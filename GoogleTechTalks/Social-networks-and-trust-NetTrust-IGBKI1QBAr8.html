background of plywood
I need to build this system it's a
system that presents as a toolbar it's
got a very thick client in a very thin
server and the basic goal and the
reasons it's called net trust is to
enhance trust on the network and when we
talk about enhancing trust it's
different from enhancing security
because security is more of a
well-defined absolute so we said what
are one of the big problems on the
network is that there's not any signals
when you look at a web page you only see
what the web page producer wants you to
see the irony is that in the information
infrastructure there are such a tiny
channel for you to evaluate if a
particular website is in fact
trustworthy or not so in ink and so
there's bad resources and good resources
and they can look the same and I have
some examples of that and in economics
the way you deal with that is you say
well we'll have signals so if you have
two students show up and they're
applying for a job how do they signal to
you that they're good students that they
really are going to work hard in Excel
well they present to you their grades so
you have the four-point-oh student and
the 2 point 0 student that's a signal
that enables you to distinguish between
the two parties all right that or
otherwise if all you could do was
interview them their willingness to show
up and want work hard would be
unobservable so a signal dependent
problem is one where the signal is
meaningful right that is to say this is
a good student worth hiring this as a
lousy student we're not worth hiring
this is a good place to live this is a
bad place to live and if you're going to
trust somebody and trust means that
you're putting yourself at risk now sigh
in computer security and the social
sciences have significant disagreements
about the nature of trust but in all
across all domains if I trust you i am
at risk if you misbehave or betray me
so trust is something that requires
signals because I can't trust everybody
I can't trust every website I can't
trust everybody to hold my wallet I have
to be able to evaluate people and
signals have to be for the web difficult
to fake at the user interaction level
they should also not require training to
evaluate now that's kind of the ideal
signal obviously all of you when you
interview someone you're going to learn
how to interview I'm sure that Google
has some training that you go through
and says this is this is what we're
looking for we have a formal interview
process and right now we do have some
web-based resources right we have
opinions we have Amazon user ratings I'm
sure you saw in the news that eBay is
updating its reputation system because a
trust system that only rates people as
good you know 99 percent of the people
on the planet probably aren't really
good and it's a beautiful day so I'll go
with 95 but I'm not going to go with 99
so we proposed a system called net trust
so the idea is we want to add context to
any kind of web experience so we looked
at the kind of context you can have so
this is I don't know if you can read
this it says welcome to ladies market
this is the Hong Kong jewel jewelry
market this is Tiffany's alright so if
you're in one of these locations and
someone says to you oh here's a box of
pearls they're from Japan you will have
a very different trust response and
think about the wealth of input that's
happening here the kind of deep context
you're getting that you don't get from a
web page this place that people are
moving more quickly the boost
presentations as compared to the marble
Fifth Avenue Tiffany's presentation
literally the smells of the places are
going to be different right this you'll
have you know fried food and human
smells and here you're going to have
that perfume counter kind of Flowery
cinnamony musky whatever it is right
and so again here is a physical offline
example so this is a bank in Berlin was
started in 1854 and they can cash checks
for you you can go in there and you can
purchase monetary instruments you could
take a paycheck in there and obtain cash
so it's that you could you could buy a
CD you can do all kinds of monetary
transactions this looks very trustworthy
doesn't it where is the check plate the
the check cashing place of racing also
does some of the same things that this
bank does you can pay your utility bills
here you could pay your taxes here you
can do money orders but they're very
diff doing the same function and their
financial functions they're very
different kind of trust environments
right so and here we have trust in
context on the internet here we have two
things that are arguably more different
than the comparisons I've just shown you
because one is the is the front of a
bank right like the the Berlin bang and
the other is actually the front of an
organized crime syndicate in Eastern
Europe right so it probably wouldn't be
that hard to distinguish between I'm an
Eastern Europe and an organized crime
meeting and I met my bank because
they're contextual so we thought about
what kind of context can you add well
obviously smell is right out so we said
we needed an economic signal that
identifies in the aggregate good
resources from bad resources so frankly
I got an a paypal fishing and I'm going
to always you know mice my privacy and
security settings are very high blah
blah blah and I always click on fishing
links because I want to see what they're
doing right I've gotten fishing links
where I felt like forwarding them to the
company and saying I don't know who did
their UI but you should hire this guy
because this is very nice website so
it's very hard you can't say it's very
hard to differentiate them and then i
get i get these wonderful emails from
ebay that say now never ever ever never
ever never don't do it do not click on a
link in any email except this one click
on this one this one's great because we
want to maintain that connection the
wheel for me the real loss of fishing if
you think about it the real value loss
and fishing is not the money that's lost
by people who lose money obviously
that's very significant it's that the
value of the email to web connection
from organizations to customers is lost
because they can't figure out if they're
in a bank or in a meeting they can't
figure out if they're in fifth avenue or
in a jewelry market on open market so
what the difference is between fishing
and malicious websites is temporal it's
very hard to communicate that on a
website okay this website's been around
for a long time now they're also often
Geographic but the phishing site that i
showed you came from Columbia
University's Economics Department it was
a subverted machine in the econ
Department so if you had just said well
you know what's the location well this
is a New York it's very respected part
of New York so what we have to do is
look at a website's history how do you
do that well right now we say we ask the
web provider to tell us if they're good
or bad okay and we can do that we
continue to do that you can do it by
ratings and we embed a lot of ratings
and you can do it by regulation I'm not
really going to talk about regulation
except for to say that it's incredibly
geographically dependent jurisdictional
and slow and these attacks depend on
speed right that's what enables them the
site goes up its up for 72 hours it gets
everybody's password and it goes down so
here's our signals um
and these all tell you that you should
trust the website in fact they say very
different things there was a study done
by the Berkman Center at Harvard and
they found that this seal in particular
to see the click to verify was
positively correlated with exploited
privacy policies and spyware okay so if
you see this web seal that says click to
verify trust me and there were and there
is an equivalent website and how they
determined equivalent was it offered the
same services and it showed up in the
same rank in a search with the same
service the one with the seal is going
to be less trustworthy on the aggregate
so this is where we are now so I I found
that picture I thought it was cute
they're not really trustworthy right
they're meaningless they're just barking
right there and if you think about that
makes sense who says to you you know
trust me is it this is that what the guy
at the Mercedes dealership says no he
says own cup of tea please I mean and
but it's the guy who used car sales
right they used car salesman who's
telling you Oh trust me it was driven by
an old lady you can trust me usually
when people say that you can't in this
case i'd like to say we're going to drop
that conditional so who do you trust
well I trust Brandon and I trust Brandon
because we've worked together for a year
all right and I know him i've seen him
perform in class Albert and I have known
each other now for about two years and
so we have social trust and I have a
high degree of certainty that neither
one of them is going to do anything
malicious to me now attackers use that
remember the first time attackers use
that very effectively was that was in
emails because you get an email from
your friend hey click on this I love you
how could you not have clicked on that
and it worked but we're not using social
trust to help people defend themselves
to help people to understand
and different differentiate websites so
the basic idea is social filtering that
you share that if he likes the website
unlike the website now of course social
filtering is not an all-new the
differences are one you can strain your
social network to you have multiple
social networks three you the
information has perfect forward secrecy
once you share it so you kick somebody
out of your social network so those are
the three factors that are different and
I'll talk about how it's different
delicious mmm is embedded in browning
but it requires making your information
public right if I want to I can't use
delicious to say to Brandon look at this
website I have to email him right here's
my comment and it's embedded my email
because if I give it to delicious
everybody has it fishguard requires
explicit action this is a bad website
and there's about a two percent error
rate blogs opinions all the Amazon
reviews they can be anonymous they
rarely really are they require multiple
searching we're going to go in a
comparison with the social searching
that we have and other mechanisms and
it's not validated will show you how our
ratings are validated and it's also very
concentrated right if you go to the
blogs you go to the top blonde right how
many people here we ed Felton's blog the
freedom to tinker right there's probably
there's got to be 20,000 other blogs how
many reach snyder's blog right they tend
to be very concentrated so I can find
out what Snyder thinks and what n things
and that's important but in my own
research group it's a little harder and
I really want to know what's happening
in my own research group so we also
embed centralized parties because if you
look at something like fishguard it
doesn't um it doesn't perform
consistently and if you have social
networks and those social networks are
highly correlated in things like age
education level and experience use if
you don't have three
parties are going to end up with self
validating isolated social networks
where up is down you know I I we're in
indiana indiana legislature once got
tremendously incensed at the idiocy of
the natural world and and you can look
this up passed a law that said pi was
three right so you wouldn't necessarily
want for example those legislators
without a third party telling them this
is really a bank you know it's really
not three so one of the things we wanted
to enable was open markets for third
parties will talk more about that and
the only verification is on updates like
you don't have to verify your identity
to the server what you do is you just a
certain identity it's actually a number
that's not linked to you and I say okay
I'm asserting this identity it is sick
you know it's 16 hex and here that's my
Denton II and here's the key that goes
with that identity so it's not as if I'm
asserting my identity as Jean but I
create an identity and I bring in my
social network so I think I've talked
enough about that net trust requires
variables that cannot be controlled by
the attacker the attacker cannot control
the things net trust depends on the
attacker can't control my social network
the attacker cannot control my browsing
history okay the attacker can control
the images they present to me and that's
and so it can do that so how do we do
this how is this yeah so I'm saying
we're doing ratings and you're like oh
okay ratings boy I've seen that before
we do too we do actually three kinds of
ratings and embed them in a single you I
we do implicit ratings if you go to a
website you like that website the
implicit ratings are history based and
the more you go to a website the morning
length the website
so i'm going to i go to google probably
every day I'm online I like the website
it gives it it has an implicit rating
that's very high alright and the thing
is because phishing sites have they told
me nuts good for them it have very short
life spans from 24 days to even the
rockfish gang we're talking maybe 72
hours maybe 96 that we have a delay so
that when you first visit a website it
doesn't go up to one because the worst
thing would be to have it so that oh
I'll send out this phishing email and
everybody will go see it and they'll
tell their friends that they've gone to
see it and it's trusted so we have a
temporal delay before it goes up that's
based on the lifetime of a phishing site
and then it delays like this so think
about somebody you work with right now
if they ask tomorrow ten dollars from
you you would give it to them certainly
right because you'll see them at lunch
tomorrow think about somebody you bump
into on the street that you worked with
ten years ago and they asked to borrow
ten dollars no you're not going to give
it to them there's this delay and decay
and that's exactly what the ratings do
if I go to this website constantly and
stopped going there it should not give
you the same rating as if I am
continuing to go there so this is the
implicit rating there's an explicit
rating which is how you get negative
ratings because in addition to there
being an absence of information there
needs to be negative information there
need to be things that say don't trust
this person this is a bad resource right
you can call the Better Business Bureau
and they'll tell you good and we can't
say anything but we all know that we
can't say anything means bad so these do
not decay so I realize that the people
you hate it in grade school you probably
don't hate them anymore but still we
don't decay explicit decisions so the
inherent results of this is we have of
the way we built it is we have concealed
identities we build it on the social
network and browsing habits we have
designed for data
integrity user server authentication and
we are not stopping bogus account abuse
we're limiting the value of bogus
account abuse so it's a very different
approach we're not saying you can never
create a bogus account because we know
who you are we're saying you can create
all the bogus accounts you want but you
can only talk to yourself so it really
doesn't matter if you do that because
you'll have difficulty moving into
people's networks so I've talked to you
a lot about the theory of net trust and
now I want to show you the I'm going to
show you the toolbar instantiation I'll
talk a little bit about the architecture
and then I'll show you the new
interaction that we have developed and
Brandon will talk about the ways the
users have asked to utilize the data all
right so this was our first tool bar you
could be things could be good or they
could be neutral later things could get
much more unhappy as you see the guy up
there he's just like this does this face
is actually throwing up so that's a much
stronger negative signal we have a
stronger negative signal here right you
can explicitly write down and now this
is the current toolbar it's not showing
up as well we have positive and negative
these are the users really liked these
that you could just click thumbs up or
thumbs down and have things go up or
down and then we've expanded our systems
of ratings is it a bank is it family
friendly see the teddy bear isn't that
family friendly is it alternative family
friendly and I abolish as one I I chose
this is a real company and what they do
is they real not-for-profit they fight
slave labor so do they use slave labor
no this is it you there really is lots
of so we use a user social network as
well as user selected centralized
authorities the only one that's in there
is the FDIC and that is because in some
cases values can be can
tested but you know in the u.s. you're
either an fdic-insured Bank ring or not
and then you can add ratings in the
little pop-up window bad site buyer
beware can you tell somebody from our
group got ripped off on eBay this was
before they changed their reputation
system so the core point there are a few
core points of these one it's the social
network not the centralized network and
it's your own history you have
everything in your own history well you
don't get taken in by fishing but every
almost everyone has in their own history
enough information to identify a
malicious site you have in your own
history enough information to identify a
masquerading site so I mean you you knew
I was Jean because I was introduced by
Albert Albert knew I was Jean because
we've met several times we recognized
each other if somebody had just shown up
and pretended to me me it would be easy
for him to distinguish them but
difficult for you to distinguish them
right so it's a compliment but it's not
a substitute for search it's about
evaluating what you found and here's the
architectural overview we have the
toolbar and the rating engine that
embeds in the social network if it's
green that means it's really reliable
and we're very happy with it if it's
yellow it means it exists and we're not
really happy with it so we have
third-party storage we haven't got we
haven't got a published API for open
third-party storage wasn't that scary we
have peer email invitations the thing we
don't like about the email invitations
is that they give the server social
network information so we don't like
that the back end file system works very
well and as you can see from the toolbar
we're actually on the third generation
UI and we've been through some testing
with that so this is the same thing done
and raining the ratings engine is done
we're doing a large-scale network test
about you
our homophily with the dorms right now
we just started it we've got two weeks
of data the question is if you have a
social network how big does it have to
be for you to have a reasonable
expectation of them having visited a
site before you visited the site so what
we're doing is we're stripping off
identities other than machine
identifiers zand looking at web browsing
histories that way we have the toolbar
you I we have the social network you
still have to do somebody manual bunny
ID entry because there and I'm sure you
know this better than I there are so
many different kinds of browsers and
mailers that we don't have something
that works universally you have to cut
and paste from the email you get from
your friend we have synchronization the
nice thing about synchronization is it
means you don't go and download all your
social networks ratings at one time you
log in you download one person's you
wait a little bit you download another
person's and leaves one hot proxies so
what's nice about this as opposed to
some other systems are we're good with
civil attack resistance because when you
open a web page we open a window and we
look for activity if you are a sight
that constantly updates your ratings not
going to go up so we have we're pretty
good with scripting attacks we do a
server authentication on right we do
right authentication for pure records we
have a hash net trust ID to email
address commitment then i'll show you in
data structures that says you that
authentic they can be used for an
authentication i can say here's a random
number and my email and that generates
my net trust ID but because we put the
random number in there if you come up
and say oh this is jeans browsing
history i can say no it's not you just
did an attack on the random number so we
have linked and that gives us linking
resistance and social network
confidentiality so we're doing mandatory
hist these are just things in we're
working on synchronization
works but we don't have good time delays
for persona change and right now we do
one hop anonymization we don't really
use tour we haven't fully integrated the
ratings part with tour the third party
rating assurance we don't have our
signed rating list up at this time and
we want to do a better job of an
invitation automate automation and
validation but there are so many
platforms out there we've only got it
really working for one and that's
Mozilla so I've been making these claims
about what the system can do hear that
here's where some of the claims come
from we hash a random number and the
email to get the ID and that makes and
so think of it as proof of work with
invitation spamming are you familiar
with proof of work you know north okay
so the idea is that you just make it
more work that I can't come out with one
email and send all of you an email with
a virus that says I love you please
forward this right or I love you and
then you open it and you accidentally
forward it to everybody in your box what
it does is it says for if I want to
claim to be gene camp right I've got to
hash that with an email so you can use
common names like sue but because we
make the social network sites finite and
because information sharing is two-way
right it's tit for tat you're not going
to accept every person intranet trust
email and if you do except try to accept
51 people one person needs to get thrown
out all right so I can't come up with an
email that says gene camp and email
everybody in the world one has to say
gene can't one has to say Elmer one has
to say Shawn so it makes it harder to
attack the problem is that if you can do
content analysis it absolutely leaks
identity and you can do traffic analysis
still we started this design with the
idea that you would have a signature
linked to your browsing history and
that's how we do server authentication
because it was easiest
and we decided in this case the
non-repudiation feature of digital
signatures is a bug because we want
people to be able to have deniability
imagine if you had actually looked at
that Hannah Montana web page and your
friends found out you definitely don't
want to share some information and if
the system enables and makes the sharing
of information easier it should not also
make that sharing non-repudiation
deniability so we're we're pretty well
implemented you can go look at the code
base to check out the implementation
status we have on the uncorrelated IDs
deniable histories no credentials
required for ratings know that down
there's no credentials required for
ratings download at the one that's in
beta now this is what we're working on
and this is why we ended up with a
server that was an email server for our
website is that when Alison's to her
friend is the random number and or
emailing a server and annonce and then
the friend says oh is this I'm going to
get alice's net trust identifier confirm
that it's random and email the random
number concatenated with the email and
hashed and the friend will send the same
thing to alice and now Alice in the
French share a key now because Alice and
the friends share a key they can use
this key to protect the privacy of their
history information and then if you look
at the data structure you guys know you
must know about the content scrambling
system CSS right where they have a title
key and then every authorized player can
untitled key remember CSS the program I
went to jail in the US the Russian
programmer because he was exercising
freedom of speech electronically
unwisely the jury throughout the case I
know you guys remember
okay so that it's this the same
architecture but we're not advocating
making a federal case of it so here's
all the all the data with a one-time key
and in the one time and then there's a
buffer so if I only have one friend if
it turns out that Brandon is my only
friend in the world even if you figured
out this was my record you couldn't
figure out how large my social network
was and then for each friend the key is
encrypted in our shared key which means
if I get really mad I get perfect
forward secrecy because I throw his key
out the next time he goes to look for my
key that that the one-time key encrypted
in our shared key it's not there he can
still have access to this stuff he has
in his client but he can't update the
material on the server and because i
right authenticate he can't take last
week's data either so he gives him
forward secrecy one of the things we're
doing is we're expanding the reigning
set for client-side forming detection
I'm very excited about this because this
farming detection is impossible usually
for an end user to detect if somebody
subverts your binding you're in terrible
shape so what we can do is include
hashes of server IP address and
certificates in the history and then
that means you can detect if you're
being redirected to a website that looks
identical and there's a warning that
comes on and we're working on these rich
text communication warnings because can
you imagine you know you're you know
you're a brain surgeon right somebody is
really smart because I don't like the
idea of that users are stupid so your
brain surgery surgeon you're going to go
actually operate on someone's brain your
your check you want to go check your
gmail and a little box comes up and says
you're at risk for being farmed please
take appropriate action and you'd say
okay that was strange you yeah exactly
what's formed don't these people know
how to spell
um what is agricultural products have to
do with email and why why are they
telling me to do something appropriate
I'm a brain surgeon I'm going to operate
on some of these brain so one of the
things we're doing is we're making these
on movies and that's what they are
they're little 30-second movies that
come up and say they kind of tell a
story and they say oh this is what's
happening right you need to and then you
know the contact your IT person if you
don't have an IT person you know contact
you know semantics ok they'll help you
this is how you can get here's this you
know go to this set of instructions so
that's a big part of narrative risk
communications and we're working on that
very heavily and we have alternative
interaction modes so you everybody saw
my little window that popped up and you
can click yes or no we've all interacted
with those ratings windows and rated
something good or bad well i did a user
test with some elder people because i
thought i really want the naive
populations that are getting fish to be
able to use this and so they said ah or
something not unlike that they said
what's a buddy what's a rating why is
this thing on my internet and then they
said I never tell anybody any
information on the internet and then
farther down on the survey they said we
shop two or three times a week on the
internet and the cognitive dissonance
was about to make my head explode and in
the same time trying to give them this
ratings information you know it wasn't
working great let's just put it that way
when you pop up a box like that for
somebody who's 67 their responses Oh a
box make it go away so this is what we
have yay we we call it the surfing with
ambient trust see the happy orb so it
takes all the stuff from the net trust
toolbar
it puts it in the happy arm and so if
it's a bank and the FDIC says it's a
bank though orb is happy and if
siteadvisor says it's a bad site thus
the orb is bad and what you do is when
you start browsing you put in your
friends emails right and that's your
social network okay so compare that
again to this rating and the way you
change your rating is you hit it thus
get it now surfing with ambient trust so
um you wrap it and and if you when you
happen it changes color basically it
goes from bright you know the intensity
stays the same but the hugo's from a
very intense green to a pure yellow to
pure red and as you've weapon it cycles
through so we are doing yes adopting
this user interface also answered the
next question which is what about trust
pack this is a great solution plus a
path problem
there's another way for a website to see
remember
yeah that would be great yeah because
it's a completely client right so I'm so
excited about this that I had to promise
not to jump up and down during the
presentation I'm not like you to observe
that I'm not jumping up in and we're
doing folks focus groups and it seems
although the focus groups have been
limited we haven't done any any any
analysis the limited user exposure we
have done mostly resistant is great can
I hit it so the other nice thing is
people don't like to downright other
people I mean if somebody calls you up
and says can you give a reference for
this person usually say either they're
good or on so sorry I'm not a reference
for this person right or oh what an
interesting person we as human beings we
don't like to be negative right we like
to embrace our joy and on the other hand
if all you have to do is be negative is
swamped the thing while it's frustrating
you then you'll get a higher quality
feedback so we're very pleased with our
worbla and then we did before we did the
or we did these other usability tests
and brandon was the one who ran this
test and he came up with some of the
other innovations I'm going to ask him
to speak about them afternoon first I
want to say I'm very proud of her for
not pulling wallace and gromit on us
hands everywhere so that was great but
my part of this test of this project is
actually used usability so I'm the user
experience engineer for gene and
basically what we did is last fall we
took a survey of a study class so I 130
where we took 38 students in the class
along with myself to participate in the
test so basically what occurred is over
the eight-week period of time we
gathered information from all of these
students that were instructed to install
the net trust bar and then add me as a
friend this would allow us to notice
where they were traveling what
information they were providing for me
and comments and to see how the
invitation system worked for them which
was great because then we had all three
of the basics covered the invitation
system the commenting the rating and
then also the monitoring
you're of your peer group so after we
had performed the test we received a
post questionnaire that I handed out we
were expecting about twenty-five percent
capture rate because of the clients that
we were using for stuff they didn't have
a great Buy in they were students they
weren't in the project so we weren't
expecting a hundred percent capture
right but we got a great turnout we had
11 out of the 38 students perform which
was more than the 25-percent they were
estimating which was which made me very
happy because it gave me some great
great evidence of what we did with the
usability test so out of those 11 some
people some of her comments weren't very
good but some of them were very
insightful those insightful comments
helped us to develop the current build
of the toolbar so things that we had
received from the users were some great
comments basically users as a whole
enjoyed using the toolbar they enjoyed
leaving comments and reading comments
they also enjoyed using the results or
the feedbacks mechanisms that were
instantiated with the toolbar and then
also they liked to read what other
ratings were from other people and next
we also committed another user survey
result evidence that showed that users
wanted more control over their personal
comments which is something that we
noticed that Facebook and MySpace had
notice also they had to pull out some of
their tracking systems because we wanted
to make sure that users were in control
of their comments and not that the
website was forcing them to make them so
some requests that we got some comments
that we received from the users that we
thought were very crucial to our
building further implementations of the
toolbar or that browsing by users would
be a very nice thing for them to see so
basically I have say 10 people in my in
my current peer group out of those 10
people I would like to search Just Jeans
comments so that I could click on genes
comments and sort through jeans comments
individually or by all the at plays so I
don't know if gene gene didn't go over
this but you can have separate groups at
work and at play or any other field that
you want to build say I just want to see
the people that I work with and
that persona I click on that persona I
can see all the comments that were
provided by those people in that user
group and then I can also click on
anybody in that user group and search
those comments that's something that all
the users really wanted to do and the
next they also wanted to annotate their
searches which is something that we were
really intrigued by and we wanted to
build that into the further builds of
the toolbar so major suggestions or
minor complaints that we got from the
users they wanted to improve the
invitation system because at this point
it is a little difficult to comprehend
for basic users so basically I have to
produce an invitation email it to you
you have to receive it you have to add
it then you have to produce one for me
and do the same thing now the reason
that we didn't get a lot of extra people
from their peer groups so the students
were also invited to increase their peer
group size by inviting their personal
friends a lot of students didn't do that
for for reasons of the invitation system
was difficult for them to use so if we
can fix that a lot of them said that
they would be more than happy to invite
more people of their peer group and
increase their peer group and in turn
increase the amount of comments and
ratings that they can receive and that
they offer they also want us to test
different prototype prototypes in the
future of the usability of the toolbar
that way they can give us different
comments the persona management was a
little difficult for people to
understand a lot of the users forgot
that they could switch the persona so
they would log in they would open up
their Firefox browser and they would be
at their at play and then they would
just start searching through there you
know ESPN or google or gmail what are
they would their normal routine was
unfortunately the way that net trust
works is it logs those ratings and those
comments to that at play and you can't
change it so say that they wanted to
share them to the at work well if you go
back to Google those ratings already
tied you're at play and you can't switch
them over to your at work which is
something also that they would want to
change they would want to be able to go
back through their browsing history and
then switch the ratings or the comments
for the information that they provided
for like the app player the at work
group that way they could share their
comments with more people or change the
comments if their opinion has changed in
in the future and now if you'll just go
ahead and count through this this is
basically current value mediated
searching we're trying to find labor
free chocolates so we're now on the
third click trying to figure out where I
can order some chocolates this is number
four number five so in order to get
slavery slave labor free chocolates from
any site online it takes about seven
clicks and that's if you know that I
abolish exists now that I abolish exists
not everybody knows that so that may
have taken them more clicks and more
searches so they've wasted 20 minutes of
their time to try to figure out where I
can order chocolates from for say Jean
who doesn't support slave labor so this
is current value mediated searching so
as you know there's not there's no extra
comments for you now if we go to the
socially mediated searching and we
actually filter all of our searches
through the browser toolbar then we can
see that Jean really liked the brand
chocolate so I know that if I need to
order chocolates for Jean I can just go
ahead and click on that to brand
chocolate because I already socially
mediated the search so I know that Jean
likes those chocolates so it makes it
very easy for me to order those
chocolates for Jean as opposed to trying
to find chocolates for Jean and then
next we have third-party comments now
these third-party comments are something
that we are currently testing the gene
showed you in the upper right hand
corner of the toolbar and as you see
there now posted next to the actual
search itself now these right here as
you can see the I abolish link and it's
family-friendly these to show me that
this is probably a good place that I
could order chocolates for gene because
I know that she supports family-friendly
and supports the I abolish website so
now genes going to go ahead and continue
with a few more points beyond this
I a mediated search is because even the
most obvious values can be hotly
contested right we picked I abolish as
the one to focus on because very few
people will come out in favor of slave
labor right it's easy but there are much
more complicated things like what's the
definition of a family what does it mean
to be family friendly but I most people
think it means being friendly to all
families and focusing on what makes a
family the child other people believe
that family friendly is a much more
narrow thing so you may have quite
contesting definitions in many of these
cases some people would say you know
made in USA that's exactly where I want
to go other people embrace globalization
and there are also situations where you
may not want to share your values okay
some values I mean it look organic that
should be easy right what's organic well
it turns out to be an incredibly hotly
contested value and for example glean
hosting now there are people who think
green hosting is like friendly nuclear
bombing you know the oh the technology
is the problem you've got to stop all
this now now obviously i'm here i'm not
advocating that but i am saying that
there are these huge hugely contested
the organic factory drapes definition is
different than the eco child definition
of organic and that incident and these
this is a group that advocates local
organic food so that even if it's
organic you shouldn't eat it if it was
grown far away from you and you can
definitely do that in California there
are inherently opposing views so you see
these on the street I you can see this
is the the big truth fish eating the
little Darwin fish and this is a doorman
fish these people there they're
contesting they're inherently can
testing and you've got to let people
choose their own inherently contesting
rights and then for every group of
people that is passionate and serious
about it topic there's another group of
people that think its sheer of whimsy
right do you guys know about flying
spaghetti monster ism okay it's a it's a
recent innovation in in religion there
we go so what does that mean when is all
that all the things I said are obviously
true but there are big cosmic social
things right how do you take that
observation and make it into
architecture and the way you do it is
you say it's got to be client center
it's got to be invisible you can't i'm
going to argue with you right now all
right so i type this in and i said i'm
going to say this at Google and now I'm
going to say it it's got to be it can't
be a centralized search agency function
you can't say okay here's the Darwin
here's the flying spaghetti monster and
here's the hardcore christian because
some people don't want to share that
with you if you're not out how can you
shop gay friendly if you're not out and
you're in an environment you don't want
to go and support exactly the people
that make it impossible for you to be
out but you also don't want to go on the
web ins and go to a centralized agent
and say oh by the way so we want to it's
important to enable dissenting values
and and silly values just you know pure
silly values because that's what people
people want and even profoundly
offensive values and you've and if you
are centered when you're offering those
values people will come to you and say
that set of values that you are offering
is offensive and you've got to stop it
or a government may come to you and say
that set of values which you are
offering is prohibited and you have to
stop it right so one of the things we
like about it is we offer a third-party
deniability that you can do this is a
hidden service right that once you find
it you can always
go and refined it and you don't have to
and you don't have somebody who's
filtering out values right i mean you
can be um you know something like if you
want to say pick any religion except for
maybe flying spaghetti monster ism and
there are passionate contest about what
it means to be a good and faithful
member of that religion you've by making
it client-side you can step out of that
entirely and the search and the values
are pulled down from one third party
they're integrated by another party so
the thing we really want to conclude
here is that there's there's no there is
no train off between security and
usability to the extent that you think
about the design is being user-centered
the trade off from usability and
security comes from two things one
defining security of surveillance and
two defining the security designer as
omniscient I know what values you want I
know what risk you want to take I know
what's a good website and wants a bad
website and you should listen to me
about it users like having history and
sharing information that history and
sharing information can enhance security
and at the same time benefit usability
so we want to the whole the whole vision
of this of this this thick client that's
now you know it's a fully working system
is that we want to expand the concept of
security to include elements of social
trust to acknowledge that the internet
is part of our daily lives and those
definitions of security need to be part
of our daily lives and click here to see
details of the certificate is not
adequate I think maybe three times in my
life I've looked in a certificate may
you know just to see Oh what is you know
is this a hotel did this group of crypto
anarchist of whom deeply fun change
providers or are they under attack you
know maybe three times
it I had to bring a huge amount of
context to be able to make that judgment
but if you see a little happy glowing
orb or a little sad glowing orb next to
you you don't have to make that context
so our goal is to inform user behavior
when they're making decisions that that
they're uncertain about and non will
need to do that but to do it in a way
that's appropriate for the user to give
them a toolbar if they want a toolbar to
give them a little orb with less detail
if they want to orb now the Orb the
toolbar still there with the orb you can
go you know two layers into the toolbar
we don't prevent you but we acknowledge
you probably don't want to and i'd like
to acknowledge some people in addition
to Brandon allegan kina graduated Alex
Oh Camilla VA co Alan Freedman did the
early modeling shree Ross pretty and
Farzana worked on the the code and zach
is uh building more orbs as we speak so
thank you for your time I appreciated
any questions
paper
that question I'm sorry yes trust no way
okay there's two ways the question was
the trust we're placing on the web pages
compare mobile page rank and the two
answers to that question our page range
is what everybody thinks a web page to a
party last night but I think are lost
because you're so close and so that's
the that's what the world thinks of
page rank now we know that page rank you
keep pagerank secret because it can be
in some cases manipulated and then there
are Google attackers and it and it has
very different and one of the ways
people manipulated is through a lot of
civil attacks right masquerade attacks
it's going to be much harder to
manipulate the social network because
you have to be part of it and if and so
it's Universal vs social network right
so it's aggregate versus individual and
it doesn't deal with the particular
trade-offs of subgroups so if what I
wanted to know was where to buy shoes
the aggregate answer in America is
walmart walmart sells one in every eight
pairs of shoes so I haven't looked but I
suspect if you looked for you know at
walmart under a shoes search it would
have a huge hype a rank i am guessing
that almost nobody in this room bought
their shoes from walmart because we had
very different sets of values determined
by our individual social networks so
PageRank is the big aggregate number
this is the social number it's more
socially appropriate and it's harder to
attack via Sibyl mechanisms and because
PageRank is centralized and this is
client-centric this has the potential to
address issues of farming and fishing
that was kind of a long answer
using the Tiffany's more puzzles
yes oh yeah wait I agree for many more
people gather and they pay a lot less to
but if you were at the jewelry market
and somebody said to you you don't have
to pay me anything now we'll just open
an account for you could you please fill
out all your personal details in your
social security number you can say no I
think I'll just give you my cash right
it you the point is not that one is good
and what is bad the point is that
they're different trust environments and
so when you get the Tiffany you know
they hold it up you know and you say yep
that's the one I want I'll take it you
don't take it you know you may not take
it you're not examining it you're
certainly not going to rub it on your
teeth right it's that your behavior is
different and that you know how to
mitigate your risk in both environments
there are obviously risk in both
environments one that you accidentally
go into bankruptcy and the other that
you know you you get subpar merchandise
and the pricing reflects that which is
why you know the jewelry market is for
many people on far better place to shop
we have and this is all going to
validate your choice to go into industry
after a semester and a half just gotten
human subjects permission to begin to do
this dorm and search so we don't know
that at this time we have run a lot of
models and simulations and our assertion
based on aggregate data is that you have
to have a social network size of more
than 20 but because we haven't been able
to get individual data we don't know
sometimes by one
there was another
so you're saying that a market functions
at depending upon two things depending
on its size and I'm saying a market can
function very easily in a small size if
there's more trust in that small size
market right so if you have a high trust
environment you can have more you can
have effective transactions so what
we're doing is leveraging this kind of
off network trust this social trust into
network trust so it combines both the
wisdom of crowds which is what you're
referring to that says the crowd should
be big and concepts of social trust oh
sorry well thank you thank you for
coming and thank you for asking
