who will be talking to you here about
search he is a user experience
researcher for search and also I would
say one of the best advocate for search
that we have he constantly is is
figuring out ways to understand how
people search and how to help them be
better searchers of information so and
he does a marvelous job doing outreach
in education and in across a wide range
of groups and I've had the pleasure of
working with Dan so with that I will
turn it over to Dan oh wait wait wait
most important I said how would you like
to be described and they said The Wizard
of all space and time so while our oil
our catering might have been a little
bumpy today we have the Wizard of Oz B's
in time so you know we have priority all
right great Thank You Tina I do a lot of
teaching I do a lot of teaching I taught
a class this morning already so this
will be my second class of the day I
teach a lot of k-12 I teach a lot of
teachers I teach a lot of university
faculty members I've even taught across
the river over there at NASA Ames so yes
I teach rocket scientists and and
there's a consequence of that I do know
a lot about how people learn how to
search and you cannot deny me my first
thesis which is that search really is a
skill now you may think you're a good
searcher but it's one of these things
where people vary a lot in quality right
you might be good your buddy might be
good you know your mom might not be so
good but it's in our world in particular
in your world where you have to
communicate these complex ideas to
people search is a fundamental and
critical skill for you and for your
readers it's not enough just for you to
be good at it but they need to be good
as it as well so in particular I want to
set this the context right here this is
a great quote we have reason to fear
that the multitude of books which grows
every day in a prodigious fashion will
make the following centuries fall into a
state as barbarous as that of the
centuries that followed the fall of the
Roman Empire we must try to prevent this
danger by separating those books which
we must throw out or leave in Oblivion
from those which one should save and
within the latter separate between what
is useful what is not and he guesses
this the date 19th at 1650 good we'll
take that um the problem internation
overload has always been with us it has
always been with us
University faculty in the in the
thousands were complaining about how
many books they had to read and how
ridiculous it was that you would have to
read a new book every year so let me set
this context because we normally think
about search and research as something
that goes on in a place like this right
we all grew up in this environment where
search was walking around through the
stacks and trying to find the
appropriate book to extract the
appropriate nugget or maybe to take out
a little figure or a table um you
probably also remember this right the
readers guide to periodical literature
it was hell to use that oh yeah we
thought it was great we thought it was
great when our library would update it
and we would go and look at the latest
one there on that long desk okay but
cross-referencing is just nightmarish so
we're we conceptualize amines to search
what it means to do research and that's
what I'm trying to talk to you about
today because the big takeaways for me
from all my studies and I go out and I
study people in their homes in their
workplaces in their school settings I
talked to them and I asked what's going
on and I discovered that there's a huge
need for a search skill everybody can
type a couple of words into Google but
can you make sense out of it when it
comes back to you it's not all intuitive
and for the most part users by and large
have little idea what's available what's
possible and how to use it effectively
that's why when they type global warming
they get those wacky answers all right
so here's a another way to think about
our side of the equation we have a huge
amount of stuff
Google produces a million different
kinds of products across a wide variety
of different kinds of content our job is
to index that and then make it available
through search tools that you can use
and we've got a lot of different kinds
of stuff web pages you know about what
about you know about new streams and
news archives newspapers dating back to
the early 1919 century videos code blogs
etc etc we've got a lot of different
kinds of things and so now you have to
learn how to navigate through the
streams of information pouring out of
each of those channels all this stuff is
searchable right so you can go to google
and do a query like population of Japan
and immediately in a quarter second get
the answer you know hundred twenty-seven
million you can do it quite query like
how tall is the Empire State Building
and get the answer 1,250 feet 20,000
leagues and miles did anybody know that
actually no nobody knows that everybody
thinks is the depth of the submarine
second question was the diameter of the
earth that's not the depth of the
submarine right you can ask questions
like what's the speed of an unladen
swallow and Google will tell you it's
ten or roughly ten meters per second is
fantastic right okay now you end up with
something like this anybody recognize
this by hand okay one person okay I I
use this in my classes as a way of
discovered discussion and credibility is
this a real thing or not and so I
thought a series of five classes down in
Los Angeles very recently out of 250
teachers as many students 0 of them
thought this was real 0 out of 250 and
these are the people teaching our kids
ok they thought this was photoshopped of
course it isn't it really is a real fish
you can go look at AAB Whateley you
could go look it up none of 250 people
thought to look it up ok they all just
assumed it looked kind of wacky it looks
like a cartoon character right even
scarier out of 250 people who took my
class and credibility how many people
googled me zero
you see the problem right you see the
problem
so um an interesting problem thing at
ernest hemingway said every man should
have a built-in crap detector but you
need to learn how did he take that stuff
where do you learn those skills you
didn't learn them in sixth grade in
particular now that we're flooding the
world worth more volume more kinds more
stuff there's more opportunity for crap
all new horizons of crap all new
horizons were learning how to detect
that so here's a great image and we
recognize this the Northeast power
blackout this got a lot of play in 2003
anything wrong with it
no clouds that's a remarkable night in
the United States and yet this was run
as prima facie evidence that you know
there was a huge you know problem in the
upper north northeast what does it mean
to be illiterate in an age when people
present this kind of information as
evidence
this is the problem you have in spades
okay this is not evidence this is crap
how would you know how do you learn to
detect the difference so look we're in a
world where this kind of model is
actually not far from being true every
book every video every online journal
24/7 you can look it up in the privacy
of your own home what do we do about
this well how many of you have seen
Google Goggles you know what that is
couple people it runs on my phone okay
and in fact what's cool about it is it's
a new way of doing search and because
this is a new media environment I made a
video for you so this was me last year
and in Google and Stanford campus and I
used my phone and I took a picture of
the tallest structure there on campus
and in the act of taking the picture it
implicitly runs an image query against
the image data
okay so what it's doing right now is
it's analyzing that picture sending it
off to a server in the sky and the
answer comes back and sure enough there
it is it's the Hoover Tower and that's
the website for Hoover tower changing
the equation of what it means to do
query all right that's just as much a
query as typing in three words into
Google search box of course now you can
also talk to the Google search box and
you can say geez can you please tell me
how to get you you know two to nine
paloma Drive Los Altos Hills and it will
tell you so the search equation the
search universe is really changing
dramatically and that's sort of the
front end technology of it the back hand
is constantly changing to the stuff on
the web it's like pouring a Library of
Congress onto the web every day or maybe
it's every four hours now I'm not sure
what the current constant Library of
Congress coefficient is right but here's
an example anybody hear this song you go
to the Stanford basketball game right we
hear this song and now you all start
chanting oh my son loves the Stanford
basketball and so he goes to the games
and he said what afternoon dad I really
want that on my ipod I'm thinking about
it uh Shazam's not gonna work because
it's kind of an acoustically bad
environment and what Alaric's
so doing a normal Google search is
probably not son give up just give up
and of course he's being a good fortune
year-old ignores me and types in ooh ooh
ooh and the remarkable thing about it
was that someone else had asked that
question before and got an answer from a
QA site question answering site right so
my knowledge about the web was out of
date now I have a new strategy right
but my son now has it on his iPod from
that little bit of a clue okay he didn't
know that it was a crazy query I did I
was functionally fixated I had a
Oshin that this was a hammer and the
hammer worked like this thank you very
much
right but he didn't so he tried
something else and sure enough it works
and now it's a strategy their number of
QA sites question answering sites people
ask questions get answers has grown
enormously part of the problem I have in
my classes I bet in your classes too is
I'll put out tests like this morning it
happened actually I have a question I
want my students to answer and talk on
it
someone has answered it on a QA site
with exactly my phrase so somebody
actually copied out of my class and now
I have to play sort of against the
universe but you see what's happening
the content of the web changes to an
important and interesting way so there
are all these effects about priming
about cueing about fixedness effects
that fight against us in our struggle to
try to be good searchers and our
struggle to understand how to do a good
query let me show you another beautiful
example of that exactly that problem
this is an eye tracking study that we
did and we asked this guy to try to find
something to do on Saturday night and
this is what he says okay I've seen
activities it's the results so here's
where I've cut the video because the
next question is adult activities San
Francisco Saturday night
that isn't known as a not-safe-for-work
query right um no it's funny when we
watch this but why is it funny
it's funny because we know something he
doesn't know he doesn't know they're
dragons in certain parts of the internet
and this is one of them right he's just
typing away he doesn't think about it
okay
so you actually already know a lot
suppose you're in the seventh grade you
might type that query let me show you
another example here suppose you don't
know that Google actually has a huge
collection of three-dimensional models
now in our case that they live in a
thing called the 3d warehouse and this
is me searching for Notre Dom I search
for Notre Dom I find a whole collection
of 3d models but all built in Sketchup
and I click on it download it and now I
have no true Dom on my desktop you see
what's happening you can now search for
not just web pages you can search for
cathedrals you can download a Cathedral
you can look at it in Google Earth and
you can fly around you want to see it of
flying buttresses go look at one right
actually understand the
three-dimensional shape of that thing
and how it fits into the structure of as
a whole do you know for example that we
have public pada public data online I
don't know how many people have seen a
chart like this before
this is unemployment charts for
unemployment rate for California we have
the whole country this is Santa Clara
County where we're at right now but as
you know putting data in context is
everything so this looks horrific right
this is the kind of thing it gets
politicians booted out of power but
let's look at another place in
California let's look at Imperial County
all the sudden context becomes real the
framing problem here is if you don't
know we have this you won't think to ask
for it if you don't know it's possible
to do side-by-side comparisons like this
you won't think to do that kind of
analysis now we've got a lot more
content 48 hours of video content is
being uploaded to YouTube every minute
ok now let's do you think it's a Mikey
getting his thumb bed and loll cats and
stuff like that umm this is in fact a
video of a living donor kidney
transplant there's a ton of really
useful stuff how do you actually do that
lab procedure go watch the video how
does a particular surgical thing happen
go watch the video you want to learn
about copyright law take a class at MIT
right so yeah
there's a lot of mikey getting his thumb
bit but there's also a huge amount of
very interesting very deep content out
there as well you have to learn how to
win oh that's the challenge now we're
not done yet
all right we can't just declare a
victory and go home some queries are
still very very hard what's the
population in Japan in 1490 good luck
that's going to take you a while right
how much is the empire building state
building actually way or why do you
swallows appear so often and the works
of Monty Python right you see we've got
a lot of stuff available but there's
still some deep analysis that has to
happen because some search questions are
still crazy hard if you drive down
Highway 5 in middle of California its
Euclidean flat the Central Valley is a
greater agricultural region and in the
middle of it there's one mountain it's
that as you're driving down highway 5
and I literally took this picture out of
my window like that what is it how would
you know Google Goggles won't tell that
to you yet but more importantly how
would you find out or how would you
figure out something like this
does anybody read em Herick anybody read
Maya okay so there's a bunch of stuff
still left to do we can now see are a
lot of this stuff but we can't do the
Mayan yet we don't have a unicode
character set for that great question
you're doing climate studies what is
that how would you find out or more
importantly my son walks in with this on
his arm should I take him to the ER
or not okay you see what I'm getting at
Search Search is an interesting problem
because a big part of it from my
perspective as a user experience
researcher is that stuff changes all the
time remember that stuff changes all the
time here's a great example of this I
was playing this past summer in a irish
session which is a bunch of these
musicians over here on the right and
they were doing this they were playing a
tune and i was great was playing my
pennywhistle having a good time and then
they started playing a tune i did not
know i was kind of screwed at that point
so I whipped out my phone hit record
and is it literally me standing up then
later back at home
on my iPhone
I ran this app called Jim cow and hit
reco this is Shazam for live music
provide by recession event tonight
shalini analysis just like guru boggles
was
sending it off to the server in the sky
I fade down the recording that I made
and the answer comes back there we go
that's the MIDI file same key so my
point is that the world of that we care
about from our data rich data journalism
scientific reportage perspective is that
it's shifting from just search in our
case to search + analysis right so just
as an exercise just for fun I compared
rain in Seattle versus rain in Palo Alto
and so I just went out and this is
literally like 15 minutes of my time I
can't find a bunch of datasets
downloaded them to Google Spreadsheets
and ran a quick analysis and sure enough
it when it rains in Seattle it starts
raining and it rains for eight hours
well in Palo Alto it comes it goes it
comes and goes comes and goes alright
you get the the redline is very bursty
Seattle it sets in and stays that's a
very simple that was basically for in
this case one day I averaged over a
period of time but here's a more
interesting example somebody here at
Google said gee can you tell me the top
fortune 200 companies that are older
than 100 years old how would you do that
would you go and look up every single
company's web page and look up their
data founding or would you write a
script which is what I did here I used
Google spreadsheet and I wrote a Google
lookup cell number date of founding and
sure enough I can produce a chart like
that in about 10 minutes
see what's happening it used to be you
did a search you got a result maybe 10
million results but you got a result ok
now we're starting to build system where
you can start to do deeper analysis
that's integrated with search you
already probably know about Google
Alerts you know about that standing
query that you can create here I made
one for climate change it runs every day
it shows me the best results and it's
it's inserts it into my alert system now
here's the issue there's a ton of
content I'll go
I told you that we've got everything
from 3d models to data sets what does it
mean to be skilled at search if you're
looking at maps do you know for example
that you can look at stores within that
particular geo region by type did you
know you could do different kinds of
routes even over uncharted territory did
you know you can actually look at the
topography using Google content so
you've got content now you start doing
some analysis how do you do that
recently we bought ITA you probably
heard about that in the process we also
acquired a company called needle base
which is a fantastic product that
basically we'll walk over semi structure
to lightly structured content bases like
websites and extract from that
structured content which you can then
query ok so it's a pre-processing you
use Google search to find a site or
Isetta sites use needle based basically
wander over that and convert ill
structured content into structured
content so I mean they can now do a
regular database kind of query over that
you can also rationalize things that
have multiple names and recognize them
all it's the same sort of thing this is
some interesting AI that's happening in
here it's actually going through and
recognizing that there are different
ways of spelling that same street in
Boston and yet it's all actually the
same place now the reason I brought this
up here is that Glenn Anderson from
Needle place actually did this really
interesting analysis of popular
technology net which I assume you know
about it it's a kind of a skeptic site
and so they collected 900 peer reviewed
papers that they believe support the
skeptical view of global warming so
Glenn wrote a crawler to go over that
and basically extract all the authors
the dates the journal titles etc etc and
discovered you're using very simple
analysis the level of connectivity
between the authors and their funding
sources would you like to guess where
most of the funding is coming from he
did that in about an hour hour and a
half see what it's done we've advanced
search from just a search when you
actually then have to do all the manual
manipulation to something where you can
get deeper into the content you can
understand the mind of the skeptics here
or at least understand the stuff they're
publishing we also have a product called
Google Fusion Tables which as you take
multiple tables of structured data and
combined them and then do visualizations
on it like that or like the as The
Guardian did in the UK to structure and
visualize all of the Wikileak data this
case they had a programmer actually do
the extraction but it'd be very much the
same as if you use needle base extract
clean refine visualize the interesting
shift that's happening here is Serge is
changing from simple search that's
simple search plus analysis now if
you're trying to understand and analyze
what people are thinking there's a great
way to do it so if you look in the lower
left corner on your Google search
results page how many anybody seen this
before actually you know what I'm
talking about the lower left corner
right down there you see there it's um
other versions of queries that are
related to this topic
so my query here is global warming up
the top and yet for something different
these are related related searches that
come along by other people doing the
same kind of thing you are seeing hive
mind at work you're seeing what other
people are trying to do so you can see
climate change ozone depletion
deforestation so on or if you want to
expand that and you can actually click
on related searches in the lower left
corner there in the left-hand panel and
you'll get a whole much larger set so it
becomes very simple for you as a writer
to see what other people are worried
about you can also use our tool called
Google insights has ever used insights
which and a couple people okay what it
allows you to do is to look at searches
or mentions in the news of web news and
so on and here I did a search for
climate change using web search queries
worldwide 2004 to present and here's the
chart okay now again to put that in
context I contrast that now with the
search for global warming and you can
see which topic dominates so if you want
to write an article this will tell you
what you might want to consider being
your title okay you can further break
this down by
you can break it down by a news category
or by content category you can restrict
the time zone to be just the past three
years as opposed to the past you know
six so what we've done that we've got
all these different techniques enable
enabling you to become better informed
about what's going on but base to all
that is being literate on what it means
to be searcher and so recently we
launched this thing called a Google Ad
AECOM which is basically a game I've
heard some of you talking about what
would it be like to make a game here's
an example you go to a Google ad a calm
and you'll get a question every day and
here's one from a few days ago the this
particular 12,500 bottle ship sailed
from 8,000 nautical miles specific
question is what color was the sail
flying when the bottles arrives at their
destination they know what this is off
the top of their head this is plastique
II went from Sausalito to Sydney but the
point is we've slipped in some learning
here this is the idea of you know the
serious game so we have roughly 25,000
people a day learning how to search by
answering questions like this right
that's not bad
here there happen to be learning about
the effect of plastic on the environment
here they're learning another Google
search technique this is the same kind
of idea you might want to use in
communicating your ideas in this case
we're showing people how to do unit
conversions you can just basically type
in 150 ran plus the under 350 Kuwaiti
dinars etc just tells you the answer in
US dollars okay we didn't have to write
a long module but now 25,000 people know
that trick
that was a good day's work for me okay
so let me give you two big hints here to
make you better serious I can't I can't
resist I have to teach okay so one big
thing is there's a bunch of stuff that
Google does nobody no human that I know
can remember all the different URLs
I can't I've given up so I use Google to
find the Google capabilities like if I
want to find the news archive I say
Google News are
or if I want to find how to translate
pages google translate 3d models google
3d models get the idea right you're
using Google as a search term to search
google for the capabilities that Google
has right it's great trick I have no
idea give it a shot
Yoda shine okay um the other thing is I
really want you to take this on
seriously you know it's a little bit
like you learned how to write once and
you're done
you never learned anything else you
don't want to do that you that's
stagnant death as a writer same thing is
true for search if your search model is
based on what you learned in sixth grade
at the hands of Miss thistlebottom in
the school library right you are now
officially archaic so you've got to say
it he's got to stay afloat on these
things stay on stay on touch so I write
a blog about search and research the web
is constantly changing the content
changes what we can do can change I
recommend you add a short sort of
learning element every day to learn
what's possible because the tool sets
are changing so fast so fast that if
you're not sort of conscious about this
stuff is going to run you past and
you're going to be an anachronism in
your own time so my injunction to you is
that you can and must learn how to
search effectively deeply enact really
thanks very much I can moderate yes um
yeah what the better way to do that is
just to subscribe to the news feed for
an official Google Blog that way they
actually write them as opposed to some
bozo and nowhere land writing it this
and you're guaranteed to get one message
per day not a hundred so that's the fast
way to do it yes yeah
let's see that never happened before
right you go to the library I go to
library we get different results so how
is it any different actually yeah I mean
the other worry is that is the hyper
canonicalization of everything which is
you'll read the ABC news and you'll read
ABC news and you will read ABC News and
nobody else can read anything else I
mean that's the flip side of it is the
sort of fascist approach everybody gets
exactly the same content I much prefer
the information available which is
encompassing right and so I think you
know those guys have the wrong analysis
basically so I'm not too worried about
it yes you can't you have to learn it
yeah I I know how to do it I would have
done how do I teach it I mostly teach it
through example so in their class I
mentioned it's actually a two-hour class
and a large part of that class is giving
side-by-side examples and so what if I
was teaching you what I would do is
break you up into pairs of people with
each with two laptops and you would look
at side by side web pages say say GMOs
right there's one page on a GMO here's
another page in GMO why do you believe
one over the other and the cool thing
about is I get all this data out of it
it's really great but what's really
interesting for example is that you'll
see you can see all kinds of stuff
happening like the flagrant use of logos
to gain credibility so for example
there's one site I can think of which is
just totally bogus alright there's no
reason you should believe it but they
used a Google custom search engine and
so at the bottom of the page is a little
Google logo and I've seen people go oh
terrible terrible terrible Oh Google
supports it yeah must be good just about
killed me right
so since people can copy logos without
any restriction naturally Geographic
gets ripped off all the time Mayo Clinic
gets ripped off all the time ABC News
gets ripped off all the time so you
actually have to learn how to actually
track these things down and that's where
the classes
okay one more question yes yeah yeah I
write them that's how I decide it's
actually a little more subtle than that
every week there's sort of a major theme
which is never expressed to anybody so
for example that first taxi two weeks
were all about keyword choice how do you
choose given this little mini story how
do you choose what terms out of it you
should be using as keywords so for
example one of them was in the 1800's it
was a common notebook used blah blah
blah blah right it turns out 1800 says
nothing whatsoever to do with the
question but everybody puts it in and
