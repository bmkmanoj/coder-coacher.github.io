my background is as a designer so an
interaction designer and visual designer
I studied art psychology and design so
it gives you a bit of the background for
me I don't know that much about what I'm
about to tell you but I know a little
bit so I'm going to sort of share with
you some ideas and then introduce people
who actually know what they're talking
about so crafting your story in the
digital world this is the context for
the whole thing so I'm going to draw a
parallel here to the music business so a
long time ago if you were lucky you
would you know be pretty talented would
record an album you put it out really
there was a little marketing involved it
was mainly just getting on the radio
he'd do some concerts there weren't that
many artists even know about right there
were only so many you only bought so
many records etc things have changed
entirely things are totally different in
the music business now and I think it's
sort of the same in science but science
hasn't caught up to sort of the changes
that have been happening in the music
world same with newspapers and other
industries so the first thing to tap
into this is a word to keep in mind is
atomization so no longer do you just
release a record you you know record
some songs you release bits of the songs
and bits of interviews with you the
artist and maybe the cover art at
different times you basically have taken
the the idea of what you are as a
musician and the kind of things that you
create and broken them into smaller bits
that you can deal with separately and
we'll see more of that in a second so
here's a band called Pomplamoose they
have a youtube channel they have a
website they have a myspace they have a
Twitter and they have facebook and on
their facebook they can have discussions
about themselves they can have photos
they've atomized themselves as
performing artists you can imagine
atomizing yourself as a scientist or a
research group have discussions events
etc other people can post things in
reaction to what they are doing right so
they've atomized themselves and other
people can respond to a certain part of
their atomic self and of course my
social network is included when I'm
looking at this so who among my friends
is interested in this particular thing
so become relevant in a second
so earlier Christmas talking about
honesty and integrity and how that's an
advantage maybe for for you guys so the
nice thing about social media and pretty
i think natalie he'll be presenting
after can comment on this is that social
media responds best to honesty and
integrity it's really bad to post for
instance to Facebook or Twitter as an
institution with an institutional voice
but it's really good to post as a human
being it's really good to post as a
scientist or as a musician as opposed to
an institutional voice so atomization
what it means for I think us is story
excuse me story is not story it's
tempting to think that maybe you do some
research you get a paper published and
they're sort of a flurry of activity to
get the story out and that's it well no
as we all know one piece of data might
produce multiple multitude of stories
and so along with the atomization of
content comes multiple stories in
multiple formats another kind of
atomization that's happening is retry
bolas asian where you know it's very
easy to find your community online so we
you know we talk about this as being a
bit of a problem maybe if you only find
the content that matches your point of
view or if you only connect with people
who agree with you on the other hand it
does let you connect with people who
will support your cause and that's what
a lot of these social media tools are
for so who's in your tribe who can you
collaborate with multiple channels means
you have to use all the channels
available to tell a story today it's not
enough to just use the newspaper or the
triple a esas outreach service you know
you have to get into Twitter you have to
get into Facebook you have to be on
YouTube but you don't have to put the
whole story in each place you can break
the story into multiple pieces and
consider how to do it like timed release
medication so you don't put it out all
at once but perhaps you release a little
bit on a regular basis so that you
retain that joy of discovery that was
talked about earlier today right people
want what they don't have and people
want exclusive things so if you can
figure out how to time the release or
you know continually release bits of
things then that was a good way to tell
a story I'll show three quick examples
as I wrap up but I'll just give you
screenshots of these now so
data not just messages this is you know
topic that's being brought home a lot
these days and I think even the NSF is
now requiring some release of data for
certain grants I'll show you examples of
how data tell a story not some some
written words around the data the data
themselves tell the story so this is a
what a flight path visualization I'll
show you this is a this I only have a
screenshot of it's basically a tracking
devices were put on right whales is from
the University of New Hampshire and the
movement of the right whales was tracked
it wasn't understood prior to this how
they moved around under in the water and
what they're sort of like patterns were
for feeding on any case you know you can
you can look this up but you know the
visualization tells the story of what
the whales do the paper also does but
you know the visualization tells a lot
of the story and obviously we can embed
you know charts someone is it Eli who
had an example of a really bad sort of
printed chart that doesn't really tell
the whole story well you know with the
kinds of tools that are available today
you can tell more than you can tell more
than just one story with one static
chart but you can tell many stories I'll
show you another example of this in a
second so you know these things are all
kind of a little bit complicated to make
you know it's not your expertise as
climate scientists and so on to actually
build these but there are people whose
expertise it is they may want to work
with you they may be in your tribe you
know one way to find them might be
through facebook also the game marco
polo everyone knows what this is right
so if i say Marco you say it's call and
response so broadcast isn't really the
way things are done any more pollen
response is what it's about and Google's
all about that right we're a search
company so people query Google and we
give them something in return so it's
inquiry based communication not
broadcast based communication this is
search I did this morning climate risk
yields Africa it's not particularly
technical the terms but they look at the
results it's all scholarly articles and
a lot of PDFs if I was actually trying
to just get it if I were a student
trying to get a you know in high school
trying to get a basic understanding
of this these are the worst possible
results so there there are communities
that you know might be able to help
create content that would answer this
question a bit better so you've got to
be aware of how people are searching you
know what shows up when people search
for the things that you do research on
and I think this is more or less last
plus just a couple of quick demos
dialogue is another part of this call
and response most websites have comments
on them now probably a good thing
although we've all seen really terrible
uninformed comments it is a way of
gauging people's response to what you
have to say on YouTube just as important
as the videos are video responses that
people make and that's what develops a
community and I've definitely seen
scientists and there's even there's a
scientist do this sort of talking heads
also there's Salman Khan from Khan
Academy this guy who basically does
education sort of teaches math lessons
and statistics lessons through YouTube
videos and there are all kinds of
responses to him as well so before I
introduce the people who actually know
about this I'll just show you how the
data themselves can communicate a story
these are part this is part of the
flight patterns visualization or not
I'll refresh that and go to another one
so the molecular visualization that I
was showing you isn't just a still image
but now you can publish when you do the
digital version of your paper an
interactive model of your protein in
fact you can actually have a lot more
than just this but this is an example of
how you can move far beyond a single
printed graph and publish the actual
data if you're a newspaper or you're a
blog scientist blogger you can embed
audio content and even interactive
charts in your blog post or your paper
route so think about how you can move
beyond what you may be done today and
now i think i can get this working you
don't need a whole lot of text to
understand what's going on here um i do
not recall maybe points of origin okay
so these are flight flight path
visualizations it's one day of FAA data
and you can see that flights you know
move in certain the important thing
about this is sort of that very little
surrounding texts or sort of a
complimentary text is necessary to get a
story or a couple of stories out of this
so the the guy who made this he now
works here but he won the I'm now trying
to remember where he went maybe from the
nap NSF I think he won the science the
visualization award or art award a
couple of years ago for this there you
go there you go hi Aaron Koblin ko b li
n okay that was super fast now i'm going
to introduce yeah well not not of me
just yet we'll do it at the end we'll
get through everyone's presentation so
write down your questions Sean asked a
okay I can take a couple of questions
well sean is plugging in and I'll
introduce you I'll go ahead I'm not
necessarily two groups but to the
institutional voice which it I couldn't
really answer that Natalie might know
more about that but I think you know
nominally it's a it's a social thing and
you know people are social companies
aren't social you do have a relationship
to institutions and two brands and so on
but nominally social network I guess is
for person-to-person communication maybe
not all you'll be able to say more about
that later yeah
sure yeah I'll give you a quick idea so
you know if say you manage to meet
someone like Aaron Koblin who does
visualizations and there are a lot of
people out there who do it maybe you
give one of them exclusive access to
your data to tell a particular story at
a particular time before you open the
floodgates to other collaborations I
mean that's that's an example of
something that's totally legitimate and
would help string a story along a little
bit longer okay sean is a talented
engineering / outreach person on the
Google Earth team and so he's going to
show us something about google earth
yeah definitely all right i'll probably
this one so Sean and I work on the
Google Earth outreach team and we help
public benefit groups use our mapping
technology to tell stories so I will if
I do my job you guys will all be motion
sick by the end of this and need a barf
bags so um let's tell some stories not
all my stories going to relate directly
to science but some of them well we got
some data this is casualty data for Iraq
and Afghanistan for both the US and
coalition troops it tells a story not a
particularly compelling one but there's
some big numbers at the bottom here is
another page from the Washington poach
post this also tells a story you've got
photographs of all the guys that have
died in chronological order this also
tells the story but I would argue this
also isn't very compelling you don't
have a sense of the scale I mean 6,000
what is that what does that mean so
couple years ago I launched a project
called map the fallen and will fly into
Google really quick and we're going to
start with ken ken was born the day
after me and I met his mom when I
started this project he he died when the
machine gun on his tank caught a tree
while they were going down the road
turned around and I'll leave the rest to
your imagination he's one of a
lot of people have died in this war but
again one point on the map doesn't tell
you much it tells you a little bit about
Ken so let's look at a whole bunch more
people so we're going to zoom out and
take a look at the entire United States
will tilt a little bit here and I'm
gonna hit the play button this is a time
animation and these are people
chronologically coming in these are
their hometowns where they died I where
they were from in the US before they
died you'll see these arcs these yellow
arcs these are connecting the hometown
to the place of death so if we fly down
here to Iraq and Afghanistan you'll see
data from there as well so well almost
to the end of the data I'm going to fly
in here in a sec to Baghdad as you might
imagine Baghdad has had the heaviest
casualties in the war each one of these
is a person each one of these you click
on them you're going to see a photo
you're going to hear about how they died
you're going to see guestbooks where
their friends and family signed you know
messages of love left messages of love
for them you can read the Department of
Defense news release you can zoom in
even farther each one of these blocks
represents a day in that city and these
are the guys that died on that day in
this city so for any one of these guys
or women I can say well let's let's fly
to their hometown and we're going to jet
back over to Ryan's hometown and he was
from college station texas i can also
look people up by their last name
alphabetically or by their age group or
by gender so this is an example of how
you can take what might have just
started off is a big statistic is a big
number and turn it into something that
tells a story right these are all the
people have died serving our country and
you know there's a temporal component of
this as well and you can see that was
the invasion of Afghanistan you can even
see the surge that happened a lot more
casualties coming over and you can pause
this is a 10-point so anyway this is map
the phone you can check it out at
mapathon org if you want to see let's
get into some other science
some other data sets more particularly
in about science so here's a data set
looking at deforestation rates around
the world you guys might imagine Brazil
gets a lot of flack for that you can
click on any one of these place marks
and you can get a little flash app it
shows like a real time estimate of how
many hectares have been logged some
other data about the types of forests
that have been logged and you pretty
pretty quickly get an idea of what's
happening a green actually means growth
so China apparently is either planting
or has a lot of spontaneous force just
popping up out of nowhere but this story
is also a little deceiving let's take a
look at it another way this is the total
area of being logged per year if we
switch to a total area as a percentage
of the country's total area we start
getting a slightly different story i
mean brazil obviously still has most of
the Amazon but suddenly Honduras is
popping in here with a whole bunch look
at some other data this is similar this
is geothermal energy potential under
each of the 50 contiguous states you can
click on one these are all these graphs
are dynamically generated using the
Google charts API you don't have to go
into your spreadsheet program and
generate them you just send us a request
for an image with the data in the URL
and will spit back a pie chart or a bar
chart for you interestingly enough this
will be our introduction to our next
topic West Virginia has a lot of
geothermal potential compared to other
East Coast states unfortunately they are
a victim of a lot of a destructive coal
mining practices so they do a lot of
coal mining in Appalachia this is a
layer that was developed by a nonprofit
organization that highlights some of the
kind of most environmentally devastating
mines in Appalachia so this is one of
those mines you can see what the
landscape looks like now looks a little
bit like the moon
but you can actually load salad imagery
what it used to look like so here's a
little bit of before and here's after
and for people that want to learn more
about the mining process we actually set
up this step-by-step tour that will walk
them through all the different stages of
mountaintop removal coal mining so
obviously first they clear the forests
then they do a bunch of blasting so this
is a way to educate the public as to
what's happening and how these you know
environmental changes are happening so
there's a big 3d model you can load see
if I can get it here you go so this is a
truck shows you the comparison how big
these machines are that are plowing
through these mountains basically all
these mountains are dynamited and all of
the rubble is basically pushed off into
the valleys and they basically pollute
and destroy the the watershed in the
area okay let's take a look at some
other stuff so a lot of census data came
out recently and I like playing with
data so for the google i/o conference
that recently happened I decided to
scrape a bunch of census data and wanted
to you know do some interesting
animations with it so let's take a look
at the number of children without health
care in the US over the past few decades
so this is an animation from 1987 to
2009 and you can see all these states
kind of move around in respect to their
data values I can pause it and click on
it this is a particularly bad year for
nevada twenty-five percent of the kids
didn't have health insurance can
continue planning it this is what's
called the googler tour once you've set
up your data in Google Earth you can
record a flight path you can record
audio narration that goes with it so
instead of just throwing a bunch of data
at someone who doesn't understand what
it means you can actually give them a
story a narrated experience of that data
and so they can walk away with the
message you want them to have
interestingly enough Massachusetts
is the best country our best state in
the Union for kids with health care only
three percent of kids locking health
care yes so it'd be interesting to kind
of mash this up with like red and blue
states to and kind of see how that
progresses over time so that's that how
am i doing on time all right you guys
aren't dizzying um let's try that yeah
so one of the things that we did um
sorry guys we worked with for the cop15
in cop16 conferences my team worked with
a bunch of scientists and a lot of
different fields and created a set of
these tours that kind of walk laypeople
through some of the environmental issues
related to climate change so this is a
tour to take is designed from some guy
you probably remember challenge is
nipping Facebook climate change the kind
of things that we can do together to
overcome those challenges in California
we already seeing the signs this is data
we're flying in the California we're
showing different regions of California
one climate model showing the changes in
temperature we're popping a balloon
showing some graphs on increasing
temperature trends we've reduced
scientists tell us that I want I want to
basically make you listen I the entire
thing but you get the idea you can
basically start flying people figure
data and creating a narrative and
explaining it to them later on in the
story I you know they show width solar
farms that in wind farm all saw energy
probably the actual wind farms that are
out here off of 580 you know talking
about different climate issues and
basically explaining things to people
who otherwise wouldn't get it if you
just dumped a bunch of data Adam all
right and I think I'm just about what's
that one more ok we'll do one more um
this is another layer that I worked on
in Google Earth this is working with you
nap and basically taking salad imagery
from decades past and recent and you can
basically look at climate change over
time so shoot off to the Amazon here's
Rondonia
take a look at what they used to look at
it like out there so here's rondonia
back in 75 and here it is in 2001 so
this is a whole layer that takes you
know different places around the world
showing lakes drying up glaciers
receding it's a way of actually visually
engaging the user and showing them some
of the real tangible changes that are
happening in the environment I'll leave
it at that maybe Sean can take a
question into while we get the next
person up who I think is Bing yeah so I
basically got you know i have like
population back to like 1,900 and yes i
only have four every decade so i just
kind of do an interpolation over a few
seconds from one dead give value to the
next so it's just kind of stood in that
example this was more of a code sample
for developers which is kind of a
straight interpolation between the
values so the other questions
yeah sure so depending on the project
the map the following thing I got about
a quarter of a million hits in seven
days which concern me wasn't really well
besides it was a personal project of
mine google so I was pretty happy with a
traffic it was on Union a lot of blog
exposure the Appalachian mountain top
removal layer that was done by a
non-profit they launched that in hopes
of getting signatures on a petition they
had a goal of like 8,000 over the entire
course of the mission I think they got
13,000 seven days from like 30 countries
around the world so if you market it
correctly and you publicize it social
media channels and you create something
interesting humming a lot of impact
right okay I'll take the other questions
later maybe again okay so it's a
pleasure for me to introduce to you
being Chen who is going to tell us a
little bit about how YouTube thinks
about telling stories oh yeah sure hi
everyone this is quite the
quintessential google experience as i'm
sure you all know presenting two
brilliant people is is certainly
illuminating for the soul and damning
for the ego so hopefully this will be
this will be helpful for everyone my
name is Bing I work and yes that is that
is deliberately unfortunate working at
Google which is why I work at YouTube I
work on something called YouTube creator
initiatives which is essentially charged
with identifying cultivating and
promoting the future Steven Spielberg's
Oprah Winfrey's and of course our
favorite Justin Bieber's of the world
it's a very new initiative for for you
too but but as you can surmise a big
part of it is identify who is a rich
storyteller and you can really
articulate their message effectively so
my goal today is to really show you a
high-level example in sort of strategic
categories of how YouTube can be a
really really powerful platform for your
use and so to begin you're going to
forgive my sort of remedial presentation
tactics but I wouldn't have an engaging
exercise first so we're going to divide
the room and a half will do you have are
going to be north you have will be south
and then amongst yourselves if you could
buck yourselves into pairs and identify
who the more articulate individual of
the pair
and hopefully no feelings will be hurt
here and the same goes for this side
you'll see why I'm doing this as quickly
nothing is personal amy is going to kill
as you can tell the most obnoxious
person the room is presenting for
YouTube of course all right I real all
we already does everyone have a pair all
right great if you are the less
articulate person for now could you
please close your eyes or put your head
on your desk and again forgive the sort
of elementary school exercise all right
is everyone all eyes are closed all
right the more articulate chosen ones
congratulations all right look at this
image you'll have 20 seconds after I'm
done talking on this half you have to
articulate what you're seeing right now
to your partner using only written text
and pictures you may not say a word do
we get it okay all right this side you
may not use any written graphics or text
you may only use words verbally to
articulate what you are seeing do we
understand all right y'all 20 seconds go
no talking no talking this should be
silent exercise talk okay is oh I'm
sorry wait if you are the less
particular person you're I should be
close right now Oh none of you saw that
what's on the screen did you all right
well they're there that defeat the
purpose of that one and we'll try anyway
and then we'll go by an honor system
later but if you are the less articulate
one you sure I should still be closed
and you're not doing a thing right now
you draw you draw for about 10 more
seconds and then you'll have 20 seconds
to then explain what you saw so person
the more articulate person again you
have to identify what you're seeing less
particular person your eyes are still
closed all right and you have file give
you five more seconds and we'll go by an
honor system for this
you owe me right words and draw pictures
you all may not you may only verbalize
what you saw not yet you will do it
right I'm all right so we go up all of
you will have 20 seconds to articulate
your partner what you saw using only
text and drawing so on this side you may
not speak on this side you may not draw
a thing you may only speak do we
understand so the more articulate person
is then going to explain what they saw
to the less articulate person who is
silent using only words yes but you've
made you can't don't try to cheat in you
know pardon oh you guys are really fast
okay sorry then I miss articulate so I'm
the least articular person the room
right no no no you guys over it's all
over last for life real quick alright so
relax real quick relax we'll start on
this side since this side seems to be
easier which is what we would have
guessed on this side who did not the
less articulate person who did not see
what was on the board okay so from one
of you was your partner able to clearly
articulate what you saw and this is what
oops and this is what you should have
seen wow you should come over here and
get this presentation then so truthful 8
did any did any was any of your partner
wear any of your partner's able to
articulate lee show you what this looked
like using only verbal words yeah more
or less all right cool good all right
very good all right fair enough so this
side this side then well this is
definitely not working I thought it
would so this side then you were not
able to use verbal words who did not see
what was on this board okay sir was
adn't wall that's not fair this Adam
someone else Adam of course was able to
articulate using pictures I bet it was I
bet it was I bet it was sir in the back
really you two really good okay well for
most people who see this they are not
able to articulate this and the point
that I'm trying to make here
is that either when you only have the
point I'm trying to make is when you
only have something that is verbal or
you only have something that uses sight
it's therefore limited right and so one
of the powerful things about YouTube is
that instead of just seeing a picture of
all these hands in different places you
start to see something that won't play
on a website which is this and so
instead of just having sight and sound
you now also have motion and that third
key characteristic of the triumvirate is
really really critical and so now what
was previously just a picture some weird
things is now something called seaweed
that is fairly innovative for video
right so that was the point I was trying
to make all right so now what we'll get
into the relative all right let's move
on YouTube as many people know is the
world's largest stage period we have
literally billions of users every single
day and literally three billion views
every single day it's a staggering
number and it's something that Hollywood
and Bollywood and Hollywood as you can
imagine try to strive for every single
day more staggering is the volume of
content that we have 48 hours of content
is uploaded every single minute that
means that in 60 days youtube produces
more content than all five major
networks have in Hollywood in the last
60 years it's a staggering number right
now granted some of these things are my
cat's on skateboards but other content
is also very meaningful like the kinds
of content that you would upload and so
my goal today is is really to not only I
guess subtly dispel the myth that
YouTube is for kids and there's lots of
sort of only fanciful content but more
importantly that there's a lot of rich
and meaningful content and to show you
sort of strategically how those things
play out so why you use YouTube I'm
going to give you five reasons at a very
high level why YouTube is such a
profound and engage platform first is
because YouTube as you all probably know
is able to inspire I don't know if any
of you are familiar with this campaign
but there's a young man who was
basically ostracized because of a sexual
orientation with the University about a
year and a half ago and as a result two
strangers who didn't even know him
upload a video on YouTube that
encouraged sort of I guess many my
order youth around the world that it
would get better and this simple
three-word phrase rather than just
putting on a poster or using audio they
made a video of this with a very human
face they were there weren't you know
famous or anything these were just sort
of you know average folk but before you
know it thousands and hundreds of
thousands and before you know it
millions of people all around the world
we're creating videos just like this and
began something of a social revolution
to the point where you see ads for this
as well as people out in the communities
engaged so the idea here is that
inspiration in contrast to what a lot of
industry thinks can come from basic
users around the world within YouTube
and it happens literally every day these
social revolutions happen all the time
another great instances I don't know if
you all saw this young lady named
Rebecca Black who sang a song about
friday she essentially is I believe 13
years old created this obscenely bad
lyrical song actually it's not lyrical
all this is a ceiling bad lyrics for a
song and create this music video before
you know it has hundreds of millions of
views and so this is another example of
something that happens very very
frequently on youtube I think the second
important thing is reach so in contrast
to a lot of sort of television sets
which is very much a Leanback experience
so you're on your couch you're watching
sort of passively YouTube is very much a
lean forward experience which is
something that will review on Wednesday
in the workshop people on YouTube are
very active consumers of content if you
just play something in front of them
don't think that your knowledge alone is
going to be substantial enough to keep
them keep them sort of engrained there's
lots more to it than that one good
example of another sort of dimension of
reach is how quickly content can travel
around the world this is you guys can
probably recognized as one of the first
visual representations of the revolution
in Egypt it was very much their
Tiananmen Square moment where an
individual and Egyptian no you know no
different from I guess very different
from all of you but may not have had you
know several five different degrees but
he stood in front of the sort of water
pipe in and literally got hosed down and
this this image got broadcasted across
the world and again was the first real
representation of what was going on in
the region and as you can tell by the
gradients of the picture this was taken
by an average user just like you and me
so in terms of rezone these you
to be able to actively engage people
around the world but it's able to travel
I guess traveled to the hands of even
the creators of content in this case of
the news the next example that I wanted
to fly across as well as someone that
Adam referred to earlier his name is Sal
Khan Sal as you probably know as a
Harvard Business School graduate and a
former hedge fund manager and in his
words decided one day to do something
meaningful with his life and so in sum
one day he's decided to literally go on
youtube and create these tutorials on
everything from algebra to
photosynthesis in this example to
grammar so forth and so on and it is
literally as primitive as this it looks
like a light bright almost and he's
amassed over 1,800 lectures and millions
and millions of views and it's just
voted one of the most innovative people
of last year by fast company he's making
of and I can sure the exact numbers but
he's making a lot of money doing this as
well and of course has sort of taken and
taken notice by people like Bill Gates
and so in terms of the the point of
mentioning this is that YouTube not only
because of the nation rise of online
education but YouTube as a platform can
really be used as a very effective way
to teach people different things and on
Wednesday we'll be going over those
specific tactics next is engage until
how many of you know who this is no very
good it's mostly the male audience in
the room there it goes that the ad was
effective so this gentleman is from an
ad by a company called Old Spice which
is on I guess I think historically
largely a male-dominated sort of
grooming products so they create
deodorant shampoo so forth and so on and
an effort to revitalize their brand they
decided to go viral and so prior to the
Super Bowl Cleveland this year unless
I'm getting old i think it was he right
all right so this year they released
this ad of this gentleman who was going
through all these different things and
the idea is that he would represents one
of these canonical experiences that his
female counterpart would want so he has
these obnoxious things like what's in my
head and of course he has a very deep
voice he goes what's in my hand it still
tickets to that thing you love now the
tickets are diamonds so again the idea
is really playing on stereo typical
things that the sort of his counterpart
were one and it went viral very quickly
what they did instead though of just
distributing content from a to
be was to ask for content inspiration
from B to a and so what he did was they
went to Twitter and he asked specific
people to send him questions and these
people range from everyone like you and
me all the way to celebrities like uh no
what's her name one of the famous
offshoot I'm gonna get in trouble for
this one let's just call her Angelina
Jolie and so it wasn't someone of that
that's that status but someone like her
and basically he would read off the
questions that they had submitted and
would respond to them in real time these
videos generated tens of thousands of
views because he is engaging people in
their content which is another effective
tactic that will be going over very very
very tactically on Wednesday so the
message here is engagement some the
biggest mistake people make on youtube
is they think you just put your content
up there and the people will just
consume it that is not the case half of
the success equation on YouTube is
engagement to making sure that not only
are you a to be but it's very much be to
a and again we'll go over tactics there
and before I finish the last thing I
want to mention is the this is very easy
so a lot of people I think have a
visceral sort of allergic reaction to
YouTube because they think Oh production
value is difficult or shooting a video
is difficult than I have to upload it
and now i have to get sort of producers
together so forth and so on and as will
share with you on wednesday that's just
simply not the case one of the beauties
of youtube and one of the reasons so
easy is because the platform is so
malleable you can show just a still
image on youtube and it's still
something profound you can show
something silent and it's still profound
you can just use audio and you can still
reach people in emerging markets or you
can have a full-fledged video and have
something extremely effective as well
and as our data shares our audience on
YouTube is highly varied it's not just
people you know sort of my sort of like
me trying to look for you know gaming
videos it really does run the gamut so
the final thing I'll say is a lot of
this will sort of frou-frou high level
sort of examples of the ways that
individuals have exceptionally used the
platform but something I really want to
emphasize that I think a lot of at least
people in in our industry confused
whether they be advertisers with
businesses is that there's no formula to
success on YouTube I'm here to tell you
that there is absolutely a success
formula to youtube and it's something
refer to as haley's law and so I will be
sharing that on Wednesday very very
tactile 8
you sort of step-by-step instructions we
were told to do is lawyers right I'll
give you very very specific instructions
on how to leverage and what tools you
should leverage on YouTube to make sure
that you can have moments like these
five as well thanks alright thank you
Bing for that very energetic
presentation um any questions for being
well and Natalie I think natalie is up
next uh yeah bingo yep and metric seems
to be the number of what seems to be a
common metric that we have this video
users met Apollo you metrics it it's not
clear that an educator for this example
absolutely so no it's a great point um
and I shouldn't be saying this as my
marketing overlords are going to get
very mad at me but I agree view
certainly do not equate to impact which
usually is defined by some sort of
action right and so at a high level the
way we look at is direct impact of the
actual content itself and then of course
indirect impact so we're trying to see
the best way particularly this let me
give an example through one of the ones
we saw earlier and the old spice
commercials got millions of millions of
hits which someone one person could
measure as sort of mindshare brand
awareness I don't believe in my chair
brand awareness it's highly qualitative
and and sort of very very fluffy with
the way that they did in directly
measure the success was the uplift in in
purchases for their product and so while
this example isn't necessarily one
hundred percent akin to sort of the
educational arena they saw a 111 percent
uptick in purchases for their specific
product that they're purchasing that's
very specific and this of course is all
the things stable because you know
there's no other marketing perhaps
people buy more in January but but you
know sort of all things considered
it worked fairly well for individual
campaigns within education we can talk
more about it at length on Wednesday
when we have one-on-one but as a sort of
unit you loo to it really really varies
on the campaign but overall I agree with
you views are not the only thing oh
sorry who that answered okay one more
really quick I don't know if I said
millions of dollars but as so certainly
a lot of it is from residual payments
from sort of his speaking engagements or
whatever have you we also have something
called the YouTube Partner Program that
I will share with you on Wednesday it is
a monetizable program where we have
hundreds of people making six-figure
incomes what something being really took
the preview of Wednesday workshopped
into heart so thank you thank you thing
haha so now I'm happy to introduce
Natalie Villalobos who is a community
manager at Google so she will tell you
all about how we as Google try to
maintain good relationships with our
users in particular probably lead users
or people who are particularly important
to the success of our products okay
Nellie yeah I like to walk around a lot
cool so uh thank you outta my name is
Natalie Villalobos community manager
Google essentially what that means is
that for the past five years I've been
building a career in helping to develop
not only power users but users that are
online users that are offline trying to
find ways to keep users engaged educate
users and really be a representative
voice not only from the company that I
represent which currently today is
google but also from those users back to
that company so I've worked everywhere
from yahoo to the institute for the
future which is where some of my talk
today will be from to now Google um also
worked for a small start-up called the
seasteading institute and style mob as
well as dig so the thing that I wanted
to cover today was um how I feel game
mechanics specifically hands them
sharing models that I feel are trending
in the tech industry how if you can
utilize these correctly in the proposals
that you're not only developing this
workshop but projects outside of this
how it incorporated will be able
to empower new audiences to help spread
the ideas that you would like to share
out that doesn't work I feel like you
can do this in if you create and
implement three different strategies or
three that actually go together as one
strategy so to supply a challenge to
develop the collective and to sustain
the campaign this is one of the women
that I think I like to listen to the
most whenever I go to a conference name
is Kathy Sierra love the quote that she
says is just make people better at
something they want to be better at so
this is an inspiration for this talk
because what I'm wanting to enable you
to walk away with is that by designing
for the user by always keeping your
audience in mind from you know the
beginning of developing a concept
driving it to the v ery to the very end
that they are the audience that you now
have completely engaged you have thought
about them first and not necessarily the
project that you're trying to get across
but you're always developing for your
users so one and I'm going to cut to a
video in a second to is a is to supply a
challenge so back in 2009 I worked for
the Institute for the future and there I
helped Jane McGonigal who if you guys
have watched any of the TED Talks is
here give a talk about how games are
leading the way and getting people
engaged in social issues in in climate
issues in things that are affecting us
as human beings what are the common
problems and how can we solve them using
games so she was lead on developing the
scientific lab and essentially what it
is is we we created an opportunity for
scientists and technologists to give
really short forecasts about a
particular scenario that we developed so
not only was it fun engaging and simple
but what we wanted to do was to not
propose was to not give hard data but we
wanted to give a theory something that
was controversial something that would
produce outliers something that would
stir up some trouble and get some people
thinking about some really fascinating
ideas and again we always develop with
these are in mind and our main goal was
to look for the outliers so I'm actually
going to cut to video very quickly you
guys can actually see you can go to this
now it's called play dot scientific org
and
note how scientific is spelled that was
always a little bit of an issue for how
innovative we were and so I will play
this and I'll actually explain a little
of the game very quickly hopefully this
will let's hear what is
what if you could broadcast a message
anywhere in the universe what if you
love witnessing history for your eyes
what if you never got lost again what if
you could protect the ones who love
what if you could run one experiment in
space join the first public your
organization's you're pairing so I'm
actually going to cut it here and
essentially kind of get the point when
I'm looking at a lot of the boards and
notes probably knows you guys have
written there's this explanation of the
narrative and so what was really
important for us in this experiment was
to be able to explain the narrative
using YouTube um you know as our vehicle
and then you could go down here and you
can actually after you watch the
scenario which was in the year 2219 what
would it be like for you to pop these
satellites into space people could then
in this particular game give either
positive imagination card or a dark
imagination card then once people played
off of it this had follow-up cards you
actually were gifted more cards to play
off of and what made this really
fascinating let me cut back to this very
quickly what made it really fascinating
was and successful was that we kept it
at 140 characters so kind of like
Twitter you're wanting to have this
rapid fire ideation which is very
different than writing like an abstract
or blog post we wanted people to move
quickly it was time limited sometimes it
was anywhere from one day to three days
we limited the amount of players that
could play and what what I will speak
and like to the next point of developing
the collective keeping it a really small
bundle of people which will develop
faster than say you have like a list of
you know mailing list of 10,000 people
and you're like how do we save the world
and like those 10,000 people are very
disjointed but if you could get them
into small passionate groups those are
going to be more useful in solving an
issue or challenge and then those users
um could reach out to us in real time
through the Twitter account and also
through blogging and me as the
gamemaster's was sharing about sharing
back out the outliers and things that I
wanted people to play off of and for
people to discover so another point that
I want to pick is in developing the
collective so one example here is a
recent company founded by dave morin who
recently left facebook and wanted to
develop a way for people to engage in
i'm sharing photos and dynamic content
with this a the thing that's very
different is that instead of having five
thousand friends on facebook and wanting
to because many people involved in your
idea as possible you can only share to
up to 50 people and i feel like this is
one of the more major trends in the tech
industry is that people are wanting to
share more discreetly not as broadly and
this is really important because we're
in the age of yelp where you're looking
for recommendations you're looking for
who and your social network knows what
and you really don't want to broadcast
out what you're doing on a saturday
night to say a thousand of your friends
but maybe just here close-knit 50 so
when we're talking about game mechanics
and sharing i think it's important that
you know in considering your proposal or
in considering other projects that
you're wanting to engage again small
groups of users not large groups of
users when trying to solve a particular
issue this is one of my favorite quotes
of all time Trust is the only real
currency so this is another company that
in the in the game and geolocation space
is called scavenger i recommend
definitely checking them out and i
wanted to mention here that people can
essentially check into places be
rewarded with things that are actually
useful to them so I don't want were
thinking about game mechanics I don't
want it to be about badges I don't want
to be about points or leveling up but
specifically here I could check into a
burrito joint I can document what I do
with a tin foil from my burrito as tin
foil origami I can take a photo of it I
can share it out with my friends people
who are coming later and if I get enough
points than what I actually level up to
is a burrito another mini burrito
something that I really actually do want
when I am there and here it's i'm
looking at recommendations and with the
challenges that are produced here i
cannot
we play off of other people's scenarios
so one of the things when you're kind of
opening your theory or idea open up into
a tree when you're opening your theory
or idea into interpretation you're
allowing people to play off of it in a
way where you're not trying to hold
tight and control the issue so i really
like it how in scavenger people can play
off of each other as they could in
scientific and last not least so in in
order to sustain a campaign this goes
back to a lot of my community management
experience when you're developing a
strategy or proposal and you're wanting
to incorporate some game mechanics
things that are going to keep people and
involved things that are going to keep
people engaged and you're wanting to you
know help them share to a you know
they're passionate we're friends to help
develop that idea you're also wanting to
at the forefront create a sustainable
campaign so when you do have this active
engaged audience that you're going to
keep them going you're going to keep
feeding them something because you don't
necessarily want to give up this
wonderful network that you just created
so this was a game that was actually
created called urgent evoke it won the
best like social change game of last
year mentors were given to the people
who were playing the game during the
game and post game they had this
incredible you know real-life
opportunity to go and involve change in
Africa enabling people to not only take
action but to also come back to the
online community and you know be
fulfilled and be fed and you know I will
be leading a workshop on on Wednesday
around game mechanics mobile shearing
will touch on the social media I was
supposed to focus a little bit more in
social media but I really wanted to
share some more popular things and you
can't really see this but this is um the
8th annual games for change something
something to look forward to also the
come out and play festival which is also
in New York you can ping me on twitter
at at Natalia envy or you can hit me up
on my google email address and i think
that's it
thanks Natalie so uh maybe a question or
two finale well well setting up but I
just wanted to make a comment to try to
connect things here a little bit so you
know YouTube and game mechanics are sort
of like ways to engage people what this
is really about is the particular
community people you have i was i was on
a retreat for the editors of neurology
journal a little while ago and they were
sort of like the room was split half the
editors love twitter and half hated it
the people who hated it thought that
twitter was all about having
relationships with thousands of people
who you don't know that weren't
meaningful whereas the others were using
it to connect with their tribe other
neurologists they were really using it
to their advantage and I think what
Natalie just showed is the opportunity
to imply some of those techniques to
build a community of people who can
really help to tell your story right you
don't have to do it alone sorry one
question maybe finale before we continue
what do I know about the particular
types of people that play games like the
demographics it's interesting because I
think with a lot of people it can really
be anyone so when we the setup
scientific it was specifically poised to
be science and scientists and
technologists people that aren't
necessarily game players online and I
think a lot of them actually weren't but
they were really good at predicting
something or forecasting something or
throwing out some really awesome big
idea when it was the urgent evoke it was
people and I think there's like close to
20,000 people on that game most of the
people were not regular online game
users these are people who were just
passionate about helping their specific
area in Africa they wanted to get behind
a community project and so instead of
thinking about what type of demographic
you just find what kind of where can I
instigate and develop and build a
passionate community how can I keep
feeding that passionate community people
that are willing and able to help drive
your idea forward okay thanks and last
we have will lures who I think is going
to tell us a little bit about sorry
telling as an allegory the network story
huh okay thanks so much repeating what
you know I'm not this yeah um
so as stories have always been networked
it is the nature of stories to be
memorable to be passed on to be repeated
and changed according to new situations
so digital technologies I think kind of
materialized very old cultural processes
but as with any new technology
communication technology there are very
new ways and how we are telling stories
and and the house stories travel I
stumbled into networks database
interactive storytelling about 10 years
ago i had a documentary project with
about 70 hours of footage and i was
desperately trying to find a story out
of it but what i had was a really
interesting set of stories smaller
stories that really wanted to be inside
of a network rather than placed in sort
of a long linear sequence and at the
time 2001 i came across media scholar
lev manovich idea of a database
narrative according to mana bitch and
this is from the language of new media
narrative and database are opposite ends
of the spectrum they are natural enemies
this is according to him our computer
technologies impose a database and
computational way of thinking and that
and processing that fundamentally
changes traditional narrative models and
you know he goes on to talk about how
the sense of identities are distributed
on all these databases it's very hard
for the narrative to contain that very
complex where we are embedded in the
world so again according to manage the
database narrative foregrounds
computational and nonlinear processes so
randomness role of metadata algorithms
and the important way the user activates
the database to define their own
narrative their own path and that it
doesn't mean that that takes away
narrative right
but narrative as a linear
cause-and-effect chain it becomes less
dominant in the culture but there are
some who argued that actually a database
and narrative are are not so separate so
a narrative a story implies hidden
possibilities or other possibilities and
are derived from story elements that we
all share so if I were to ask everyone
in the room to tell the story of Little
Red Riding Hood you would draw on a
collective data set North American data
set and tell it your own way and I think
a good story is able to even though it's
a sequence it's able to bring to mind
all the other possibilities because
you're constantly guessing right and we
see this complexity in an in recent
storytelling and television that serious
like like lost anybody watch lost
anybody nobody where you have you have a
kind of flirtation with computational
and nonlinear processes in the
storytelling and in a way you can enter
in at any season and sort of as long as
you're covering the whole you know all
the pieces you're able to put it
together it's so fragmented and it's
sort of indicating a new kind of
thinking so a story is more than just a
narrative it's it involves a set of
techniques for pacing for temporal and
spatial marking anticipation suspense
hierarchies of information and engaging
emotion our most common and familiar
story form the anecdote is shaped around
rising action or development
accommodating a climax and then a
resolution and this is scaled in in
movies and other forms where so for
example in movies each scene is is has
this has this arc then each act has the
ark and then and it sort of mirrors the
whole nerve of newspapers where stories
are competing together on a page
introduce the inverted pyramid in which
information is delivered at the
beginning of the article and become less
important as towards the end of the
article below the fold to say it in many
ways websites took on the newspaper
structure for storytelling where the
home page contains the most important
information and everything above the
fold but of course that we you know as I
mentioned episodic television novels
engage in really more complex models
where are their simultaneous arcs
juggled in a given story a network story
so has a familiar structure a linear
structure and i want to say anyway i'm
using this is that a network story can
be a linear story in a in a network of
other linear stories in an open
structure like the web it can also be a
set of stories that are contributed by
users in a closed network like a forum
of some kind but also a story that is
itself made of smaller Network story
this is Adam ization this is Adams Adam
is a shin right that there can be a
closed network that is telling a story
from all these pieces the important
thing is the network is made of discrete
units off these are often narrative in
themselves and we some people call the
micro narratives there's some some of us
call it's snooze as a developer came up
with this is a smallest narrative units
news one of the arguments against are
telling is that it's all surface
diversions no depth or complexity we
jump from one thing to another in a
fragmented way without sustained
argument building of argument and I
think many of us can sympathize with
this right but the fragmentation we're
experiencing now is as shallow as it
seems sometimes is actually building to
very exciting new forms of expression
and connectivity so embrace the
fragmentation embrace the atomization
fragmentation is an essential part of
language the world broken up into
signs gives us the power to think and
imagine and you know I say I come from a
background in film montage the juxta
bishan juxtaposition of fragments has
become kind of a shorthand on the web
it's it's the way to get put two things
together and let the user make the
connection to see the pattern and in
that way let them tell their own story
right so our brains crave fragmentation
as do databases write a novel or a movie
which are these immersive experiences
which to sit back and we just we don't
experience fragmentation are actually
very fragmented right a movies made up
of scenes and shots if you look at a
novel it's made up of words and what
creates immersion our rules of grammar
and syntax cultural codes visual
representations right rhythm all these
things are developed over time and so
we're in the middle of learning how
these pieces can connect so how do we
get formal relations between snooze in a
network story so computational processes
metadata algorithms link structures a
network story needs an agent to define
past activate algorithms to to really
create meaning this is where I think
much of the authorial voice can come in
into creating these database stories
even though you're handing over to the
user what kind of thinking can you can
happen with a set of link structures or
navigation how can how can that process
be triggered a link like an edit and
film can have semantic meaning if I
linked an apple of the word Apple to a
picture of an apple that link is kind of
invisible if I linked the add the word
Apple to say a picture of John Lennon
right or a knife or a snake right those
those convey ideas it's like an edit
right of course social interaction has
been talked about but I think
the way in which users can take stories
and and change them or are add to a data
set add to a snoo rearrange sequences is
all very important agency brings life to
a network story and then the other thing
is media ecology a network story
respects the environment which it is
consumed two more minutes we live in a
universe of devices all talking to us
often it simultaneously so a 50 page PDF
doesn't exactly is on exactly network
friendly one could break it up into
parts but as Adam was saying you know
having us you know blog posts video
synopsis of some kind allows that story
to be digested in different ways and to
be and to travel in different ways to
its its friendly to the ecosystem we're
in I was going to talk about the blog as
a sort of indigenous form of network
story 10 but I think what you can see
here there is fragmentation immersion
does happen when you when you look at
the blog as a whole and get engaged with
a voice of a blogger I want to point you
however to the whale hunt org I don't
know how many of you have seen this it's
it's I think you don't have to care
about whale hunting but what it does is
it it's able to give you a macro view of
a linear story which is a photographer's
traveling with a whale hunt and if you
click on the mosaic it brings you up to
an image but it's in a series of images
that continues like a slideshow it's
like a little movie right and you're
able then to navigate through limiting
what you're seeing in the timeline by
people by themes right so here's just
it's we talk we use this as it's perfect
example of a new kind of storytelling
and and certainly one model of many i
think that's that's it i don't have
anything to sell for my wednesday talk
but thank you
so any questions for will maybe two
questions before we go to the next
section yeah I kind of wet well it's um
you know these are these are little
metadata I mean anything that allows a
user to make leaps of themselves and
that can be that can be simply tags but
it can also be visual connections so if
you have a bunch of choices on the page
what what is the next thing that's going
to take you to where you want to go well
yeah I this is where I really think is
very important to concentrate on that
that linear sequence is a short but
that's going to be where I mean a
YouTube video right you got to work on
making the youtube video engaging but I
would say that I don't know three to 10
minute live a 12 12 10 minute in terms
of time focus on a piece right then you
step out of an engage with I think
there's a lot of depth to this it's it's
something that is a little bit
complicated at first and also requires
possibly rethinking how you deal with
something like your data for instance
and so it's certainly worth having
discussions not in this large group
setting to talk about very specific
instances in which this atom ization can
be used to advantage and the tribal
ization can be used to advantage and so
on so thanks to everyone who spoke
