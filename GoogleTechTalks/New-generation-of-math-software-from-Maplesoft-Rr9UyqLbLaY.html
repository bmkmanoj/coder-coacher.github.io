distinct pleasure to introduce Mohammed
been Demi and Darren McIntyre from maple
i worked at maple back in the mid-90s
and i always thought was a great product
and you know since I've been here at
Google every once a while come across
projects and I think oh yeah maybe would
be really nice for that would be great
for that so it's very pleased that they
could show up I just wanted to mention
that this talk is going to be going to
google videos so please keep any
confidential information out of the Q&amp;amp;A
questions until maybe later on if you
want to ask it in person or something
all right
Thank You Terry and thank you for coming
again again my name is Darren McIntyre
I'm the vice president of sales and
business development at maplesoft it is
not my job today to bore you with a
number of PowerPoint presentations this
is a tech talk so we're going to get
Mohamed up here and talking very shortly
wanted to ask a quick question just a
poll of the group who is familiar with
maple today spy show of hands for a
video that was about twenty five percent
is anyone familiar with the matlab suite
of products so that would be matlab
simulink sim escape by show of hands
that was more like ninety percent our
company is a mathematics software
company we feel that anywhere
mathematics is done any more computation
is done we feel that our product has
applicability we play nice with other
pieces of technology that that being
matlab as well as semi link and Mohammed
will go into some additional detail for
you so just a quick couple slides from
me mission statement here we feel we're
the leading provider of trusted high
performance software tools for
engineering science we got our routes
based in education but branching out
into the commercial market space what
we're trying to do is building a very
high-end computational tool that has the
world's easiest to use interface very
simplistic easy-to-use interface and
you'll see that in Muhammad's
demonstration in just a few minutes so
one more slide for me started as a
research project here in University of
Waterloo back in the late 80s oh we've
been in business some 20 years
approximately two years ago we
introduced that new way to access that
very powerful mathematics based engine
and that is inherent inside of maple 10
which we released a couple years ago and
maple 11 that we released back in March
of this year we about 150 employees half
an RDS or very technology-based and we
do have very strong ties back to the the
academic space I'd like to introduce
Mohammed at this point in time that was
my last slide I just wanted to briefly
introduce the company in the background
and now we'll launch right into
administration and maple itself okay
thank you darren okay just before i
start my presentation I would like to
thank Terry and also like to thank
Google for the opportunity for us to
come here and do this Tech Talk so I can
go back home and say up into google so
maple is a tool that will allow you to
do you know mathematical modeling and
simulation and it can go they can go
beyond beyond that so what I'll do I'll
just do a quick demonstration of maple
as a mathematical tool and then we're
going to some other add-ons so what we
have here is a worksheet where you can
seamlessly mix your mathematics with
your you can seamlessly mix mat with
tags with images with graphics and so on
so what I've just kind of type here meet
an expression so we say x squared plus
sine of x divided by x and then plus
they say 11/3 maple 11 has a 2d equation
editor that will allow you to type in
your equations as equations using real
math notations and like other tools
where you have to code your equations or
have them hidden in cells the the maple
document to the maple documents
interface was meant to make the
usability more of a an easy thing to do
when using the software so what we have
is a context-sensitive menu that will
allow it to right click on any
mathematical expression and then maple
will give you a list of commands that
you can apply to that expression so here
we can see that we have like
differentiate evaluates facts or
integrate and so on so if I just pick
let's say optimize and I want to
minimize the expression so we click on
the minimize and the maple will minimize
the expression it'll give me the results
there I can also right click on this and
we can do number formatting so we can
display our results in scientific
notation engineering notation we can
also specify the number of decimal
places and then we click apply and then
meepo apply the formats in there in some
cases a lot of people be in
to the equations in their documents and
when they go back to the document you
don't know where the equations are
coming from so what we've done we can
make annotations so we can select the
expression here and then we forget to
the formats and then we say annotates
selection so I can say okay this is a
reference and it's coming from a book
called cold math and modeling and then
page 123 for instance so now when I
hover over my expression there I can see
the the little reference that tells me
with that equation is coming from
entrance mathematical symbols is very
easy and we have a number of pallets
that give you access to over a thousand
different mathematical symbols so this
is the favorite palette and we also have
the expression palette there you can see
we have integrals derivatives summations
basic functions like the size the cosine
so if you meet to them integration we
click on the integral symbol there and
then we can say okay we go from x0 to x1
and then we want to integrate the
expression x squared and times the
natural log of X plus 1 with respect to
X and if i press enter so maple will do
the integration and it give me the
results as you can see there we can also
use let's say summation there with the
sigma again from k k going from one to
say n and then we want to sum up all the
K squared and then we present and then
maple will give me the result again
applying the contact sensitive menu I
can right click on the expression there
and I say i want to factorize click on
facts and then maple factorize the
expression for me
working with matrices we also have a
matrix pilot there that will allow us to
create different types of matrices if I
click there we can specify the number of
rows and number of columns fine just
type M 1 here and then we're going to
create lease a 3 by 3 matrix for
simplicity and we click on insert matrix
here you can see that we have different
types of matrices that we can create we
can create random matrices identity we
can also specify the shape of the matrix
and also the data type so in this case I
just want to enter an empty matrix so I
can start typing random values here
so that's my matrix there now if I right
click on the matrix now you will see
that now I have things like solvers and
forms i can do le the compositions i can
the queries on the dimensions the rank I
can also do like the inverse determinant
of the matrix and then maple will give
me that I can also use if I 2 m 2 and m
2 is the inverse so just to m1 to the
minus 1 and press ENTER and the
maplewood give me the inverse of the
matrix I can also multiply the two
matrices and this will give me the ID
audience matrix the other thing that we
could do you can work with numbers but
you can also work with symbols so if I
do let's say a B and then see if i press
enter now for press enter we have a
matrix that depends or the inverse
matrix depends on the promises a b c and
if I to simplify here to tell me people
to simplify the the product of m1 times
m2 presenter now we have also the
identity matrix what I multiply the sir
working with the large matrices I'm
going to create a very large matrix it's
going to be a thousand by a thousand
matrix which is a very large and I'm
going to choose random matrix I don't
want to fill out a thousand by thousand
matrix and the data type is float if i
press insert here oops so that's my
matrix there
now I'm going to compute the inverse of
large M so I'm just going to do budge em
to the minus one so this is a very large
matrix how long do you think it will
take to compute the inverse of the
matrix it's a million element matrix and
any idea yes
anyone want to guess five hours five
seconds ok I'm going to present oh right
now so it'll take about a second or two
to compute the inverse of a very large
matrix now to view the elements all I
have to just double click and then we
can see the entries there all the
elements and you can see it's a thousand
by a thousand we can also view the image
there and that will give me an idea
about the structure of the matrix and
you can see it's a very dense matrix a
quick test is to multiply the two
matrices and this should give me the
identity matrix again multiplying two
very large matrices
there is if I double click now again we
should have the identity matrix and you
can see that we have 10000 one and I can
view that by using the image and we see
that we have a diagonal matrix which is
exactly what we expect
the other thing I'm going to demonstrate
here is you know using maple to solve
differential equations maple does solve
differential equations symbolically as
well as numerically it can also solve
differential algebraic equations and
this is one of the you know strong
features in maple so what I'm going to
do here I'm going to define oh de one
and we got to use a numeric example
first and then a symbolic one so we're
going to enter the Eau de again entering
differential equations in maple is very
simple we use the prime notation which
is like X double prime means the second
derivative with respect to time and then
plus X of T squared plus 1 and then
times X prime of T and then plus X of T
and this is equals to 0 so this is
okay this is a second-order nonlinear
differential equation if I right-click
what we have here is a you can see now
in the context sensitive menu have solve
differential equation and solve the
differential equation interactively I'm
going to choose the interactive one and
that will give me this assistant that
will allow me to solve this differential
equation again without having to use any
commands I mean so far I have not used a
single command it's all using the
context-sensitive menu or using the
shortcut keys here i can add initial
conditions or boundary value conditions
so we say at time T equals 0 X is 3 and
then X Prime at time T equals 0 is going
to be 0 and then we say add and then we
say done so this are the two initial
conditions that we need to solve this o
de now if I go solve numerically here on
the left hand side you see the different
solvers and maple always pick up the
appropriate solver depending on what
type of differential equation we're
trying to solve I have to provide to
provide the value for time so if I say
at time T equals 5 and I click solve
maple will give me X and X Prime at time
T equals 5 I can also create a plot
another part will plot the solution of
that differential equation which I can
then return to my worksheet I can also
return the numeric procedure that
generates the solution or I can return
the maple commands that will generate
the solution as well if I click quit now
we have a solution there so the next
thing i want to show is you know
important data into maple so if i use
the tools assistance we have a lot of
assistance again that would allow you to
do things without having to know
anything about the commands with the
syntax so we have a curve fitting we
have data analysis import data so this
is the 1 i'm going to use here so you
can see the the file formats we can
import excel files matlab files audio
files image files and so on going to
select Excel
and going to look for an excel file in
my maple folder
next and then we say done so this will
import the data so we have 25 thousand
pairs of points again the
context-sensitive menu will allow me to
visualize this again just by
right-clicking on the data there and
then we go plots and then we have the
plot builder and again the plot build is
an assistant that will allow me to
create different types of plots and then
we say plot so maple we plot the data so
that's the data there if I want to
manipulate the data will change things
into this again using the contact system
menu right click and then we have we can
go symbols and then we choose points
right click we can choose to change the
color say red for instance we can also
use the drawing tools here so we can add
text for annotation purposes so we can
annotate the plot so we say to the point
plot example
we can also attack instead of math we
can also use mathematics for annotation
purposes so if we want to add let's say
PI there okay again from 1 to N and then
we have it's a 1 plus K squared we can
also use can highlight areas in the plot
so this was a demonstration of important
dates and visualizing data again without
having to use a single command it's all
done using the assistance and the
contact sensitive menu
the next example i'm going to show you
is a two 3d animation so we're going to
define an expression here so x + r x y
and x the exponential of minus x squared
plus y squared
now again if I right click on this again
we have the context-sensitive menu and
then we have the plots and we go to the
plot builder and here I'm going to
select animation so it's a 3d plot here
the x and y are the x-axis and the
y-axis we can set the ranges we go from
one minus one minus 1.5 to 1.5 and then
the same thing with y &amp;amp; R will make it
go from 1 to 10 if i click on plot maple
generated animation
again we can right click there we can
make changes style surface without the
wireframe we can add a lighting scheme
and we can play the animation here so
you can see the animation we can also
rotate this in real time drizzy just
using the mouse and you can also export
this in different formats a bitmap gif
jpg and so on
I said there was going to do a symbolic
differential equation which I didn't
I'll do that right now so we're going to
define a differential equation set M
times y double prime of T plus B times y
prime of T and then plus K times y of T
and this is equals to let's say alpha
times cosine of Omega times T and then
plus say beta
so this is a differential equation the
initial conditions we just do y of 0 is
0 and y prime of 0 is also let me make
this 3 so these are my initial
conditions now to solve this
differential equation all i have to do
you know even if you have to use the
command it's very simple just do
dissolve and we solve in the eau de tu
with the given conditions and we're
solving for y of t and this will give me
the solution in terms of all the
parameters of my system so you've got
the a be the alpha beta and omega m and
so on so we have the solution there and
now what we could do could now let me
show you something cool here I'm going
to assign that solution
now i could if i type Y of T here if I
right click on it again using the
contacts of sensitive menu we can
convert this into any of the languages
that we have there c java fortran visual
basic and matlab's if i do see we
convert that into a c code that we can
then use in some other applications
maple does have a number of packages and
these packages are libraries for the win
things like you know if you doing
statistics or linear algebra I'll just
do with statistics this will load the
statistics package which means it loads
the the functions in that package and
there are large number of functions that
we have in the statistics packages you
can see there there are about 35
different distributions there are a
number of statistics plots can generate
random numbers weekend all kinds of
things so let me just do a quick example
here if I define X as a random variable
we use a normal distribution here then
we take one and 0.5
I'm going to create a sample of that so
if i do sample X and let's say we take
hundred thousand samples press enter
that's my data there again if I right
click here now we have statistics in the
context sensitive menu and then we can
do all kinds of visualization we can
create bar charts and histograms and the
summary we have quantities like a
geometric mean standard deviation the
mean and so on so let's do a histogram
and that's the histogram that which we
can edit I can change the color I can
change the bin width there I click
update when i click on quit then maple
will return the histogram for me there
so there are a lot of functionality in
the statistic package we have a number
of a bond tools there is a dar mentioned
how many people use maple us how many
people use matlab and simulink are quite
large large number of hands we do have
tools that will allow you to do your
mathematical modeling in in maple and
then you can convert all that stuff into
a sea into a mess function or a simulink
block that you can simulate in a
simulink environment we also have block
importer that will allow you to bring in
simulink models and then convert them
convert them into mathematics and you
can simplify the model then you can send
it back as a simulink block for better
performance so what I'll do but before
that any any questions so far
yes
okay we get that question do you wanna
okay the question is how do we differ
from mathematica is that um mathematic
has historically been our number one
competitor specifically in the academic
space we feel that the work that we've
put into the interface of maple to make
it extremely easy to use the 2d editor
the Mohammed showed the assistance the
tutors built into the software tool make
it immensely easier to use than that of
Mathematica we feel that the power
between the two systems is somewhat
comparable but we feel that for
engineers and scientists we do reach out
to other software tools like that of
MATLAB Simulink for connectivity in
there in an engineer's tool chain so we
feel that from a connectivity standpoint
we feel that maple is a much better tool
than that of Mathematica and as well
from an ease of you standpoint we also
feel that maple is superior in the past
as well mathematica is not a very open
system to allow access to view the code
inside of Mathematica ninety-five
percent of maple has always been open
and still is so if you wanted to see the
coding that goes into the four thousand
functions that are physically a part of
the math libraries you can go in and
actually view the code the actual code
itself any other questions before we
continue yes
the question was what about intellectual
property if the code is open there is a
subset of maple that is protected that
we do not allow access to too readily to
users we feel that it is important to
open up the math libraries to allow
people to verify the results and that's
really why it's there maple does own the
IP to the system and we don't feel that
there are any any holes there that are
opening us opening us up in any in any
insufficient way anything else okay
we'll continue
hey thank you
okay since there was a question about
the maple open environment me just show
you a simple example how you can view
the code of some of the functions so if
I
okay there are a number of functions in
maple obviously so there is one it's
called is prime which checks with
whether a number is prime or not if I do
is prime 2717 so it's true so if I want
to view the code of the is prime
function what I'll do here is print his
prime and actually the code is written
in the maple language so maple does our
programming language that we can use to
write code so this is the code that we
use for the is prime function so there
are number of functions that you can
view about ninety percent of the maple
commands are written in the maple
language and they can be viewed you can
also modify them you can make changes
and then you can save them you can also
create your own libraries based on what
we have in maple
now using maple programming language
again is very easier just do a simple
example here just for if I do the name
of the program is going to be Prague and
then we say proc is that is a keyword
that starts a procedure in maple then we
say n1 and one is going to be an integer
we don't have to specify what data type
is Bettina sometimes we can do that
yes
thank you I was going to the same thing
here and injure and then I'm going to
define some local variables so we define
say m i J as local variables and then
we're going to use the for loop so we
say for i from 1 to N one do and then
for jay from 1 to N to do so what we're
going to do is create a matrix so am i
just put its I plus J and then what we
do is and we need to end the first do
and then and the second and in the
second loop and then we end a procedure
so this is a maple program we use in two
for loops we could also use like if
statements and all kinds of and then
here we can run the program by so Prague
if we do three comma four oh forgot
something here what we want to return is
the matrix M so the matrix so n1 comma n
2 and then M oops forgot to close this
and then we have our matrix day if we do
something bigger
we have a 30 x 40 matrix a if I
double-click I can see all the entries
of my matrix
ok the next thing I'm going to do here
is to show you block building block
imports as I mentioned the block builder
is a tool that will allow you to convert
mathematical models into simulink so if
I do with block builder this will oops
okay that's my block builder and these
are the commands in the in the package
and if i do ? block builder this will
open up the help page and these are the
commands that are built in the package
so block about that mean as it says
their exports a dynamic system to
simulink so first we have to create what
we call a system objects and a system
object could be a system of differential
equations it could be a transfer
functions it could be state space
matrices and then we can generate the
code which is an S function that could
be a see code or MATLAB code and then we
can do manipulations like in a the
characteristic polynomial gain margins
Grammy ins and so on if I get to an
example
so here we have a number of examples
there so I'll just go to the mobile
robot there so this is a system that was
modeled in maple and outside was modeled
in maple and testing was working fine
then we wanted to convert that into a
simulink block so so initialization here
it just means that you load all the the
libraries system definition so we have
the parameters and we have all the
variables in table form so here we have
the robot chasis radius and the moment
of inertia the mass the wheels the
moment of inertia the DC motor
resistance and inductance and then we
have the variable definitions what each
variable means so X tyt means the the
robot positions the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates and
then here we have the the model and the
model is just a system of differential
equations that we need to solve so this
are
so defined in the system what we have to
do is assign give the the initial
conditions and also the the number of
parameters there that we have to give
them values and then with the simulation
so with the input is given by this
piecewise function here and then we're
going to view the output by solving the
system of hoodies so this is the robot
head in this is the XY positions of the
robot so this is the simulation of what
we do is run this animation here that
will show how the robot moves along the
trajectory that we have there and then
we do the exports a simulink and this is
the last piece which will convert all
that into a simulink diagram here we
have the two inputs and we have five
outputs and we have different states we
can also view the parameters the
resistor the mass the moment of inertia
and so on these are the values we can
also change this mask labels if you want
to and now if I go generates this will
generate the code I can't preview the
code so this is a code that's generated
automatically
and now we're going to build the block
this will open up matlab and simulink
okay that's my type
yes sure okay yeah okay try hard I twice
harder than optimize together we have
three options there is the know when
what we use in here behind the scenes is
the code generation of maple and it has
the option to add the optimization so
you get an optimized code the difference
between optimized or try hard i mean i'm
not entirely sure but it's it does i
think he did it gives you a better code
i think but i'm not entirely sure what
trihard means we had that question this
morning I just didn't I wasn't expecting
it to be honest so this is the the robot
for the the block that we just created
using block builder if we double click
here again we have all the parameters
there now if I apply an input so we just
take I mean we could take a sine wave or
a step just take a step here
okay we apply the first inputs i'm going
to use a second step input
and we're going to use scope
so I'm just going to use two scopes just
for x and y now if i run the simulation
it's done so this is my x position there
and this will be the y position
so this is you know uncontrolled outputs
then we could apply a PID controller so
we can control the output so we can get
the Apple that we we want so this is a
block builder is that blocking pasa does
the the inverse a gives you like a
simulink model and it converts it into
equations that we can simplify and
reduce the number of equations a lot of
redundant equations and then give you a
better code for that one last thing that
I'm going to demonstrate here is
optimization maple does have
optimizations optimization functions we
have the optimizing which is a built-in
optimizer and this is basically it does
local optimizations does LP solve there
is the least square solve there is the
maximized minimize nonlinear programming
solvent that quadratic programming solve
we also have a global optimization tool
box that's an album that would allow you
to do global optimizations so this you
have an objective function and you have
a number of constraints and you have
bounds and you want to find the optimal
solution than maple will allow it
definitely to to do that in some cases
you have test data you have inputs
outputs and then you have a model that
you want sometimes called parameter
identification so based on the test they
say want to find the values of different
parameters that will give you the best
or will fit that data think I have an
example here instead of me creating work
from scratch I'll show you one
so we have global optimization and this
actually was done by I can play so we
have here we have so this is the test
data so we read the data and then we
plus it and that's what we have there
and then the model function is given by
this expression here as you can see it's
nonlinear where what we need to find is
the a b c d and the k and those have
some real significance this is actually
an aspherical lens so here we
substituted are about this value so this
is the model function that we have we
have the intervals for the different
value for the different promises we have
a between minus 0.001 and 0.001 same
thing with b c d and k is between minus
1 and 1 so the objective function will
be the sum of the least squares between
the actual value and the calculated
value and then we'll run the global
solve command and this will find the
values for ABC and D and K and what we
do is plug them in the solution in the
in the equation that we started with and
then we create the plot so this is what
we have here and if we plot the two
together
you see that we have two curves one on
top of the other
and then we verify the results here
so the regression coefficients we have a
b c and d and then we look at the the
error say it's in the region of 10 to
the minus 6 so the results are very very
good
so this was the global optimization you
can also use the optimization assistant
so if we go optimization this will allow
me to define an objective function by
clicking on the edit button there so I
can type in an expression there you
could have as many variables as you want
we can add the constraints so we can add
constraints you could have as many as
you want again and we can add all the
bounds so the way the intervals of those
parameters and then here we have you can
see these are the local solvers with the
local optimizers and this is the global
one and the global one does have
different options there is bench and
boundaries multistart single start and
we can choose whether to minimize or
maximize and once you enter all the
information you just click on solving
the maple will solve and it gives you
the optimal value as well as the values
for the different parameters that you
need how we doing for time and we show
how about ten minutes any questions okay
yes sure okay okay
somewhere in these packages so I was
like okay how I find stuff okay good the
question is how to find built-in
functions in in Maple yeah that's that's
very easy what you do is remember I did
the question mark for help so if you do
? you looking for functions side
functions you want an index coma index
and then press ENTER and the maple open
the help page and all the functions that
are built on the software with the
hyperlink so you can click on the
function name and then maple we give it
a help page on the function so add if I
click there I'll have the help page on
the ad and how it works with all the
options and usually at the end of the
help page there is a number of examples
that you can copy and paste it shows you
how to use the add function
well in here I just did function index
and he gave me a list of all the
built-in functions so okay what's the
second question
ok
geez well
and
nice
the necessary
okay okay so the question is how to is
their built-in functionality that
William will minimize the number of
operations let me so when you for
instance simplify of factor wise
whatever you just want to reduce the
amount of computations that will that's
a good question i don't know the answer
to that but it's something that we can
definitely get back to you on line tight
leash or if there is a built-in function
that you can say okay go and minimize
the number of operations I've seen
something that's probably when the
optimization comes in but that's
definitely with code generation so if he
but I mean I'm not going to go into this
as I don't know the exact answer to that
and we can definitely get back to you
what version for maple are using a
version 10 is a recently it's a recent
release it's just the previous release
it'll be six yeah six is quite old
yeah I have seen an example where you
get a summary of all the operations you
know how many multiplications how many
additions and so on and there was
something that reduces the number of
operations but I'm not entirely sure
what it was I think it's to do with the
code generation and the optimizer that
is built in maple that does that okay
any other questions yes
yep
why sorry could you repeat to do man
good okay so you have people like nikala
gist stick uhler branches science yeah
and then have to do a whole bunch of a
cat at mathematics or in order to prove
their work okay um do you have
assistance or help or something in there
or allowing them to know what to use to
do the map they need to do
okay the question is from the gentleman
there is a what he's seen so far is good
for mathematicians but it's not good for
people who don't know math is there
anything in the salsa that can help them
okay okay what you know using maple
maple is a sudden it's widely used by
engineers as well as mathematicians and
scientists and it it does mathematics
but you mean what you need to do is for
instance you have a I I give examples of
like a differential equations the
mathematicians know how to solve this
differential equations people who are
not mathematicians wouldn't know how to
solve a differential equation so what
the maple does you give it the
information and it'll go and do the math
for you you don't have to do any
mathematics when using maple maple does
all that I mean if you're looking for
tools that will allow you to like you
want to create a system you know use
block diagrams and connect them and then
get your equations then maypole dance
have a number of options there is a tool
called Dinah flex pro so what you do we
don't have to do any mathematics you
start with a system let's say you have a
spring mass damper so what you do using
what we call a model builder so you have
your ground and you have your spring
mass spring damper and then you have the
mass you just make the connection you
know bring block which is the the mass
and then the joints which is the spring
and the damping and then maple will
translate all that into mathematics for
you and we've coming up with another
tool called maples same it's in
development and again it's very it's for
none for engineers I don't need to worry
about the mathematics so they have a
system they can create it using
components now I bring a resistor
capacitor spring damping coefficient
make the connections and then run the
simulation and they get the results and
I don't have to worry about a math
any other questions so it does run on
Linux it does run on UNIX it does run on
max windows so it's a multi-platform so
you can run it on different platforms
it's not just windows
okay so since we have a bit more time so
what I'm going to do here just show you
the another ad on which is blocking
Porter is that okay what okay so what
we'll do here might have this open
this is an f-14 model so I'm just going
to run through it so here we load the
the two libraries the blocking ports on
block builder so what we do here is the
import the f-14 model so what this will
do it'll earn I mean just run this one
more time
so we'll have simulink with the f-14
model run the simulation here and then
we get our results so I've done here
this is the simulink so we import it
into maple using the import command and
then you would print the summer of the
model so we have ninety two equations
there's a lot lot of equations we have
ten state variables we have two inputs
to outputs and 19 different parameters
so we use a simplified model which is a
commanding maple that simplifies the
model so we went from 92 equations to 12
equations so i get rid of 80 equations
the promises are the same the inputs are
the same the apples are the same and
then we do the simulation by solving the
system of for DES and then we got the
the response as you can see if you look
at that and you compare it to this one
here so you can see they are similar so
this is the result that we obtained in
maple and this is the result in simulink
then we do the analysis here so we can
do the both plots we plot the phase and
the game and we also plot the the poles
on the zeros and the sub response when
we apply an input to our system
and then here we have the gain margins
so again you know once you simplify the
model then you can send it back to
simulink and then you can run it in a
simulink environment okay I'm gonna stop
here and then we can use whatever time
is left for any questions yeah or if you
need further information we have
information back here that you can take
a it has all the information about maple
and all the add-ons that we talked about
again thank you very much thanks for the
time at thanks for the opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
