masood missoni from google and he'll
tell us about in homogeneous control of
quantum phase transitions thank you so
sorry for technical difficulties this is
that the room has been renovated this is
the first event after renovation so so
this session is supposed to be on
various in homogeneous protocols to
navigate through first and second order
phase transitions you already had two
talks from D vague that addressing this
issue for first order phase transition
I'm going to discuss how we can engineer
a non-trivial in homogeneous pass to
basically navigate to a second order
phase transition and minimize the
density of defects this is a work done
in collaboration with mark grams and
Adolfo del Campo with Adolfo using these
audience so I'm going to go through a
quick author a description of the talk
i'm going to start with the motivation
and then introduce keyboards drug
metabolism for people who have no
background then i discuss how we can go
beyond Cuba's direct mechanism the idea
is that can be beat that limit or a
prediction by Cuba's right and that's
kind of the idea general engineering in
homogeneous second order phase
transitions and then I discussed that
actually you get a new class of
universality which is universality of
critical phones and conclude with
possible application to approximate
optimization so the goal is to design a
protocol that is not necessarily care to
get a ground state for and either but to
stay in a low energy sector so basically
there are issues with trying to solve
there like a new problem hammacher and
get the ground state is that first it's
very hard for hard problem and the
second is actually not needed for many
application machine learning knowing the
ground state is actually not good you
know if you want to apply machine in
optimization for machine learning if you
get the ground is that most of the time
you're actually doing / feeling so it's
not a good idea so the idea is like
how we can engineer a control field that
can be constructed in inhomogeneous in
time and space such that it allows you
to open up a gap between laura g sector
and the higher excited estate so i
quickly go over a brief review of
quantum phase transitions so this is a
phase diagram with as a two parameter GN
t is the temperature geez your control
parameter and usually you can change it
you can consider this is the coefficient
associated with the transverse field and
the second term is your problem
Hamiltonian and you come from a very
large value of G's all the way down and
that certain value of GC we had a phase
transition and this is a here in this
fact we are going to consider only the
zero temperature limit vadim at the last
talk in this session is going to address
a finite temperature effects and
environmental effect for a spin chain so
the the issue is this the the core of
the idea is related to the physical
property of quantum system at a critical
quantum critical point so we can
introduce this a new parameter epsilon
set dimensionless parameter that gives
you the distance to the critical point
so yeah remember igc we had to write the
system experience a second order phase
transition show you introduce g- GC and
normalize it the thing is that if you
come from a large value of g and as we
approach to the value of GC the epsilon
goes to zero and this this is correspond
to kind of an impulse regime between to
adiabatic evolution so basically a start
adiabatically following the dynamics but
then suddenly things changing and you
know the system ax stops responding and
you have this kind of phase transition
and what it means is that the gap is
vanishing and the correlation length is
blowing up and this is with two
different critical exponent which is
near zia new the idea is that that led
to the Kimura lock mechanism is hot well
what happened actually near critical
point and the vicinity not that exactly
a critical
the idea is that for any finite time
quench time you are not going to ever
actually experience what you believe
that happens at critical point because
the system is going to freeze well like
just before you get to the critical
point so this is just keep Osric
mechanism in one slide and that just
it's very simple idea of a
phenomenological basically theory with
two assumptions the first assumption is
that the term that can response that the
system can respond ideologically it's
one over yoga and that's kind of very
decent assumption the second one is
saying that the the value of the epsilon
you can expand it linear over time with
the coefficient which is one over the
coin straight and and this is these are
that's all and all you need to do to
from to have a replace T from this vast
expression to the second one and just
solve it for epsilon and then you get an
expression for epsilon as a function of
Tokyo and so the total is your you know
annealing time or your quince tree and
you can solve this for Chi and get
something that is known as the Kiva's
director emerge the freezer time in the
impulse regime and it again it's a
function of torque you you can use the
value for the epsilon and find the
correlation length which gives you this
expression and the inverse of
convolution is your density of defects
which is this exponent is the dimension
of the system and this theory has been
pretty successful both experimentally
and theoretically for one you can the
exact solution and see that you get this
relationship which is within a pre
factor completely consistent with the
prediction of Cuba 0 so the core idea i
want to emphasize here is that the idea
is that just before you get to this kind
of quantum critical point you never
approach you actually never get to the
point just before that you go to excited
states you have a finite number of
defects and finite range of correlation
and that's the state that you leave
after this quantum critical point is
exactly what you freeze out before that
region so you start adiabatic evolution
so here you start the adiabatic
evolution
this excited states that you left when
entering to that regime so for a quantum
izing model you can write this
hamiltonian this is for colonizing model
this is the simplest possible system you
can see this like a phase transition and
there are two different organs like a
paramagnetic or at the symmetric phase
and the order phase and you go through a
phase transition with any rate of finite
crunch for this kind of system that mo
dynamic limits out there goblets
basically at any finite time you have a
possibility of defects or kings so the
idea that I think inspired my work and
this is that how we can improve this
performance you know basically reducing
the excitations or topological defects
by driving in the system in a
non-trivial way using the different
paths so there have been some works on
using various pass for annealing but all
of them are based on some random you
know initialization of some Hamiltonian
intermediate Hamiltonian so this is I
think delta minus the first constructive
way of using a non-trivial Hamiltonian
basically a programmable approach to
anything so i should mention that the
idea of inhomogeneous cubed zurich has
been applied to system in absence of
disorder this is the first time that we
applied it to disorder system so you can
consider a like a spin chain you know
that is sitting spins from 1 to m and
here it's a schematic verb like the
simplest possible inhomogeneous the
schedule is that here there's been one
two three already experienced phase
transition it's been four and five are
in the middle of you know simultaneously
experiencing phase transition and spin
six seven eight have no clue what's
happened as far as they're concerned
nothing happened so this is in contrast
homogeneous schedule that you thought
from GI like this dash line which is
uniform everywhere and you just calm
down and at GC this dash line you get a
phase transition everywhere and so I
argue that that's generally speaking
suboptimal for almost every cases so
there is a nonzero value of slope which
is this alpha that is optimal schedule
so you can do a smooth this profile with
this function and for a small alpha you
can just consider it linearly related to
act like an N and T so and this is
you're basically epsilon the parameters
that describes the critical point and it
means that for if the N the location of
a spin is where like at any given time
is equal to VT it's 0 so you have phase
transition so you have faced transition
in a space at various time at so this is
a spacetime separated even so for and
much smaller than VT these are the
things that already in the order phase
already experienced phase transition in
the spins that are very over there on
the right hand side and larger much
larger than VT already like you know
that the system is still in the same
electric razor has no clue but it's
interesting that just a little bit in
front of the disk critical from there is
a penetration depth so the spins are a
little bit in front of the critical for
get inside of what happened in the
broken symmetry phase because if you'd
recognize this Hamiltonian you had a
kind of free non-interacting quasi
particle ferry quasiparticles and there
was actually moving so if you you move
the critical front smaller than the
velocity group velocity of those
particles you get longer range of
correlation that's the core idea so so
to see this better are considered fixed
spin in the chain and then you can write
this epsilon in this form which is like
that this is the coefficient of T
remember it's just a cure inverse of Qin
straight so then here the global
annealing turn becomes related to this
kind of in Hell in homogeneous parameter
this new like many body parameters alpha
v and so the idea is that if your speed
of this critical front much larger than
the group velocity basically you are in
homogeneous regime in homogeneous regime
your alpha is 0 the slope is 0 and your
velocity is infinity to get a finite
country but if you go a smaller than
group velocity you get a new physics
basically you get longer range
correlation so and this might be a dick
you know you get this impression that
this is the necessary and sufficient
condition but that's
not true so there is actually a speed
that is a slower and it's a related to
the you know kind of Cuba Zurich
understanding of a different speed scale
that information can transfer them is a
slower so to see that you know you can
define it the velocity of the
information transfer as like dividing
correlation lens over time so the
correlation lens is like the Cuban
circulation lens that describe how much
coalition happen time is give electron
these are like lenses scale and time a
scale that things happen in a keyboard
right ward ok so you divided you get
crib attract velocity and this velocity
you can plug in the relation for like a
standard cubic and then use this
expression for inhomogeneous version and
you get an expression as for velocity as
a function of Apple so with the control
parameter you can change the speed of
information so you controlling em
anybody system with their like a
effectively beam anybody parameter so
it's not that based on a microscopic
degrees of freedom and for Z this is
critical critical exponent if it is
larger than one you get non-trivial
effects that we can be increased by
alpha and more interestingly you can
look at it at another perspective is
that you can actually effectively are
introducing a gap for a system that is
gapless so basically by putting the
Delta as the expression that you have in
Cuba's Rick and just plug in epsilon and
the relationship that talk to you has
with the Alpha you get an effective gap
expression so based on this expression
you would say oh that's great I just
increase the Alpha and you just open up
gap as much as I want but that's not
really the case because there is another
like Panther that you have to take care
of its the diffusion else into the
symmetric faith and this is because um
you know there is a finite penetration
depth into that phase basically this is
given by effective kinetic mechanism
which is there related to this effective
gap that I introduced and so in a way if
you choose alpha too big you get a good
gap but you have like very small
penetration for the trivial case of an
inhomogeneous protocol
that you just to want to see another
down update on a linear chain and that's
just an inhomogeneous a schedule but
it's a trivial one because the
penetration depth is just want to spin
so you know you cannot capture a
non-trivial correlation and that's of
optimal and the add 40 which is you put
all these things at the phase transition
is suboptimal too because basically
because you get bounded by the global
gap so now this is opens up a
possibility of a different gap not that
the gap of the many-body physics by the
an effective imagine gap but you know
one good thing about this system is that
you can just exactly diagonal eyes and a
numeric least Elliott as well so this is
a plot of residual energy as a function
of the velocity and you see for large
enough velocity basically you're in
homogeneous regime and you see that this
residual energy pretty substantial and
we can go to basically 67 order of
magnitude a smaller residual energy by
going to a smaller velocity and it's
interesting that for different disorder
that the amount that you can drop their
that suppress the defects is different
so and this is like a homogeneous
schedule is completely blind to this and
I thought this is pretty fascinating so
this is like a becomes a probe into
seeing a different degrees of complexity
that is hidden by a homogeneous schedule
so we did the landis give a study of
this you know basically looking at
residual energy as a function of
velocity and alpha and you can see
they're monotonically for a smaller
velocity you get better performance so
these are for different time scale so
here actually the trimet scalar
associated with the units of j 1 h bar 1
so this is an interesting feature is
that for ad for you see this deep
there's an optimal for a longer time I
scope which is really gets you to
extremely low energy sectors and if you
compare it with the value of alpha 0
which is here and alpha like a round-3
that is one singular spin update you get
35 order of magnitude improvement so but
we have like a phenomenological theory
to understand what's going on so
basically
drive like a different condition like a
base similar to like a divided bacterium
you can define like a crazy idea by the
condition is that instead of saying that
what's the maximum velocity that I can
go through like a second order phase
transition for a system that is has a
small gap here you can go saying what is
the maximum velocity that I can go to
get the maximum to have like the maximum
correlation length and this is related
to a gap like a square away a local gas
instead of the global yeah and here the
derivative of the Hamiltonians as a
function of with respect to the
parameter a position parameter of a spin
in the where that actually at that
particular time is experiencing the
phase transition that's basically the
center of that wave front so this is I
think the most interesting properties is
that that you can see a universality for
the shape of the critical France if you
plot various distributions of various
different like instances of disorder
spin so each plot here is the 1001
million points for 1000 different the
solar system each one you get 1000
different sample and you see that here
they have four different value of alpha
they just sit on top of each other and
so it's independent of the shape of
their alpha so you have this universal
property you can compare this with this
expression that is a and the same
Universal to class based on that a
strong disorder renormalization group
techniques that you can see this kind of
imagined universality parameter and here
instead of n you have an effective blend
scale for the system so basically you
engineer that they are universally class
by it engineering the your effective
length of scale I think this is pretty
interesting and the gap is not the
global gaps the local gap of the system
so and so if you look at the complexity
of this algorithm so this is the time
complexity as a function of the inverse
three residual energy
it's all you know normalized because we
are looking at the various different
sizes so if you saw it at the very large
value in the horizontal axis you get the
ground state and for a very small value
we have maximum arrow you see that for
the homogeneous algorithm discos like
exponentially so that to get to a lower
and lower energy sectors you have to try
it exponentially for for an
inhomogeneous protocol this is more
fancy version of the inhomogeneous
protocol that I didn't mention it there
is no time to go into that depth that
you get basically a polynomial scaling
and this is I think the most interesting
one to look at this data it's this is a
few sample from like a linear chain of
like 1000 spins and you know you have a
strong disorder so JS values or anywhere
between 0 &amp;amp; 2 this is equivalent to
minus 1 to 14 a 1d system you see that
for homogeneous schedule you see there
are this is a property distribution of
defects and they are just sitting at
various places randomly under a lot of
them but in this kind of in homogeneous
schedule you see that it's being very
cleaned up so you have very less errors
and the arrows the most interesting part
is that the errors are sitting at on the
weakest possible link so for thousands
of these arrows you get the same kind of
penalty in their energy as one of these
errors here where it corresponds to a
big j IJ so this is a very low costing
so basically sweeping the defects from
where they are very costly and dumping
them into the sink of where that like
judges are very weak so you pay a
smaller penalty so we of course you know
you might ask you so how about higher
dimension so we did some disciplinary
result of simulations of quantum Monte
Carlo simulation that actually
segregated on ten thousand cubits so
these are islands of 50 by 50 disorder
ferromagnets separated by spinning a
glass border a very big click glassy
water and you see that here the quantum
of color simulation shows for this is
the x-axis is like various different
islands of this kind of ferromagnetic
islands
and you see the median residual energy
and there are up to 200 magnitude
improvement with this strategy over a
homogeneous one so homogeneous is this
red one and you see that a different
alpha 4 in homogeneous it's very low and
of course you know we tried for more
realistic that was like a contrived
example for more realistic like a glassy
disorder strongly disorder strongly
classy to the cases and you see that
desired result for the two different
instances and you see that there is
always an advert that is a non zero
alpha which is optimal basically and so
basically alpha 0 the slope of
homogeneity when you approach their
standard adiabatic quantum computing it
looks a suboptimal for this you have to
do a little bit of pre-processing which
is located like a some cluster finding
algorithm which is like it could be n
log n available in the number of qubits
so basically this is the conclusion of
this you know work you can consider the
possibility of that having we have a new
class of algorithm that are in
homogeneous in space and time and you
can drive the system quite a
dramatically over a second order phase
transition and there is an optimal shape
for the critical point a critical front
and the lenses scale of in homogeneity
leads to an effective size of system
which has universality and residual
energy can be minimized by several other
magnitudes and so this is obviously has
application to approximate canto
optimization thank
I can thank you for stock I can see how
this would work for when you are trying
to solve a homogeneous like a
ferromagnetic problem because one corner
can guide the rest of the problem in the
right solution but if you want to solve
complex problems like your spring
classes if you start from one corner and
let that corner go out the rest of the
problem you may not get to the right
solution how do you do that so so
basically this is the result I show this
is a glassy this is the day you know
these r minus 1 this instance that I
have up here this is minus 1 to 1 by get
one and any value between minus 1 to 1
not only those two value so and it's
it's a strongly disorder is strongly
glassy and it's still it performs better
the only things you have to have is that
you have finite correlation lines if
your coalition should you are in that
you have an underlying assumption in
your question you are saying that if the
correlation lens is equivalent to the
size of input how do you get any
advantage you don't so basically
involves cases of np-hard like this is
not going to prove provide any speed of
over homogeneous so I as you improve
approach like very large correlation
length but if you're afraid correlation
length is finite as you increase the
size of system this this this algorithm
plays the dominating role because
basically tells you this is related to
the area line you know in physics is
that basically saying that all the
information related to these boundaries
even for a hypercube so all everything
you need to know about the system is key
can be captured or what a finite
correlation length so then you drive it
visible I can like a babe and you just
prop again and you get maximum you can
actually recover the ground state like
that basically this algorithm allows you
to always to get the ground state with a
non zero alpha always so basically for
any degrees of complexity so as far as
the collation Lance is finite so back
because you can engineer your wavefront
to capture whatever correlation lens you
have so you need to like this is
the way we want to use it in that kind
of that actually this this idea led to
the quantum pattern playing algorithm
that you know hard to mention this
morning is any way that you can engineer
this within that kind of things by
looking at the replica looking at the
autocorrelation function you can see how
much Croatian you have and then plug it
in a virus in homogeneous it doesn't
depend on where you start because I can
as I can design a problem that the
corner you will start lead to the wrong
solution and then you try to align the
rest of the problems that soon yeah so
listen as I told you the core idea is
not to get the ground said you might get
the states that have various small
overlap with the ground state but there
are extremely in a low energy sector so
this goes to that you know i would say
that motivation of might you know this
this slide that yeah yeah you're right
this is a good question you're saying
that door I can see situation that
you're nowhere closely where instead
yeah you're right but there's still
energy is very low because you have very
few defects you know but these kind of
pieces of like that you know I spin
channel by guest wing configuration they
could have a completely different
overlap you know the orientation with
their ground state so the fidelity with
the ground said is a small I think this
is good enough all right let's thank my
suit once more
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
