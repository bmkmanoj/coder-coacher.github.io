web page if you have used Gmail or so
one of those services that Google
operates that required it log in before
you've you've seen this this is too ooh
awesome this is how this is our login
page and the way your 10 to get a google
is with with a password and this
password is sort of like like the key to
the kingdom line the thing that you type
in here gives you access whoever knows
that string right has access to your to
your email to your calendar to your
documents and so forth it turns out that
these passwords can get into the hands
of you know bad guys and there's a
variety of different ways this can
happen you could infect yourself with
malware neil's just give a couple talks
ago a few ideas up of how that might
happen you might become the victim of a
phishing attack where you involuntary
just give someone a password turns out
also users reuse passwords for different
sites so users who have a password and
use it for Google use the same password
at a different site and some of those
sites are better than others at
protecting the you know the secrecy of
these passwords some users have
passwords that can be a Bruce brute
forced or guest and then there's what
what we call the password anti-pattern
and for those who are not familiar with
this concept here's an example of it
this is a a page on on evite for those
who are not familiar with it is it's
actually an awesome site allows you to
schedule events that take place at a
certain time a certain place and you can
invite invite your friends and to make
it easier for you to schedule such an
event evite would like to know who your
friends are would like to have access to
your address book so so you don't have
to retype all the email addresses of all
the friends that you want to invite to
the party that you're throwing and so
the way they get access to your address
book
is they ask you for your AOL password
for your yahoo password for your help me
pass with your gmail password and the
list actually goes on there I cut it off
after a while and we don't like it for
for two reasons one is what the reason I
already mentioned some sides are better
than others that actually protecting
this information keeping this password
secrets not that evite is one of them
but but there might be sites out there
that that are not very careful with this
the other reason though is that if this
pattern were to become pervasive or
remains pervasive I guess I should say
on the Internet then we teach users that
it's okay to type there in this example
Google password for legitimate reasons
into other websites and we don't we
don't want that to happen so if
passwords can can leak in so many ways
then maybe we should try to get rid of
passwords so I want you to do for the
next 15 minutes or so is do a thought
experiment with me where we assume that
we buried passwords and we use a
different authentication mechanism to
authenticate to Google and let your
imagination run wild let's assume it's
something really secure I put one
example on here this is like a three
factor authentication and one of them is
a is a key that you have in a in a
temporary assistant module that we
require to all our users to having their
computers and we also in addition when
you authenticate do Google you have to
type a little number that you read off
one of those key fobs that some
manufacturers may and we require every
Google you should have one of those and
you have to also swipe your finger print
through a fingerprint reader that we
also require every user yet so something
like that imagine maybe your favorite a
proposal for more secure authentication
mechanism and so how are we faring with
with these sort of password leakage
channels if we did something like that
and it turns out it looks actually
pretty good right if if
one of the components are authentication
mechanisms is some key that sits in a
temporary system module that software
can't get to then malware presumably
wouldn't be able to extract that key if
I don't have a password anymore that I
that I that I type into Google to
authenticate then I can't fall for a
phishing scam because there's just
nothing for me to type there for for
similar reason if I don't if I don't
have a password to authenticate to
Google I can't reuse it at a different
at a different site if we move the task
of coming up with these with these keys
to some piece of software from from a
human to piece of software presumably
the software would be pretty good at
generating them in a way that they
couldn't be a brute force door guest and
for the same reason that the reuse of
passwords and other sites wouldn't work
the password anti-pattern where some
side asks me what is your google
password because i have legitimate
reasons to try to access your Google
account excuse me that wouldn't work
either but it turns out if we did that
we would make life of our users are
quite unpleasant they would break a lot
of things and here are some examples let
me try and go through of these through
some of these so up here is is a plug-in
into the the Mac aperture apple aperture
application which is a photo management
application and the there's a plugin
that exists for that application that
allows users to upload the photos to
picasa web which is google's a photo
hosting site and that plugin was not
written my apple it was not written by
google it was written by a third party
and it has built into it the assumption
that the way you authenticate to google
so the user name and with a password
similarly here's an instant messaging
client that can talk to a bunch of
different websites one which is google
and has built into it the assumption the
way i authenticate to google is with
username with a password now you know we
could maybe take the position say all
those off
were silly to make such an assumption
but sometimes you don't really have a
choice he is an example of an IMAP
client this is again the mac mail I
guess whatever the mail app that you get
on the Macintosh by default it's an IMAP
client has to implement the IMAP
protocol the IMAP protocol has built
into it the assumption the way you
authenticate to the servers with the
username and with a password so the
author he didn't really have much of a
choice similarly over here this is an
example of adding an exchange account to
to Android so we can run at the the
protocol layers active sync to get your
contact information calendar information
so forth and of course we would break
evite it would be much harder to throw
parties if we if we switched our
authentication mechanism because evite
would be so much harder to use so what
are we supposed to do right if we if we
do change our authentication mechanism
away from passwords well there's a
protocol called auth that third-party
applications can use as an alternative
to asking the user for their passwords
and it works something like this use
another site that you probably are
familiar with it's called Facebook and
it's a social network and they try to do
something very similar to what Eve I'd
was doing they would like to get access
to your address book so they know who
your friends are so the site becomes
more useful to you if you can connect to
your friend's Facebook provides a much
more interesting experience than if
you're there all by yourself but unlike
evite who is asking for your username
and password but they do instead is they
just put a little button on there it's
just click here to import your google
address book and then the next thing
that happens is you get armed redirected
to Google you you're now at google and
google says facebook would like to have
access to your address book is that okay
yes or no and then when you when you
press ok then the OAuth protocol makes
it so that Facebook ends up with a token
that they can use to access your Google
account and download your your address
book and this works not only for web
applications but also for installed apps
but there was a question the audience
down here it says google contacts that's
what we call the address book um sorry
the question was where does it say that
is asking for address book um so this
works for websites but it also works for
installed applications here's an example
of an application that's that's an email
client on the iPhone and instead of the
the app asking you for your google user
name and password it also runs this off
protocol and it pops up a web browser
and so remember we still in this thought
experiment right google is not asking
you for your password it's doing
something different so that presumably
the user does something somewhere
between this step and that step that's
not shown here there's something
different to authenticate to Google and
then says yes it's okay for this
application that i just installed on my
iphone to have access to my to my inbox
so um this is the way the protocol looks
they told us to try to deep dive into
some more technical meet this year but
then they told us we only have 20
minutes so I'm I'm not sure I can go
into too much detail here you might be
familiar with the protocol also the way
it works is that the the client gets a
request on so let's do the example this
is Facebook this is google and this is
the user that wants to import a google
address book into facebook so facebook
receives a request token then the user
visits google and says that they want to
approve this delegation and then
facebook goes and exchanges the request
token for an access token and then they
later use that access token to access to
access google now it turns out the first
version of auth that was published and I
was actually implemented by quite a few
companies
a bug in it that allowed a session
fixation attack that would allow a an
attacker in this case Bob to impersonate
a victim Alice to a client so to come
back to the example so it would be
possible for Bob to go to Facebook and
say I want to see my address book but
the information he would be shown would
actually be Alice's information and the
reason this work is because in the
original version of the of the protocol
the client and the server could be
confused in associating different
identities with the same access token
and part of the story I want to tell
here is that how this protocol got fixed
this happened about about a year ago and
the fact that it was an open protocol
had so many stakeholders I think was
actually a good thing because a lot of
people came together in a very short
period of time I want to see like within
a week or so we had you know in to shut
down servers we had to fix the spec we
have to implement the spec we have to
bring the service back up all within a
relatively short time frame and what now
most company are running companies are
running is is wroth version 1.0 a which
is certain fixes to this to this flaw
fast forward 12 months we're currently
working on earth version 2.0 which is
done within the ITF and earth to point
zero one thing that it tries to do just
as a different design is to instead of
having one flow that tries to address
different use cases both the installed
apps on your iphone use case and the web
application delegation to a web
application use case it splits it up
into different flows that are optimized
for each use case but each flow is
simpler than the then the OAuth one flow
was and there's some other some other
differences that if you're interested in
we have timely Q&amp;amp;A part of it so too
recap this part of the talk I asked you
to do a thought experiment with me where
we were assuming that Google drops
passwords tomorrow and replaces it with
some authentication mechanism that
doesn't involve passwords and what we
found was that we would have to move a
whole bunch of the internet away from
this assumption that the way you
authenticated Google is with the
username and password and we saw a
protocol Oh auth that is designed for
that for that purpose but one of the
points that I want to show you is that
you know there was a little bit of a
false start with this OAuth protocol the
very first version of it actually had a
pretty major flaw to it and as we're
developing the second version I invite
everybody in this audience to maybe
participate in the in the process of
standardizing this new version if you
guys work on you know protocol
verification or something like that
would be really nice if we had some real
results that say you know we have proven
certain properties of this protocol as
it's being standardized so if we move
everybody over from all these
third-party applications from asking for
passwords and move them over to auth now
users no longer have and there's no
longer an excuse for asking the user to
type their say google password into some
third-party applications so evite can
replace their page where they ask for
username and password with a page that
looks more like Facebook's page but then
evite itself probably still has I still
have a username and password to log into
evite itself right and so all the issues
that I brought up in the beginning about
passwords apply to that password as well
so one thing that we can do about that
is to use this other protocol called
open ID that can help getting rid of
passwords on third-party sides also and
you might have heard about this protocol
also it delivers an an assertion
identity assertion to a to what we call
a relying party so what happens is that
the relying party and the identity
biter so imagine evite and Google they
exchanged some key material in the
beginning and when the user goes to if i
can say i would like to log in the user
gets redirected to Google there they do
whatever they need to do to authenticate
of Google and then Google redirects them
back to Eve ID with essentially a signed
statement in the URL saying this is user
number 1 2 3 4 5 and then if I can can
take that information and login the user
it turns out that in practice these
relying parties want both they want open
ID because they don't want to worry
about running their own authentication
system it's a hassle and you can get
things wrong and then you use are
exposed and they want auth because they
want access to the users accounts at the
service provider where they coming from
they providing a service that's so much
more useful if they only knew who all
the users friends are if they only could
schedule appointments for the user
automatically and so forth so we needed
to combine these two protocols into one
protocol which we call the open idea
North hybrid and it's a little bit of an
of an ugly duckling in that it literally
just puts these two protocols together
it runs them in one flow but open ID for
example is designed to be very ad hoc
there's no prearrangement of keys and so
forth they all being exchanged before
and I on the other hand requires that
you register before and and you exchange
keys open Eddie has one signature method
or has another signature method so our
open idea North hybrid protocol has
always two different kinds of signature
methods for different types of methods
for different kinds of messages and so
forth so it's not it's not great so
there are sort of these a problem with
the protocol itself and then we have you
I issues that we're also currently
dealing with one of one of them is what
we call the NASCAR problem and if you
haven't heard of that this is Lady Gaga
calm and Lady Gaga calm has a as a login
button you can login to Lady Gaga Coco
my guess there's a user community or
some
like that and they have heard of open ID
so when you click the login button you
get a page that looks like this and when
you know when I gave these examples you
want to log in with your google account
and so forth of course the same holds
for the other service providers on the
internet right so you can log in with
your Facebook account with your myspace
account your google account your twitter
account your yahoo account your witness
account then there's a little arrow here
when you click on that then the next six
possible providers slide into view or
you can have a username and password on
the account so first of all this doesn't
scale as more providers come online what
this is you I supposed to look like and
second of all XD confuses users a hell
of a lot they don't really know what to
do when you stared at you I like this so
this is this is an open problem that
we're trying to figure out so summarize
I talked a little bit about ongoing work
in internet identity we're currently
working on earth to the new version of
auth we're pretty sure what it looks
like if you join the discussion groups
now you'll realize that this sort of
some just loose ends that we're trying
to tie up at this point the next version
of open open ID is much more open so to
speak we don't we don't quite know what
it'll look like there are some that call
for open ID v-necks to be just a thin
layer on top of roth to be that as it
may will will have to end up with some
sort of hybrid that gives you both open
ID which is an identity assertion and
earth which is access to users account
all in all in one protocol and then i
gave you some hint of that there are
some UX problems that are also currently
unsolved them and we're still working on
okay so train joins an entire i think is
my last slide tell them what you told
them so what the lemonade's need for
third-party apps to know users passwords
we went we went through that i explain a
little bit what open ID was about and I
reminder if you work on protocol
verification anything like that please
have a look at auth to tell us where
it's broken or prove to us that it's
okay
and so some of the ongoing work that
we're currently doing the new right so
the question was couldn't a bad guy even
though auth exists and all the good guys
are not using OAuth couldn't a bad guy
still ask for your password did I oh I
see so when I click on the facebook la
import my address book from google but
and i said that you're being redirected
to Google what have you not what if this
is in really Facebook and they're not
really redirecting me to google right so
right we do get this question a lot and
I don't claim that author open ID are a
solution to the fishing problem I think
the solution to the fishing problem
comes from how do i authenticate to my
service provider right so if it's not
really facebook and i click on the
button and they redirecting me to do
something that looks like google on that
and that page ask me for my password
right and i say what do you mean my
password i don't have a password right
that's I think how we how we should
solve this the fishing problem other
questions
well so it seems like one scalability
problem for this is that you may have
different types of information you may
as we heard you know last half hour
presentation you might have complicated
rules about what you want to share with
who maybe rules that you're not even
completely aware right so it seems like
um unless you know the Safari mechanism
has some sort of clearly fine way of
structuring right so the question is
with this oil flow where you get to
authorize delegation to a third party
how how do we make it so that the users
are really in control what it is that
they're authorizing access to am I
summarizing this correctly okay so
that's that's a very good question and
what we want this this authorization
page to be we want it to allow the user
to give what we call informed consent
right they need to understand what it is
that they're doing and it can sometimes
be a little overwhelming to read through
some of these authorization pages and
this is some of the UI work that we're
doing is to sort of change them every
now and then test them on users and to
make sure that they're really
understanding what it is that they're
that there that the delegating and it is
it is sort of a complicated question I
agree right ok so follow-up question is
well how does the user can use to see
what is being transferred so there is a
page at it under my account at Google
where gives you a summary of who has
access to your calendar and so forth we
don't show you exactly which pieces
they requested not not at that detail
but you will see that facebook has
access to your calendar and you can go
there and you can revoke it if you want
to this question so the question is
isn't that a benefit if people can have
different personas on the internet and
login to lady gaga with one of them that
is not necessarily linked to some of the
other stuff that's happening on the
internet and yeah people should
definitely be able to do that you can do
that by you no logging today Lady Gaga
with your Facebook account but logging
into evite with your google account or
having to Google accounts or maybe we'll
come up with the way to you know even
within one account maybe be able to have
different personas and when you see the
approval screen you could say I wanted
login is this person or that person or
something I I certainly think if if if
users find that useful we would we
should build it for them
so facebook tells you can only have one
account so facebook tells you can only
have one account I I can't comment on
their on their account creation policy I
don't know okay for those but yeah ok so
at Google you should be able to create
multiple accounts all right ok and I
think one more one more one more from
the back right so the is this are you
saying is this the same as passport
passport sets of our questions a
question that we also often ponder like
because passport is sort of like
well-known failure in the space right
they roll it out it was a protocol look
very much like something like open ID
but it really wasn't that successful and
shall be honest I'm not sure that we
know like the answer to the to the
question there might be several
components to it one is that it was
controlled by one entity that only work
with only work with Microsoft by the
advantage of the NASCAR UI is that you
can pick who you want to account you
want to login with right and that
relying parties maybe didn't like to be
tied 2121 service provider it might be
that it was maybe just an idea whose
time hasn't hadn't come yet i'm i'm not
entirely sure what all the problems were
with with with password we see quite a
bit of uptake on in terms of traffic and
sites that are all valid for open ID
these days okay thank you
