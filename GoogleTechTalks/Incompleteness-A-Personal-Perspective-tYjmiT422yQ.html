by Kristian calluna he's a professor at
the university of auckland he's a close
friend of gregory chaitin who as many of
you know came up with the concept of the
Omega number which is uncomputable
information and Christian with a student
of his computed 64 bits of this
uncomputable number and if you're if you
want the details of why that's not a
paradox you can talk to him afterward I
had the privilege of studying with him
did my master's thesis with him on the
relationship between incompleteness and
uncertainty but Christian has spent his
entire career researching and increasing
our understanding of the unknowable and
uncomputable so Christian clear thank
you thank you very much I'm delighted to
be today at Google and to talk about one
of my favorite subject which is girdle
incompleteness I am very happy to take
any questions during my presentation so
if you have anything to ask or you would
like to comment in any way just do it
okay so first I will start by saying
what I'm not going to talk about so I'm
not going to give you a full picture of
incompleteness this is a very very broad
picture so I will give you just a
glimpse a personal glimpse in which I
have contributed a little bit I'm not
going to report just discovered fatal
flaw in the proof which invalidates the
theorem there is no such such fatal flaw
and I'm not going to offer any cure for
incompleteness because again there is no
cure for incompleteness so I apologize
if I disappointed the audience
these are things we will not appear in
my presentation however I would say
something so what I'm going to talk
about is basically the following I will
very briefly say something about
classical incompleteness and I am going
to to ask and answer three main
questions whether there are any really
interesting example of examples of
Independence statements these are
statements which are true and unprovable
in specific theories the second one is
what is the source of incompleteness
what makes a sentence prone to be
unprovable in a given formal system and
finally how common is this phenomenon of
incompleteness is that just a linguistic
trick is just an accident or it is much
more than this so these are the
questions I am going to try to to
discuss and most results presented in in
what I'm going to talk about use
techniques from algorithmic information
theory which is a theory which tries to
measure the amount of information in
finance and infinite objects with an
algorithmic flavor so what kind of
questions we may ask in order to arrive
to incompleteness so I have written here
three such questions can we write a
program to check whether mathematical
proof is correct or not
can we write a program to generate all
mathematical theorems can we write a
program to check whether mathematical
sentence is or is not a theorem so these
are legitimate types of questions we may
hope that these questions will have a
positive answer and in order to make
sense
to answer such a question we have to
have a formal system an axiomatic system
in which we will be able to talk about
mathematical sentences mathematical true
sentences and mathematical provable
sentences which are theorems and if we
look at those questions we can easily
easily convince ourselves that if we fix
a formal theory it is not difficult to
to to imagine that there is a program to
check whether a sentence is or is not
provable by a given mathematical proof
and this is a requirement David Hilbert
put forward as an important criteria for
mathematics the possibility of having an
algorithmic method
something which does not require any
creativity anything you know no
innovation no Google thinking just pure
mathematical checking now can we write a
program to generate on mathematical
theorems well if the answer to the first
question is is yes then the answer to
the second one looks very probable to be
yes as well but what about the third one
can we write a program to check whether
mathematical sentence is a theorem or
not why this third question looks
different from the others well in the
first case you know I have a sentence I
have a proof and I check the correctness
this is you know something very straight
foot but here in the third question I
have to browse all possible candidates
of proofs and decide for each of them
whether that specific proof is a proof
for the sentence or not if I find one if
I'm lucky
that's perfect I know but what about the
situation was I don't find it after you
know 10 years or 100 years nothing can
be inferred from this always there is a
possibility that at the next stage proof
will come out which will prove my
sentence so this possibility of running
into an infinite search is the reason of
worry okay
now let's go back to 1930 and I will
read aside it David Hilbert who was at
this stage one of the greatest if not
the greatest mathematician pure
mathematician and he was thinking about
how to make mathematics you know solid
in foundation you know at that stage
mathematics was in in the in in the
front page not because of the results it
produced by because of the crisis of
foundations you know what is
mathematical truths how to prove how to
generate all mathematical theorems and
Hilbert Hilbert had this important radio
dressing in 1930 in which he basically
said there is no inner amables we must
know and we will know so this credo he
he you know challenged the whole world
of mathematicians was not only an
opinion a personal opinion but the
beginning of a program to have a
universal language and an Universal
construction formal construction for
mathematics but only days after in
königsberg you know when things go
wrong they go wrong very fast
so all it is after this famous hilbert
address a very young
Viennese could girdle 25 years old
present it in the same town in Canada
burg where you know the king goes
Hilbert to two important papers one was
a completeness of the predicate calculus
and the incompleteness of principia
mathematica so the first one the first
paper was not really appreciated by by
by the audience because everybody
believed it is true and what girder
produced was just a proof the second one
nobody understood with one notable
exception for no man
was the only one who immediately picked
up the idea and not only he understood
it but he immediately started thinking
and developed and he produced some
beautiful result which unfortunately for
for Neumann good already knew it so what
what what what girdle proved this is an
incompleteness theorem he proves this
important facts for every effectively
generated formal theory which includes
elementary arithmetic the theory cannot
be both consistent and complete
consistent here means free of
contradictions complete means that the
theory can prove any true statement
which can be formalized in the theory
and if you are not happy in by talking
about truths here I can offer you a
little bit more general statement here
which is a second form of incompleteness
which says that in any consistent
effectively generated formal theory
which includes elementary arithmetic
there exists and can be produced
effectively a sentence of arithmetic
which is neither provable no disprovable
we don't know which between these two
Oh sentences the sentences and its
negation is true and we don't care but
we know that both of them are unprovable
so the theory cannot basically decide
between them now let me give you
immediately two examples just to just to
realize that things are not - you know
just just pure blue sky sentences piano
rhythmatic which is a first-order theory
of natural numbers is incomplete or
inconsistent right either there is a
contradiction or there is a true
sentences of arithmetic which play an
arithmetic cannot prove sir mellow
Frankel with choice it's a much more
complicated mathematical formal system
is set theory which basically addresses
the whole mathematics this theory itself
is incomplete or inconsistent and what
about you know the powerful automatic
theorem provers and you have Isabelle
improve power and so on as they complete
and consistent it's an interesting
interesting question now let me before
go into some more technical details let
me explain some things which are again
examples illustrations of of of
incompleteness as I said arithmetic is
incomplete but in contrast elementary
geometry is complete so there is a
program you can write which decides for
any sentence in geometry whether this
sentence is provable or not
incompleteness as I said it's incurable
each time each time you find an
independent sentence it means a sentence
which is true and unprovable you can add
this sentence as an axiom to the formal
theory and what you get you get a more
powerful see
which proves everything the original
theory has proved but much more but this
new form in this new formals axiomatic
system is urine of sick of the same
disease there are other other sentences
which are true in unprovable in this
more powerful system and this is true
not only if I add one by one unprovable
sentences but if I had infinitely many
isin in algorithmic way or by tossing a
coin the result will be again and again
a theory which is incomplete and
incompleteness is a serious challenge to
help us program which sort of thought
that mathematics can be expressed in an
Universal way yes is the set of all true
statements is a meaning of course meant
and if we if you which if you OB have
one minute I will discuss exactly yes
sir
now when III don't say a theorem is true
so when I said III I am looking at the
true sentences if you wish to talk about
truth in this contest some of them will
be provable some are not provable but
every theorem proved in in in in the is
a formal system is a true sentence right
we'll be seeing this so if you could ask
you questions in the microphone or get
it from him we'd appreciate that Thanks
okay now what does incomplete least not
imply it doesn't implies that one plus
one is three now coming to your question
it doesn't imply that there is knowing
no complete and consistent formal system
for arithmetic because I can take I can
take as axioms as you proposed all the
true statements about natural numbers
and there is a formal system this system
of course is complete because it proves
every every true statement but what is
the sickness of this formal system the
sickness here is that we are losing the
possibility of determining whether in a
finite amount of time where the true
sentence is or is not provable now the
same is you know yes
in general in general it is always
possible to prove that a sentence is
true and unprovable but not in an
algorithmic not in an algorithmic way
right the Bible is incomplete or
inconsistent not a consequence of of
incompleteness area same for the
Constitution so you will see many claims
of this type unfortunately there are no
relations now let me go to the more
serious part of the talk and I will
address these three questions whether
there are interesting natural concrete
independent sentences what makes a
sentence in complete independent
unprovable and how common is the
phenomenon of incompleteness so one of
the first concrete examples of true and
independent sentence was found by girdle
and this is the consistency of the
formal system itself so girder has
proved that if I have a formal theory
which includes enough arithmetic this
theory cannot prove its own consistency
so it cannot prove that there is no
contradiction in in the set of CRM
proved by by by the theory what I mean
is in other terms the theory will never
prove P and not P where P is a specific
sentence but it's interesting here to
observe that this theorem says PR says
the the the series a piano rithmatic
cannot prove its own consistency but it
doesn't say that an be honored
ethic consistency cannot be proved in a
larger system when indeed here indeed
here sir Melo Frankel which contains in
the mirror peon arithmetic can prove the
consistency of the an arithmetic of
course what sir Melo Frankel cannot
prove is sir Melo Frankel's owns
consistency yes sir when you say
effectively generated does that mean
that there is an algorithm for enumerate
in the tree there is the typical formal
system consists on a number of axioms
and rules of inferences which you know
they generate one by one all possible
proofs and implicitly all the theorem so
this mechanist can be replaced by an
algorithmic generates exactly the
theorems of the formal system now let me
let me give you another another example
and in what I'm going to talk Turing
machines will play a formal for a formal
basis of the machinery and not only I'm
going to use a subclass of Turing
machines which are called prefix-free or
serve the limiting Turing machines and
those machines have like most
programming languages prefix-free domain
what does it means miss if a program for
this machine eventually stops any
extension of the program will not
determine a computation which eventually
stops up basically you have a mechanism
and marker which sort of produces self
the limits the program itself this is
just a technical condition but this is
essential for those who would like to
look at the technicality and it's
essentially to allow us to do
probability theory in this context and
one of the
natural questions we may ask we go to
piano rhythmatic which as I said is is a
formal system about natural numbers in
which all problems about programming
about computability can be naturally
expressed and we go to this system with
a full description of a universal Turing
machine what is a universal Turing
machine is a Turing machine which is
capable of simulating any other Turing
machine like this wonderful Mac which is
capable of simulating any other any
other computer in particular of Windows
one sir so now the scenario is the
following I go to two piano rithmatic
and I produce the full description of
the machine based on this description is
peon arithmetic
capable of deriving a proof that this
machine is universal or not and the
results are the following sometimes yes
sometimes no what does it means is that
the presentation of the universal
machine can be sometimes open to play on
arithmetic and disclose its universality
and sometimes it could contain this
property in a hidden compact way that
peon arithmetic cannot guess in any way
cannot certify by proof universality and
this is you know this is a very very
simple example you know you can't do you
can't do computability without
universality now Mike mentioned
graduating from from IBM New York who is
a very good friend of mine we have been
together to a conference in in Indiana
just last week and he is the inventor of
this Titans Omega number which has
very very intriguing properties but let
me first mention that touring in 1930
through nineteen thirties proved a very
important result the undecidability of
the halting problem what does it mean
this it means that there is no Turing
machine which when presented another
Turing machine in an input for that
machine decides in a finite amount of
time whereas a computation on that
machine on that input eventually stops
so this means it is impossible it is
impossible by running a very clever
procedure to know in advance whether a
computation is going to stop or not and
when you fail deterministically to
understand the phenomenon in mathematics
typically we look at the same phenomenon
from a probabilistic point of view and
instead of asking whether it is possible
to have an algorithm to solve the
so-called halting problem we ask a
different question what is the
probability that given a random program
to this machine the computation
eventually stops the machine I am
talking is a universal is a universal
cell the limiting Turing machine and the
answer to my question in a mathematical
terms is this number of Omega which
depends on the man on the on the machine
is not this number is not like PI or e
just a unique number it's a collection
of numbers each of them depending on the
machine I'm computing the halting
probability but all these numbers share
a very very important and very important
class of properties which we'll be
discussing and what I'm going to say
something and the first the first
important result was proved by Titan
which I can present in this form
mara Frankel if arithmetical sound can
determine at most finitely many bits of
Omega let me decrypt this for you
what does it mean first of all you
remembered here Melo Frankel is one the
most successful attempt to get a formal
system in which everything in mathematic
fix today can be expressed so this is a
formal system for the whole mathematics
what does it mean it is sound with
respect to arithmetic it says the
following every property of natural
numbers which is proved in thermal
Frankl is true what why is it important
it is important because you remember in
completeness applies to the system so we
cannot we cannot see we cannot know
whether there are we know that there are
true and unprovable statements about
about natural numbers and we want this
minimal sort of sanity
Union no insurance we want to be sure
that the system when prove something
about natural numbers will prove the
correct a true property so this number
is a real number so it can be written in
binary and the binary expansion is an
infinite sequence of zeros and ones
right and for every position in this
binary sequence I have two types of
propositions one which says that say the
first digit is 0 and the other one says
the first digit is 1 the spent for the
second part we have one proposition
which says the second digit of of this
number is 0 or the second digit is 1 and
so on
now in each pair of these propositions
one is true and one is false right
because we have fixed the sequence of
zeros and ones and we do the following
if we ocean imaginary experiment we
collect all the true all the true
sentences
about the digits of of Omega right how
many do they have infinitely many how
many sir Melo Frankel can prove finitely
many so the most powerful system for
mathematics is not able to reveal more
than finally many bits of this number
right only finitely many bits and any
proposition which is true which is true
about these bits and does not fit in
this small finite set will be an
instance of independent sentence a true
and unprovable sentence does that mean
that for a given universal machine
we can't even trivially generate an
infinite number of programs that will
obviously just stop immediately yes it
does mean that no because now be an
infinite is a true statement you have
said but you you see each of these
programs you mentioned will appear as a
as a term in this infinite sequence
right now how these terms conspire is
not at all created at all and this is a
difference between this number which is
completely OPEC and the sequence which
will give me the following information
the first in some enumeration of the
programs the first the first program
stops or doesn't stop and so on this
sequence which I guess you had in mind
has a property set it is also
uncomputable because of the halting
problem but it reveals by computation
infinitely many correct values because
always I can generate infinitely many
correct programs which eventually stop
this is not the case here because of
this do you know conspiracy yes sir this
might be what you just answered but
is this result because you could
formulate a program and the program
would stop if and only if a certain
statement were true so if that
statements one of the unprovable ones
then knowing whether it would stop would
be a way of proving or disproving the
statement and since we can't do that we
can't know whether that program stops
this will be a sort of argument for the
uncomputable 'ti of this number but what
I'm claiming here you and you will see
it is much more but yes this is a way to
argue that there is no algorithm pute
the digits of the binary expansion of
this number okay but as I said as I said
these are this argument is good but not
good enough to give us this sure and by
eighteen it's good to tell us that the
others number is uncomputable where i
can have infinitely many bits computed
by an algorithm what it doesn't say
directly that I cannot do more than
finitely for this one and I am going to
to to to to explain to you with a little
bit more work I can exactly locate the
moment when Sir Melo Frankel fails to
prove anything in this moment this
moment is a following so this moment is
if I if I start looking at the digit of
this number and after the dot I may have
a number of ones and at some moment the
first zero appears and then I have the
rest sir Melo Frankel will be capable of
certifying by proof only the first ones
after the dot the moment the moment the
first zero appears it becomes completely
powerless so this is this
the exact behavior because you see the
once after the dot they can be they are
sure the others are unsure and they
could be forever undetermined to any
algorithmic to any algorithmic
computation and as a consequence of this
result the solovay has proven something
very interesting that there is and it is
possible to construct effectively
universal machine which is such a bad
guy that sir Melo Frankel cannot prove
not a single bit of its binary expansion
how do I get this from my theorem well
it just enough to take such an Omega
which is smaller than 1/2 so this means
after the dot I have no one if I have no
one after the dot then everything
collapses but of course historically
historically solloway proved firstly
theorem and mine came later trying to
understand exactly what happens in in in
this construction and this example which
is the worst possible Universal machine
from this point of view furnishes an
interesting class of example of true and
independent sentences any sentence
saying then one billionth digit of this
Omega is 0 or the one billionth digit of
Omega is 1 is unprovable in thermal or
Frankel why if this condition this
sentence is false we now set tremolo
Frankel does not prove any false
sentences about natural number if it's
true is not possible because of the soul
of a of the soul of a result so you see
what is very important there are two
ideas which
I would like to stress here number one
it's extremely important how you code
information all this all this Universal
machines have the same computational
power but universality is encoded in
different ways sometimes universality is
sort of open to formal systems sometimes
it's completely hidden to open system
secondly this this this kind of theorem
shows that incompleteness is not
something extremely extremely
complicated you know I have here
infinitely many sentences about natural
numbers that's you know it's a very very
end it's not algebraic geometry is not
Union no cosmologies it's it's very very
simple number theory and the most
powerful system in mathematics is not
able to say anything about this ok now
let's let's look and is another
perspective of the possibility of
proving things and for this aim I will
introduce what is called the prefix
complexity of a string X and this is the
the minimum length of a program for the
universal machine to produce a string X
so the short is the most compact
representation for X with respect to the
machine you is the if you wish the most
compact form of U with respect to this
machine and it is possible to prove that
any string has a most compact
representation and now we we are asking
how many statements of the forms saying
the complexity of the string X is
greater than M
can be proved can be proved in say it
sir Melo Frankel theory and what what
Shaitan has been able to show is that if
I have such a formal axiomatic system I
can effectively construct I can program
and I can construct and I can compute
this number C which the properties that
anything which is a sentence of this
form which is provable cannot have m
more large as larger than than C and in
this way in this way in this way you see
only finitely many strings can be
certified to be complex everybody else
it's true and unprovable and why are so
many others because most strings have
high complexity now based on this URM
Jatin has proposed a principle which
says basically the following if you give
me such a formal system then I can
contrast the complexity of the system
with the complexities of the theorems
proofs in the system and in systems
which are interesting the following
principle will be true the complexity of
any provable sentence of the system will
be smaller than the complexity of the
system itself plus a constant now the
system being effectively generated it is
coded by a final string so I can
construct and I can I claim think of the
complexity of the system I can think of
the complexity of any sentence because
again we have a string and what what
this principle says it says that in a
finally specified Theory anything which
is provable cannot have
a complexity higher than the complexity
of the system plus a constant now this
is a principle which you you have to in
order to justify the principle you have
to to find a mathematical form of this
more complex and this system there are
different ways to to explain this one
possibility in which we were able to
prove this principle was true was to use
a complexity which we call Delta and
this is the original prefix complexity
minus the length of a string X now I
will briefly explain to you why we
needed this modification from the normal
standard complexity to this complexity
Delta first of all the number of strings
of bounded H complexity is finite in
most interesting system systems proof
infinite limit theorems so with eight
you would get anything interesting but
even more you know H is the very useful
interesting complexity for strings but
when you look at strings at sentences it
doesn't work well and I will give you an
example if I take the this very simple
sentence N equals n what is the H
complexity well it goes to infinity when
n grows large and larger because you
need enough coding sources to represent
n but Delta complexity will be bound
because I removed from this complexity
exactly those resources necessary to
codon and for this new complexity it is
possible to prove that shayateens
principle works fine for every finitely
generated formal system now I am going
to approach the last part with my third
question which was how popular or
unpopular is incompleteness is
in completeness just a bunch of
sentences obtained by linguistics tricks
or it's it's much more and one can look
at this question from various points of
view and there are at least two points
of view which are interesting number one
is topologically so you know you look at
the geometry of those sentences and you
look to see which is larger and which is
not larger and the second one is from a
probabilistic point of view you look
what is probability of proving a true
sentence in in a formal system and what
is the probability of not proving this
so with respect to the first with
respect to the first question we have
been able to prove that the set of true
and unprovable sentences is
topologically very large and I will give
you I will give you just an analogy an
analogy to understand what does it means
is you think of all possible real
numbers and inside the real numbers you
have the much smaller set of rationals
right so in this context in this context
is a set of real numbers which are not
rational corresponds to the set of true
and unprovable this is a bigger set in
in in probabilistic terms how we we can
look at the same question so we have
been able to prove that the probability
that the true sentence is unprovable is
always positive but the probability to
prove a true sentence goes to zero and
the length of the sentence go grows
larger and larger so in other terms you
know what we can prove what we can prove
mathematically is very very tiny
we compare what we cannot mathematically
prove and these are two points of view
which just
if I in certain sense that this
phenomenon of incompleteness represents
if you want the norm not the exception
and finally finally let me let me ask a
more pragmatic question is
incompleteness bet or not well
of course of course any kind of limit is
not a pleasant not a pleasant result and
when this limit Union no attacks if you
wish the very foundations of mathematics
is even less pleasant I have two two
comments about this the first one is
that I don't find incompleteness to be
such a bad situation because it forces
us to to be creative so you know in
order to prove theorems we cannot rely
only on automatic procedures when we
rely on new and new ideas and the second
the second comment which I would like to
to have here is that for troops we have
girdle's incompleteness so there are
sentences which are true and cannot be
proved but what about what about
computation what about computation do we
have the same phenomenon and the answer
is no for computation because of the
universality of the Turing machine which
was proved by by Turing in mid thirties
we have completeness so you see there is
a different different status in
probability the axiomatic method is not
is not complete but for computation the
universal Turing machine gives you the
possibility of computing everything so
in a sense the situation in in in in
programming and in
in discrete computation each it is is
much better than the situation improve
ability in mathematics so this way you
you know we love so much computer
science and I would like to add one more
thing about about incompleteness as I
said incompleteness may be sort of
challenged by creativity this is not to
say that completeness in in in in in
computing computability does not require
that not require creativity and you know
very well it at Google how much
creativity we need to do things very
well thank you very much for your
attention
thank you thank you very much professor
I really appreciate you being here today
there's a there's a piece of terminology
is which is confusing to me and I think
maybe to other people in the room to
when you have a axiomatic system like
ZFC and there's a statement a such that
you can't prove a and you can't prove
not a you seem to be saying that one of
those two statements nonetheless is true
and you talk about true statements that
can't be proved or disproved and if you
have a statement like a such that you
can't prove a and you can't prove not a
what do you mean when you say that well
one of them's true and one of those not
true well there are two things here the
first claim I make such sentences which
cannot be proved and not disproved and
this is a sort of general statement in
which I do not wish to enter in in
difficulties regarding what is a true
statement or not but if we do
mathematics and if we have a concrete
system like sir Melo Frankel which the
Continuum Hypothesis we have a clear in
mathematical logic a clear criterion to
define what is a true statement so this
goes back to to to to task II which task
is worked very close from here at
Stanford University so in this context
when I adopt a criterion of truth then
clearly if the theory is free of
contradiction one of the sentences P and
not P or a and not a is true the other
is not and because I'm interested only
in those axiomatic systems which proved
true sentences then I have this form
which is there exist sentence which is
true
and not provable in the system so truth
once again is something which goes from
outside the system probability is
something which which goes into the
system is like I would say you know it's
an outside level I can see this is true
but the system itself from inside cannot
see this so if I understand you
correctly you said that for every
provable truth theorem in ZFC there
exists a proof which is not not much
longer than the size of theorem plus the
constant yes so wouldn't that mean that
NP is the largest possible compatibility
class because if you have any statements
and you could compute a computable
statement you can turn that into a
theorem if there exists our proof of
that which is not much longer than the
theorem itself then wouldn't you be able
to find it and see I'm sorry to
disappoint you I don't think that there
is a relation and at least not one which
I'm aware in a guy I can see at the
moment but I if you allow me I will make
a comment regarding P I don't think well
P versus NP in my humble opinion is a
very very challenging mathematical
question but I do not see good evidence
favoring that P is a class of the
feasible computations so I don't see
good evidence that P is a mathematical
faithful formalization of the class of
problems which can be solved by feasible
algorithm yeah I was talking about NP
nut not P yeah
hi thanks for coming today a lot of the
examples that I've seen where people
point to systems and saying this
sentence is a sign of the system's
incompleteness or a sign of the system's
inconsistencies all seem to be very
pathological they're all based on
looking at the halting problem we're
looking at decidability the Omega
constant itself tells what that quite a
bit I'm curious if I were a
mathematician who were only interested
in doing things like 19th century and
earlier would I bump into incompleteness
Azur inconsistencies in ZFC and I'm
curious how if there are certain areas
of math where ZFC seems to be working
just fine I mentioned you know the
simplest example is elementary geometry
everything is complete there and you
know this is much much more general but
you point it out to a very important you
know weak point in the quest of looking
for independent independent questions
there are very few sentences prove to be
independent for which a typical working
mathematician will say aha this is
something
III I will I will stop working because
you have proved that that you have
proved it's independent but saying this
you can turn around things and transform
incompleteness from a bad situation into
a good situation so it is conceivable
for instance let's look like Riemann
hypothesis with with two other
colleagues we have proved that there is
a program which has no more than 7500
bits which has the properties that the
program never stops if and only if the
Riemann hypothesis is true yeah Mike
said about our tent to compute bits of
Omega we computed 64 7500 a long way
to go but what what I mean if we will be
able you for instance if you tomorrow
come with a proof that Riemann
hypothesis is independent of of termina
Frankl then you have an indirect an
indirect proof for for this so and there
are people Sherlock is such a
mathematician who who you know thinks
about turning incompleteness into a new
tool of probability i it's really great
having you here today thank you again I
was very interested in your statement
the end that you have greater optimism
or I think if I understood you right
that from a point of view there's more
power in algorithmic computation and
there is an axiomatic systems right so
yes because the computational processes
form a complete set you have
completeness you don't have completeness
in in in in mathematics improve ability
so in in in what sensor or computation
what in what sense is this complete its
complete because the universal Turing
machine can reproduce itself
first of all universal Turing machine is
a finite object it's analog of the if
you wish
it's Almelo Frankel system for
mathematics what is a difference between
these two objects
Thermal Oh Frank is is not capable of
proving many many true sentences in
mathematics the universal Turing machine
is capable of reproducing any possible
computational processor so this is why I
think that from this point of view there
is more power in computational processes
and in an informal probability and I
don't know whether does this make any
sense for you but that this was in the
the contrast I try to make all right so
it doesn't really hold out more hope of
of developing or proving more of
mathematics through algorithmically then
through an axiomatic system well it
doesn't but you know there are many
other things which are important in life
which can be achieved through
computational processes and there is but
aren't we sort of computer people sort
of in the same boat in that it's perhaps
comforting to know that anything that
can be computed B can be computed by
some Turing machine but if there's no
effective way of finding that program
aren't we basically in the same boat as
a mathematician who can't find a proof
of a theorem yes yes of these forms of
Zehra results which say this specific
computable function this specific
function can be computable by a Turing
machine but there is no way to
effectively you know construct such a
Turing machine yes there are such such
results which sort of parallel to some
extent but you have to also acknowledge
that the that incompleteness does not
make any reference to effectiveness in
the axioms and Rev in the rules of
inference accepted by the systems we
discuss here there is no requirement
that we have only constructive rules
anything is possible
so in a sense in completeness you know
goes b1 effectivity do you think there
are any in computable statements that in
the future we might want to add two ZFC
to make it more interesting what what do
you think there are any statements that
can't be I'm sorry letter
can't be proven in CFC right now that we
might want to add as axiom yes yes
that's a very good point this is exactly
what girdle advocated so Gerda said that
well the main job of a mathematician is
not really to prove theorems this can be
left to two to two computers but what is
important is to is to see and
distinguish between interesting
mathematical sentences and trivial ones
and of course adding new axioms in order
to prove more interesting sentences is
the job of a mathematician and even this
does not cure incompleteness
is a way a perfect legitimate way to
increase our mathematical knowledge what
would make such a sentence interesting
well the sentence by itself may not be
interested it may not even be
interesting but it's interesting is what
the interesting consequences of adding
desist this sentence to to a formal
system if we get more insight than for
instance a typical a typical candidate
for such a new axiom is for instance to
to accept the Riemann hypothesis and
actually even this is not explicitly
many times said many results in
mathematics have the following form
if Riemann hypothesis is true then this
is true and this is exactly like you
know you know saying let's add the truth
of the Riemann hypothesis as a new axiom
and say whatever we can we can get but
you know in order to be safe we'd have
to prove that the Riemann hypothesis
could not be proven which hasn't been
done well if he can't be proved it is no
no harm
what if it's proven first then there's a
lot of harm
I have a quick question you mentioned
that elementary geometry is complete
does it imply that is in it is
inconsistent no no it is consistent it
is consistent but there is an algorithm
which given an arbitrary sentence of
elementary geometry can decide whether
this sentence is provable or not
geometry
no that's it says the points that's a
point you can you know it's a very good
point because you will say Oh everything
in geometries which will speak about pie
but to speak about 1 2 3 and so on so
arithmetic is in geometry what what what
makes geometry complete when arithmetic
is not well that was the issue here is
number natural numbers are not essential
in elementary geometry so we can bypass
this and the same argument we can extend
by saying it's physics incomplete or not
so one one wrong way to claim that these
things it's incomplete is to say well
mathematics is incomplete if you believe
in what I have said here and because
this is based on mathematics and physics
is incomplete that's a completely flawed
line of reasoning because it doesn't it
doesn't tell us you know it's not it's
not ruling out in any way it's a
possibility of doing physics like we do
geometry it doesn't say that you see
natural numbers cannot be avoided in in
doing physics of course it doesn't say
they can be avoided of course but you
cannot use this type of reasoning you
know hand waving somehow to jump on this
you know
stronger conclusions that physics is
incomplete it may be incomplete but not
because of this argument so so in the
example of geometry being complete
already available set of true but
unprovable statements should be supplied
by all of the arithmetic statements that
you know to be true modeled in geometry
I don't know if that makes sense or not
hmm I'm not sure what's that so so you
can't model in the language of geometry
statements about arithmetic oh yes yes
that's true there are things about
natural numbers which cannot you know
are not mirrored in elementary geometry
well I guess that there is no more
questions once again thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
