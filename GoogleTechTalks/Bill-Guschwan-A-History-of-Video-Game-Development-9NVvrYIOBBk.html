what my name is I'm going I'm going to
do my best imitation of an Atari 2600
you have to bear with me i'm going to
show you here's the part 46
a little nervous
Roger to Conger too so what I'm trying
to do that's a metaphor really for what
that Terry 2600 is so I'm going to start
out more talk with that is the metaphor
one 2600 is ok so keep that in mind my
name is Goku Shuang you know a lot of
you guys don't embarrass I knew him as
absurd at apple inc com why was there
when he invented to this Apple II and my
name was Angus at Apple Inc time so the
Angus comes from my last name getting
high as my last name one to do a circle
circle so that's where that comes from
so call by Angus in the video game
industry I was in the video game
industry from early 90s through the mid
90s I worked out three do first after
leaving Apple that apple I'd worked on
the Newton founding team I've worked on
the quicktime founding team and i worked
also on a thing called apple media tool
and after I left 3d I went to work on
the founding team of the PlayStation so
one point I was the main technical
contact in America for the for the
PlayStation and then I when I've
actually worked in Japan so
so the title of today's talk is the sole
synthesizer body control and video games
and so the picture i show here is a
picture of Miyamoto's the designer kato
influence at nintendo and it that's me
you know rubbing my chin like a
philosopher which at one point during
our conversation with them he called me
a philosopher instead of actually an
engineer and and some of the joke there
is its Angus designing Mario 128 because
that picture is actually the day that he
finished mario 64 we went to a little
local to Japanese pavan we had a lot of
drinks I ate a sparrow head ya know if
you want a sparrow it as a spare on a
stick and they deep fry it and now they
made me fight the head off of course I
will only did that because I was drunk
and I was with me a motive time and next
week I was in the Sony hospital anyway
so we were under them that step that's
what that is though so really what what
I am about is sort of since I left the
video game industry have left it for a
while so I haven't been in the video
game industry so I'm glad up to date
technically on some of these issues but
I've been sort of working on my own sort
of approach to it and I come back to
video games because I spent the last
eight years working with body and how to
control the body and so that's one of my
personal focus now is so I left the
video game industry the last eight years
we've been working on how to access the
body that's what we're going to talk
about today okay so issues of embodiment
in and how that comes back and then I
incorporate a lot of philosophy again so
I've fact that McGee emoticon call me on
philosopher that's worthwhile show that
picture alright so in Japan there's a
big tradition where everyone has sort of
their day job
they have what they call their personal
camera okay so Japanese that it's sort
of like it's sort of assumed that
everyone has talents but you should be
like drought drinking then they say
let's see your talent you got to be able
to pop it out and show your talent okay
so that's sort of sort of a Japanese for
the cultural custom and of course in
Japanese that are is really their
closest approximation to the L and then
all syllables the Japanese into the
bottle so the closest approximation to
talent is a dental so co-processing cut
on tour was sort of what I demonstrated
to you of course the Atari 2600 didn't
have a coprocessor maybe it did but
that's what of the bare minimum sort of
hardware system records point that i'm
going to talk about in terms of the
metaphor of balancing a an object as a
metaphor what the Atari 2600 so then
this in this picture of these are
various shots with me and Japan
balancing there's one in Kyoto over the
golden temple and there's been some
students in the park that it is shopping
alright so I worked when i worked at
japan and work closely with ken kutaragi
he brought me over there to work in 1995
so I worked for directly underneath him
and it worked on texture mapping code
while during my stay there one of the
things I was struck by then one of the
thing that's interesting is he's a real
cowboy so he's kind of close to I was
very similar to him its terms of spirit
because and one of the things that
people say about it for example is his
name is kutaragi which is four syllables
right which is a somewhat rare to have
four syllables for name so that's sort
of almost like the way that he's named
make some sort of interesting um and so
I think what his get a real vision right
so one of the things was to deliver new
effective experiences what you know what
I recruited a lot of experiences i'm
sure other people have names for them so
then i began to think about this and one
of the things that i think you really
understood was this idea of a choice or
the point is the effective threshold so
the effective first world is the point
at which technology can dimmer deliver
qualitatively new experience I think
recently that's something that Steve
Jobs talked about her is the iphone
waiting for the cell phone to merge with
the PDA so that you got the that crossed
over the advective threshold so that now
when you get an iphone into a while
experience before that it wasn't a wild
experience so that's kind of what I
referred is the effect of the threshold
of affecting the experience that you
feel in your body what you would body
the feeling that you would bottom and so
how does when when does technology reach
that point to deliver that experience
alright so I think it was real visionary
in that sense but then there's one
problem and I'm going to bring up issues
of the problems with his sort of vision
and it's caught what I call the
technological plateau this one of the
point in which technology increases but
the change in effect of experience
stalls ok so my example here's the
playstation 3 right so it's increasing
graphics and see mound and things like
that didn't it hasn't really necessarily
appointed the new wow experience and and
I think that was delivered that while
experiencing this current generation of
video games was obviously delivered by
the Nintendo Wii and we'll get into that
so more about the technological facto so
it's a period of time when the software
and hard hardware designer are not
insane right so the hardware design
software is a tug of war right the
farmer gets ahead and software can't
keep up so video games specifically
council video games are such a good
example of that because video games are
all about speed right there I always
compare it to the dragsters of cars
right the whole design of a video game
is just speed speed speed speed and you
have to know that you have to get that
if you don't get that you fail in the
market okay for the moment for the most
part okay so that's why they're looking
at video games in the history of them
technologically is a really good way of
following sort of trends in terms of
what's happening as opposed to looking
at some operating systems or whatever
operating systems are like the you know
the on the Civic's or whatever in terms
of cars and that sort of metaphor again
going back to the metaphor so games
always create the greatest speed of
software for the current hardware so
really when i worked at playstation on
the playstation that was my job i was
sort of one of the things I was tasked
with was was sort of which animals
really i basically demanded which was
the macro codes for accessing the
assembler and the 3d transformation
should also known as the GTE or the
geometry transferred engine so I would
go around and parachute into different
developers and tell them how to write
directly to the hardware okay and I had
a fight with him so much because he
thought puron you always wanted to
protect the OS level and it was just you
know again getting mad work on my own
the way that I think I just always
demanded that he was very butted heads
with an
one time in those regards all right so
at the bottom there's my note i worked
on crash bandicoot in fact when i worked
at three yards out of epub way of the
warrior I worked with naughty dog and
you Gavin jason rubin over there and
they worked out the way of a warrior
with a 2d fighting game and i hope to
support them there and then when i went
over to the playstation I told kutaragi
son crash bandicoot crash bandicoot
crash bandicoot and one thing you think
he did listen to me was that of course
he hated me so when the launch of the at
that point you note impetuous out of the
cave is impetuous relationship with him
when they launched it in New York I was
in Tokyo I'm asked for him to fly me to
to New York and he didn't let me go but
levert I was still bitter about them
anyway so but anyway so when the
PlayStation the first year of the crash
bandicoot Andy Gavin sad and universal
studio Lots Suzanne stump Tuesday and
summer studio Suzanne snuggie the
summers back then had some sort of TV
show so I'd walk into the Suzanne Somers
studio and and go in there in the back
room and II was back there counting
polygons like just counting and counting
counting and he's bad you know like he's
at least six months just counting
polygons what he can do to get better
performance and what you can do so
that's really what to me in terms of my
vision is a technical director back then
and so many was looking at video games
and it's just all about you know not in
cutting edge and always competing
because that's how the marketplace her
video games competes you know I mean
there's other factors not only just the
technology obviously quality of gameplay
etc but or in my job the way that I look
at it that technological issues is very
important so I throw this slide in here
so historically maybe I view myself
important in one aspect in terms of the
Macintosh then there was sort of this
idea that sometimes the plateau is not
the technology that holds the technology
back and when I was working at apple I
worked at Apple door
90s and I worked with actually Tim durst
back then he's actually the one who
taught me when I was living worth living
and well at school at University of
Notre Dame he would actually tutor all
the football players and then he would
come and tutor me I'm max buck West his
next buggies the debugger for the
Macintosh right so and you know Tim by
the way never went to class but he had a
perfect GRE I'm gonna use my gyro so and
that's why I just sort of model my
behavior after him he went to apple I
went to apple etc etc and I think he
eventually wanted work on the operating
system and back then and that's a
picture of me and Brigham Stevens who I
was you know we were more like into
video games and wanted to do them and we
always wanted to write directly to the
screen what's the one writing directly
to the screen means going by bypassing
the or less than just hitting the harder
it directly and they always against it
because they do why you wanted to keep
the user interface and all this stuff
and I kept saying to them you know look
it's we're talking about tracks there's
not civic so we don't have to worry
about compatibility we need to write
directly to the screen so we wrote the
article and in the article this was the
compromise I wrote like six pages of
just this is why you shouldn't write
directly to the screen so there's six
pages of that and then maybe three pages
of the code that bring them pretty much
full row that explains how to write
directly to the screen on the back
that was the first time that that
article was published and so you know
that they always say history repeats
itself so when I went to Sony and I was
working on the launch for the
PlayStation in America III was coming up
and of course everyone was fretting
about and saying oh no we have enough
software okay which is a big issue there
wasn't enough games that was the big
issue like at three do there was a big
issue of not enough games three deal
launched with Shelley Duvall's birdlife
that's why I one of the reasons many
reasons I talk a little bit more 13 do
didn't didn't succeed you know what 13
year old boy is going to play Shelley
Duvall's birdlife alright so that was
the same sort of panic at that plate at
Sony especially could rocky and toward
the end of it when they were finalizing
the hardware there's a you know CD
player built into it and I started
working on some of the code for like
making sort of fractal designs based
upon what was happening with the music
playback and basically kutaragi gotta
win to this and he got really angry he
said why is our main technical contact
in the US writing code for the hardware
not supporting developer if you don't
have enough software etc etc so you know
so now I got really mad and ice would
have shot back to him and I said it just
was repeating what happened at at Apple
he was so concerned about porting and
supporting the next generation of the
PlayStation then he didn't want us to
write directly west oh you know so that
we could upgrade and that was that was
what his issue was and I haven't tried
to give him the point of view that that
wasn't the reality and it was so bad
that the lsi engineers who actually
designed some of the chips inside the
PlayStation were literally two miles
away from our office but they wouldn't
allow us to just go with two miles and
visit visit them and me
do do some basic engineering to
understand how the hardware work so I
shot back to him I said if you don't
give me access to them how are you
blaming me for the value of his product
so that wasn't even email that I wrote
there was called III won't be ruined by
Angus and the blue clouds and salute
father's records to that music player so
all right so the executor I mean that
you know fashion of them that going back
to the admiration spectrum you know I
really believe it was a real visionary
the big thing that he did was a stereo
sound wall experience for the Super
Nintendo right so stairs so that's why I
say in 1990 that's what it was and so
foggy solution at the time was to get
this the sort of sound ship was this
idea of a bubble coprocessor right so so
this will be my interpretation in terms
of our metaphor of what the super
nintendo is so I did sort of the Atari
2600 the balance the three aspects of
juggling there's balance inning and
tossing okay so we get the balance which
is our baseline reference point super
for the Atari 2600 now I'll do balance
and spinning okay so this is now my
interpretation of the supernatant
so what we have there is we we have two
things going on in parallel using my
metaphor in the spinning and in turn and
then there's the balance while balancing
it and spinning right so the addition of
the coprocessor was sort of his basic
inside right had this put this with the
sound into a chimp let it do its own
thing and don't have a basically don't
tie up the box right so for video game
developers that's the big thing don't
I'm the bus and we'll talk about that
more than me so so in this case you know
the sort of stall of this technological
plateau was solved by a hardware
solution right so up till then they
didn't have stereo sound this sort of a
technological plateau and then the
threshold is achieved by using a pro
processor right alright so freeing up
the bus alright so the bus of the main
route my outings i think is making the
engineer so I don't get too much detail
of how it works but it's the route over
which it is exchanged multiple devices
compete for the attention of the plaza
right so if you're in the ideas if you
store out codes in the data you send
send that data down to the whole process
or the device can run independent of the
senior so you can get two things done at
the same time done in hardware you don't
have to worry about it right so I always
talk about this in terms of pure ice
core inside was mystical process so this
will come back to haunt him right so
this is sort of part of my team all
right so then the next level is we the
next sort of threshold so you know
throwing himself will say he is the
inventor of the sound synthesizer and
sure enough given credit in the next
level for him in terms of his mind in
his vision was the graphics synthesizer
right so sort of you know here's the the
basic history of the graphic
synthesizers in the seventies writing at
hardware sprites the ti 99 for a which I
use a fuse and program using cassette
tapes the Commodore the tire to the 2600
and the 80s you had software sprites
which provided more flexibility so the
Nintendo and even the Macintosh and so
then the 90s the technological plateau
where everything was stall and up until
the PlayStation was how to solve the 3d
and graphics problem okay so riding so
93 that's about when the 3do came out
right and that was their attempt at
solving that sort of problem so he so he
the next level for that was how does it
get to the effective threshold of 90,000
polygons per second so it turned out
that in order to reach the effective
effective first of all to experience a
3d fighting game turned out to be
approximately real time in terms of
processing 90,000 polygons per second
okay so that was a technological level
or the effective threshold at which it
would be possible to get that okay and
so that's where they were stalling so
the 3d real time wow experience was what
could be achieved when he hit 90,000
polygons per second okay so the while
that I had with the PlayStation was I
was walking around in see the pirate
ruku or somewhere and topia one of the
subsidies and just seemed like sort of
the stores and the TV's on side of the
streets and then there was a video of
this game show chinden which was a 3d
fighting game early on and I just
remember looking at it going literally
saying WOW with my jaw wide open right
so the fact that that affected threshold
really mapped about 90,000 polygons per
second that's what it was so now we
reach cooter oggies next insight which
was that which is the idea of being able
to do three coprocessors essentially is
what you want to talk about there's a
graphics chip the 3d transform chip and
the CPU which we could be
in peril okay so and this became a much
more advanced designed to have these
three chips rather feral right so in
this case you have the CPU this is a
critical insight had a 4k caption so by
comparison 3d of had no instruction
cache and the cash is critical because
then it frees up the bus right so you
light up you load up your polygon
transfer blue staying off the bus or the
graphics engine could then at the same
time render the next frame that you're
kind of confident it's GT instructions
which is a coprocessor in the cpu ran
for 20 cycles and so you can actually
use the cpu while the gte was running so
that i was also another form of
parallelism that you could actually use
the cpu while the GT coprocessor running
because if it's running for 20 cycles
you could sneak in three or four move
instructions or read instructions in the
cpu and then you can get further
parallelism there right so then and
that's basically how sort of that work
so alright so then let's do an
interpretation of what a play station
would be
alright so we've already have the
balancing we had the spinning and so
then the last variable or last form of
juggling is tossing okay so this is my
interpretation I select channel it's you
know it's very typical worker a
PlayStation this is my okay so we're
going to have tossing spinning and
balance
well I just realized it go to the
balance I need the other spin so we'll
start with first names of here it is
this mounting atari 2600
I think it actually degree of difficulty
for having a blinding light in my eyes
if you never know with performance what
you're going to experience alright so
that's my interpretation of the that by
the way I'm actually juggle I juggle for
the chicago sky here in the city so
performance is one actually area of
interest for me in terms of embodiments
of performances one aspect of embodiment
and so that's my sharing today is from
some of the tricks that i use and the
chicago sky who performs here at the UIC
Pavilion come over the summer while the
men are playing alright so moving on to
and then here's to get an overview of
the 30 it failed to achieve the
effective threshold of 90,000 polygons I
mean I don't think anyone knew that that
was what it was going to be the 90,000
polygons was going to be the number but
it just happened to be right you know
because of course at first they promised
a million polygons on the original
position but really the reality is about
90,000 real sort of time performance of
polygons so it did not have a gte which
was the geometry transfer mention which
was a coprocessor so it didn't have
built-in sort of divide functions and
you could not use the graphics chip as a
coprocessor it had to be run see really
didn't have the parallelism and the CPU
didn't have an instruction perhaps oh
there's a picture here of me with trip
hawkins teaching him no I'm actually
kidding i wasn't teaching it but i think
it was some sort of new york times
article back in the heyday about like 92
okay so moving on so then the next level
was sort of the PlayStation this
PlayStation 2 PlayStation 2 the sort of
Wow experience was just more of a
continuation personally I that's kind of
when eyes would have left the industry
so for me that the playstation 2 wasn't
necessarily or what personal war
experience but the technological
challenge then though it was clear to me
when I left was that once we have all
these parallel processing is over the
bus the bus became the limiting factor
right so once you optimize the design so
that you free up the bus the next factor
just became well the bus isn't fast
enough right so so getting back to the
dragster analogy once you start to tune
and everything gets tuned to its maximal
amount what happens is then that the
weaknesses of the design dance for show
up and so in this case it was a random
box okay so Ram boss was a faster memory
system and that's what he decided to
incorporate which was was very very
futuristic in terms of incorporating in
fact then right so and then there's some
number for the polygons and in terms of
it and and then the air more of the same
in terms of what they have to do so so
since it's sort of proved in with the
sort of that I don't have actually a
good demonstration of a Playstation tube
but I will have one of the PlayStation 3
so now a PlayStation 3 the wild
experience right so cooter Rogers vision
was this idea of the emotion synthesizer
he talked about this way back in London
when I saw him speak in 95 I think this
sort of notion of an emotion
synthesizers away the sounds of the size
of the graphic synthesizer than the
emotion synthesizer it's a really common
a year in my attention what you really
meant by that and so what I sort of say
about that with the PlayStation 3 is
that it sort of is
sort of recent news on a new
technological plateau okay so I'll do my
interpretation of the PlayStation 3 so
this is sort of the group 10 maybe with
the PlayStation 2 ok so for the
PlayStation 3 i'm going to take five
balls and juggle them while i balance
one of these pins on my chin ok so here
we go so that's going to be like at
least six things going on right sort of
approximating what a play station for
you
so I picked up juggling when I was about
22 hours ago with Michael cast who is
the 1989 world champion juggler her
name's working at apple at the time and
York City good in one place we're going
to fix our picked up in academy or its
etc he gave up juggling to do that
remember we had a higher tone he came
out juggled he was juggling like seven
pins or something and then they asked
him are you full time generally says no
that's a sort of a dribbler out of
practice during 7th anyway so I picked
it up much later in life so to general
five balls in you know I can generally
by balls as a baseline but during the
fireballs doing something else is that
much more difficult makes it takes much
more time in work and effort to
experience so that's sort of my analogy
of what the PlayStation 3 right and I
think this has come out on the news
fairly recently the basic problem right
how do you get seven cool process to
work together right and one of the
things I thought of what you need make
crepes offer I mean I don't know maybe
that or something of that sort right
this the idea that they're sort of one
main computer with many sub things but
it's not a perfect analogy to talk about
mainframe software but the reason I just
think of that just because I started out
on the IBM 360 at Notre Dame with Tim
Dirk's he and I racine at a desk and
kind of answer questions about the IBM
360 and while we were running code on it
so so really that becomes what the
PlayStation 3 was is you know how to get
those seven core processors to work and
I just noticed the other day that
there's this sort of thing out there
called the pervasive parallel listen
laughs I don't really know anything
about it but that's sort of addressing
that problem right so the problem is
that how do you have I mean he was hard
enough with me going around trying to
get people to write parallel code just
like the GTE and the GPU but now they
guys were these seven sort of separate
engines it's a sort of the difficult
things to sort of
address so so on a higher level would
have the place playstation 3 well i mean
it's still not totally a failure right
still doing fairly well chugging along
and I think as people figure out the
technology it Pato acquired a long way
through very well so maybe instead of
like with Danny Gavin spending a year to
investigate the PlayStation maybe it's
going to take three or four years for
people to figure out the PlayStation 3
right because I have such advanced
technology right so that might be might
be what happened so I'm sure it has what
I recalled legs right has no the
distance but in the short term it really
hasn't succeeded to relative to its
competitors right so so the technology
cannot pass the effective threshold of
synthesizing emotions so and a certain
level it does sort of fail I think in
terms of puter Iraqis vision in terms of
doing that so when I say here what he do
wrong he was building an emotion
synthesizer was right but he ran into a
technological plateau right he's
hardware is way ahead of the software
right we need to resurrect mainframe or
something right I say or something
because again I've been out of sort of
really working hard with code for a
while so maybe some people know better
what what solutions might come from
parallel processing because I certainly
don't know but to utilize all the all
the bull processors right so so that's a
pretty well-known problem i mean i'm not
making any great insight here but in
terms of the video game industry it's
really important to see i think that
contributed to kutaragi sort of errors
they just figured you can just keep
adding a coprocessor and then that would
always solve the problem and he ran into
this technological plateau right and
that's where he stubbed his toe okay and
then he took his eye off the ball in
terms of what video games are about it's
about the effect of experience right so
the history up until now all right is
spent eighty percent of the time on
rendering the frame of rendering sound
right so the playstation the culmination
that sometimes of the playstation series
really culminates the graphic
synthesizer air and sound sides are area
you know that's not to say that there's
more development that can't happen in
those arenas but in terms of delivering
those wow experiences perhaps it'll be
more gradual right so the future is
trying to start spending more time
getting more input from from the user so
so here we transition into this sort of
concept of where do we go from here
right so where is it that we move on
from here what's the future right some
of the future is already here right so
what's the what might be the new
effective threshold and its emotions so
I think goodu raju described his vision
is right it's just as implementation is
what he called his strategy was right
his tactical implementation was wrong
right so and you know make mistakes
right so so here's some thoughts on
emotions where I talk there's a couple
of things so emotion is output from the
player right how do you trigger the user
and with a new kind of controller ride
which is kind of what I think the wii's
getting at and how do you trigger in the
user through interaction with their
pitching or so the story I mentioned
this guy and hooks I've been kind of
following and he does he teaches
animation for actors so so he teamed
like if you're an animator you have no
acting experience how do you convey
emotion in an animation things if you
don't if you're not an actor yourself so
I hope that hooks really sort of focuses
on that problem how to imbue animation
characters with emotion right so you can
put emotion into the actual material
itself so he's based here I mean I've
been really hard with him in about five
years or but I know that's what of his
mission and I think that's what an
Avenue to go and of course the new movie
industry has always been trying to get
to the
right and even if you go back to my
could pass and everything that's going
on at Pixar and all that mdv juggler
support our jugglers Michael passin 99
IJ champion see I makeba oldest juggling
traveling trivia he's he's sort of
addressing that problem and then another
way to do it is to take the motions
emotional state of the user into the
game so actually using how to take that
emotional state of the user and then
change the game in response right so
instead of thinking that the game has to
do something then the person will
overwrite act to it but how to keep that
emotion back into the game and other
avenues for expressing emotions so so
that eel emotion synthesizer is use a
sort of a definition of effect you're a
fact emotion or feelings displayed to
others through facial expressions and
gestures posture voice characteristics
and other physical manifestations right
so when we're talking about emotions
we're talking about the body then right
and so that's the key sort of insight so
this is I think the new effective
threshold and video games in and again
this is anything original inside because
in the marketplace that's already been
expressed through the interest in in the
week right so a couple notes here facial
expressions I know people are project
them in Pollock men's work in terms of
mapping out the muscle movements of all
faiths facial expressions and gestures
right so with the week those issues of
posture which I'll talk a little bit
about in terms of context of Pilates I'm
a Pilates instructor and it deals a lot
with posture voiced characters etc
alright so the Nintendo Wii I also you
know get like think philosophically
right so one of the things is gesture is
a form of language and emotion so I
think when really what we're trying to
do with video games is deliver an
experience to humans right so we have to
really think critically of what our
models of our of humans right how what
are humans what
they communicate so you really have to
think critically in that sense of what
is the model of the human so we can
deliver an experience to them an
effective experience that'll be
something that they want right and so
what I think the weeds doubled on or
perhaps through the genius of Miyamoto
whoever was that intended created this
was a gesture is really a form of
language in an early form of language
and it can then directly be mapped to an
emotion all right so it so the we focus
on a smaller chunk of the effective
threshold of gestures right instead it's
a small step on the way to a full-blown
emotion synthesizer and I point out this
Italian gentleman giovanni battista eco
he created this book called the new
science I'm way back in some earlier
couple of hundred years ago of these and
he what he wanted to say was that our
ontology is he little screwed up another
was the list of objects that we think of
as a little bit backward so in 30 and he
wanted to basically place at home poetry
person at the first move for anything is
poetry that idea that really poetry in
that sensation and feeling an experience
at the sub line expression of life is
really the most important thing and that
he wanted to shake up science and make
that the first principle and then
structure how we view the world from
that sort of viewpoint right and he
actually talked about gesture as being
the first language and he also and then
another fellow who talked about that too
is vintage time I'm very influenced by
vintage time this notion of the two
forms of language and language games so
language games is the concept that you
can use really how we communicate like
even now we're using on the stand
gesture because I'm talking about an
Italian I'm talking like this right and
so that concept of using gestures for
communication and language was sort of
famous thing that late bit contrived
talked about which is to say look don't
think
right so when you look you're not in
your head you're not in your head space
right you're in body right and so we may
I think at this point it would be
valuable to start looking to the future
and looking back to what miles of
humanity are and how we can really
develop video games in that sort of
expression and deliver the needs that
are without it okay so the way it
describes it is the idea that the social
world is the work of man and I think we
see that expressed through this sort of
social online things is Facebook etc so
the marketplace is sort of proving that
out and that the earliest layer of human
culture is that of mint and poetry and
so all right so now we're looking at
issues of embodiment and that's sort of
where my interest lies now and sort of
transitioning to sort of speculating
about what could could sort of come to
fruition one of them is this demoted
brain sensor and there's a picture there
on the top and you know which is
interesting way interesting God and and
then the second thing is with the body
and then there's the wii fit now my
criticism of the brain Setzer is that
not only is the brain your your mind but
your whole body is your heart and I'm
going to talk about that so I more
subscribe instead of sort of the d
cartoon version like the motive is
getting at the first of the mind-body
duality that the brain is up here
somewhere then actually your brain is
fully your whole body and dumb and
that's sort of what are my model is that
I really focus on it what I explore so
that's sort of my passion now is like
seeing how that how we are about it in
terms of emotion okay so back to the
weekend i think that's coming out this
month in the US market very popular
I just pulled this little quote from the
newspaper and sort of their kind of
proves my point about what I'm talking
about looking at new models of humanity
what that is this is one of the
reporters for you and I put the blog
we're all wired reference here and it
says despite my skepticism my balance is
getting better and so on this we fed you
try to find your balance I'm doing more
you're going to begin each new session
and I'm impressed that I'm now able to
hold poses like foot Jam straight up
your crotch his elusive translation of
one of the poses being clever and witty
without falling off the board and here I
bold this sort of statement what this
means for my health and absolutely no
idea okay so what I'm really interested
is that that kind of thing like what
this means from our help right so we can
flip that game out there they can do all
these things but really what we want to
do is really go back to how to Polly
synthesize emotions in ourselves and how
do we use video games to sort of Tampa
sort of experience because otherwise
that people are just going to move and
use it but have no idea of how that
works so so I come up with to avoid what
are my thoughts on the better models for
body control okay so one is two there's
two things that you need to do for mine
from the work that I've done in the past
five five years or so first thing you
want to do is wolf illnesses is to
alienate yourself to see your body
objectively and then increasingly align
yourself with your breath okay this is
through the tradition of Pilates that
I've worked with so the idea of
alienating yourself is that you have to
be able to come back to your own body
and see it differently the best example
I heard of that is sort of like if you
want to understand that today's modern
car is an explosion engine right so what
a car does is it just as a controlled
explosion over and over and over
but we never hear the explosions if you
have a new required or similar car it's
different right or we never did we never
see it but if you drive is saying who if
you found somehow a Model T car and
that's all and you started it up and you
would figure that explosion of how it
starts up I think people have had that
experience you'll then be reoriented to
how really a car is an explosion
extension and so that's what value of
alienation is it's sort of like deep
familiar or deeper militarizing excuse
me it's a difficult works for me to say
but d familiarize yourself from your own
body so you can come back to your body
and figure out what's going on and
that's the first principle in terms of
body control and then the second one is
learning for me them is to access the
emotional state through the muscle
control so the emotive sort of headset
can access emotional state theoretically
through the brain waves but I'm more
interested in how the whole body of
bodies in motion and what that could
mean and then ask you the meridian and
I'll talk about that so this this is
these two areas Pilates and meridian
meridian stretching are basically my
arrays of sort of research and this is
the point at why I'm coming back to
video game so so I left the video games
and at the point about when the
PlayStation the graphic synthesizer and
the sound synthesizer sort of finished
and now I'm kind of coming back in terms
of thinking about it critically and so
these are my thoughts on it from my body
work in terms of how do you begin to
integrate body into a video game ok so
Nietzsche so again from philosophy
Sunita was a preacher teacher was a
philosopher from Germany and one of his
books was called the joyful signs ok and
so there you go we got the two you got
the two things matching up right there
got joy emotion after state and you have
science science knowledge and
engineering and those are matched up ok
so this is basically my interpretation
of what you was getting and so the idea
there is that joint can be a science ok
and so you know that's what we're sort
of getting at with this sort of idea so
if it is the science we can control it
and how do you do that so he had this
notion of the perpetual recurrence I
think otherwise the subscribers to the
eternal return but I think the better
description is the perpetual recurrence
ok so recurrence in terms of programming
we're more comfortable I'm more
comfortable with that term and then
perpetual is a better term that an
eternal because it applies more time and
space as opposed to more of a divine
dimension of time
so what you want to do is return a
two-year body with objective objectivity
so what you talking about there is this
process of if you can live your life
over and over and over again how would
you make a joyful well you would make a
joyful of every time that you come back
into your body you just be able to see
it and see it with a sense of joy and
glee so that was sort of what these
ideas that when you alienate yourself
then you can come back to you about him
you come back to your body you can see
how it is to be joyful okay in some ways
maybe a metaphor kaleidoscope you know
seeing your life coming back to it in a
new kaleidoscope by seeing new fragments
you know maybe some of the art in the
20th century you can think about is
cubism of Picasso or things like that
that really try to capture that essence
that that really perspective is really
always changing and never the same many
times when you come back to it quite
alright so again back to the term is d
familiarization then how do you a lady
so how do we implement each's idea of
the joyful science right so we do
another area as you saw this gentleman
is philosophy and then that was
implemented by bertolt brecht another
german i guess i really like the Germans
I'm but he was in theater and he talked
about it in terms of the alienation
effect ok so the alienation effect is
what he used in the theater and it sort
of the implementation of that how do you
need yourself in a sort of theater and
an environment and when you're dealing
with motor behavioral I work as the
Pilates changer and my first step is
always to create awareness for people
like the first step is always a great
awareness then you create skill okay so
if you walk into a gym and you go
through a bench press with a trainer
this job isn't first to take this is how
you to avenge across this job first is
to create awareness whereas awareness in
your own body how to move in
you know before you actually do the
training in the skill okay so that's
that that's already implemented in
training with the body as well is that
the doctrine is always create awareness
which is just another word for
alienation or deeper militarizing
yourself okay and then I already gave
the guitar gianluca daughter was very as
a movie director was very influenced by
this notion as well okay so all right so
in Pilates what is pilates it's
corrective exercises to use the body in
line with the breath all right and
really what I think of it is as my
Chavez applies instructor is I'm a car
mechanic but instead of moving something
it's the breath that your body is used
to inhale and exhale and that as a
mechanic I'm restructuring your
musculature so that it optimizes your
breath like I'm just like when I used to
work on the PlayStation I was
fine-tuning developer game applications
to get the best performance I do that
same process now but with human body and
the optimization gold is prepped and
that's the goal on a lot is it will
explain that in a minute so the five
principles of it are controlled
centering concentration precision in
frap so so that's why control becomes an
issue because we're outlets the video
games because that since his whole view
the centering is learning to move from
the center concentration so here's the
mind-body connection it's embodiment
right so there is no separation there's
no big cartoon split between the mind
and body there actually are one thing
and then precision back to German
engineering very precision the terms of
using the body thing so you can use body
alienation or using your body for breath
okay it's going to understand your body
you have to see it as a bread machine
okay there's a muscle that's actually in
your neck that works as an accessory
breathing muscle all right and it's up
here in your neck right along the sides
of
you know the way you could use it is I
could go like this and it will actually
help use use my head that way okay but
if I want to normally then it helps me
to move my neck but let's deconstruct it
okay I'm very influenced by jacques
derrida and its concept of
deconstruction and the concept is if
we're looking at how to move my head
using that muscle that's one Center
process that's one idea the other
process is well what if I wanted to use
that muscle to help my craft so I'm
going to Center the idea of breath and
then use that muscle accordingly right
so what I would do then is I'll use my
muscles to disengage my neck muscles so
they can't move my god so I would lock
the neck and when I locked the neck and
i lock my head there it will reverse the
polarity of the full of the muscles so
instead of pulling down on my head it'll
hold here and the muscle actually
implants and inserts here in my chest
and on my clavicle so instead of moving
my head if I locked my head down it
reverses the polarity it'll actually
begin to pull onto my chest so then the
second thing you have to do is there's
two insertions for this muscle it's the
clavicle and the sternum so I have to
lock down my shoulder so I'll reach your
way to lock down my sternum so that the
only thing left that's left for that
muscle to do is to lift the chest so if
i do it and i'll try to do it now it's
reaching a way to lock the clavicle down
block my neck them engage my stomach to
relieve the support of the neck so that
they can help by breathing and then on
the count and exhale and then I inhale
lifting the sternum here
yes
okay so it's a very complicated precise
way of learning how to optimize your
breath if you use that muscle at a
deconstruction said the centering breath
does the focus of that muscle we're able
to achieve that so the poddies exercise
focus on the breath right another
example is people normally start with
their legs straight up and this exercise
called 100 okay they never progressed
lower and the reason is contingent
foucault and architectural sense sort of
like to view history as archaeology
studying why something happens just
because people do it right it tends to
be we do things just because someone
just did before there was no real reason
why and so people land up with your legs
sticking straight up in the air and then
they've never changed it because no no
one ever told them that that's not what
you want to land up with your legs and
the reason is if you then again
deconstructing look at why how can i use
my leg muscles to help my breath okay if
your leg muscles are raised to 10
degrees the insertion of the muscle that
pulls up your hips will insert into your
diaphragm which will then actually
support your breath okay so I have a
picture of that so you'll see there that
the legs there are 10 degrees off the
ground okay vs. if the legs normally
you'll see people in their legs will be
straight up and down like this as
supposed to be here and if you start to
breathe you will achieve the optimal
breeding position and that actual
position and that exercise is a breath
exercise if you've ever been to a
Pilates class no one will ever tell you
that no one ever will tell you that why
is that because in history is just
contingent people put the legs up
because it's a safer position it's safer
because you go to a group class if
you're in a group class you want to keep
people safe and why do I people people
from safe because there's lawyers all
right so this is sort of a Michelle
Foucault sort of way of doing the world
and exploring concepts and why they get
corrupted and they get corrected because
of that sort of sentence ok so that's
how the breath works that way alright so
moving on from Pilates and there's
another mode that I work on and it's
called the meridian and Verdean
stretching and currently Olympics are
coming up there's an Olympic swimmer dog
Torres and she's 40 years old and
currently she's it looks like she's
going to make it
swimming at the Olympics this summer for
over 40 years old had a kid and
everything okay and of course the first
response is well how does she do this
and you know with the stories about
steroids and sort of athletes she gets
to ask that question all the time but
I'll tell you the secret okay here's the
secret of what she does she does the
system column ready and stretching okay
and it's just a system of the way to use
your body to optimally stretch and we'll
talk about it here a little bit more so
let me digress back to announce play so
the way you use your body can actually
control your emotional effect so when
you use the meridians they're sort of
lined up in your body and by using them
you can actually change your sort of
emotional state so every time one of the
ratings that comes on in front of your
body is the governing a sort of meridian
there's and it's sort of down here in
the front of your body and it's sort of
the guideline for your emotional state
so anytime the for tar torgar Torres
goes to swim in order to pump her up and
give an emotional state which is crowded
they'll do this stretch okay so she'll
come down here dig your knee in and then
start to lean back you come forward and
then
so she pulls in the end leans back comes
forward and returns okay so they'll do
this on her hundreds of times right
before she goes to swim and why you know
why are they doing that because they
want to give me that sense of I'm number
one I'm number one I'm number one how
are the accessing that emotional state
do that stretch I just told you there's
a lot going on it looks like a simple
stretch there but the key inside with
this stretch system is that you're
actually contracting the muscle as you
stretch it there's no other system out
there does okay so this is the system
that I around in the Nats how it'll
change okay you're 16 lines of meridians
in your body there's other methods to
acupuncture touch and stretching and I
focus on the stretching so one of the
back to sort of this idea of joy
so this position
have your arms up and then you lower
your arms that process is your heart
Meridian in that hard if you're working
with give you a sense of Troy so if you
take your arms down and you pull them up
with resistance that's actually the
process of which you can create a sense
of joy okay so that way in terms of
moving the bodies whether you can access
emotional states ok so the meridians map
to emotional status alright so there's
no they divided into two sort of groups
they're sort of what are called Ian
exercises immune exercises tend to make
feel lighter so there's actually a
physical effects of it as well for
example the harbor do exercise you can
you actually grab the partner and
actually do it why when you raise your
arms and if to somebody resist as you
move your arms through the range of
motion it'll actually be actually
generate that sense of it for you you
can actually go ahead and try to home
fuel site or in the satellite locations
of here as well so so the idea that is
that exercise actually can be done by a
computer so if we did this exercise and
then with the computer and then answer
in the context of a game not only are we
physically generating the sense of joy
in the person through a very physical
manner by accessing the body for able to
change your emotional state right so so
minded emotions and body's just not
appear in the head and needing a sensor
alright so I mentioned it about the
resist while contracting ok so that's
the key inside flexibility as divided by
this system of murdering flexibility is
that the muscle contracts is through the
range of motion and that's
counterintuitive and going back again to
Foucault dere na wires that we think of
stretching as just this one motion do
you think about a muscle a muscle is
made up of hundreds of fibers so just to
say okay I'm going to stretch this
muscle and it's going to work all those
muscles doesn't make any sense and not
only um because there could be hundreds
of fibers in there right so there's sort
of a categorical mistake that happens
because
we can go it's a it's a bicep muscle and
therefore all I need this one stretch so
what you want to do is how do I use that
stretch to get each individual though
say there's 100 muscles there how do I
stretch each individual muscles well the
way you would do it is by by contracting
and stretching at the same time because
what will happen is some of those 100
muscles will need to be stretched then
someone we need to be contracted so as
you contract and stretch at the same
time the strands of muscle that need to
be contracted will contract and the
strands of muscle that need to be
stretched will be stretched right so but
because of the sort of philosophical
error in my opinion of the fact that
there's a muscle we're stretching it we
r has them to thought critically about
how that works so by contracting and
stretching through the full range of
motion you'll stretch maybe the maybe
they'll be five fibers that are need to
be stretched those muscle
Dainius stretchy and contracted and then
that's the secret of dog returns one of
the series I mean she knows other things
as well I'm not saying that's the sole
reason she spends a hundred thousand
dollars a year on training etc she's got
strength train approaches swim coach
obviously but the key to it is the body
and the ethics of the slide we
tijana exercises not exercises are
things that make you feel heavier and
then finally they're sort of sort of
getting just more sort of substantive
historical support for this position in
Tibetan Buddhism meditation the one is
was cool that begins where you have to
do 100,000 111 heart meditation
stretches the actual stretch itself is
where you would get on your knees and in
this case it would normally be on the
floor but i'll just use the ball since
I'm it's a rough floor here so I would
basically go down prostrate down come
back up and stand up and I would have to
do a hundred thousand of those sort of
things so again that's just sort of more
sort of historical support for this view
of how to use the muscles to activate
sort of
example so finally in conclusion
to summarize this whole thing you know I
started off with the sort of concept of
the motions of size in terms of crude
araga explaining what it is and sort of
now what kind of pour my research and
where I'm at with that now is what I
feel that was that it's actually a soul
synthesizer right so the flies that we
work with really deals with the breath
and how to open up your breath right and
traditionally back into similar blossoms
they always sort of equated your breath
with your soul right so if we learn
using such techniques and accessing your
breath through your body you're really
going to access your soul 1s or a
concept right so the graphics
synthesizer and sound designer is coming
to a close the future video games will
access emotional states of usage to
deliver a new while experience you know
the wii wii and controllers like a wii
fit our star wars' sophisticated
emotional states you know are accessible
through use of the body by redken traala
g and meridian stretching mind so so in
that i think with that in terms of the
soul synthesizer i'd like to conclude my
talk so thank you for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
