thank you all for being here on this
beautiful warm Wednesday afternoon so
we're going to talk today about twenty
percent projects here at Google and I've
got two of my colleagues Andrew Hogue
zach loyd and we're going to tag-team
our way through this let's see oh we
have the clicker here okay so that's the
three of us okay so a bunch of a whole
lot of interesting things out of Google
started is twenty percent projects
you'll hear more about them during the
presentation on more than just the icons
that I showed there some of our products
don't have very particularly attractive
icons with some of them do yep and zach
loyd will look tell us a little about
what twenty percent projects are all
about we're going to be working in
Reverse alphabetical order by first
letter of last name hi there's this
working cool so my name is zach loyd i'm
a manager on Google Docs and
particularly I manage the spreadsheets
part of it which is all Google Docs or
most of it is run out of the New York
office here I've been working at Google
for about four and a half years and
today I'm going to talk a little bit
about what twenty percent projects are
what our typical projects that people do
like what are sort of the ground rules
at Google for working on twenty percent
so let me go ahead and get started okay
so what I tell people I work at Google
one of the first things that they
typically ask me and they're like oh
that's pretty cool or or whatever they
say something but they always say do you
get a day a week to work on whatever you
want and I say kind of yeah I kind of do
get a day a week to work on whatever I
want with in some boundaries it's like I
can't go to
orchidea week but as long as I pick
something which might benefit google i
can take twenty percent of my time and
work on it and you know this isn't
present in every company but the idea
behind it is that if you have a culture
where engineers can take some time away
from their main thing which is the sort
of company priority what they've been
asked to work on and work on something
which interests them you you will foster
a community where you get innovation so
it's supported all the way from the top
down it's been part of the Google Google
culture for a long time and it's it's a
pretty deeply ingrained thing here so
the basics of it the way it works is
pretty much every engineer who works at
Google gets to take twenty percent of
their time to work on a side project if
they want you can start working on
twenty percent pretty much as soon as
you're comfortable and settled into your
main project that's that might be a week
that might be a month a couple months
but you can just start doing it is it
really twenty percent of your time the
answer is yes if you want it to be and
engineers here will divide it up sort of
differently some people will do a couple
hours of days and people will do a day a
week some people will do a week every
five weeks some people will sort of bank
away their twenty percent time save it
up for a quarter and then do a couple
weeks of work at once so it's very
flexible you know it really depends on
the engineer some people some people
like doing a little time I like one day
a week that's the thing that's been most
common that I've seen and it depends on
what you're working on too so that
brings me to the next question so as a
20-percent project person what can you
what can you work on so the answer is
it's really broad you can work on pretty
much whatever you want so long as
there's some potential benefit to Google
so it should be somehow related to to
Google or to your job or technology or
something which might potentially one
day benefit Google
but doesn't have to definitely benefit
Google and a lot of things that people
have tried haven't worked but it should
be at least in the ballpark this is a
creepy slide so I'm going to talk a
little bit about some of the different
kinds of twenty percent projects that
people do that I see them working on
here so within the kind of Google
internet the guide these are sort of the
general categories that you see so
people can start a new project twenty
percent of the time you see this people
can work on something that already
exists they can tinker around with some
codes it's not really a project it could
be an internal tool they can work on an
engineering intergroup as twenty percent
of their time and these are sort of
cross functional groups that exist
within Google to promote best practices
that kind of thing you can work on an
open source project you can teach
something you can teach a class or you
can even just spend twenty percent of
your time doing kind of professional
enrichment so but the I think the most
interesting kinds of projects are the
ones that you hear people talk about
most when they think of twenty percent
projects at Google are sort of these
exploratory projects so these are things
that people kind of try to shoot the
moon on come up with the next big thing
for google these would be things like
Gmail or or goggles or I don't know
maybe if Maps had been a big I've been a
20-percent project there are things that
are there somehow knew and there's a
sort of risk associated with them so
these are projects which engineers will
tend to sort of have an idea and it's a
it's a bottom-up process you'll you'll
say okay in addition to my normal job
function I'm going to work on this big
idea and try and come up with the next
big thing for google a second kind of
twenty percent project that I often see
is the sort of small and fun project
it's the project where I'm working at
Google I like what I work on most of the
time but I actually I want to break I
want a diversion I want to work on a
feature for Gmail I'm
someone who does databases and I want to
be able to make an Android app so you
see this kind of thing all the time too
and this is another great part of the
twenty percent is it can just be like
hey I want something different some of
the time and it still adds value to
Google so Google is happy to encourage
this kind of project so you know it in
my particular work I people had features
to our Google Docs all the time like
this you know people want to just you
know someone might add the spell checker
someone will add some formulas and
different functions to Google
Spreadsheets another big use of twenty
percent project is a sort of precursor
to moving around within the company so
on google docs we get people approaching
us all the time who they're working in
some other part of the company they're
working in ads they're working in search
infrastructure whatever they want to
join the Google Docs team pretty much
always the first thing that we asked
them to do is to work on a 20-percent
project for us so this is implementing
some small feature would be a typical
thing and it's a great way to see if
there is a good fit between the new
engineer and the team to get into the
code and it's again another one of these
very useful parts of having this
flexibility in your job and then finally
there are these there's a sort of
culture or Google where if you see
something that's broken rather than
filing a ticket and having someone else
fix it the ideas you just fix it
yourself so there are people at Google
who will spend their twenty percent time
just kind of seeing things that drive
them nuts and fixing them you don't like
the way the meetings are scheduled you
can fix it you don't like the way the
elevators go up and down come up with
like a way of making the elevators work
better so there's there's a ton of
latitude in what kinds of twenty percent
projects you might do so I'll talk
briefly about some twenty percent stuff
that I've done and then I will hand hand
over the talk will go tag team back to
mark so for me I did a 20-percent
project of the kind of exploratory
nature which is I was working on google
spreadsheets
doing sort of regular features and I got
fed up with kind of the wave the code
was architected and I said my twenty
percent time I'm going to see if we can
come up with a better way of rendering a
spreadsheet you I and I kind of tinker a
lot no one asked me to do this and
eventually you know I showed it to
people I was like hey what do you think
should we'd be doing things this way and
people bought into it and eventually we
ended up rewriting the spreadsheets you
I to be based on this new technique that
I was messing around with in my twenty
percent time so that was cool I mean
that turned into kind of a big thing
that a lot of people worked on and then
you know there's one other one within
Google Docs which is a good example so
Google Apps Script which is kind of the
macro language for Google Docs started
when an engineer who was working on
google spreadsheets he'd worked with
certain technology his last company and
he just again same sort of thing no one
asked him to do it but he he just one
day show people he's like hey look you
know you can use this technology to make
let people make custom spreadsheet
functions and people like on the team
we're like that's really cool and now
it's turned into completely its own
thing with a you know a bunch of
engineers working on and a lot of users
and it's a very important thing for the
product so you know even my personal
experience I've seen the twenty percent
projects grow into really really cool
things so that's it for me with that I
handed over to mark thank you so my
twenty percent project was the art
project and it didn't wasn't even a
project for a very long time it was a
kind of an exploration so i'll tell you
the story let's see i think we're going
to play a video see if I can figure out
how to do this this was a marketing
video created for the art project early
on
you
so I was born and raised here in
Manhattan ah the child of starving
artists and one of the things I
discovered about being a starving artist
is that it's not particularly
comfortable so so I decided not to be an
artist you know at about age 10 you know
before that it was like I was me artist
like my my mom okay so i went to kal tak
got a PhD at CMU became a computer
scientist but I never lost interest in
the art world I just didn't want to be a
starving artist so after working for a
while here in the New York area I got
involved in a CTO organization here and
as a result i met the cios of most of
the big museums here in the city and had
been thinking about this whole question
of the digital museum ah I wrote a blog
post on it before I joined google in
fact ah and you know the interesting
thing that google have been working on
on digitizing books for a while now but
the art problem is actually very
different and in some ways harder
problem uh so there's been some
estimates of the total number of books
in the world and the range of estimates
go between 70 and 170 million unique
titles that have ever been published in
all the languages worldwide since people
have been creating books that's you seem
you may think that's a lot of things but
just for comparison the Smithsonian
alone claims to have a hundred and
thirty six million objects in its
catalog and that's one museum there's
17,500 museums that are members of the
the US only american museum association
so there's a lot of objects in museums
around the world and because of that
only a tiny fraction of those things are
on display so for example the
loove reports that it displays about
35,000 objects are and the estimates are
that the Louvre's collection is about
seven million objects that's probably
wrong by a factor of 10 but the best the
best case is that they're displaying a
half a percent of their collection now
another another force and change driver
in the museum space is the sort of the
death of regional museums back you know
up until maybe a century ago a travel or
less than a century 50 years ago travel
was slow dangerous and expensive if you
were traveling you had to have a damn
good reason and in general people didn't
because it was slow dangerous and
expensive so as a result every sort of
major regional city around the world has
a has a sort of a museum with a
relatively broad not very deep and not
very not very large but sort of
comprehensive collections so that people
there that can sort of see you know
paleontological things and art things
and technology things in one place um
well today travel is in fact fast safe
and cheap by the standards of a century
or more go and that's having a huge
effect on on the regional museums which
are basically dying ah you know why go
to a regional museum in podunk when you
can come to New York and visit the met
and moma and the Natural History Museum
and or go to Washington and visit the
Smithsonian or go to London and visit
the British or go to Paris and see the
Louvre so the regional museums are are
changing their basic strategy there
either becoming specializing being
becoming specialized collectors of
extremely narrow things that makes it
worthwhile to visit them or more often
they're just fading away the collections
are large and fragile more fundamentally
than all of that you know back to the
point about the Louvre and they're half
a percent on display curators are are
imperfect
caravaggio who's now considered one of
the great artists of the 1600s was
essentially forgotten for three or four
hundred years after he died only
basically rediscovered in the middle of
the last century now considered you know
one of the gods of art so the question I
have is how many other phenomenal
artists are kind of languishing in the
archives of museums around the world
given that only half a percent of the of
the of the things are on display okay so
so my hypothesis has been that if we
could get a large percentage of the of
the museum collections in the world
digitized we could eventually begin to
harness the the world's population
looking at the art and saying gee
there's something really interesting
over there that maybe the curators
didn't notice and and sort of begin to
change the way people think about art
you never quite know so when I got here
to Google I had this sort of dream of
the digital museum uh and I began to you
know sort of think about how Google
might get involved in this and google
has all these really incredibly powerful
tools one of the reasons why we can do
we can do in software is we've got what
i call nuclear-powered hand tools and
and that lets us build incredible
software with relatively small teams in
very short order so so i organize some
brainstorming sessions with variety of
the engineers here whoever was sort of
interested asking okay what could we in
fact talk about if we went and visited
the museum people and we had them
brainstorming sessions we came up with
some ideas one of which actually is part
of the of the art project namely the
museum view stuff which is basically to
take the head off of a street view car
and put it on a cart I'll show you a
picture of that later on and trundle it
around inside the museum and create a
walking tour of the inside of a museum
so in parallel in Europe some people a
woman in the Madrid office persuaded the
Prado to let Google Finance the capture
of some of 14 of their masterpieces and
published them originally in Google
Earth and then subsequently in maps and
that was that came out in nine in 2009
and that was immensely cool it was a
huge undertaking because basically to
capture a to capture a picture required
closing down the gallery was in and
assembling this big framework of steel
bars and the camera machine can would go
up here and it would move over take a
picture and move over take a picture and
then there was a bunch of software to to
sort of need it all together and it was
incredibly successful and that led to
the next phase of the Europe driven a
project they basically well we're good
we'll go to the national museums and and
you know invite them to join this art
project where we'll scan one of their
masterpieces is sort of put them all
together in a website and they went
around and talked to the the big
national museums and we're getting some
good traction with them and they came to
New York they hooked up with me and and
they told me their plan I said gee you
know we don't have national museums in
the US in any real sense um I mean
there's the Smithsonian I suppose but
but it's not the big museum in the US if
you want the great museums they're
mostly sort of privately funded I mean
tax exempt you know but there's the Met
there's the moma there's a bunch of
other things and those guys have to
worry about their funding streams
national museums in Europe are funded by
the governments and so they're not
nearly so cautious about about you know
marketing questions whereas in the US
the museum's are basically afraid of
channel conflict problems so so we
adjusted our approach and I introduced
them to a bunch of the museum's via my
connections to the cios and we started a
bunch of converse
patience one of the things we didn't
understand is how clubby the the museum
world is basically all the top museums
know each other they're all they're all
continuously talking to one another so
there was nothing we know conversation
we had with one museum that every other
museum in the in the world didn't know
about within days which didn't didn't
hurt us in any way because we weren't
you know we weren't conducting anything
in secret but it both helped us in some
ways and hurt us it helped us in that
you know once the word got out that
google was going around talking to
museums there was tremendous excitement
and also tremendous fear it turns out I
discovered after a year or so later that
one of the sources of the fear was that
about 25 years ago a major technology
company had approached a bunch of
museums and and had gotten them to
submit a bunch of their art to
digitization and there had been some
some fairly unpleasant experience visa
vie the licensing of that of that
material that had sort of left emotional
scars in the museum people and so that
was one of the reasons why we were faced
with certain delicate conversations
fortunately we didn't actually ask for a
ownership of the digital images or
licensing or sub licensing rights so
that made it a little easier for them to
to work with us and then part of the key
of course in any of these things is to
get some one major to jump first and in
the case of this the moma here in New
York jumped first and the reason that
worked was sort of interesting the the
the woman who was sort of the key
decision-maker at the MoMA was an art
historian I still is i'm sure and when
we told her about this she said oh she
said oh yes i know i know what you're
talking about because i am an art
historian and i teach and one of the one
of the paintings that I teach is Las
Meninas which is in the Prada
when was one of the ones that the Prado
project had digitized and she said that
was it was you know earth changing for
me when you guys put that up there
because I could now see things in that
painting that I've been teaching for 20
years that I was never able to speed
before because I could get down to the
point where a brushstroke was this big
okay so she was on board immediately
okay and it was interesting is that a
conversation with the Met sometime after
that and he was so jealous he was so so
pissed off that that you know the moma
had just like dived straight in without
without tremendous amount of anxiety
over it and the met meanwhile was like
mmm they were they were they were
pondering fairly hard not to be fair the
Met was in the middle of a director
change going from the old director to
the new one and there were a variety of
other challenges to worry about but they
ultimately did come along and signed up
so we got the met we got the moma the
Frick the freer are a bunch of these
total of 17 museums so the moon while
the street view street few guys we have
reached out to you know with this idea
of museum view and they built that cart
can you see that there is very cool and
it basically you know a re-engineered
street view street view camera built
into a thing with a battery and so on
and sort of cool and it you push it
around and it takes pictures of the of
the interior of the place so basically
what we ended up with is a gigapixel
image which is incredibly high
resolution basically lets you zoom down
to you know again where we're a
brushstroke is this big a museum view
tour of each Museum of some part of it
not every museum said the whole thing
they do a couple galleries or this or
that and then we built a website which
basically let us present the images in
the the gigapixel image browser and it
turns out the museums were eight you
know because the museum's those high-end
museums that we're dealing with have
plenty of capability of their own we
weren't teaching
anything they didn't already know but so
in fact when when the time came we
didn't just get the 17 gigapixel
pictures that we had originally signed
up for we got I don't know over over a
thousand pictures in total we got the
viewing guides and variety of sort of
information about the art from the
curators and we built as part of it this
thing the my art collection so if you
sign into the site you can select
individual things and you get sort of
along the lower bar of the of the screen
you get sort of your pictures so you can
make up a collection of the things that
you like particularly regardless of what
museums they happen to come from so it's
kind of an early social social aren't
feature now there were all kinds of
challenges trying to make all of this
work first of all the the in order to
put the street view stuff together you
rely on good you know XY location of of
the cart at every at every photograph
and guess wat no GPS inside the building
so we had a number of interesting
challenges I won't go into the details
but they were they were tricky um a lot
of inertial navigation a lot of all
kinds of Corrections a lot of game
playing the team did some remarkable
work one of the things we learned which
we didn't expect was that lighting
inside of buildings is actually harder
than lighting outside you say wait a
second outside I've got the bright
sunlight that enough and the answer is
inside a building I've got a window so
I've got all the bright light that I get
outside as well as all kinds of ranges
of shadow inside so it turns out that
the dynamic range that we needed outside
was not enough to support doing it
inside and we had to actually redo
everything and we rebuild our entire
process for a much wider dynamic range a
lot of information again the the
museum's once they once they sort of got
interested in doing this wanted to put a
lot of information in there lots more
pictures than them than we had
originally expected
then there were you know sort of quality
control things the museum's wanted to
review and approve every museum view
picture now that turned out to be you
know in some cases it's like you know
there's one I'll show you later on which
is actually quite amusing their time
when it really is important to exclude
certain pictures but it also means that
some of the museum view tours seem
remarkably jumpy and your sense of
situational awareness is very disturbed
because you go forward and suddenly you
like your teleported somewhere else so
we have work to do in terms of getting
this kind of thing to the quality level
that we all really want here's an
example of the quality control this is
this is the room called the hall of
mirrors in Versailles and we took that
in its up in fact and if you look
closely there's a little you can just
see it there and I picked it out and
blew it up there's the cart
self-portrait of the cart in the inverse
I and that's the kind of stuff we had to
contend with so we had a big launch on
the first of februari all kinds of
celebrities and press and all that stuff
at the Tate Modern in London it was
rather more successful than we
anticipated both in terms of usage and
in terms of sort of critical response so
the net result of that was that the
traffic to the site has been phenomenal
but more fundamentally the museum's who
we had to woo and seduce to get
interested in this the first place are
now basically tearing down the doors
trying to get into the project and there
was actually there's a wonderful
interview with the director of the feet
see who who basically talked about the
impact of the art project it drove
traffic to his website 5x ah which is
you know because one of the things we
could provide in the in each of the
pages as links back to the museum's own
site but in addition it doubled his foot
traffic
ok so the fears about about channel
conflict and cannibalization of traffic
turned out not to be true in fact they
turned out to be the opposite of what
was expected so with that with that I'll
hand it over to Andrew for right thanks
mark so so with that kind of great
overview of a project that I think you
know we can all grow is kind of wildly
successful and is going to go in for a
very long time like I don't want it to
take a step back and talk about three
instances that I've been involved in of
twenty percent projects that one that
worked kind of on possibly on par with
the art project one that definitely
didn't and then one that kind of turned
out pretty different than then I
expected it to just so you know me I in
the search group here in New York you
might remember me from such Google and
NYC tech talk meetups as the structured
search engine anybody was here for that
so that Google's about seven years I had
kind of a wide variety of twenty percent
and eighty percent experiences so there
we go so the first one that I was
involved in surely it was strictly
speaking it was david petraeus project
but I kind of helped get home get it off
the ground was what's now known as
google goggles it was really known as
unveil internally and david was actually
a ball state so there was really an
engineer on the big table project so
what I've heard a big tables are big
structured I'm scaled database that we
use here at Google for large quantities
of data so David was kind of in this
project it was exciting for him in terms
of like scale and doing interesting
things but he had this kind of itch that
I think a lot of engineers have where
your main project is kind of structured
and working out really well you wanna do
something kind of crazy and interesting
on the side so so goggles actually start
out with some software that we had
acquired from company called Navin
vision that only so far at Google after
a couple of years been used as part of
picasa so is it they were using it to
recognize things in picasa
help you automatically label and group
your images in picasa today we're
sitting there looking at this and
thinking man you know this is kind of
it's kind of cool I can you know
categorize my picasa albums but there's
got to be something else to this right
we've got all these like fantastic
machine vision research researchers in
Santa Monica you know they're doing this
crazy you know PhD level stuff but
really if PAGASA is really the only
under result maybe there's something
cooler we can do here so so David idea
was basically okay was instead of
treating this as a organizational tool
lets tribute as a search tool David
worked a little bit in web search he had
thought a little bit about what we do in
a search as far as universal search so
if you type in a business and Google
will find you a business and local
listing if you type in something you
want an image will show you images so
you thought well what do we take that
idea of search and combine it with the
idea of being able to recognize things
and photos and build a visual search
engine it's actually Universal so he
took the navin technology is going on in
Santa Monica it was only being used for
picasa and he built a little demo right
so this kind of have a lot of Zack
mention before have a lot of twenty
percent project start off something has
crazy idea they they talk to the people
that need to figure out how to kind of
hack together something and Ford in
Davis case it was a little android app
that basically you could point at
something you know like a logo on a coke
bottler or something like that and it
would find that thing find its name and
then do a web search for it right so
kind of not that crazy of an idea if
you've already got the the Picasso
technology what kind of a totally new
format for it that turned out to be
really compelling and then the next step
was basically said you started shopping
this around again and that kind of a
natural evolution that twenty percent
projects take you show it to somebody
they get excited they they tell somebody
else about they act come by to say can I
see a demo and then kind of all of a
sudden he has vice president's like
fighting over who's going to sponsor his
project so so this was like you know
this is kind of good example of kind of
a successful 20 billion project almost
too successful so they kind of they kind
of double down this is at this point
this is where I kind of got involved a
little bit I help them find more
engineers for we built a team we ended
up with three or four people in New York
working on it bunch of people instead of
Monica doing the vision stuff we built
an Android app well a couple years ago
and this is the kind of now being held
up as one of the standards for visual
search you know this you know kind of a
general competitive market now people
that actually trying to build visual
search engines and do these kinds of
things
when the interesting things about
goggles is it actually bred more twenty
percent project so it's like this kind
of compounding effect because now
goggles is cool it's a full-scale eighty
percent project but other people want to
be able to do their twenty percent
projects as part of goggles so one
person actually implemented the the idea
of taking the OCR that we do as part of
goggles and feeding it to Google
Translate kind of you know a little
no-brainer if you think of it now you
can take it you're in France you don't
have to read the menu take a picture of
it we send you back what that menu
actually says another person want to be
able to add contacts to their address
book from from business cards pretty
simple OCR you take a picture of
business card parse out where they
address the phone number of the name is
now you have a contact in your address
book I don't think that phone number
works anymore though so so that's an
example of kind of a 20-percent practice
i think really worked well again i can't
take much credit for it David did all
the hard work this one I can take total
credit for and was an abject failure so
this is one of my this is the long time
this is probably six or seven years ago
when I first joined Google and I was
kind of looking for my first twenty
percent project you know I i wanted i
was having fun of my main project which
was you know during question-answering
stuff that I still do at Google but you
know I want to try out something that I
hadn't tried before I've been talking to
my family and my mom has you know at
this point of computer a windows
computer and I'm over there like every
month fixing it right i mean like I'm
sure anybody this technical has this
problem right all she wants to do is
send an email and the whole thing is
like pop ups and spam and malware and
all kinds of things like that so I'm
think myself how can i solve this
problem you know and like good engineer
i start looking at linux and i realized
that you can make these bootable CD so
I'm like wouldn't it be cool if at this
bootable CD I give it to my mom and all
she has to do is when a computer's
broken if I can't get there she throws
it in the inlet CD drawer reboot your
computer and all of its there is gmail
right and maybe a chat window the thing
that never really quite solves how to
print you know consider that point the
bootable linux distributions didn't have
good printer support and you get to set
things up so this is a fantastic idea I
thought this was going to be great so I
forgot to advance the slide but anyway
so this is her problem you know this is
what happened right so so it turned out
that there are bunch of reasons that
this didn't work out
in retrospect first of all I'm not a
great you know machine learning guy and
things like that i'm a terrible colonel
hacker as it turns out like I really you
know I good linux user but i'm not very
good at actually figuring out how to
make the thing do exactly what i want
start things wouldn't win it when it
first comes up and kind of be really
easy like i wanted to be is actually i
guess kind of what chrome OS ended up
being which is you you boot it you login
with your Google credentials and
everything just kind of works so I think
maybe I'll say that once ahead of my
time I guess so that was that was probly
the main reason it didn't work the
second reason was that you know at that
point you know that talked a little bit
about doing things that might actually
help Google at that point I don't think
there was really any exit in within
Google for this this project right i
mean like it wasn't like a google google
really wasn't in the operating system
you know business at that point now we
are twice over you know google wasn't
really thinking about you know we're
thinking about spam but only in the
context of gmail and so on so there
wasn't really a lot of support other
than me working on this and that's kind
of a hard thing after a while you know I
just kind of kind of gave up and it was
cool idea now now my mom has a
Chromebook and she's happy so so okay
this is the slides a little messed up
here but it was my last twenty percent
project is one that was something I was
passionate about it was a lot of fun
turned out completely different than
what I thought it was going to be so
I've had kind of a long-standing
recreational interest if that's possible
and things like bioinformatics and
genetics you know I like a new plan this
kind of stuff fascinating and what I
really wanted to do is kind of find out
a little bit more about you know what
what technology were behind it actually
write some code and figure out there any
problems that we could solve and they
kind of start to look into and talk to
people I realize that almost every
biologist that you talk to uses blast so
those of you are familiar with the blast
is is like hyper optimized way of
searching over nucleotides you know
bills are very very compressed index of
them and you can search very very
quickly for things that are kind of like
the protein that you have or the the
sequence that you have so it's a pretty
specific tools a couple different
flavors of it it's not necessarily the
right tool for any job that you have but
because it's so fast and people have
worked so hard on it from a computer
science perspective almost every
biologist crams their idea into the
blast you know
framework so they'll like take the blast
results and then they'll reprocess them
a couple different ways and that'll be
the result but it's almost never the
optimal thing to do if you're a
biologist but because it's so fast they
end up using it so so my idea was that
well Google will has a lot of CPU so let
me to worry that much about optimization
you know don't don't don't tell anyone I
said that you know biologists have lots
of ideas and they don't know how to
optimize necessarily what they want
optimize is for the ideas that they've
had right they want optimized like I've
got this great idea for identifying a
new virus you know or something like
that or or figuring out if a virus is
related to another one or it's going to
involve in a certain way they shouldn't
have to think about the details you
don't have to think about the biological
implications of it not about how to make
it fast enough to run on their little
you know 12 core processor that's
sitting couldn't CPU the 12 CPUs that
are sitting underneath their desk so we
have this this kind of nice compatible
arrangement which is that Google has
lots of server CPUs then have that much
RAM because we keep things loaded like
our search index at all times so in case
we need it you know biologists have lots
of idea they don't have that much money
they can't buy tons of computers and we
kind of put these things together so
actually I managed to get a lot of
people excited about this one I wrote
some code I took what we use for search
indexing we wrote a kind of a couple
modules of it and tried to make it's the
kind of input a you know basically with
Python you drop your scoring algorithm
let's say for your violet you're
matching you want to match them DNA and
then we run it on a much larger cluster
so they didn't have to worry about
scaling it for DNA databases got lots of
people excited about this I went at a
time like I didn't really have much time
to spend on actually turning this into a
real idea but a bunch of other people
did and so what ended up happening was a
couple years later i've been involved in
a while so i won't take any credit for
this part of it but we launched this
thing a couple months ago called
exercycle which is basically we're
giving away a billion core hours of CPU
to researchers to do all kinds of
interesting things everything from like
geospatial imaging medical research
astrophysics computational biology
thankfully stuck with it so this is cool
right i mean like now basically
scientists can find have a prepared a
relatively easy way to leverage the the
computational flower power that google
has google does have to become an expert
in astrophysics which is not really our
area of expertise we can be an expert in
running large data centers and scaling
software and in search of things like
that
so it's kind of a nice end result and I
won't take much credit for the end
result but you know I had a lot of fun
of the beginning so I just want to wrap
up so as I said before you know 12%
times 1 of these like really flexible
things right one of the great things
from Google's perspective is that it
gets a lot of good ideas as you saw at
the beginning we get things like Gmail
we have things like Google News goggles
you know the art project all these
things come out of twenty percent time
they're huge they're fantastic they're
they're profitable they make us a you
know makes a lot of money a lot of happy
users we have a lot of happy engineers
because the engineers get to do
something maybe that's a little outside
of their you know their domain of
expertise they learn something howson
find new projects if they want in flavor
sometimes something that doesn't
necessarily work and I think that as an
organization we accept that you know
there's probably for every for every
goggles there are dozens of live CDs
lying on the ground right and that's
okay and we've kind of accepted that
it's definitely worth it in the end
right it's a great time for
experimentation it's a great time to
kind of have some fun as an engineer
getting the blow off some steam you can
learn something new you can teach you
can do things that aren't even
technically related you know a zach said
a lot of people spend time teaching or
volunteering for mentoring programs you
know things like that you can try
something that's completely different
than what you normally do in your day
job which i think is great and yeah and
you know the recruiting pitches that's a
really great part of working at Google
and I think that that's that's
definitely true it's definitely
something keeps me sane it's good for
the soul you know and it's part of you
know kind of our culture that I think
keeps this kind of fresh and
experimental so anyway so that's it I
think we're gonna take some questions so
thanks
so there are microphones up on the Isles
if anybody is interested just line up
and we'll start off okay um what
determines when a 20-person project is
no longer viable it's a good question
well two things that there's there's two
exits for a 20-percent project one is up
and one is down the the down is often
very clear because the engineer says you
know something this is a bust like live
CD you know it didn't quite go it was
fun i learned something but this wasn't
going to go and the other one is what it
turns like goggles it turns from a
20-percent project into a full-time
project and you know one of the critical
pieces of the puzzle for that is that
the management is expected to be not
just tolerant of twenty percent projects
but supportive ie when you see something
that has gotten the stage where you
think it might go you help it turn from
from you know skunk works into real
works yes kind of how when it when it
goes or what it doesn't i think that as
a manager you have a mentoring
relationship right you know part of
twenty percent is learning when to stop
I think and I've found it's pretty rare
that people don't know when something
isn't going well you know this as nice
as we are at Google you know like and
people are always going to try to give
you some positive feedback you know it
you know it's I've now almost never seen
it so we not really get the message that
something isn't really working out and
people are realest and it's much more
fun to work on something successful so
you know directing them onto something
else that there might be more fun and
successful is usually pretty easy hi
guys thanks for the job um two questions
so question different angle if somebody
is an engineer within Google and they
have an idea for something but they know
that there's some people outside Google
who might be working on it and
interested in that sort of collaboration
part a how would they go about that
would that be tolerated second if
something's on the outside of Google and
they can see synergies and interest for
a great bunch of Engineers and something
they're doing how would they access that
too if you like drop
seed and say hey would you guys be
interested in playing around with this
the easy solution as we hire you I don't
have anybody has an ongoing manager to
that these things are tricky because as
soon as you're dealing with an outside
entity you have to be respectful of
other people's intellectual property
which typically means before you can
start collaborating with somebody you
better have some kind of a contract
contractual contractual relationship in
place and that involves the business
development people and come you know
negotiations and discussions and when
things are in very speculative stage
which is where most twenty percent
projects are that tends not to be a
place where the folks outside are
willing to say oh yeah I'll do this
jointly with google and you know you can
have a license for in perpetuity one of
the one of the reasons why it worked
here in practice is that your time is
paid for by Google and so there's a sort
of a well-understood principle that that
the work that you do on your twenty
percent project is a work made for hire
and it's ultimately Google's so as long
as you're willing to make that deal to
be exploratory and and speculative with
Google's time with Google's you know
nickel and in exchange for that you know
you we get it has it ever happened or is
it just forget about it I don't know
yeah I don't nobody is this i mean
there's certainly things like the art
project that require a lot of external
support but they're the genesis is
within right you know so i mean like
we're newseum open-source coffee that's
true yeah yeah actually a lot of people
do do all go to our stores in a way
that's our twenty percent including open
sourcing technology that is google you
know and putting it out in the world so
I mean we we have lots of people who
contribute to 22 open-source activities
on there twenty percent time that's
certainly quite common forgive me to
just going on very very very simply
where would be a contact point to
continue that conversation ah i think
the committee afterwards
um thank you guys I was wondering if you
had any advice for companies that we're
going to set up their own twenty percent
program and at what stage of company
growth when you set up that here because
me if you're in the startup phase it
would be really kind of challenging to
set that twenty percent program so what
stage of growth would you recommend that
companies set that but i'm not i'm not
convinced the startup stage is a bad
time for twenty percent actually i'd
almost sorry well maybe 20 maybe the
idea is that it start up it's all twenty
percent time you know but but i think
any size company i think you can have
this idea of giving people some free
rein to to try out ideas that they they
have I guess the startup dish to be you
want to be hyper focused on that one
thing you're trying to launch but yeah
if you can find twenty percent stuff
that might help that one thing you know
have different facets that could be cool
you know also you know a start-up is in
this mode where you know everybody is
everybody is focused on the goal for the
for the startup itself so you know that
what that basically means is there's no
turf okay and if if your thing if we're
going to start up together and your
thing needs some of my time it's going
to get it okay so is that twenty percent
time is that a formal thing who knows
yes so to get back to the original
question about what you can do to kind
of encourage twenty percent how to set
it up I think some of the points at the
end we're kind of targeted that like I
think as you know as the leadership of
the company has to be tolerant of
obviously people spending time not on
their main project that's probably the
first hurdle to get over and you get to
be tolerant of failure a lot you know
like you have to be tolerant that this
is despair mental it's storing things
against the wall and seeing what sticks
and I think you have to be supportive of
the engineers both in terms of what is
successful and in terms when it's failed
it fails right so obviously if it fails
you're just forgive and get them going
on something else could I can be
demoralizing what's even more important
be successful to be supportive of the
successes because if someone makes
something that's obviously good and cool
and you squash it because you don't want
them to spend more than twenty percent
of their time on it you know that's
that's actually really i think even
worse than not having twenty percent
time at all so as we were willing to
deal with the the success of twenty
percent you know you'll be willing to
deal with google news come
out you know Google was very small when
Toyland google news came out of probably
only 40 or 50 people at Google at that
point and then they had to get behind it
because it was obviously the right thing
to do then put real engineers from an
engineering power behind it so I think
you have to be willing to cope with both
outcomes two questions is the business
card application of goggles out on the
market yet yeah and this is a separate
app or no no it's it take a picture look
music hub with goggles and it'll offer
to add it to your contacts yeah and then
is there a graveyard of dead twenty
percent projects or way of like putting
live CD together with chrome OS how do
you do that any sort of job yeah i mean
i offered just a bunch of ideas that I
had when when co-wash was getting spun
off but I don't say they'd already
thought of all of them so I mean you
know I think yeah that there's certainly
along this is always there's always a
bunch of people at Google have thought
of interesting things you know with with
whatever your new project is and it's
good to kind of go and talk to them yeah
I don't know that yeah I don't know that
you need to force it necessarily I guess
people documentation really i mean like
we you know I maybe this is just me I
think a lot of people with google are
good yeah use google internally right
use use our internal search everybody
right hip you write down what you did
then someone will find it you know i
think that's part of the best way hi my
name is varmint and my question is at
what point does a 20-percent project
becomes so comparing to the engineer
that the best course of action for that
person or team is to grab all of google
and launch startup and how often does
that happen oh it's mark mark white
house before it doesn't because you know
the work that you do at Google is
Google's so yeah yeah that's kind of the
contract that you sign right is that
you're doing good work it's using
Google's hardware it's using the air
Google's time effectively so yeah that's
kind of the bargain that you make but
the flip side of that bargain is that
you have all the resources of Google you
have all of these machines all of this
technology all the search all of the you
know all the platform to use to make it
make it that much better and other
engineers one of the common things is
you know you get a bunch of your buddies
together to work on your twenty percent
project
with you you know most of them are not
single person things it's often lots of
other people involved yeah arguably it
to start up without any of the risk
because you can work on it you have your
body's free funding yeah no no no
funding problems no no salary problems
you know you can still pay your rent hi
I'm so happy to hear the details of the
arts project because I'm so interesting
art I have a question I'm sure that a
lot of museums and institutions they had
they were worried about kind of the
possibility that there was were kind of
a stolen I mean their pictures by
someone were some kind of institutions
so have you developed any kind of the
protection I need the technology to
prevent someone from stealing the images
or a kind of any intellectual properties
from the website um the museum's keep
the ownership of everything that's up
there um the the we don't have any
particularly aggressive drm machinery in
there that's that hasn't turned out to
be necessary thus the quantity of data
involved is such that that it's
non-trivial to steal so it hasn't been a
huge concern partly because again for
this particular thing the the pictures
that were put up our are sort of very
well-known so it's not like you're going
to come along and say oh look I've got
I've got images of starry night you know
you know if they don't represent any
kind of economic threat to the museums
because the the pieces are too notorious
to be stolen in that way you mentioned
before a project that kind of started
one way ended up some some other way are
there give any examples of the projects
where they actually we're facing failure
it looked like there was no point in it
and then somehow it turned around and
turned into something reason
successful almost every project it has
that experience a budget of not all
mostly recibiste of like you say well
you should know it's this is one's a
failure but they kept going and well
yeah I mean the art project at several
points when we had unsuccessful meetings
with some of the museum's you know there
were those of us who going you know I
don't know if this is going to go guys
it was there were times when you we were
in the dumps you know but you know we
persevered and and it came out well yeah
I mean the biology project was actually
one of those I mean we we had a lot of
support early on and we went one route
you know we had a bunch of excitement
you know exactly what level excitement
about it and went one route to try to
kind of fund it and turn into a real
project and that ended up collapsing and
that's that's the point of which I
drifted off but other people persevered
and it's not becoming an actual you know
a real a real kind of thing so yeah I
don't know yeah yeah I guess the the
spreadsheet project I did there were
other engineers in here worked on it to
there were a few times when we were like
this might not work and we were you know
a year into it and but you know we were
fortunate enough not to our managers
supporter it even threw out there was no
moment where they were like you know
this isn't going to work what's tall
yeah could you clarify you talk about
engineers having twenty percent times
does this apply to non development
engineers user-interface specialist
documentation specialist business
development people yeah as far as I know
yeah well if the the formal program is
in is in the what's called engineering
and operations part of Google which
means basically software engineers sree
which is the folks who run the systems
and product management um biz dev is not
part of an jobs I mean this is I'm sorry
we're getting into bureaucratic detail
here so the answer is it doesn't extend
to everybody but it extends
you essentially the engineering
organization incidentally I find that
people that want to do something twenty
percent like will make the time you know
it's just million the only difference is
really whether it's the eighty percent
to a hundred percent time or is one
hundred percent two hundred twenty
percent of your time right now the
perfect example of that was in fact
there was the health project which we
recently announced that we were shutting
down had a large cast of volunteers from
the sales organization who were donating
their twenty percent time sales doesn't
formally have twenty percent times so so
but you know again as as Andrew observed
if the will is there will generally find
a way l especially from my question is
the only engineer isn't seeing that it's
not how's this channel is the program
changed over time or has it what's sort
of as engineers what sort of
measurements and observations have you
been taking measuring over time and is
there a best practices as someone else
asked earlier is it a publish for
formalized best practice within somewhat
of the formalized program which I'm
hearing does exist someplace you know
should write that down actually yeah we
oh yeah go ahead sorry now those are
good questions the does a dipper office
office and is there competition among
the offices or who which office is most
effective video we don't we don't that I
know of have a fine-grained metrics on
this one of the things that we know as
managers is that the number of people
who choose to participate in twenty
percent projects is always in my opinion
disappointingly small arm that is
there's plenty of them going on and
people are encouraged but I find that I
spend a certain amount of my time
exhorting people to have the you know to
sort of take the time step back from
there eighty percent project and do that
because you know people it's very easy
to be very wrapped up in your
current thing particularly if it's it's
it's gnarly and hard and sort of tricky
technology people often I don't want to
be distracted by that I wanna I'm just
like I'm too focused on this and you
know that's fine we don't force them to
take twenty percent time yeah I also
think it it's kind of like a like a
quantum you know wave function like if
you observe it too closely it's going to
collapse right so I think sorry no
physics jokes yeah okay so I mean like
if you institutionalize it too much
you're going to hurt exactly what it's
trying to encourage which is kind of
disregard for the current you know
framework of things so what we do
measure it in terms of asking people
questions are you taking twenty percent
time you know do you find that it's
encouraged and so unlike that as far as
like formalizing the process by which
you choose a 20-percent project or
having competitions maybe even between
offices I'm not sure about having MSA
observed in here some of that but if it
was it said can't it can't improve it
again measures my visual we have these
those we have a clearinghouse website
internally where people who have ideas
but maybe not time or not the right
skills post suggestions for twenty
percent projects that's particularly
popular with non engineers who would
like engineers to work on things of that
sort so there's a bunch of things of
that sort but you know we would
certainly like to see more of it as much
as increase with quick question for all
you are you wikipedians yes no yes no
what are each of you wikipedians what
does that mean isn't like contribute to
a comedian yes of course I have yes yes
sir yeah so uh I don't have my
membership card on me so one thing I
noticed that like large corporation
sometimes you know ideas you know that
you would kind of be contributing or are
widely accepted but then the the problem
comes into play when you need hardware
or CPU cycles so you know twenty percent
time I get such of your own time but
let's say you're twenty percent project
actually required you know a whole bunch
of Tomcats and Apaches and everything
like that I mean where those going to
come from if they're sometimes probably
CP used you need yeah that's that's
coming I say about Google of its machine
resources you need that's easy like that
was the whole point of the
bioinformatics
type of command oh yeah we have lots of
spare cycles the it's actually probably
the other types of resources like
personal resources UX resources things
like that that are more constrained so
you don't have to kind of get this to
bureaucracy and you know put it through
the different every engineer can run
jobs on any one of our what machine type
of command yeah thank you yeah I have
two questions first is how many so
what's the percentage of new products
that have come through this 20 was an
experiment audience i mean i showed you
getting logos of a bunch of things that
start with twenty percent projects so
it's a substantial number there's not a
lot of top down you know products you
know new product kind of things
obviously like android was you know like
it wasn't to twenty percent project
within google docs i can think of at
least three or four things the document
list the scripting engine the different
editors the technology behind then it
all started as twenty percent stuff
significant yeah my second question is
that these projects start as individual
projects but how exactly does internal
collaboration work for these so you
started as an idea which an engineer
will bring but how do you then
collaborate eternally to grow that idea
yes I mean people sit around you know at
lunchtime and say gee if we did blah and
it's like well yeah we could do that and
then like all of a sudden there's you
know a little set of Java files being
grown and change lists being reviewed
and suddenly there's something going on
a typical thing I think is someone
starts with a demo like it's like
someone will just make something in a
free time and show it to people and
they'll think it's cool and get people
interested and then it kind of takes off
from there yeah we try to have a lot of
encouragement i mean like we have a
weekly actually start on one that I were
talking will squared not for a while
which wasn't quite a 20-percent project
but had lots of sub projects in it that
were kind of spare time things and we
have a weekly beer in demos where we
would kind of for every Friday for 30
grab lunch at a couple six-packs
everyone shows off what they've done and
we've expanded that now the entire
office hat does it every Friday and
other options to pick this up so I mean
like that's a good place like you show
off hey this is the cool thing that I
built and someone comes by Nelson you've
got like six twenty percent is all
working on the same cross checks
so here I was thank you hi I'm Ronald
and first of us want to say great job
with today i love the seeing all the
foot traffic double on the museum so i
was really fascinating and amazing here
it's a great job my question is you know
in regards to one of the responses
earlier you said that is actually like a
database where people can post ideas
they don't have time to work on or if
sometimes of the business people i
posted they can't do it themselves or
how often do you see programmer the
developers really take on one of those
projects or a developer have failed on a
project but another one picks up on it a
few years later and seeing those really
roll out into successes well i don't i
don't know the direct answer to that but
for example we have an annual event here
in New York called sales engine in which
we pair up a salesperson and engineer
for a day and the engineer shadows the
salesperson and just kind of observes
them and listens to them and you know
hangs out with them all day and out of
that over the course of the last several
years have come at least two fairly
substantial new internal products that
have substantially improved the way we
serve the the the customer base and in
the advertising space so you know again
the the the key challenge in all of this
kind of stuff is how do you create how
do you create a connection between a
need and some creativity and
unfortunately it you can't formalize
that too much because as Andrew said if
you if you shine too much of a bright
light on it it disappears so we do we do
what we can to kind of foment that
communication and and sharing and
conversation and then we just hope
things work yeah hi how are you I'm Dan
galanti I just wanted to say I think
you're twenty percent projects are
amazing and my question is how do you
get sales and marketing to collaborate
with you when you come up to an idea how
do you generate that enthusiasm and what
channels do you use me I know you think
it's great but how do you get them in
the world to see your vision like I said
we have this immersion program where we
pair them up
no the the sales guys have their jobs to
do and they live in a world that
engineers don't understand and vice
versa by making them spend a day
together you force them to have a set of
conversations which start out sort of
uneasy you know are you human being yes
I am are you okay and it goes on to a
mean yo and a number of these immersion
relationships have developed into you
know we have lunch once a month we
talked about going on and it has sort of
begun to break down some of the I don't
understand you I don't understand your
language thing that keeps keeps groups
that are in different areas apart you
know is that you know there's no magic
to this people talking to each other
generally break down the barriers so
it's almost like a task force in a way
which more like informal so it's not so
much I'm saying it's not a task force
because we don't set out a goal right
okay we just say talk to one another oh
ho don't know so Google must be a very
unusual organization as it's grown as
local optimization set in and managers
try to get there in place to do their
work and therefore if they're doing too
much work on the twenty percent project
or they're really engaged in the twenty
percent but not as much in the eighty
percent project the manager doesn't do
people get rewarded at an annual review
time based on their twenty percent work
as well as their eighty percent work
that sort of thing goes to yeah it's a
balance yes I mean yeah I would say this
is one of the biggest challenges of
twenty percent is that people who they
feel like it might take away from their
main job and worry that they're not
spending enough time on the main thing
and you worried that your manager
wouldn't support you but you know the as
a manager that's your you're supposed to
support this and it's an important part
of the culture that that you encourage
people to try and get outside of their
normal job so we already know we also
have a lot of managers that were
engineers right I mean like I think that
also helps I mean I you know as a matter
now I recognize the need for twenty
percent time you know and the need for
me I'll have an outlet and the need to
support that so said you have to be very
supportive of that kind of thing and
that the hardest part is when somebody's
project is successful may need to not
on your project anymore and that one is
you know it's tough but you know it's
not as you said it's a global
optimization not a local one so a
partial answer to that is that you know
in our annual performance review process
one of the things that every engineer
does is a self-assessment and one of the
things that you do in your
self-assessment is you you say what did
I do and and so you put your I mean I
put my I put my contributions to the art
project into my self assessment saying I
worked on it so and and so the the
people the the 360 the folks who look
who are appraising me my peers and
colleagues I see that and they say oh
you know how important was his
contribution and all that kind of stuff
and then my manager when he's over of
going over the whole thing i sees the
assertion and the supporting commentary
and takes it into account or not i mean
again it's not one of these things where
you can where you can put a heavy a
heavy metric machine on it because as
soon as that happens you you you begin
to crush it out and what we're pretty
good about is recognizing it so you know
if if you create gmail you know you can
count on the fact that you're going to
be recognized and rewarded or the art
project people have been recognized for
for that quite effectively I remember
orkut was a 20-percent project wasn't it
a race it was it wasn't on your list of
slides was it considered a orphan or
something we we cannot possibly list
every twenty percent project there have
been thousands of they love shore so and
towards of success my social network
Yeah Yeah right I'm sort of talk about
people can have an idea proposed it
start working on it you know they might
have a proof of concept they might get
to a live demo that they can share so
what could you talk a bit more about the
process of how does it go live exposed
to the whole world you know and who
looks at that or what are they looking
for as a hurdle to go from you know it
work it works in one instance internally
several people I've seen it to anybody
in the world can use it and
use it a lot yeah so so one of the ones
in dogs that can think about it started
off for the demo was the the scripting
thing and basically that was just people
within dogs were like this is cool and
we we tend that I think a Google have
the attitude if you have something that
we think is cool let's just throw it out
and see if people actually use it and
for twenty percent stuff it's probably
the same so for this we launched it and
the response was positive and then from
from there you know it sort of got more
support as more people use it it will
take i think we're running out sighs we
will take the last four that are online
and you have to walk away you can you
were one of the four yeah so that Bob
gazelle Terremark just a thought this
21st twenty percent would seem to be in
the constant same constellation as
professional development and the
internal venture cap effectively an
internal venture capital fund of sorts
at what if you're effectively doing is
making sure people stay current and stay
professionally developed and oh yes
develop new ideas without having the
generative bureaucracy to vet them let
be an unfair characterization I think
that's I think that's reasonably fair I
mean you know the the thing we know is
that creativity does not follow
organizational hierarchy lines and and
the part of the whole point of this is
to let that creativity flower without
without uh you know the it's all it's
much too easy for managers to casually
squelch things not even with hostility
but but carelessly and so the elegance
of the twenty percent project concept is
that it it protects things when they're
small and fragile ah and lets them
demonstrate themselves and the flip side
is and this is an interesting question
some ways a pop probably a hot potato a
little bit but if you find people who
don't want to spend twenty percent
do you notice a correlation not just not
clear about people are very deeply
immersed in a particular project but in
a negative ability to keep fresh
professionally now you know I'm we don't
not six month for a year but
consistently are you seeing any prize in
that respect I you know I don't I don't
as a manager pay attention to who's not
doing twenty percent projects I do
exhort them to do it but it you know I
view that as I view that as fertilizing
the field by scattering the fertilizer I
don't go say hey you know Bob you know
why the hell aren't you doing a
20-percent project you got no
imagination I mean that long good weight
as well gee I've seen the reason I vaise
that questions that I've seen a lot of
organizations is pedal to the metal on
actual tasking as a result three to five
years downstream the entire team is
professionally wait at hardware that
burned-out way behind on technologies
and then everybody's looking at
themselves saying well how do we
assimilate this new technology and the
answer is everybody's been at a hundred
and twenty-five percent powerful last
five years there's no time to learn
anything we're now suddenly wiped out
yeah i think twenty percent time is a
better long-term strategy than then
pedal to the metal sir I great
presentation I have a question I come a
protein percent project and it becomes
successful do I get like a bonus or job
security or right certainly yes it so it
doesn't hurt you know like David Petru
who killed with goggles is doing quite
well career-wise and everything like
that you know yeah not going to tell you
what his bonus or anything like that you
know no it's definitely a good thing i
mean i think you get a lot of career
trajectory that google is about being
you know having ownership and having
impact and having you know kind of
breath and responsibility and this is a
great way to kind of get at the ground
level and something that will become
broad and impactful and
have a lot of responsibility yeah hi my
question is have you guys are there any
20-percent projects that try to improve
the delivery of government services or
try to address social challenges that
you guys can cite or are there any
interests as Google allow for that
addressing social challenges there's
lots of that I mean both in terms of
there's there's all kinds of
volunteering things we didn't talk much
about those we really focused on sort of
the creative entrepreneurial kinds of
things in most of the questions but but
in addition for example there's a team
that's now part of org that's called
crisis response that had its genesis in
arm in some people going in response to
the big earthquake in Haiti not long ago
AG we should be godet we should go down
there and see what we can figure out to
do to help okay we didn't have any idea
quite what we could do to help some
interesting things like people finder
came out of that um but that had as its
genesis some of the same twenty percent
approach to things whether it was
formally twenty percent or not in its in
its starting instant I don't know
exactly but there's there's a lot of
that I mean I was involved in one for
Hurricane Katrina same thing actually it
didn't actually get turned into a
project unfortunately so we had to do it
all over again for a quick in Japan and
Haiti and other things like that but
yeah those things happen a lot the one
of us food trends also came out of which
i think is another good example of that
sort of thing those usually end up with
the org that were certainly is a good
place for that kind of you know not and
yeah I guess what would usually called
nonprofit kind of you know kind of
things yeah thank you this is this
question is in the context of just
professional development and not
business if you will but and it's a
subjective question is how have you seen
just from the it sounds like these
projects are someone gets a very
accelerated view of product development
from the idea to go through the steps of
launching it which may be on a big
project there in one piece of that cycle
how did have you seen it kind of affect
people just in general how they approach
things afterwards after having had this
very different experience not just in
what they focused on but the breadth of
what they end up focusing on yeah well
go back to the example of david from
goggles i mean he was always kind of an
inventive entrepreneurial kind of person
otherwise he probably wouldn't have done
this sort of thing in the first place
but you know he's he has a lot of these
skills now not only is he I think a
better people person you know like he
was a very heads down kind of engineer
but this is exposed him to having to
deal you know not only with the
inception as you said of a project but
selling it getting support for it
understanding how it fits and
organizationally corralling other kinds
of resources UX resources you know a
product resources biz dev all those
kinds of things so I think yeah you're
right it's very much the successful ones
are very much education get to the point
before about kind of being like venture
capital it's also like being an
entrepreneur I think within within
Google cuz I guess what I really mean is
most of them are probably unsuccessful
in terms of you know commercializing and
but yet people have this experience that
may may be very just valuable in the
long run and I'm more asking about that
than the huge successes we think it in
it encourages a healthy attitude towards
risk-taking which which we think is
crucial to career development in general
I think that one of the ways in which
Google is different from the average
bear technology firm is that we try to
really foment a a sort of an
entrepreneurial spirit which is you know
people could generally believe it's not
possible in a large corporation and you
know
we Google we sort of view ourselves as
an ongoing experiment how do you in fact
grow without losing that kind of spirit
and culture and this is one of our ways
of trying to preserve the creative
spirit well thank you all very much for
your time attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
