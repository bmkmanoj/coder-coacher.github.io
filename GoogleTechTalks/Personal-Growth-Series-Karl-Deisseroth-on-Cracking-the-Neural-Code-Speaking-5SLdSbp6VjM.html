Google you
again I'd like to start first by
acknowledging ng D you and MCS events
who have really helped us get this event
going it's my honor to welcome our guest
speaker Karl Deisseroth who will be
speaking about cracking the neural code
because he's such an honored guest we
have another honored guest to introduce
him John Hennessy who's the president of
Stanford so I get to introduce John and
we decided not to make the line any
longer than that president Hennessy has
been on the faculty at Stanford since
1977 in electrical engineering and
computer science is a pioneer in
computer architecture and that's is
currently or recently working on the
architecture of high-performance
computers very widely published has
received many awards and is also on the
board of directors at Google enough
enough enough so Stanford in case you're
not familiar is a small College just up
the road and Google University just as a
for a second helps Google employees
develop cross-functional skills
including leadership management
fundamental business and professional
skills and our school of personal growth
which is sponsoring this lecture helps
Googlers develop their full potential on
all levels and has a particular interest
in applied neuroscience so that's really
one of the reasons we wanted to have
this happen please welcome John Hennessy
so at the time around the world where
universities have to be thinking about
attacking and going after the most
ambitious the biggest challenges we face
it was 50 years ago that Watson and
Crick published their DNA paper and
since then the work that's gone on on
DNA on genomics and the human genome and
more recently on functional genomics has
revolutionized medicine not only laid
the foundation for science but changed
the way we think about treating lots of
diseases and we're still in the infancy
of that revolution I think it's a time
when before us stands the challenge of
building the same scientific base for
the human mind so we understand the
process of going from neurons to full
cognition doing that will require lots
of innovation and lots of new research
but I think one of the most important
steps forward in doing this and building
up that knowledge which then will allow
us to build the therapies that we really
need to attack diseases of the brain one
of the most important steps is bringing
together teams of scholars across the
range of disciplines that will be
necessary not only basic neuroscientists
but people who work in cognitive
neuroscience who work in psychiatry who
work in psychology work in computer
science who can begin to put together
that model to crack than the neural code
I think in order to do this one needs
some real breakthroughs in how you
monitor understand and stimulate the
human brain and the talk you're gonna
hear from Karl today I think is one of
the most important new breakthroughs we
have for being able to monitor and
stimulate human brain activity Karl got
his undergraduate degree at Harvard
before seeing the light and coming to
the west coast he did his MD PhD at
Stanford in our neuroscience program
he's currently a faculty member with a
joint appointment in our new
bioengineering department and in
psychiatry and most recently was winner
of one of the very distinguished NIH
directors pioneer Awards this is some of
the most exciting work I've seen going
on in neuroscience it's gonna relay the
whole map for the discipline so I have
to get out of the way and let Carl talk
about it thank you very much John and I
have to say the work we've done it
couldn't have been done anywhere else
but Stanford and I'll show you why
that's true as we go along but it's
really a an amazing place to work I had
my first tour of Google this morning and
also clearly a similar thing here I was
an early adopter of Google so I'll take
a little credit for that but you've got
a great thing going here as well it's
wonderful to be here I am in
bioengineering and psychiatry both I see
patients one day a week most of the time
I'm in my bioengineering laboratory
though that's an unusual combination you
don't hear those in the same sentence
too much but I think the time is is
right for that in psychiatry and in
neurology there's something wrong with
the high speed dynamics of the system
and we need better tools and better
technology to probe and understand
what's going on but even beyond disease
clearly the brain does wonderful
mysterious things and what we lack is
technology that allows us to gain deep
insight so it all comes back ultimately
to technology the technology we've
developed is called optogenetics and in
a way it has its roots back in some sort
of visionary ideas that Francis Crick
Watson and Crick that that you just
heard about he said what we need in
neuroscience is we need a way to drive
all the neurons of just one type in the
brain and leave the other ones on
altered and this is because the brain is
a it's like an orchestra there's an but
with all the different instruments
intermixed and so you've got the
bassoons and the Piccolo's and the the
the harps all intermixed and there's no
way until very recently to to really
conduct this and to generate music to
control the different players
individually crick foresaw that and this
was in a Scientific American article
back in 1979
and I think and what really an amazing
turn of events the what's allowed us to
make headway on this challenge is with
tools from microbes from from algae from
single-celled algae from ancient forms
of bacteria that live in rare and
fragile ecological niches and I'll tell
you about how that works it's really an
unforeseen turn of events that's really
been uplifting now come back to this
issue as to why the brain is so
difficult we have within our brain many
different functions that are controlled
by many different elements many
different cell types if you just think
about one particular structure the
hypothalamus this is a tiny little
structure deep in the brain if you zoom
in the scale bar here is 50 microns 15
millionths of a meter you see some red
and green cells that are labeled here
all intermixed well in the hypothalamus
look at all the different things that
the hypothalamus does it controls sleep
hunger thirst sex growth temperature
fear social bonding and actually many
more and all the different neurons all
the different cell types that do this
are intermixed so you can't stick in an
electrode and just drive one you'd get
all of these going at once okay so no
one wants to be a teenager again right
so that
and the red and the green ones here are
happened to be the ones for thirst and
social bonding what we need is a way to
to truly conduct the circuit and if as I
alluded to if you put in an electrode
you drive the cells you want to target
and the cells you don't want to target
and this applies to basic science
figuring out what the brain is doing but
it also applies to treatments to
therapies you'll get the therapeutic
effect from one but you'll get
side-effects from the other the way the
optical approach works is that we make
just the cell type we want
photosensitive sensitive to light and we
can deliver the light with fiber optics
and we can control just the cell type
you want and leave the other one
unaltered and so this is this is a
large-scale effort it's almost a
Manhattan Project it's how do you how do
you bring together an immense diversity
of ecological tools of computer science
tools of optics of behavior of
psychiatry and neurology how do you
bring these all together and in a common
enterprise to make this sort of effort
work and there are three components to
it one is bioprospecting mining
evolutionary and ecological diversity
for the tools that we need and Nature
has made wonderful things reverse
engineering applying the control tools
we have and the readout tools we have to
try to infer what sort of computations
what sort of motifs are present in the
brain and finally of course this is
relevant to just the basic science how
does it work but you'll see it how
important the implications are for
disease as well so here they are these
are our unlikely allies this is
basically pond scum this is
Chlamydomonas Ryan Hardy I it's a sink
that's a plant
it's a single-celled algae and it has a
chloroplast at photosynthesizes uses
light to generate energy and it has
flagella so it swims around in
freshwater ponds so it uses light for
its own purposes it doesn't care about
the brain it doesn't care about the
neural code but it uses light for its
own purposes and I'll show you how we
can coop that this is an archive Actium
a very very ancient form of
these forms of life live they've been
sort of shouldered out they live in only
very difficult challenging niches in the
world they live in very high temperature
environments hot springs or they live in
very severe salt conditions as this one
does and they use light because it's one
of the few resources they have around
and they use light in order to do things
like move ions around and that turns out
to be very useful for us as well and the
reason is this they make proteins they
make small nanoscale devices that
basically act as antennas that receive
light and transduce the light signal
into ion flow here sodium and calcium
ions the one from pond scum is called
CHR to our channel rhodopsin - it's a
single protein that inserts into the
surface of a cell this is represents the
positive ions into the cell it does this
for its own reasons it does this so it
can learn to turn toward light as being
a plant it has to do that well this
happens to be more neural code for on if
you have a cell and you drive positive
ions into the cell this is the currency
of information flow in the brain and it
means on it means active so that's
fortunate for us the archaea bacterium
is it acts as an antenna for yellow
light it makes another protein that
responds to yellow light and it pumps in
a negative ion an anionic chloride well
this happens to be neural code for off
and so we were able to co-opt these
these tools for our own purposes here's
a close up of what channelrhodopsin-2 x'
source the algae looks like it's got a
chloroplasts this is how it
photosynthesizes it makes light it makes
energy from light and it has a nice spot
to detect light and it has flagella that
it uses to swim around now it actually
it's pretty cute it rotates on its long
axis when it local boats and so it's ice
pot spins around so if lights coming
from one side it's got an oscillating
light signal that it needs to make sense
of and it doesn't have a brain to
process that it doesn't have a it's a
single cell and so it needs to be
very efficient and you'll see this theme
show up again and again these microbes
have to do everything all in one package
and they have to be efficient and so
what it does is it makes a very fast
light sensor that transduces the signal
into ion flow now we took this we use
genetic tricks we took this light
activated channel and we put it into
neurons neurons from the brain here in
neurons from a rat brain and the scale
bar here is about 50 microns 50
millionths of a meter and what you see
here are the outlines of three neurons
we put this into these cells and we
tagged it with a yellow fluorescent
protein the Nobel Prize was just given
for a green fluorescent protein a few
weeks ago this was given to Marty Cioffi
and Roger Tsien this is just a static
imaging tool we tagged this channel with
a fluorescent protein so we can see
where it goes in the cell and it goes to
the surface so it's act that's right on
the membrane right where we want it and
this was the most amazing thing we
couldn't believe this when we tested it
out we give these millisecond scale
pulses of blue light as shown here by
the blue dashes and these sawtooth
deflections these are what are called
action potentials or spikes this is the
currency of information flow in the
brain so with pulses of blue light we
can now start to speak the language of
neurons and because it's a single gene
we can now target at different cells and
we can now start to control them with
light now can we get this working in
freely moving animals well what we have
here is a mammal a freely moving mammal
what a fiber-optic it's all externalized
here so you can see it this can be
internalized these fiber optics that we
use we can use 50 microns 100 microns
diameter fiber optics we can target any
area of the brain we can go deep
superficial we can have multiple of
these fibers and so I want to show you a
movie a movie of a mouse where we put
the fiber-optic in the right side of its
brain
and you may know the right side of the
brain controls the left side of the body
controls movement toward the left side
of the world and in the surface of the
brain there is if there's a six layered
neural network it's called the neocortex
six layers one on top of the other we
used a genetic trick to just label layer
five and what you'll see if this movie
plays you'll see now why isn't playing
Oh wonderful you'll see this animal
circling and I'll play it again we turn
off the light here and it stops okay so
we made this animal really want to turn
I'm gonna play it again so you can see
it again from the beginning you can't
see the fiber-optic because it's so
light and thin you'll see a little blue
light reflectance from the skull when
the light goes on let's play this again
so just in layer five you can see he's
just exploring and right about here
you'll see the little blue light turn on
and he'll start to really want to turn
left
you can see it's he's normal locomotion
doesn't appear distressed and he stops
right here when we turn it off goes
right back to exploring so that's one
although that's a little scary right I
mean here's a freely moving animal that
we've induced to really really want to
turn left and this this is something you
could never do with an electro just
driving that layer that layer five here
at 20 Hertz 20 times a second and
because it's a fiber we can target any
area of the brain and this is something
that we do quite routinely so I'm going
to come back to this this issue again
what are the what are the ethical
implications what are the philosophical
implications but also what are the the
positive implications the medical
aspects and the basic science aspects
now this is only one axis of control
this is using blue light to drive things
to excite things but I can tell you this
is just the tip of the iceberg okay
what's illustrated here is sort of an
artist's rendition of the kind of thing
we can do we can search the sequence of
letters here is an amino acid sequence
of a protein we use search tools which
you are very good at here we use search
tools to go look through genomic
information and find novel tools we can
predict from a sequence whether they'll
respond to blue light to yellow light to
green light and we're starting to build
a palette of different channels of
control that can all work together at
the same time and so then we can truly
start to play the role of a conductor
drive different cells in synchrony out
of synchrony as we wish and this is a
new kind of algae called Volvox I'll
show you a picture of that shortly the
amazing thing is that life in all its
complexity bacteria archaea these are
the archaea bacteria and eukaryotes we
live here this is a relatively small
unimportant branch all of these use
external signals for information and for
energy but the microbes do at best they
do it most efficiently because they're
small they don't have much space for
different genes so they have to do
everything in one gene they have to be
compact
and maybe even more importantly than
that they're incredibly diverse and so
in every niche every spot where life can
exist there is life each spot has its
own source of energy its own unique set
of environmental information and I can
guarantee for virtually every kind of
energy every kind of information out
there whether it be magnetism pH light
there's a microbe out there that spent
millions of years designing a beautiful
antenna for that source of information
and so the goal is to actually extend
this and expand this to - sound -
magnetism - to other wavelengths of
light and this is a form of
bioprospecting but with a clear focused
goal to develop the palette of tools we
need to truly start to speak the
language that we need to understand and
control the brain now I mentioned green
fluorescent protein and I mentioned this
is of just a fluorescent protein this is
something we use as a tool in the lab
this is it's been around for about 15
years we didn't discover it it was
discovered by Marty Cioffi at Columbia
and as I said he just got the Nobel
Prize for that but it was shared with
Roger Tsien at San Diego and why was it
shared Roger Tsien made redshifted
versions of it he made yellow
fluorescent protein he made red
fluorescent protein now these are not
control tools like the tools from the
microbes I'm telling you about these are
just anatomical things they let you see
things they're just static fluorescent
things that let you track and trace
where cells are but why did Roger Tsien
share in the Nobel Prize just for making
redshifted versions of it that doesn't
seem that much of a big advance well
actually it is because the power of
having this this palette now gives you
combinatorial imaging so you can now see
where do things overlap where do they
intersect when do they share properties
when do they not share properties and
that has turned out to be such a big
advance that it was certainly worthy of
the recognition that he got so with
channelrhodopsin-2
this source of control and we're
fundamentally different from this and
that it's control now can we also
develop shifted versions of this and
start to actually play things in and
complex patterns well this the Natrona
Moniz Fairey onus halo
Dobson is starts to get us down that
path and you can see it responds to
yellow light it pumps in chloride ions
and where does it come from it comes
from a fascinating geological set of
structures these are salt lakes in the
Sahara Desert in Egypt and these are
constantly forming and evaporating
they're fusing and disappearing and they
achieve very high salt concentrations
two to three molar so this is extremely
concentrated not much can live there
except for these little archaea bacteria
and they can live there because they've
evolved these pumps they evolved these
pumps to control their ion gradients and
to use their ion gradients to generate
energy so we did the same thing we took
the halorhodopsin the chloride ion pump
and we put it into neurons in fact we
even put into neurons where we have the
blue light activator the
channelrhodopsin we put them in the same
cells at the same time and then look at
these little sawtooth deflections we can
drive these action potentials these
spikes of blue light pulses and we can
shut them off with yellow light because
remember negative ions coming in that's
neural code for off so bi-directional
control different channels well now you
say well that's one color on one color
off
let's have we need two colors on right
we also need that because we'd like to
drive to positively drive cells in
synchrony or out of sync and we've taken
steps toward that as well we found this
Volvox channelrhodopsin and this is a
fascinating little algae it's actually
not a single-celled algae it's
multicellular and it comes in these
spheres it's more of a social algae you
know it's they they live together they
cooperate it's called the fierce roller
because it's it's spherical I like it it
has sort of a rotational form of
locomotion but it turns out and we found
this in looking through this is just an
illustration of what the genes look like
this is in the amino acid sequence of
the genes what it looks like and we went
in and we found this one it's called V
CHR one Volvox channelrhodopsin and it
had some subtle differences compared to
the other ones that we'd seen and in
fact you could predict that it would be
redshifted
and indeed it was this is an action
spectrum we call this an action spectrum
this is the wavelength of light that
works to excite the channel and blue
light activates the older one the
channel at opsin - you can see 470
nanometers that's blue well out on round
green that's about 525 nanometers and so
you can see and we can use this tail out
here of the vc HR 1 action spectrum the
Volvox channel Dobson spectrum we can
use this tail out here to drive it that
doesn't touch the channelrhodopsin-2
itself and we put this into neurons and
we use yellow light out on that tail and
look at this we can drive these spikes
now with yellow light 589 nanometers
this is a wavelength that doesn't touch
the other one the earlier tool at all so
now we've got multiple channels of
excitation as well as excitation
inhibition starting to build the pallet
of tools and this is all just light okay
not even starting to get into the other
forms of energy the other modalities
that are relevant now but looking at
them all together so now we've got the
blue light activator the yellow light
inhibitor the green light activator and
these share a number of very important
properties that make them very useful
for translation to to use in mammals and
their single component this is
incredibly important for delivering them
for technical reasons to get them to
work well we can target them to
individual cell types we can tune them
wavelength tune them we can do
combinatorial control the fact they
respond to redshifted light allows us
redshifted light penetrates deeper into
tissue so we can access deep structures
that way they work in behaving mammals
there fast millisecond scale this is
crucial the brain operates on the
millisecond scale so without that it's
hopeless this is why drugs pharmacology
they have so many side effects they
usually don't have the effect you want
because they're not operating on the
appropriate timescale
there's no dark activity nothing happens
until you turn on the light the light
power that they are that they use one to
ten milli watts per square millimeter
this is tolerated and this is because
they come from biology and so it's
designed of course to be compatible with
life these are made and used by biology
and you don't have to add
are there cofactors to make them work so
a lot of very important properties and
again we couldn't have done it without
without nature so this is this is only
the tip of the iceberg we're expanding
the search now scaling it up looking not
just for light but for antenna and these
nanoscale antennas that were able to
respond to other modalities of energy
and information so that's the sort of
the first leg of it the bioprospecting
leg and you can see the the sort of
progress that's been made now of course
the next step is to try to use fast
control tools and fast readout tools and
and and try to infer what neural
circuits are doing now let me pose a
really fascinating question for you so
this is the brain this wrinkled
structure that you see when you look at
the brain is actually only part of the
brain it's called the neocortex and this
is the six layered structure that sort
of sits like a coating on top of the
brain all the wiring is inside the six
layered set of layers that cover the
brain these are layers of cells of cell
bodies and they send out axons or wires
that connect them to other cell types
that's all in the middle but the coating
is on the outside the brain is
specialized it does different things in
different regions this is the back of
the brain this is the occipital lobe
it's specialized for vision and so all
vision all visual sensory input ends up
here gets processed this is the temporal
lobe this is involved in auditory
processing but also in mood and in
memory this is the parietal lobe this is
involved in calculation and spatial
rotations and integrating sensation this
is the frontal lobe this is where
planning executive function motivation
all reside where motor output resides
totally different roles here's the
paradox you go in and look at these with
a microscope and they look exactly the
same okay you look at the neocortex here
for visual input and you look at the
neocortex here for planning motor output
it looks almost exactly this
subtle variations and the thickness of
the layers but the players are all there
it's a six layered structure same cell
types same wiring same thing here and
this mystery is also a clue and it's
sort of analogous to what John alluded
to with the double helix it's the same
kind of commonality that you see in the
use of DNA and you see in the use of the
of the double helix based genetic code
it's the same code in virtually all
forms of life some subtle variations and
some forms of course incredible
diversity in life but clearly there's a
common theme a common motif that
underlies how the genetic code works
it's got to be a similar thing here
different court different areas of
cortex do totally different things but
the same fundamental structure there's
got to be an underlying motif an
underlying dynamical code that is
accessible and understandable here's an
illustration of what this looks like on
a slightly finer scale these are the six
layers of cortex one two three four five
six information comes in from a
structure called the thalamus it comes
in here hits layer four its layer five
gets up sent up to layer the superficial
layers near that the top gets set down
to the deep layers near the bottom and
then it gets output back to the thalamus
where a motor output behavior is
expressed but it looks the same same
basic structure same basic cell types no
matter where you look so the schematic
the microscopy doesn't tell us enough it
tells us the players but it doesn't tell
us what the circuits really doing for
that we need dynamics we need to play in
complex patterns of stimulation and we
need to read out complex patterns of
output and that's a black box okay so
what there is is there's a black box in
there we don't know what it's doing we
might be able to turn this into a gray
box relatively soon have some rough
models that we can start to fit the data
to but the key thing is to have fast
play in and this is another illustration
here driving spikes with blue light
pulses knocking them out with yellow
light
this millisecond scale control we can
now use to play in complex patterns of
activity at Stanford we and our
colleagues are developing fast readouts
as well electrode based imaging based
and behavior based to get the readouts
to see what the circuits doing and the
goal is to turn the black box into a
gray box and then finally to understand
what the underlying dynamical motifs are
that are present in the brain this is an
illustration of how this can work what's
shown here this is an entire rodent
brain so you can get a sense from the
scale it's sort of on the centimetres
scale we can play in complex patterns of
activity just as you would do if you're
conducting an orchestra playing in
different colors of light funneling
through fiber optics we're getting
increasingly precise control the spatial
pattern of activity we can do we can get
readouts from the structure we can do
electrical recording from candidate
downstream structures we can do imaging
to get fast readouts and most
importantly we really know what it means
because we can do behavior as well we
can have freely moving animals and we
can see what the real consequences on
the behaving animal are so that's the
the second leg of this which is the
reverse engineering leg and the final
leg that I think is is for me one of
them not not that the other aspects are
not interesting but one of the most
satisfying for me is the potential for
medical translation and here's here's
the problem we have with the brain is
this is the paradigm of
neurotransmitters soup or the chemical
imbalance and I'm sure you've all heard
of this when you have someone who's
depressed is that person does that does
that person not have enough serotonin or
if someone is hearing voices do they
have too much dopamine
okay and this treats the brain as if it
were just a soup of chemicals without
millisecond precision without complex
structure and this is why medications in
psychiatry and neurology they have
serious side effects they help some
people absolutely but they also don't
help many more people and
they don't fit they don't fit they don't
speak the language of the brain
here's epidemiology which i think is
underappreciated this these are numbers
to the United Nations the World Health
Organization has quantified the fraction
of disability worldwide worldwide or in
the Americas similar in both
distributions the fraction of disability
worldwide caused by neurological and
psychiatric disease and you can see it's
the red pie slices it's enormous
these diseases are are often fatal
they're hard to treat they're chronic
and we just don't understand that we
just don't have good models and we just
don't have the technology to generate
good models and this is a targeting the
hypothalamus is actually interesting
paradigm to show you that we can
actually make headway on medical
applications medical control so I showed
you this image before this is the
hypothalamus and you've got two
different kinds of neurons all
intermixed well we did a study to see if
we could control the neurons that were
involved in sleep and sleep regulation
remember that was one of those things
that the hypothalamus does there's a
disorder called narcolepsy which you
might have heard about it's studied at
Stanford outstanding and pioneering work
done there there are neurons embedded
within the hypothalamus called the
hypocretin neurons also known as the
orexin neurons and they play they're
thought to play a role in in narcolepsy
when you lack these cells you whether
you're a human being or actually the
animals that lack the receptor for the
protein made by these cells you have the
tendency to fall asleep particularly
when you get excited you fall asleep and
this is a serious debilitating disorder
well we went in we put the
channelrhodopsin the blue light
activated probe just into the hypocretin
neurons that are involved in in in wake
and this is what it looks like we just
put a fiber optic down we used a couple
hundred micron diameter fiber-optic went
all the way down to the hypothalamus
we did simultaneous EEG to look at the
brain waves and we had a freely moving
Mouse
and what you'll see here this is an EEG
just focus on this one here this is an
EEG of an animal and here's where we
give blue light stimulation at 20 Hertz
and you can see a few seconds later
timescale here at 10 seconds this starts
to change now this may not look too
different to you this little stretch
here compared to here but if you look at
enough of these and you quantify this
this is lower in amplitude and look the
animals waking up this is the muscle
graph indicating that it's starting to
move around so we can actually drive
awakening we can drive this complex
behavioral state transition just using
blue light just by driving hypocretin
neurons that are intermixed with all
these other cell types and the
hypothalamus that do all these different
things and so this has very important
implications for narcolepsy but also
just as a proof of principle that we can
now start to apply this to medical
problems another major class of medical
translation has to do with deep brain
stimulation this is where you put an
electrode you actually place an
electrode within the brain there's a
wire running down the neck and there's a
battery and a controller in under the
clavicle in the chest wall just like a
pacemaker battery would be and this is
used in Parkinson's disease it's also
used in depression and although it
doesn't work for everybody and although
it causes some side effects some really
interesting things are seen when you put
this into an area of the brain that's
probably involved in mood you can see as
soon as the electrode turns on and you
drive it at a 130 Hertz 130 times a
second depressed patients report things
like this sudden calmness or lightness
disappearance of the void this classic
depression symptoms of emptiness void
goes away in many patients not all or
even most but some when the electrode
goes on the void goes away now think
about that you know because this is you
know as you will know a lot of these
things the low energy loss of hope void
emptiness these are hard things to
express they're hard things to quantify
but they're real they're fatal and they
underlie an immense source of this
ability worldwide and this actually
starts to show us that these are real
tangible things that the biology is
there it's accessible it's not good
enough with the electrode although it's
it's wonderful work but it's not good
enough doesn't help enough patients
quickly enough and it can't have side
effects it's dose limited but this is
really really important it's an
important proof of principle that were
headed down the right path heightened
awareness increased interest
connectedness brightening of the room
sharpening of visual details I've talked
to Helen neighbor who's done this work
she says patients start wanting to clean
out their garage or plan a trip to Italy
you know so of course within reason you
don't want to do too much of this but
but think about this is quite profound
130 Hertz well that's that's can't be
the neural code for happiness right
that's that's that's too simple and it
indeed it is but it's it shows that that
major psychiatric or neurological
symptoms are accessible that maybe some
of the problems have to do with activity
not getting through a bottleneck and the
bottleneck can be tweaked in a
relatively a simple fashion like this
vagus nerve stimulation this is another
way of getting to it the vagus nerve is
a nerve that runs from the brain down
the neck to the rest of the body
there are also nerves that run up
through the vagus nerves in the body
back to the brain so it's like a
superhighway you can actually access the
brain through the vagus nerve without
actually doing brain surgery and so this
has been used for epilepsy and
depression you put a little cuff around
the vagus nerve battery pack in the
chest wall but you have a lot of side
effects again and this is because
electrodes are accrued and nonspecific
look at the rate of side-effects voice
alteration it starts to sound
strangulated when the device goes on
that's because you're activating all the
the throat neurons the laryngeal neurons
Koff difficulty breathing difficulty
swallowing neck pain okay so it can work
but side-effect limited because
electrodes are imprecise
these are huge disorders everything
that's in principle accessible treatable
with electrical stimulation you look at
the list here depression chronic pain a
B C D OCD addiction Alzheimer's
Parkinson's very common very costly we
know where the foci of these disorders
are we know approximately where to go
but the electrodes are not quite good
enough and don't quite take us there and
I want to touch on getting getting
toward the end now I want to touch on
recent work from my lab on Parkinson's
disease so here's two individuals with
Parkinson's disease it's a very serious
disorder more than a million Americans
have it it's got a chronic course it's
ultimately fatal in many patients one of
the key symptoms is slowing down
you can't move quickly eventually your
gait just becomes sort of a tiny stepped
shuffling gait serious tremor sort of a
five Hertz tremor progresses to dementia
depression and death very very serious
disease what happens is there's a set of
neurons that live in a part of the brain
that's deep called the substantia nigra
because with a particular stain they
look black and this these are the
dopamine neurons in the brain and they
get lost in Parkinson's disease they
disappear and that gives us a you know
we know we know that a particular cell
type is missing or not working well but
it doesn't tell us yet exactly how to
intervene and we don't know if we did
know we'd know how to treat this we
don't know exactly how to intervene to
help most patients now deep brain
stimulation is done for Parkinson's
disease you can put the electrode and
downstream brain structure drive it at a
hundred thirty Hertz and hope for the
best
well that works actually you know in a
significant fraction of patients you get
recovery from the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease the problem is it
doesn't work for everybody it stops
working after a while and it is side
effect limited and so again can we take
this to the next level can we provide
instead of doing a crude 130 Hertz
stimulation the brain can we start to
actually fix the dynamics of neural
circuits in a coherent way
and here's an illustration we actually
you know I use the word deconstruction
here this is this is this is really what
we're doing we target the
light-sensitive proteins to all the
different elements of the circuit
sequentially we march through them one
by one and we find the right tweak the
right knob to turn that corrects the
disorder here's the path of a mouse
before during and after that the optical
treatment that we did when we found the
right circuit element and this has taken
over about a minute you can see remember
brady kinesia slow movement that's one
of the core symptoms of Parkinson's
barely moves at all ten centimeters only
before we go in and we drive the right
circuit element we found the right one
after a lot of searching a lot of our
early efforts didn't work but at low
commodes quite readily once we turn on
the light then we turn the light off and
it's back to the parkinsonian state and
so this for us was a really wonderful
validation of the basic principle of
deconstructing circuits not just for
basic science but for also for medical
translation and again the goal really is
to march through the disease circuitry
whether it be depression whether it be
Parkinson's and understand how the
dynamics are often how they can be
tweaked and tuned to correct the
disorder so these three legs the
bioprospecting the reverse engineering
and the medical translation you can see
how how they stand together but but how
broad they are on different fronts you
need genomic experts you need people who
are very good with search with DNA very
good microbial biology this is a very
important engineering computer science
Electrical Engineering concept medical
translation physicians people who are
familiar with disease models and this
sort of broad effort I think is the kind
of thing that can help sort of really
unify a large organization and toward a
common goal for us it's a very exciting
moment now there are ethical
implications as well you know anytime
technology takes a big step there are
serious
there should be serious philosophical
consideration of what's really going on
what can we control well getting back to
the hypothalamus this is where all our
priorities are okay we're all our needs
our desires our that tells us how much
we want of something what we want and
how much we want and that being
accessible now that's a serious issue
now as you can see as nice as the fiber
optics are this is not the kind of thing
that can be projected from you know a
thousand miles away okay it's not it's
not the level of a weapon and nor do we
intend it to be a it's not really
suitable for that but it has in addition
to that sort of level of concern in
addition to the scientific issues we can
address and the potential ethical
concerns there are philosophical
concerns you know this is if what we
really want if our needs are really
tunable by a particular cell that's
present in a certain level in a
particular structure of the brain does
that have implications for understanding
what it really means to Watson want
something what desires are what what
priorities are and these things I think
have to be considered along the way and
these are there again we have wonderful
colleagues at Stanford who are very good
along with us communicators on this
issue last last slide to two final
thoughts and this to me is this is what
I feel most passionate about these these
tools come from basic science from
people who just studied for decades
these organisms because they thought
they were interesting without a thoughts
application without a thought to
medicine much less neurology or
psychiatry okay so these were you know
we didn't discover these organisms we
discovered the use of them for
neuroscience for application to science
but without the decades of work by the
people who had studied these we wouldn't
have made much progress and so I think
it's an immensely important testament to
the value of basic science that that be
allowed to proceed to be encouraged to
proceed
this is the other point ecological
diversity many of these come from rare
or fragile ecological niches you know
there'd be no particular reason to worry
about a salt lake in Egypt right except
on general principles and so I think
what comes out of this knowing that
tools arise from rare and fragile things
that's I think it points us to what what
can we do to preserve the the rare and
the fragile and the weak and so I just
want to conclude there and I thank you
all for your attention
I'll be happy to take any questions and
chat with people
feel free to email me uh you know yes
yeah it's a great question I didn't have
time yeah I will create it it's a great
question the question was how do we
target these probes to specific cells in
the brain I didn't have time to touch on
that what we use is we capitalize on the
fact that different cell types in the
brain have different jobs and they make
different proteins for those jobs and so
different cells will make protein a and
not protein B they do that using DNA
there are little bits of DNA called
promoters which govern expression of
protein a only in that cell type a lot
of these are known and we know more and
more of them all the time so we take
that little bit of DNA called a promoter
which this cell uses to make sure only
protein a and not B is expressed in the
cell we take that little bit of DNA
called a promoter and we use a genetic
trick we attach it to the DNA that
encodes for our light activated protein
and we put that whole complex back into
the brain so that whole complex goes
into many different cells in fact it
goes into all the cell's
but the promoter that governs production
of things is only on is only active in
the particular cell type that needs to
make protein a so that's a trick we
capitalize on the fact that cells
already have genetic tools to make sure
proteins only get turned on in one cell
type and not another cell type yes
yes yes that's right so once we put
these two bits of DNA together how do we
get them back into the brain this
actually is the easiest part of the
whole thing it sounds like the hardest
but at this point this is easy and we do
this with things called AAA these these
are called adeno-associated virus 'as we
all have them we expose them all the
time these are part of normal cold
viruses but we we tweak them so they no
longer can cause cold symptoms and they
don't longer can reproduce and we put
the DNA in there these are now widely
used in people to deliver genes there
was just a study in in The Lancet
published using this kind of system to
deliver a different kind of gene for
human beings with Parkinson's disease
they're very safe they're well tolerated
something to be careful of when thinking
about translation to people but it's
it's being done and actually this is
this is right now it's the least least
difficult part of the whole thing yes
what can we do with look well you know
as I've said this the the people here in
in so many ways touch on different
aspects of this you know the we do need
better ways to search genomes and we
need better ways to reverse engineer
circuits we need a outstanding computer
science and we need outstanding smart
people who who like searching through
things and so there there are very
natural synergies yes
yeah
yeah so this is a wonderful question so
the nematode worm the the actual wiring
has been known for a long time and this
is because it has only 302 neurons and
so with serial electron microscopy much
as you would reverse engineer a
smartcard or computer chip with electron
microscopy the entire wiring of the of
the this little war on this nematode was
discovered actually decades ago but
although it was done decades ago we
still really have essentially no
understanding of how even that nervous
system works as a unified whole and the
reason is we lack specific control and
we lack dynamics we lack the ability to
probe and modulate and readout dynamics
so exactly right what was missing was
was the element of fast control not that
you don't need the wiring diagram you
need that missing pieces adding in the
fast control yes
would you leap forward several decades
so what what are the the clinical
applications and I think you know we're
already starting to to touch on those
and those are coming in the form of
understanding what are the clinical
applications we're now starting to
understand what are the circuit elements
that are going wrong in Parkinson's
disease and there's a lot more to learn
we're just scratching the surface but
just understanding will help us do
things like design better drugs design
better non-invasive interventions we
have non-invasive interventions that
don't require even fiber optics even
something as thin as a fiber optic we
just don't know how to use them well
because we don't understand we don't
understand really what's wrong with the
circuit and it's very hard to do high
throughput search of a circuit and a
human being who's sitting before you in
the in the office to find out what's
going wrong with their circuit and then
to correct it so the understanding from
the animal models will help us use even
other tools better in people in the very
long run some of these actual tools
might be translated to people but I I
see that as a minor aspect of the whole
thing
I think the real goal is understanding
and design of better treatments which
will come very quickly probably on the 5
to 10 year time scale and so we're
looking forward to that yes
okay yeah where can we read more
information first we have a website and
it's optogenetics org so opt Oh Jeanette
ixora
all one word and there's links to
publications images methods and press
there and you can email me also yes
yes so bringing up the very important
issue of brain feedback of the way
different regions of the brain work
together and the one influencing another
and this is very important actually a
lot of diseases may arise from feedback
from overactive feedback effectively
getting stuck in a loop that needs to be
intersected and that and that can be
done even briefly a brief intervention
could knock you out of a vicious cycle
that you that at least for a while
and so understanding those feedback
loops is probably important in
depression may well be important in
Parkinson's and you may not need
multiple sites may just need to
intersect at one point to break the loop
at one point in order to affect a cure
that said there are many reasons to seek
control of multiple different regions of
the brain at once probably different
areas of the brain communicate better
when they're in sync and I mean on the
millisecond scale here so this is not
just generally revving up to different
regions of the brain this means on the
millisecond scale making sure they're in
synchrony this is probably how the brain
unifies different parts of an object
into a unitary hole so I stand here
there's sound coming from me they're
photons coming from me but you still see
me as a unitary entity and why is that
because the different neurons in your
brain that are responding to the
different aspects of that entity they're
probably all in synchrony on the
millisecond scale and that's creating an
object a single unitary object that is
crucial to understanding how the brain
works and how that goes wrong and some
diseases like autism and to do that
we're developing fiber bundles and
multiple different fibers that can
access different areas of the brain at
the same time and drive them in or out
of synchrony yes
yeah question is pain control or
anesthesia this is this is absolutely an
application with the key reason being
with electrodes it's very hard to turn
off okay
you can definitely Drive things and in
some cases you can overdrive them so
hard that the neuron becomes exhausted
it no longer works as well but that's
difficult it has side effects doesn't
always work and certainly doesn't spare
the other cells around so creating
problems and this is why pain control is
so hard in the spinal cord where the
pain pathways go that's where motor
control goes also and you don't want to
paralyze people this has clear
applications for pain because we can
truly turn off using the chloride pump
and we can truly turn off just in
targeted cells and so we're looking at
applications for that the pain pathways
are known that promoters for the pain
pathways are known and so this is
absolutely a possible application
alright well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
