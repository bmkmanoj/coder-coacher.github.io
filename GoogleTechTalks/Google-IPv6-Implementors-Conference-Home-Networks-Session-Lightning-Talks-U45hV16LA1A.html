so I've done some v6 work there on there
oh jeez I'm the editor of a v6 draft in
the ITF on on basic physics requirements
for see you readers I'm mainly going to
talk about the CTE audiology or the home
gateway or whatever people have chosen
to call it every stand this forum has a
different name for it um but it also
applies to the to the home home network
I also have another hat which is where I
have perhaps most passion and enthusiasm
and that's the user hat I'm a user in my
home network so every time I say things
like the host has to fix this you know
the intelligent has to be in the host
network on to it its user hat or not
Cisco's huh so I like a figure out word
clouds and you know funnily enough I do
show that as the it was the biggest one
here is done on good frequency when I
took all the references from the ITF
craft the WT 124 which is from the
broadband forum and eerie respect from
from cablelabs so these are basically
the specs you need to implement if you
want to do a CP quite a few and one
thing to notice is that with these three
specs I mentioned are you know they're
basically covering oh you know the most
most of the access networks and their
old specs and we're really just doing
with simplifying CP vendors work here by
by trying to make you know a simple
overview expect this is how you can do a
CP and giving the references where to go
and look if you have to look for details
we're doing tinkering you could do a v6
EP 10 years ago and so please don't
blame us for for delaying the sixth
deployment just because we haven't done
these specs yet
and the broadband forum is so lovely you
know these three specs I'm talking about
our are overlapping and that's probably
because they address different audiences
the broadband forum is made up of
service providers and vendors where
service providers are really the ones
deciding the agenda and therefore
managed devices where the service
provider is managing the device
typically we the protocol you called TR
69 which is also defined by the
broadband forum the IDF effort which i
think fred baker just sent off to the
isg so that would be in our receiver is
soon is made up of the design team was
actually people from the broadband forum
and from cable absent from the IDF
trying to you know find some common
ground so we avoided having you know a
cable AB CD and a broadband forum CP and
then I an IDF CP which you could buy
from best buy so so that's really the
the least common denominator for v6
support because the way we did that work
is if anyone disagreed with something we
took it out to the spec so it's very
simple it's very basic and by the way if
you did the the word cloud slightly
differently where you fit a space in
between the RFC and the number this is
how the the reference section looks like
so IDF is very dominant here for v6
support and there is a little bit of my
Tripoli United spec co2 to implement but
most of this is is I def work I thought
I should say something about the
existing v4 architecture and what the
implications are for for the v6 work
we've done so lots of things have
evolved over time in the force base so
this is my home network and yes I did
draw this picture myself and it wasn't
my two-year-old son and
so I have three isolated networks at
home I have the the red one to the left
there with the with the setup box so
that's a walled garden service from my
isp it's realized as separate vlans
upstream the RG bridges that traffic
Anna gets address space you know private
address space in 10 / 8 from the ISP
there is no connectivity between that
setup box on my TV and anything else in
my never so I can't you know plug my
camera in somewhere else in the network
and look at pictures on my TV for
example i get a VPN router from cisco
which has a tunnel going straight into
the cisco giving me a cisco address
space in that bottom red link and the
blue one to the right there is is
enacted the force base from from isp and
if none of those bases overlapped is
this kind of works okay and if my
girlfriend wants to print something and
I have a printer on the cisco red link
there that doesn't work if I have the
printer on the blue network i can't
print while i'm working on cisco stuff
so basically and when I want to watch my
porn or download or whatever it is and I
prefer to switch networks so I have to
you know change plugs depending on what
I do and that's really not very nice I
mean with my use for hat on I don't want
my network to work this way and so the
VPN router could do split tunneling so
that you know only Cisco traffic would
go to cisco and everything else would go
to the internet but for that to work to
get return traffic done correctly that
VPN route would have to do not you know
it would be a basic part of the
architecture basic thing you needed for
this to work how do we do this for these
six
so what we do have is is all these
benefits you get from that that you
don't necessarily get with just with
these sex you get stable addressing you
get some sort of multi-homing support
you get security you get ability to plug
and play Reuters for example we chain
that and you get also some sort of war
garden support any network hides all
this from the hosts which you know
appear to be single home so how do we do
all of this with with these six so what
we have said in you know from a standard
perspective is well let's ignore all
that stuff because it's some hard
choices to make so this is the network
we've you know define a profile for from
the broadband forum perspective and from
the from the IDF perspective but that's
really the network i want i want my home
network to look like this and what I a
cute except for example if I have
devices which don't do Ethernet I could
have a separate link for those still
with a single CP doing everything
everything for me and so what we
standardize this is we said how the van
link you know the upstream link should
work how we do addressing three models
for addressing we'd slack dhcpv6 or with
you know what we call the unnumbered
model even though that doesn't exist in
v6 on the land side we're saying how you
get dns information there's a dhcp
server there from positive dns we also
accepted as RFC 5006 or they stand on
versatile that went nuts that's coming
out and the broadband forum has gone
slightly long you no further than Danny
IDF draft to state how us should work
how multi constitute work we've said
that simple security and firewall should
be supported we have tried very very
hard
to avoid having to say something about
it should be default on or off with my
user hat on I would definitely want it
off because it breaks things I really
really don't understand and I've been
working with networking for 10-15 years
I don't understand what it does for me
and so I really don't want it want it on
I actually don't want that VPN
connection either I just want to access
my employers data and you know final you
know I'm happy to do some sort of
authentication for example but I could
be on an application layer and not not
done on the on the network layer because
that you know end up in all these you
know separate isolated networks you get
all these problems with reaching local
stuff and things and one thing to notice
though is that even in this network we
are sorta multihomed and we're
multihomed in a term I used for this is
non congruent multi-homing which is
where your multi home to two networks
which you know they don't overlap they
give you access to different services
and even you know in this case where you
have a dual stack network v4 least six
and v6 Andy four networks don't overlap
as we know so that's why we have the
term loan congruent multi-homing and and
that also applies where you know those
examples we had earlier today from NTT
if we have a walled garden service here
the VPN service you offer you you still
get every host being multi hound and the
problem with that is that hosts aren't
very good at multihoming Reuters are
built to do multi-homing hosts aren't so
there's quite a bit of stuff which needs
to be fixed there that is really just
implementation details it's nothing to
do with stylization it's just that they
have to learn how to live and operate in
this multihomed environment and I've
been thinking about
would we like the whole network to be
any more complex tendency is there any
point in having a rooted home network
you know I would plug in arbitrary
number of Reuters here in my home
network and you could have looped
apologies and what have you and I I'm
still looking for a use case for that
and it would be a fun problem to solve
because we would have to have you know
both unicast and multicast routing in a
home we would you know one requirement
for home network is that it has to be
plugged in play you can't expect people
to sit and configure ohs BF areas for
example so we will have to make that you
know plug-and-play my problem though is
that I can't find a use case for it so
we're probably not going to standardize
that anytime soon other things we've
specified here on the land side is the
use of you lays unique local addresses
so a typical home network will have 2
p-6 prefixes one you'll a prefix and one
global prefix the reason for that is to
allow local communication to work even
though you know before you've been
provision to the global address or in
the case of V numbering for some reason
some eyes piece want to continue v4
behavior so that prefixes are relatively
short-lived that's not something which
works very well in v6 unfortunately so
you know that would be like changing
your telephone number on their phone
during a call that just doesn't fly one
more of a problem we haven't sold which
was meant oh that's so just mention
added and before coming here I was in
Rio on holiday and they mugged my watch
so have no idea what the time is and
they mugged my glasses I can't see
anything but you know apart from that
I'm doing fine okay it and so non
congruent multi-homing as I said is you
know this case we're here either be four
v6 or your multi prefix on on these six
you get one prefix from your wall garden
one prefix from the internet provider
and the host has to choose the right one
and if it doesn't choose the right one
it fails and working in cisco it would
be nice to come up with a good way to do
this in the network and the best answer
we have is not you can do v6 not just
like I do for v4 and it works if we
don't want to do not we can you know we
can send you ICMP messages saying you
pick the wrong source address perhaps or
we could do I LNP or Dino's going to
jump up and say we can do this and yes I
think we can yeah exactly and and this
yes and if we don't want to do it in the
network we need hosts to behave smarter
with this and we need you know to be
able to do source address selection
policy dns server selection policy of
things like that by the host but network
will help you and pass that distribute
that policy down and this is these are
things we were looking at standardizing
in the future but it's not in the basic
specs neither from the broadband forum
nor from from the IDF and another
problem we're looking at is is this
multi-level math problem where you get
one RG CP from your service project do
what you want so you go and buy another
one and you plug it in the back of it
and I kind of works for me for so know
if you don't have overlapping that you
you know you make sure the biologies
from a different vendor cross your
fingers and and stuff like that but if
we do that with v6 you know how do we do
that because you don't have not and so
you need some sort of hierarchical
prefix delegation you need some sort of
default MLD proxy you know passing dhp
other configuration options downstream
and if you want to solve this problem do
we also want to solve the problem or you
know topology with the directed graph or
even a arbitrary topology with loops and
then we're back to a slightly more
complex problem
so just to summarize on the unresolved
problems because they're much more
interesting than the soul problems
plug-and-play routine if we need that
hopefully the answer is no do we need to
do in flash remembering what happens if
if suddenly you're I you know your link
is down you come up with different v6
prefix you're in trouble this kind of
that kind of heights this from you even
though you lose all your not state for
v4 what do we want to do with security
my answer with my user hat on is nothing
I don't want any security from my home
gateway but other people disagree but
what does security mean I mean food for
example is Mayacamas and suggested
menagerie coffee be that I had a a
firewall port on my oh geez I could plug
things that didn't trust into that port
and leave the remaining stuff open where
I could actually offer services and use
it but I really like to see him to end
compliance security whatever that means
I mean something which didn't break
end-to-end connectivity and DNS is the
home gateway going to be an
authoritative name server for your
reverse zone for example service
discovery you know well that's been a
great embarrassment to the IDF not
having solve this problem for for a
decade and again multihoming us
multicast qso multicast is something
that brought on forum has specified to
some extent it's an MLD proxy in their
specification so the the basic specs are
done it's the working text 124 I to from
the broadband forum docsis 30 has been
there for a long long time the basic
requirements right these accelerators
are done they're just making their way
through the bureaucracy of the IDF we're
working on a future stuff the you know
that after basic is probably it should
be
intermediate requirements for a sexy
readers because I'm sure we're not
getting to the advanced one yet and
there's a working there's a puff session
on home yet again which is an IDF effort
looking at not only resolving these six
issues on our G's but also existing the
four issues there's work that Dan wing
is talking about tomorrow which is v6
lat avoidance which is again this non
congruent moved to homing how can we
avoid v 6 knots and and one thing to
remember is that v6 doesn't change the
internet architectures there any
problems you've solved in v4 and the way
we solve it you know you probably want
to resolve it the same way with these
sex but I really want to encourage
people to to think twice about these
walled gardens these VPN services
everything which require you know it's
visible to me as a user in my home
network and breaks things I mean I want
to be able to print these six can
restore the internet architecture but
please select it you know don't break it
again yeah thanks mark ok any questions
so we're gonna is it ok to holding that
yeah we're going to hold them to the end
we're going to include questions for
this part in the in the in the tail end
we're doing a like 15 or minutes or so
questions so thanks Willie thank you
very much yeah you can if you want to
stay here with us yeah whatever you want
yep next we have Eric vinc from
participation talk about some of the
security work that's happening from the
standard point of view this give this
morning what about the security posture
and the security policy in any CP ok I
don't have the answer above mostly
questions on this but let's have a look
so security questions first about ipv6
itself so when you are adding a pv6
question number one and then basically
I'm coming to ipv6 through the angle of
a ballistic security because i am a
security person basically so question
number one is a pv six more or less
secure than ipv4 and we all know there
are roughly equivalent the only big
issue is that until now
people know less about a PV six and if
you know less of course you cannot
really secure your network you can only
take an attack and this kind of stuff
and then which security policy you need
to apply for visas right it is only
problem this is everyone's problem must
be the same as a ipv4 including the nut
security and we all know that if we
divide behind the net is gotta try
analyt is part of a botnet so I really
wonder what is the security of not in
this case I must be blind or something
but anyway I don't see it must be the
same in two thousand when ipv4 CPU were
developed the landscape was different
and I shall come back on this we are now
in 2010 so things has change right I'm
getting older I'm using my hair but CPS
are different at the point or match
congruence do we need to weigh between
the ipv4 security policy and the v6 one
and there this is maybe where I
personally disagree with some people in
the room they must be congruent because
the end user is no clue about different
physics we only know about PC networks
and device so it doesn't care what is v
4v 6 it means that the security policy
must be congruent there at least on a
secret point of view so typical appear
for security from 2000 ok anti spoofing
you all know everything out inside to
outside and you block everything from
the outside to the inside if it's not
matching an unborn flow and you deny
authorized then you can open some port
forwarding right or basically opening a
hole to follow BitTorrent or whatever
and now the issue to think about it the
circuit of police in any CP device is
often co-located with an odd function
right and it is done by the same piece
of software most of the CP device are
based on linux and iptables do that's
for at the same time not and
security it's really the case what is
co-located it doesn't mean that not
bring security okay so ipv6 change of
two thing I mean is vastly the same
thing but a few things change something
I really like is the link local
addresses because they are local right
nobody can use those addresses to attack
you for instance what I say to some
service provider a why don't you use
between your router's link local only
right ospf isi-kolkata guess any routing
protocols right perfectly fine a
link-local but then you cannot be
attacked on those link which is kind of
cool on the other end own device now are
globally reachable okay so it means that
all your girlfriend's can print on his
printer with no problem which is kind of
cool from the user perspective but of
course it means also that I can print or
only printers and trained you know some
f word or whatever words you want and
another thing this one is maybe a little
bit convoluted but just to tell you a
few things are changing their so we have
there something like a broadband network
and on the left hand side if it's my cpe
and and my pc on the right hand
scientist is released network with is a
printer and somewhere we are sharing the
same provider which covers belgium and
norway will be controlling but anyway so
and we are basically in the same from
the service provider perspective the cpe
are in the same layer to domain okay the
same VLAN for instance so in ipv4 you
get this kind of link the green link in
ipv4 all the traffic that the service
provider sees is the one address of the
CP of my CP talking to all a's CP right
because the CPR doing that so now if we
are the same layer to domain we need to
apply tricks within the service provider
network to force the traffic to go to
the VMG or whatever owned and managed by
the provider in order to do some billing
to do some inspection to do whatever
okay stands before they want to see your
traffic they don't want to get direct
connection so they need to use layer two
tricks for doing this in v6 my pc talks
directly to the printers of knowledge or
network right so as we are coming now
from one prefix in my network to always
network with different prefix it must be
routed so naturally it will always go if
you don't any kind of routing
information exchange between the CP
always go through the bng because they
got on your default route so there we
are kind of solving the problem okay
because there is no more need for to CP
to talk directly using the one address
okay good my CP has not changed to talk
about v6 with only CP only the TC
attached to it anyway small difference
here so when talking about the ITF and
some vendors as well what is the simple
simplest ipv6 security policy to be
applied new CP and it's basically a copy
and paste and again I kind of like it
because that's congruent and the user my
mother my brother doesn't have a clue
about different v6 and they need to get
a congruent security policy okay as we
are kind of of opening the door so it's
basically the same thing as before right
aunt is proofing all gone permit inbound
only if it's matching the nether the
flow benefit we know it that thing it
breaks end to end it means that now even
if I could reach always printer put on a
routing perspective I cannot from the
security perspective all my packets will
be dropped by only CP okay so then we
are back to square one so make in time
in two thousand we define the standard
for the cpe cpe we are very weak and
limited the O's themself
we were running windows 98 right Oh
windows 2000 or whatever my poem
whatever you want it very weak and
vulnerable OS they were attacked all the
attacks as well we're done mainly I play
a trillionaire far as well right we were
not talking about a cross-site scripting
at the point of time and this kind of
nasty JavaScript or Java applets secret
a technique at that point of time it was
firewall and power and firewall nothing
else ten years later when we are now
designing v6 EP post we talk about Vista
we talk about linux mac OS and blah blah
right all the others now they are secure
it's very difficult to attack a
Microsoft Vista Windows 7 let me wrong
when most of you do it same thing for
mac OS and Linux and so on but the level
is very very high CP device I mean you
all know muslo more memory stronger cpu
faster cpu something is different new
security techniques is appear the
intrusion prevention system are used
everywhere in each in a very large
organization there is IPS will be also
towards on reputation database we give
to some remote IPS reputations we can
see all traffic coming from this one
this may be better than traffic coming
from that one okay so techniques are
there we rely as well on automatic
software updates about policy is coming
from the cloud so we change the
landscape okay vastly and what I say a
also has more secure its kind of
crossing finger here because only new
webcams and only do sensors and your
coffee machine on basics and your fridge
over v6 we simply need to update the
embedded operating system there is
strong as well they ? because there we
don't really know yet so proposal it was
a proposal basically that mark and my
ability push to the ITF is that let's
try to do a less simple basic security
where we lie on the new techniques
techniques like IPS right automatic
updates and so on and you got the draft
they're here and it will win this draft
we put couple of policies that says a
basically use about IPS use about
obvious updated signatures so you are
always up to date all of us are running
antivirus somewhere this anti virus
database is updated daily nightly or
whatever with new signatures I mean this
modern techniques right it's been there
for five ten years cpe could use this
now the issue now you need to change the
business model right the antivirus you
pay a monthly fee or yearly fee we need
now when you buy a CP of this kind of
security you will need to buy a yearly
subscription contract okay so why not
and then this is basically where you got
at that point of time you use IPS
techniques for instance and orders two
olo free incoming connection all the
incoming connections are allowed we
restore end to end but then we are not
naive we call it in the draft paranoid
openness yes we are open I accept each
and every connections coming but I
declare them suspect and dangerous only
on a real proof of suspicion when they
are not like inside if there are no my
connection they open they can go through
and so we only block the real evil stuff
and benefit you restore the end to end
like Mark said we change the internet
architecture kind of because end-to-end
connectivity is restored okay until
basically so to summarize I mean I mean
working in a pleasing security for many
years now they are roughly equivalent
training and let's experience it's a
challenging for physics so for a few
years amounts a quarter it will be less
secure that's not only point and but now
when we deploy ipv6 CP in 2010 let's
figure out that ten years has passed
since the ipv4 not security
CP has been there so we need to change
our mind there okay we need as well to
educate the customer base that we need
to get subscription-based security and
not only buying one device and forget
about it they will have to pay to get
maybe those updated policies there and
that's it thanks Harry thank you for
your attention by the way thank you very
much are all right rock if you can come
up Rock ours and Shakira tell post from
Slovenia yes I know jaan EP 14 million
so we know each other and we used to
work at say my speed beginning so far
basically really did what we did is
linnea now I'm more than you're in the
vendor side so basically what we have
right now is that we have some kind of
the multi service environment from the
service provider or tell what every we
will call it it was some years ago some
holy war should we use it villain per
user or real and / service we ended with
both with limitations with Larry CPS
already mentioned home network and I
have some things to show what
implementation we did for our customers
then from the Lakers regulator site is
nowadays pushing community service multi
provider environment we will see how it
will goes but anyway we will need to be
supported on the CP this is one thing
how it looks the CP which is Valon the
user is the implementation which we have
with one customer you can see all this
algae magic there the router side it's
even I jumpy for kink implemented there
on one public PvP interface is
everything also the management if you
look to the home network yeah okay we
have some kind of the home network but
we have the problem with the different
set of boxes how to solve things
regarding the VOD each vendor works
quite the different and for each
customer you need to do it the
customization then this is the
implementation if you have real and /
service I draw intentionally there that
the interfaces are breached so it's very
clear that the humko network is is
braked you have no chance to share our
content between st be odd or your laptop
or whatever you will do it on the on the
left side okay it's its implementation
which we have it on the field are then
here is the question if you help the
multi service box which has only one IP
how to solve that on TS these networks
on the right side are private networks
under closed then the first
implementation of the ipv6 which we have
will be like that so we will not change
nothing we will just introduce the ipv6
on the on the internet site there I have
some slides but i will skip it because
all already mentioned ok this is the
question it will be this the ideal
device whatever it will be in the RFC or
drafted RSC which all men intent is
altering its also stated that you can
share multiple
line interfaces one of the possibility
is good that I have the primer whatever
could are today closed services on the
one interface the internet will stay on
the on the other interface it will still
we will still have the ipv4 and all the
algae is there what will happen here is
that you're basically switching from the
villain / service to the villain per
user what does it mean for the network
which the operator has do they will need
to change everything or they will start
as was on the first light and then built
I don't know new aggregation network and
access network and then we see how do we
go further then here are some things
which all already mentioned but anyway
the question is how we will get the GUI
interface on the only ipv6 CP so there
we don't have this famous IP which is
the same on this old see peace so we
should have something like modern dot
local or whatever it will be that the
guys which are on the field can access
the the the interface whatever it will
be then on the ipe we think we have dhcp
authentication but where whatever will
be in the end because and beardy a
commode so basically for that generating
the silly arse or keep alive things on
the on the layer free or we will have
something different something sango
going cause in New York Europe open
access network they are basically layer
2 networks so how the ipv6 real ipv6 led
to home gateway will look like
because what we saw today is that
everything will be fully routed model so
we don't have an answer regarding
community service multi provider
environment if it will be pushed through
the regulator the things are which will
emerge is quite different if you have
the Greenfield then you can start to
build quite different CP if you have
existing deployment and depends how you
decided to be learnt user will enter
service and you need to solve these
things but in the end what what I would
like to see is that we don't break again
the whole network that we feast while we
need to fix and yes I agree the CP today
is quite different you have more
resources on it providing the fire
roaring I don't know some customers
would like to have it some not ah it's
probably will be the bait but this is
more or less but I had to say thanks
that rock okay so like to have bobbing
from eros come up and talk to us about
me sick said a nurse hi I'm bobbing
director of product management at eros
just how many people I've ever heard of
errors in this room not that many maybe
a few of you so unless you're in the
cable industry you probably are thinking
who the heck is air is so I'll tell you
real quick who Aires is we are a global
company headquartered in North northern
suburb of Atlanta and we develop
products that enable cable operators to
deliver West video and data services to
their subscribers and we're probably
best known for our carrier grade high
capacity high-performance CMT s as well
as our our docks is 20 and docsis three
old cable modems and emta s emta is
embedded multimedia
no adapters that's a fancy name for a
voice enabled cable modem so so what are
we doing in this in this area to enable
ipv6 you know as a cpe sitting in the
home we see ourselves as a gateway into
the operators network so there's three
excuse me so if you have a voice device
which you will you probably will have
three IP addresses there'll be an IP
address for your your cable modem
there'll be an IP address for the host
computers behind the cable modem and of
course the voice adapter is essentially
another piece of cpe behind the cable
modem so that gets to the IP address as
well so what I'm gonna do here just give
you a quick view of the type of products
that we have and then what we're doing
and where we're at on ipv6
implementation we ship Ariza's shipped
about 25 million cpe today docsis 20 and
quickly into docsis 30 so there are a
lot of products out there that will
require some upgrade at some point in
time to ipv6 and so real quickly we have
two types of products the two main
products we have are the docks of 20
products and then our docks is 30 4 by 4
and 8 by for your TAS and gateways
excuse me so in here we have the Cape we
have cable modems we have multi-line
emta s we have telephony gateways these
are gateways with two line for line
telephony services with high speed high
speed internet and anal 2011 in what are
the speedway's and also we have battery
backed up models as well as non battery
backed up models so where are we going
with the ipv6 for talks is 20 on the
ipv6 chemo this this on 0 1 2 3
okay okay except I can't see that well
yeah all right so where we at with with
the ipv6 cm support today we actually
all our current products on current
docsis 20 products support ipv6 cable
modem management today how do you turn
it on well the cable modem uses the tlv
five dot one which is in the in the Mac
domain descriptor message and that
basically tells the cable modem whether
it should be doing addressing an ipv6
ipv4 sorry ipv4 first ipv6 only or do
the alternate mode where you will try
ipd saker's and then ipv4 and of course
and networks where MDD is not activated
yet it'll just go straight ipv4 so 228
in the actual deployment of this ipv6 ok
we also have an MDD override feature
that will allow you to turn off the
capability for ipv6 in the various parts
of the network as you upgraded so right
so the the next piece that solves one
third of the problem the other
two-thirds of the problem is the ipv6
address on the cpe and on the MTA so we
are coming up with a new firmware
release to all the existing model 6 the
current products that we sell and today
will be upgradeable to ipv6 to support
cpe behind the cable modem we also
provide an override mechanism as well so
that the operator can do the upgrades on
a staggered basis throughout his network
it doesn't have to try and flush cut
everything at the same time on the ipv6
MTA side currently we do plan to do this
in the packet cable 20 based Eve DD VA's
we haven't determined a release date for
that yet because we haven't quite got to
the point where there are enough
networks out there with gateways and
call servers are currently support that
yeah that isn't a plan all right so a
legacy support this is a very important
one hour earlier models model fours and
fives there's probably 15-20 million of
these devices up there today we know
that the operators want to be able to
upgrade those to ipv6 at some point the
challenges these were earlier devices
and there may be issues with the amount
of memory available to do the upgrades
so our challenge here is to figure out a
technically feasible way to recover
memory from the current devices and look
for ways to be able to upgrade it and
help her operators not have to go out
and do truck rolls and recover 20
million devices from the field to
upgrade ipv6 it is just a quick matrix
not will need to go through that but if
you're interested you can see what
products we have and what the status is
under ipv6 support doctors 30 is fairly
simple all our doctors 30 products meet
the ipv6 requirements in the spec we do
plan to introduce a router capability
fourth quarter of this year and we are
looking at putting in DS Lite support as
well to aid in the migration strategies
and again the ipv6 MTA support will be
added later on when pack cable ed VA
ipv6 networks are available and I give
you six former matrix that's it thanks
thanks pop pop so I'd like to have Eric
bank come back up from Cisco talk a
little bit about some of the work he's
done on the Gateway side of things
thanks Eric ok still Eric still looking
Francisco now this time about ipv6 on
the cpe so Cisco in itself as you know
is shipping high-end kind of cpe where
you get everything with iOS not the
iphone OS right but the good all the iOS
Francisco
changing of it if everything already be
too expensive for my father or my
brother right only at home I can use it
for me but within Cisco we have what
equal to consumer be you something that
you know about flip camera or linksys
that you buy it fries or at best buy
whatever so what are we doing there
that's basically the top here so and
it's not only about you know running
open wrt on the linksys device no no
mostly asleep mark will tell you
tomorrow morning starting at eight or
nine I don't remember instant time I
seven you kidding okay i'll give you
kidding okay who family anyway so we
tell you about the commitment of cisco
for v6 i'm not talking here about the
links because linksys product family
because it's included of course in the
cisco commitment and it's not a limited
of course to any cpu or RG that we
talked about okay whenever you want so
we have a proof of concept for couple of
months or even a couple of quarters
running on existing hardware with
different brand new image and it's been
tested on every continent except
antarctica I must say it has been tested
over cable modems over a dsl using dhcp
using a six rd of course right what do
you expect from us even in some case
when you receive a / 64 from the
provider we need them to break v6 while
not envy for the same time kind of
reader but all we can do right Matt
Winston's in France is receiving a / 64
from free only as far as I know no yeah
you get a rotten ounce man with anything
yeah so then you get to / 64 right so
doing dns proxy doing slack dhcpv6 on
the server side on the one side and on
the client side of course in usual stuff
oops so now it's obviously assistant
it's based on the linux kernel so there
are some more challenge there one is
that
lot of application are only single
address family so we are running to dhcp
process okay 14 v 414 v6 it means that
if you have to implicate this for a lot
of application you end up with diverse
size of memory which is not always easy
then of course what is the default
setting for the security so we have some
internal disagreement between my friend
only a mark and myself on this one but
of course the end user would have to be
decided I can override the default
settings that is pretty sure at the
point all match on a u.s. fact cpe are
we hiding a pv6 from the user okay my
brother my father again I've no clue
about v6 so when for instance i say port
mapping for the v4 a low-order web
traffic bought 80 to this specific ipv4
address because its existing stuff what
does it mean for v6 mean that every port
80 can go through or something different
so it's not always easy right we would
love to get something which is
completely hidden for the user if it
doesn't want to know about v6 doesn't
have to okay which level of auto
configuration as well okay person we
start we boot we try to do dhcpv6 on the
one side but for how long do we wait
until basically meaning falling back to
six rd with static configuration if we
have 6 30 configuration to dhcp before
then we do it immediately but if we
don't yet do we wait before starting six
rd although we start 6 added immediately
okay the default settings can be with
challenging them and then a couple of
questions for all of us okay what about
dns do we new proxy dns but then we are
breaking DNS SEC okay understand is an
ipv6 conference but ipv6 deployment is
basically co-located in time with DNS
SEC deployment as well so the CP we
designed for v6 must be complained to
the NSA meaning genus proxy cannot be
used right then autore planes is famous
192 168 101 here you can use Bonjour but
what about my windows we are using see a
discovery for windows what about
magnetics we need to get the system
which works for everyone so not with
there is no room for windows for sure i
could bonjour my windows at home by my
father's that's an F Bonjour hi sorry
for managing the box ok bye I do agree I
do not want to get on my brand-new ipv6
box please go to 192 168 1 dot one but a
great right we could do it this way I
mean if it's not the killing stuff but
we would be nice if you get fine and
good idea whatever pppoe is everyone
when Karen kewell even a cpe if you do p
POV we do a duet step pppoe now some
service provider in Europe once we have
to pee-pee recession one to the v4 to
the existing Barrasso bng or whatever
and another one for the part face to a
single beer asobi energy which is the
piloting the basics so the anyway I got
asking all the questions are for the end
if you don't mind Google anyway then the
other part is when she'll be removing
the dual stack and get only a v6 you
will not it and then the last point is
was already alluded to work or late in
Europe a lot of service provider are
simply renewing the v4 address every day
because they want to prevent you to get
a server on the free or mostly cheap
contract and wanted to talk to them they
will do the same thing for physics they
will be renewing the prefix delegation
every 24 hours or 36 hours so we needed
we need to remember number immediately
on the inside ok just do about right i
mean you just send array with the ultra
fix and with their lifetime 20 and done
what is kind of bad right and then what
about you Elaine
I mean do you really want to get a UL
April device and then how can we be sure
that the random number there at the time
and everything that'll provide any
collision I don't know that's basically
it so CP ER coming and what Vince earth
said this morning yes no the last mile
CP with ipv6 are there right i mean for
multiple vendors so thank you are okay
so last but not least we're going to
have Hans from d-link come up and then
after Hans we're going to take about 10
or 15 minutes of questions I think if we
have a good discussion we have a little
flexibility so I will no interview Thank
sounds right how do I run um ok listen
i'm from heating systems um thanks Eric
I think every coveralls almost all my
slides so I just goes through my slides
quickly and I see everybody s so tired
here ok listen news I kept her from
Laguna last october two thousand night i
think it says let don't sweat move to
ipv6 what's let I think we have been
talking to a talking about ipv6 for
somehow more than ten years is this now
we still see let lot of spec and a lot
of stander and not finalized yet and
from manufactured home networking
manufacture point of view we still not
get a lot of service co everyday it
either properly because our product
itself but also because people still
have less knowledge in how to set up and
how to configure their product so now we
talking about switch to ipv6 and as we
can see that address is running out I
think this also be covered what I one
like Luke Harvard here is led more and
more
Home applications I think I hear we we
have people from all industries but not
the TV's too since this year we saw a
lot of TV are going to have internet
connectivity even video is doing their
own routers as our competitor right now
so IP address of either ipv4 address or
ipv6 address the IP connectivity or
internet contempt e is certainly going
to increased due to Lee's home home
networking applications in slide I would
just want to highlight last gpp and
wimax already support ipv6 as mentioned
in earlier this morning so I would like
to focus on to our commitment and our
strategy to ipv6 support we have all of
our new routers as well as letter n
arrow to live and routers support ipv6
for all of our home gateways today and
we are very poor lad we have already
have 21 of our devices certified by the
ipv6 ready program and I think feeling
is the only only vendor who just you
know crazy enough to promote ipv6
directly from low key box and shipping
distribute least ipv6 home gateways
directory retails to home users and I
think this covers some problems we here
today in the morning yeah the problems
legs of low home gateway device so lucky
we believe to drive ipv6 is to have your
router home gateway to start stop for
ipv6 first then we talk about IP cam
mass and the other home networking
devices so this is our raw map
now our home gateway device starts about
ipv6 and we will gradually tend led to
the other home networking devices like
an ass and I PT IP cams so also I would
like to hear talk about that was our
problems here I think every cover most
of length for me but to me we have been
talking about IP vixx's for 10 years so
hustling X and there are so many
transition protocols so it's really hard
for us manufacturers to design either
the UI or which protocol we are going to
support which transition mechanism we
are going to support all right here is
why you can see why you can get from the
retail today in our CP routers and with
least on ipv6 visual support we have
ipv6 in ipv4 tunneling which the
original Italian poker 6-2 4-6 rd and
Toronto petrol for negative 20 stack
which supports that ipv6 dhcpv6 PD for
all N and auto configuration and of
course pppoe yeah we have today you can
just get it from retails yes and as us
as long as you see the ipv6 logo unlucky
bugs it's ready today yeah all right and
we supposed area MNR as we say it's
really ridiculous to have ipv6 bucks and
you have to go through the management
interface through 190 a 160 a 192 168 0
1 0 1 1 yeah so we suppose they are
however we also urge led a platform like
windows make I'd nope impurity support
area Mr instead of windows seven but
there are a lot of payphones percent
support it yet so
it would be great that people can use
something like feeling router dealing ap
to SS your management page no matter
what your ipv hype IPS and in our parks
the support I BBC ipv4 and ipv6 and
Naples of course and something I also
like to address is led let Ari the DNA's
option for RA I know that windows seven
is not support and I confirmed from the
windows 17 and I don't know if the other
play phone have a plane to support yeah
and here you go these are our models let
support ipv6 and already certified up by
ipv6 ready program yep so let's my slide
thank you thanks Hans so what I'd like
to do is open up for questions for folks
we have a few minutes for questions and
I was kind of expecting it to be plenty
of them Stan hi Stan barber I've spoken
since nineteen no a long time about ipv6
one of the things I've looked into
recently is home networking and it's
great that you guys are working on this
what is the relationship between what
you're doing and the folks that the
what's it called a digital life
networking alliance or whatever they're
called the guys who actually built the
little boxes that you attach to your
home networks that aren't routers doing
to be sure that everything plays
together in ipv6 so are you talking
about like DLNA yeah there's dual life
networking Alliance is that the name of
those guys I don't know any guys have
any comments about it mean it doesn't
make a lot of sense to have ipv6 and
your local home network and you can't
plug anything but pcs into it at least I
like to have my you know blu-ray player
do ipv6 and these other really cool
things sustained i can i can tell you i
don't know if these guys are able to
comment on that
III did I could take two things about
about my experience with that we've
exchanged emails with those folks and
they they basically said that there
there's done there's nothing to do from
a v6 point of view I of course didn't
believe it but I don't I didn't have
anything more to you know anything
further to go back and forth with them
on I know that on other fronts there are
there are some efforts going on to make
to like things like televisions v6
capable but today I don't know if
there's been any sightings of sightings
of them in a wild Matthew from internode
in Australia um we're a dsl provider and
we've tried to provide a IP v6 native to
customers over pppoe and I guess one of
my comments about about cpe is our
general frustration has been the
complete lack of them with for actual a
dsl cpe unsent d-link have some routers
and understand some people have some
code 44 you know separate router at home
router sort of gateways but one comment
for about the broadband forum stuff is
to a certain extent it's all very nice
to think about oh you know do we have
the firewalls turned on and do we have
all this complex networking in the home
um can we like just come up with a
standard for actually doing it and start
doing it rather than continuing to worry
about how we're going to do it in the
future because I want to get on with it
you know I really do and it's actually
really hard to convince a lot of our dsl
cpe vendors to actually get a move on
because a lot of them are going well I
don't know what to do yet you know
there's all this stuff that hasn't been
decided yet and you know bless me I've
got two of them who have come out with
code for us not links yourself I'll
point out for dips for dsl modems and
not d-link for dsl modems and its really
frustrating um can we maybe just have a
phase 0 implementation of hey look you
can do this and we can get on with it
please well so I didn't say very much
about that because it's it's simple and
it's done and you know it's more
interesting to talk about new stuff but
so we forgotten how to run
multi-protocol networks right if we
knew how to do this in two thousand you
had a PPP based dsl network it was
multi-protocol support right you could
just turn on these six and it would work
then the slam then we started to do you
know you can see things in the network
and look into PPP sessions in the middle
and God knows walk right so these labs
were suddenly be for specific even
though they were laid to devices and now
with IPO II if you're running that it's
lots of good and but if you were then it
would be lots of v4 smarts in access
nodes which would have to be updated but
this is all you know I didn't talk about
that because that's all in the access
network but fully you know for the CP
itself the broadband forum is done you
know there might be some issues with in
the access network especially around
iboe how how you need to replicate all
the v6 functionality how you you have to
you know get be sick support in access
nodes and stuff and that's you know
Weiss mark came up with were so hard to
prove sick sorry because you just tunnel
across the whole thing and wait for that
to sort itself out but you know brother
forum on CPS you know we are done that
it's you know it is the basic stuff
getting you know phase 0 get 36
basically six connectivity and yeah just
ignore all these new things because
that's you know job security because
you're scaring the cpa vendors I mean
really I i I've got a network and if
they've got to Cisco 877 or something
like that they can plug in and it works
but actually getting CP out there to get
people using it I mean point one percent
of my customers have signed up for the
trial point one percent because they
don't have cpe so fun right but
everything even is get on with it if you
read the ITF draft it's I don't know 11
pages or something and it's very very
simple and basic so but you're right and
that that's not a that's not an uncommon
sentiment that you're offering right and
that's part of the reason why early and
a lot of other people had had you know
stepped up and drove the the initial
version of the joy of three I mean it's
probably been less than a year at this
point right and and you know your
frustration is not
rare right so and I think a lot of work
that's happened there is its kind of
helped out in that front Ron yeah I
wanted to respond to Eric's comments
about equivalence of ipv6 died before
from a security perspective the I think
you pointed out that that the difference
might be along the lines of user
experience operation experience and so
forth my additional concern has been
implementation maturity since we have
you know 25 years of experience living
on IP and ipv4 and find out all the bugs
in a lot of the implementations where
we've had almost zero experience
relatively for v6 implementations in all
products my fear is that there's a lot
of latent implementation bugs we're
going to we're going to beasts i bet you
we will be seeing lots of denial of
service exploits out there until we
discover this and get more of the v6
implementations field it how you respond
to that agree okay agree with you my mum
maybe we can have learn when developing
the software you maybe have learned from
experience for instance control plane
policing is done but they 04 v6 it was
not the case for v4 so we learned by
experience but for sure mean I am
quoting me know a lot of us are coding
we are making mistakes right we are
leaving being so yeah agreed but West
George question / comment from my
esteemed cpe vendors it's alway it's all
well and good that you guys are doing
work to make new boxes support ipv6 and
I'm very happy that I could walk down to
my local best fries and buy a new box
but what about the existing ones where's
the firmware updates just support ipv6
on those okay i will reply the negative
rock yes you're talking about adsl2 plus
boxes it will be quite difficult because
you don't have the resources basically
the main cpu and things which are there
if you are fully relative model they
supportive just the bandwidths which
were for
that's 8 20 megabits you the reasonable
big packages were there and you care
limited space flash and RAM on the box
so basically we know if we going do a
stack then we need to have more
resources one possibility is if you are
using the PvP that you use people pass
through and you plug box behind it so
this is one thing or if you help the
model which was more costly but anyway
when the customers are buying the CP is
the most important thing is the price
because the quantities are big so
basically if you would like to have a
lower price then well what you do you
cut off the the flash the rom and you
change probably the the power supply and
then you ended with what you have it so
basically if you are willing we have
only one case that the customer was
willing to have more resources in the
next year we will came also with the
salt therefore for produce box but for
the order all the boxes sorry because
the main issue was a price yeah I should
probably have clarified what I mean is
more the standalone boxes that you plug
into the end of some other terminating
device you know because you look at it
from the perspective of there are plenty
of things now where you know I can I can
walk up and ask for a box from comcast
and they're going to provide me a box
that does wireless and has a couple of
ethernet ports in the back of it and it
kind of stops being my problem but in
the early days where it was a cable
modem and you plug something into the
back of it a separate box that did your
wireless and your your Ethernet and your
NAT and all that kind of stuff I'm more
talking about the boxes that I would
walk to that I would walk into the store
and purchase not what my vendor would
give me yeah it's look it's different on
the vdsl2 right now you brill hell
mainly you will not have the boxes
outside because you cal contributor
compatibility issues with the chipset
vendors so basically it's you will not
get it out of box things is if you would
like to get from the sharpies problem
that you care always the specific
specific things for the
telcos or service providers so basically
we don't have the case that we meet at
least two or three weeks to make the
some tweaking modifications with the
same features but they are in quite
different ways to use and it's very
difficult that you will get the panic of
villain Peru's producer villain poor
service and then some special
implementation there that you will just
get the box out of the store and that
will just work so basically all the
boxes has some kind of the customization
is done on it so basically either you
will just choose the general box which
doesn't support this all things and I
agree with all that you held and it is
llamas which are doing the snooping
functions and it's not so easy if you
have multi service environment and if I
can make one comment Wes I know I know
that there are some cases where you can
upgrade existing boxes I mean we were
aware of some as well and it actually
goes back to something I want to tear
another page at events keynote I mean
it's it's an issue writing me which I
forget what he called it but something
for conquers all right i mean it's you
know we all know about that problem
right well and i think the the issue i'm
having with this is that people are
hiding behind the hardware constraints
of the device but somehow open are open
wrt seems to be able to make it work for
a much larger variety of devices than
the then actually exists some sort of a
firmware upgrade that enables ipv6 so
that's more the reason for my question
is you know either you need to make the
decision say okay we're kind of writing
these off if you want to do this go use
wrt that's our officially recommended
solution or backported that's the point
it's supposed to be free it's already
something i bought okay i don't know who
its first I'm just gonna say we done i
minus a we should kept lying gonna move
on lighting talks so I mean like to try
to be brief yeah but yes good at it um
just to just a comment with respect to
v6 is new code therefore there's going
to be new bugs there for all this kind
of stuff just a prospective moment I
think you'll agree with me but I wanted
to say it is that all the alternatives
that we see because of that six
left left problem in the V for
exhaustion techniques in particular a
plus P kinds of things that are new code
on a cpe working with new code on a bng
in ways that they have never worked
before together or new carrier-grade NAT
functionality all that's new code 2 and
new security attack vectors we're
running into new code no matter what so
that you can't just take the v6 off the
table and not go down the security
problems path if we're going there
anyway hey wait a min we're running out
our P addresses baby nobody told me that
do I didn't get the memo what happened
gen yeah this is Jamaica from ntt
communications and this is a very
interested in presentation thank you
very much first overall but then also
the you know lots of people already
pointed out what I direct talk but in a
one single day if you cannot n officiate
the specification actually we cannot do
that right now for example they still
allow you know we operators doesn't fix
it the other specifications self maybe
the IP we found the basics pppoe is the
same i maybe the separate and i'm still
even for us didn't you know you know
fixated so you know as he said that and
it please have a loom for the frosh and
alum so that then we can upgrade later
in our bakery and then if you can do
that and a priest open up the source
code even if you you know the point is
the sometime d you guys and created an
assault to the people then untouched
neighbor at least if you have a quote on
the source for somewhere maybe that some
guys in the world can in upgraded so
please consider that support or maybe
the free source code please yeah i think
that's that's probably a really good
point there was the follow-up i was
going to make to lorenzos comment about
how much do you want to pay for this i
think it then in that case maybe we
operators can support for that operate
in that case in and you know we can pay
for that well customer right and it
makes it the reality is that for
everybody in this room ipv6 represents
kind of an unfunded mandate you know
there are some portion of it that you're
going to have to
and you're going to have to spend money
on it and you're not necessarily going
to see a return on it other than you get
to stay in business so it's a shady
business case I'm asking my vendors to
share the pain yeah the tutors to us
that you know first people who like to
move motivate these kind of things is
the ISP will show you know a force to be
the shortage of the before address so
the new customer coming here then please
give me the fiber to the harm them but
there is no IP address so you know we
have to you know give the ipv6 so you
know we have a listen to pay you know
sometimes sometimes that happens anyway
just to comment on this upgrade and so
on so they are too kind of cpe right the
one you buy its best buy and so on with
the lifetime of one year or two years
and then it's over end of sales and the
one you buy I mean from your vendors and
the service provider this one is maybe
I'm gradable know to your questions
about lazy yeah will the subscriber pay
for a new CP I know people who bought by
a new CP to get a faster wireless so one
buying for something which is end-to-end
communication where your bitter end by
your skype or next guy next application
we work better I know people that will
buy it not because it's v6 right because
it opens back the internet but and to
Eric's point I mean that that's why it's
key to make sure that when those devices
are built that like you know this for me
sex or at least they have enough room to
be upgraded to support v6 I just want to
make a comment about the upgradability
what back to rocks point the earlier
legacy devices you know there always is
that hardware limitation because you
know you're talking about high volume
products which are there's always a cost
optimization concern you know the
operators don't want to pay you want to
pay as little as possible for these
products you get a cost optimize it and
when you do that you are going to reduce
the amount of RAM and the amount of
flash what we're looking at from the
eris perspective we know that our
operators you know don't want to go out
and spend a hundred million dollars to
go up there and replace all there exist
legacy cpe so we are going back and
looking at our legacy products and
looking at ways to remove other
functionality that might be lower
priority so we're asking our operators
okay you want us to go and take your
five-year-old device and squeeze out 50
K of memory so I can fit ipv6 CP support
in it what are you willing to give up
and you know what what are you willing
to pay you can you know this is a five
year old legacy product you've paid for
you've used up the value the products
been discontinued is no longer supported
as a vendor if I have to go and upgrade
existing product I have to support it
for another three four or five years
I've got to get paid for it I got to pay
the engineers I gotta pay you know my
tech support people so you know there is
going to be some cost but it's a
business case right as an operator would
you rather spend a dollar or two per
device that you have in the network now
and upgraded or would you rather go and
spend 120 dollars to go and retrieve
your how many boxes 5 million I don't
know yeah do the math right so the
business case is very strong I so last
but not least last question yeah Walter
gluten scoffs at home we're also a CB
stock fender I have a list of things the
LA Dylan a indeed yes there is ipv6
support in it's not as quite
straightforward what ipv6 opens up is
the possibility of actually
communicating between homes now it's
strictly private range ipv4 you could
have the opportunity opportunity to
stream from home video from home to home
for instance not something i don't think
is solved the access networks are indeed
are a big issue where's the alcohols
where the the DSLR vendors are they on
this conference I didn't see a track for
that but that is a major issue there are
the legacy out there which comes to the
point of the
cpe vendor sale it's not that easy to
say that just be over and done with it
because you have all these different
access networks which were designed in a
completely different way which have a
different hardware and there is no one
single solution and that's that's
actually a pity there should have been
more standardization along the way their
models it should have been a restriction
and along the way but there hasn't been
one of these things is princess pppoe
can we kill it please already it's
really stupid I mean it mocks four bytes
of your of your MTU size it is grossly
inefficient we see our customers moving
to pure IPO II which makes it much
easier to do dual stack and apps or the
thing as well and then what do we have
oh yeah the security policy so as we see
more networks going to isps putting
managed boxes into people's homes the
user that they should have a service
contract for the security updates well
those managed devices that could be a
part of the service a pose that those
operators offered of course that is much
harder to sell indeed with the little
like surfer d-link sorry i buy your
heart here for my for my home but but
but i sell hardware that is I saw
software hard for hardware that is that
is managed so it's going to get harder
and harder to get an unmanaged box as
your as your gateway because all these
different operators are trying to
squeeze more value out of the solution
and into a controlled gateway they can
do that okay so two more questions to
your point alcatel was invited they
didn't reply k somebody else's curious
Akamai was invited they didn't reply
Microsoft and Apple are invited they may
be here they may not so think of that
what you will I think we might expect
something from someone for apple and and
Dave say I know that date sailors at the
eye
retreat we would have loved to have him
but he has other commitments mark on the
cost issue i just want to point out one
thing so Laura's eggert at nokia just
did a study of a bunch of NAT devices
out there okay collected together ran
tests and found that that the number of
flows because of the Nats and such
supported on stuff out there is
somewhere between 16 and a thousand okay
and and then it maxes out right because
of these limited resources you talk
about understand that with ipv6 if we
have that option that says transparent
mode turn off my firewall because I have
firewalls on my hosts anyway you don't
have to track any flows at all tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands of TCP
connections and the cpe does nothing no
Ram yes yeah but your bittorrent build
still run an ipv4 so I really need today
to do a stack so I will need to support
all your things on the ipv4 and
additional I PVCs maybe it's a lightning
talk but the ipv6 is just a simple
forward you don't have to track the
state of it yeah okay but IRA still need
the support ever think about the ipv4
okay well you know maybe I'll have a but
that you the user ends up with tens of
hundreds of thousands of flows instead
of just you know 800 yeah I understand
but I have the same resources for ipv4
and ipv6 so I will still need to support
everything can i pee before the first
first place and the additional know what
you guys can do easily every dynasty
resources of rattle rattle rattle rattle
thank you thank you all thanks thanks
everybody thank you thank you google
Thank You Erica renzo
thank you for the panel all right we
we're going to just try to run through
this lightning talk session this is like
kind of all the space that we have since
the best agent is quite fact and this is
going to be really really fast i'm
thinking probably no questions five
minutes i'll give you give you a
countdown oh yes we've got like like
seven of these to try to get to be in
about an hour so bear with and i'll buy
everything i have everything here so it
should be easy to go awesome app taking
rip that one because that balloon down
to get to that one yeah thank you
alright so we are going to talk about
geolocation ipv6 very very quickly i'm a
craftsman the rest of the team members
were up there and we represent quota if
you don't know who Koba is we've been
doing G location for the past ten years
so we know a couple things we're just
across the 101 over in downtown mountain
view and what we have now is an alpha
product and you say the against an alpha
product so we're looking for people to
partner with us to understand our data
better and how it fits into the v6 world
I think I'm preaching to the choir here
because I my co-workers saw that we
mentioned geolocation three times during
it today so these are the general areas
you use it but the important thing is
that it's pretty much impossible in the
v4 world today a to search to buy
something to get online banking anything
and naturally as quote we see that
you're going to need this in the v6
world very soon so to that effect there
are some difficulties though as we all
know it's difficult to make v6 work and
it's going to be difficult in some
respects to make b6 work from
geolocation perspective here's a couple
areas to consider we already said the
care grade net is bad it's bad for us to
weave like these six to go ahead and
succeed it's a really big space which is
a good thing for addresses but not so
good for us because it's a little
tougher to target traceroute toast names
how do you scan an area as enormous as
or as large as the v6 world is and
tunneling transition 624 I mean there's
a lot of a raised voices about what's
good and what's bad in that area but
makes it difficult for us as well from
geolocation perspective so let's start
talking about the data I want emphasize
again real quick that when we look at
the data this is the V
six world as a whole we're not talking
about specific who's really using it i'm
just looking at the space that's out
there and I like this slide because it's
very dramatic it basically says there is
the registries and then there's
everybody else if you break that down
you see I can't see very well from here
but you basically you've got a frenetic
ripe apnic and the dod that basically
dominate the current allocated space
that's out there this doesn't really
include what is routable I want to point
that out real quick if you include route
bility and things are going to change so
from here on that lets go ahead and
ignore those guys because they really
mess up my numbers I think this is a lot
more interesting though I do know that a
few you're up here are in the crowd so
please don't yell at me real quick if
you think you should be higher up there
or you aren't mentioned I just looked at
these from the register organizations
and so they could work out differently
if you add certain ones together that
were different but here's the top 10
that make up eighty-two percent of the
IP addresses the v6 addresses out there
if we go and we skip over or so does
community see this real quick I'm going
to go and switch over the next one next
one is at the top ten country so these
ten countries have ninety two percent it
would appear of the v6 of space out
there if you look if I switch back and
forth between the carriers and the
country's was a pretty nice little
combination because Deutsche Telekom
owns a time France Telecom owns a ton
and it works out equally and us in the
United States we just broke into the top
ten in the top ten spot so go us let's
talk about the Alpha very quickly it's
as itÃ­s that's an alpha program what
we're putting out there mostly is for
you as the customers to get a chance to
build your systems around it get it
integrated start playing with it and see
to how it scales all that good parts
like that and then we would love to have
the feedback as well because it helps us
to understand better how to tailor our
own systems to complete the geolocation
itself because you are the people out in
the field the trenches that are seen
who's using v6 we're in the rear with
the gear and we love that feedback
and if you're familiar with our G
directory services or the data file
either way we have a way to get it into
your current environment so you can
start playing with it and stop at four
minutes oh and if anybody wants to
contact us I'm Nate grassman Tampa
bottom Perry is the one that really runs
the alpha program if anybody's
interested feel free to contact either
of us you think I'm friendly contact me
either way thank you perfect see I think
Jason next think you are hi jason has
something that I think has a great
promise for assisting users would you
rather have this that's good so this
will be very very brief test dash ipv6
com speaking only for myself we've
mentioned that the content providers are
doing testing to see how many of your
users are going to be broken that's
wonderful for the content providers
gives them a lot of insight does
absolutely nothing for the user this
will very simple that's the same kind of
be contesting it will try a series of
URLs see how long it takes if they
timeout or not try to declare will this
person be harmed when a content provider
starts to go to ipv6 more importantly
will they be broken when the provider is
only ipv6 in a more distant future world
this is an example today on the Google
v6 Wi-Fi thanks pretty much work other
than the resolver does not reach a v6
only resolver on the outside not so bad
this is on my cell phone v4 only things
will work when somebody goes to v6 they
won't be harmed by it they're just not
in an ideal situation
this unfortunately is about 20 minutes
ago on the Google normal network
somebody is advertising a bad route
everything's broken is it still that way
hmm is it still that way are there still
robberies I not sure this looks like
it's a 64 being advertised I've got a
mac address oh haha the guilty if this
is you please stop feedback welcome if
it detects any particular cases that it
doesn't understand it will have a form
at the bottom please fill it out give me
contact info so i can help better
understand it thank you but you only
used two minutes you got a second is
there show the demo hmm what do you
think this would take to to handle uh
tens of thousands of users may be
checking maybe not simultaneously
probably need a little bit more
connectivity from my provider a little
bit more cash so please don't slashdot
me so but it's okay if you too but if i
share with your friends yeah like
twitter okay looks good here that was
quite fast ya know this actually has
nothing to do with the client having v6
dns resolution this is using the normal
resolver it doesn't know which way it is
the resolver that is being used was told
to look up a name that is only dns
lookup a bowl over v6 so from here to
resolver to a v6 authority that broke
Erich yeah it says the dns resolver that
he's talking to does not have the
ability to to make a make a query of an
authoritative server that is deep as I
pv6 only
and that is in fact the case at the
moment so in this particular case so
we're when there is DNS for v6 glue
records some of your lookups may be
delayed Thanks excellent thank you very
much we're moving liar lung here Thomas
you he only took about three minutes so
you grab a few minutes more if you wish
I have three slides and three such lies
speaks lovely all right thanks well I
can easily talk longer this is a big
program but I thought I just want to
give a brief overview of the usg v6
program mostly because it's been around
actually for a long time it's going into
effect pretty pretty soon and I'm
surprised at how many people are run
into they actually don't know very much
about it or weren't really aware of it
when they probably should have been
alright so this is really about US
government requirements for ipv6 and it
starts off with you know in 2010
starting in July ipv6 and ipsec are
going to be procurement requirements and
if you look at the history of the US
government with ipv6 they have a very
long history of making requirements or
saying we want ipv6 deployed and I think
earlier today one of the talks to start
off the DoD in 2003 I guess the earliest
one okay over time the requirements have
slowly been ramping up or they beget
more specific about what it means to do
ipv6 and the one that's going to affect
in July is now a very detailed profile
that lists individual RFC's you have to
do and also includes a testing regimen
where you have to take your products to
testing organization to verify that
actually complies with all the relevant
pieces of the ipv6 standards this was
made binding by a federal acquisition
regulation that's so-called far this is
the way the US government turns policy
into procurement law and what it means
is as they start doing procurement and
to a vendor the vendor will be asked
show us what you're doing with ipv6 and
that it matches our requirements or that
it supports ipv6 in the following ways
that's the way these sort of things roll
out the scope of us TV 6 is it covers
all devices or products that in bed an
IT stack so it means anything the
obvious things like an operating system
any kind of hardware software packages
bundle together that has a stack in it
if you're running it sort of a network
appliance or a router it has some sort
of you know v6 tax functionality and
you're going to be in scope for this the
u.s. g6 requirement is really two parts
there's what we think of as ipv6 that's
all pretty reasonable and in fact I talk
to people that are doing this and
vendors the the v6 requirements aren't
that hard
but they've also thrown in security and
ipsec in particular ike version and to
and from an industry perspective I
version two it's sort of a new mandate
it's not really widely deployed industry
at all in fact it's not really deployed
at all in industry today so pushing the
envelope on that and of course the fear
from from vendors that sell to the
federal government there's a assumption
that this sort of requirements can
become a checklist where you have to
have it or else you be turned away at
the door or you're gonna have to fight
really hard to get people look at your
program your product because it doesn't
meet some set of generic requirements
okay so how is this done nice develop
this over a period of three years
they've have a you know the number of
documents there's a profile document
describes three network classes or sorry
device classes hosts routers and what
they call a network protection device on
there are specifics there are specific
requirements for what each class needs
to implement in terms of functionality
is obviously the host functionality will
be different than the router
functionality they've created a testing
program to back it up that involves
third party outside labs that go and
test the individual rfcs that you're
supposed to have implemented to
currently UNH iol you know shows ipv6
ready logo testing and I csas are doing
that and when you're done with that the
product issues but they can call an s
stock or suppliers declaration of
conformance or I'm sorry compliance that
essentially says here is what we've
implemented and here is the testing
laboratory tested it so you can go look
at the results and verify for yourself
that we've really done this and so from
at a high level there's been a pretty
good collaboration in my view between
NIST and industry and the sense that
NIST you know they put out some draft
profiles they got a bunch of Industry
feedback their revised them and modify
them and what they've actually produced
at this point is not as nearly as owners
as it could have been if you imagined
what elements is the match if you look
at some other programs that have been
put into place in the past they've read
they leveraged the ipv6 ready logo work
tremendously there's an mou sign between
the two organizations where they're
essentially pledged to work together on
developers you know come the same test
set so that as you're doing one you
automatically get tested for the other
well the open-source test you know tool
kits available you so you do that in
your own lab
so at least as you're doing the product
development you'll be able to test this
stuff and be pretty certain that when
you go to the external lab you know
what's going to expect and you already
know where they're going to go through
or not ok so in isolation then this
profile is policy free so this is this
is one thing to keep in mind missed does
technology they develop what the profile
is they talk about the technology in
terms of policy who is required to do
this what it means if your product
doesn't comply that's policy is done by
OMB okay completely different part of
the US government so practical impact of
us db6 for all of us if you talk to miss
what their intention was in creating
this program was essentially to provide
additional market pressure
Iraqi talk to them specifically the I
Persian to I be sex security requirement
is designed to bring sort of two things
in with ipv6 not just a larger
addressing space but actually sort of
increase the overall baseline of
security that's available or potentially
available and what the OC v6 does is it
creates a way for the federal agencies
to express what their requirements are
in a sort of a vocabulary that everyone
understands using the profile that says
like if you want to be usg v6 capable
that means you've implemented the
following rfcs and everybody agrees on
what that is in fact if you look back on
the sort of the previous requirements
the government has said you need to do
ipv6 well people could turn around said
we've done ipv6 and people say well what
does that really mean like what we did
everything except for this particular
standard and it turns out that's a
critical one to make your product
actually work in the field so we know
how that that game works so the December
far requires agencies to essentially
issue requirements with state with their
requirements are starting in July of
2010 and what the actual agency will
require or request we don't know yet
because they haven't really done this
yet and they may request less than the
nice sorry then in this baseline or let
me actually request more than this
baseline the assumption is that most are
just going to say this looks good to me
we're going to do that okay DoD has
their own profile work that they've been
they've been doing they've been sort of
you know working in tangent with the
NIST work so they've already expressed
essentially what their requirements are
they're largely lined up they have some
different timelines and as an overall
result what's happened now is that the
vendors that sell in the federal
government are essentially adding more
ipv6 support and more IP second hike
version to support to their products
they would have otherwise in the absence
of this program okay in terms of what's
going to actually happen when this goes
into effect it kind of really remains to
be seen what the individual agencies are
going to do at one level they are
required to do this they are required to
you know stay with their ipv6
requirements are in reality there's
always going to be a little bit of
wiggle room there are there's Avenue for
exceptions in if you look at the writing
it requires the agency CIO to make an
exception how hard is that to do it
depends
on the agency it depends on the vendor
it depends on how well they like your
product and all kinds of factors and
this creates sort of a bit of
uncertainty for product vendors that if
they don't have this functionality maybe
they better get because they don't
they're going to be disadvantaged
especially if their competitor over here
is doing it or we're not sure if they're
doing it or how up to your speed they
are and so on and so this really creates
a sort of a just generalize pressure to
to put more ipv6 into products I think
that's what's happening I'm you know I'm
pretty familiar with what's going on in
the program I'd be happy to talk to
people offline more about it but but if
you go talk to UNH they've got you know
they're they're getting products tested
now we have some in the pipeline you
know I know cisco and juniper another's
do as well all right thanks any
questions pardon um there's two answers
i can give i can say they're they're
very different because the DoD jeddak
work is like they've done their own
thing completely separate you know um
and from NIST that said if you look at
the actual technical requirements there
they're pretty much in sync it's not the
case that if you're going to do
compliance with one you can't do it with
the other but there are some differences
in the timelines on when one goes into
effect and you know versus the other but
and that's where you know working
together and having industry involved
has really helped get this thing worked
out a lot better than it was at one
point yeah thank you alright thanks
perfect thank you sir oh let's see
moving right along uh Adam we haven't
had a cop haven't had a hosting provider
I don't think today well not soon my new
room
hello Adam from voxel net just a quick
background ER and I'm going to skim
through some of the earlier slides we
are a hosting provider we are not
content per se that we have about a
thousand customers most of which are
some form of content we are not a
household name necessarily though some
of our customers who've agreed to let us
use their logos in the slide are and
from a traffic perspective we have a
number of products our big ones are
leasing of servers either a physical or
virtual machine these are dual stack
enabled today and additionally we have a
CDN which is not yet ready but has many
requisite building blocks in place why
v6 simply why not no compelling reason
we could think of we wanted to provide
our customers with ample time to get
ready test for possible reach ability
and application sack issues and as Eric
pointed out v6 is not something
generally common among coasters and
something we would like to see change
for our deployment I'm going to skim
through this it's a pretty simple
topology we have in place no real
surprises no real complexities Richard
steenburgen and Aaron Hughes had nano
talks which outlines step-by-step
exactly the process to follow and pretty
much the deal there likewise for our
peering there were no real gotchas speak
of we simply enabled dual stack on our I
exports and pn is or the counterparty
wanted to we maintain unique v4 and v6
peer groups and route maps so we can
traffic engineer both of them
differently and in the I X's one thing
we found or that the route servers are
our friends they're not for everyone we
realize why some people are reluctant
use them in fact in some of the equinix
locations we were pretty much the first
network to actually connect and
advertise a prefix to the raft servers
but at the same time we like them they
helped a lot of these slow start issues
just basically contacting peers getting
sessions up that sort of thing and over
time we're hoping to replace them with
direct sessions for our transit it was
also a pretty simple process basically
as our contracts came up for renewal
with various vendors we simply gave them
the ultimatum give us dual stack in all
locations and don't charge extra for it
most vendors were happy to comply
actually kudos to level three and Helia
specifically for being very much with it
and cooperative on this point those who
weren't be terminated and interesting
side note that actually coincided with
thank you failure in a number of areas
actually looking at the people who would
not give us dual stack we found they
were also missing bgp black hole missing
support for IRR prefix lost generation
missing a robust community said
delivering ports really slowly treating
10 gig ports as if there were somehow
gold plated and took many months to
procure had dated pricing under commit
models and in the end from a reach
ability perspective we're very glad we
issued this ultimatum and kind of
regretted not doing it sooner and just a
little background iran our boarding
process when someone signs up for a
server basically right now dual stack on
a server is something which does not
come standard it requires an email to us
frankly because we want to know who our
users are engage them get a dialogue
going see what they're doing why they
want to adapt v6 so on so forth in the
future this will probably be a standard
so just a screenshot of our internal
system it's very easy to board a
customer we basically have a GUI which
we use which will auto assign them a 64
in their VLAN interface just punch in
requirements it'll give us a recommended
net block we click Save and at that
point basically our routers are
automatically configured with this / 64
on the customers VLAN interface and
internally it's actually really simple
to implement we had the foresight
basically from the get go to database
all IP addresses be then v4 or v6 as 128
bit and here's another screenshot this
is actually of our Adobe AIR desktop app
as you can see basically customers can
spin up or spin down infrastructure
themselves be a physical server or a
virtual server and lo and behold if
their account is flag to support it they
will receive dual-stack likewise DNS we
are using power DNS with a my sequel
back end this is a homegrown tool which
is accessible to our customers and our
staff you can see it's simple to add a
ipv6 reverse record you can add qua days
no real surprises there as for
deployment by and large it went well our
internal tools are working well backbone
deployment when well no real issues data
center and edge was a little bit hairier
just on these small top of rack layer 3
devices required some reboots 40 cam
carving even still some of the cam
profiles that vendors give us are less
than ideal but work it's one unexpected
gotcha a specific vendor platform was
just seemed to suffer from an utter lack
of key way basically it's supported v6
dressing v4 BGP but
v6b GP try to establish a v6 bgp session
box on Malik but and as for our CDN
that's pretty much what we have to go
underlying infrastructure is there needs
additional QA need to figure out logging
and potential for breakage with our
login and one big thing and something I
really want to speak to in closing is
just the fear uncertainty and doubt
there are non reach ability scenarios
that were discussed today they're real
people learning an RA but not actually
able to talk to the v6 internet people
with really dodgy or broken v6
connectivity and at the end of the day
when we're serving the kind of traffic
we are a fraction of a percent still
represents a lot of eyeballs and at the
end of the day we are in business to
deliver content so that kind of gets in
the way of things some next steps host
dressing currently we're basically just
assigning a sixty four per customer VLAN
interface in fact common practice but at
the same time seems a little bit
gratuitous also conducive to possible d
das and port scanning scenarios and when
we roll out new services with a layer 3
hypervisor you basically have sometimes
a hypervisor functioning as a router and
a single host and do you really need a
slash 64 for that I'm not sure I
certainly hope not and as for next steps
reach ability testing obviously we need
more empirical data to that end with
cooperation of certain customers we are
embedding certain objects via JavaScript
jpg or flash and customer websites to
basically feel out for reach ability in
addition we're contacting specific peers
and other eyeball networks of interest
basically trying to vet and qualify them
and just in closing one thing we would
really like to see is better community
knowledge on the reach ability scenarios
and to that end I saw a lot of
possible lightning talks and other
comments left for various white listing
services and reach ability studies
underway if anyone could benefit from
some VMS or physical machines on our
network we are more than willing to kick
in so please see be offline and any
questions Bravo you had a little slide
with interesting icons of some of your
customers earlier don't go back okay
just want to know if there's any
correlation between those and people
have signed up for your ipv6 um there
has been some I can't speak to specifics
it's not been a lot unfortunately but we
are looking to do specific case studies
with some of these more name-brand kind
of customers and hopefully come next
nanog or next conference will have some
actual facts and data to share their
okay thanks hi Stan barber have you had
any customers or is there any
correlation between domestic and
international customers with interest in
ipv6 um it seems to really run the whole
gamut we've had comparable interest from
domestically and abroad additionally we
have data centers and other continents
and people in the US or spinning up
machines there and vice versa so
interest has been pretty widespread no
real correlation thank you very much
restroom no okay Thank You Adam
Suresh suresh krisshnan from erickson
this I'm okay hi my name is Suresh I'm
here to talk about what kind of
difficulties you can expect when you try
to inspect packets in these X so this is
not a very popular topic like people
don't believe in middle boxes but the
fact is they exist and they actually
need to look at packets so anybody who
turned on an ACL on your router you are
looking at packets okay and I just want
to like bring up like few points like
where routers have had difficulties in
the past and they probably still do it
really depends on the architecture but i
just want to show what the flash points
are so okay i'm in v6 a lot of the
optional information which was like in
the extended part of the IP header is
like pushed into separate extension
headers okay and for example like a
fragment was like we had like a fragment
ID and like the bits like for a
fragmentation these are all being pushed
into an extension header so this makes
standard packet processing much easier
because you have a fixed length header
and you don't have to worry about that
but if you have exception packets it
becomes much harder to process them and
this like multiple extension headers and
there are variable number of them and
each of them can have variable lens okay
and the extension header format is not
very well defined so each extension
header can have like a different format
and this means that once you build your
box if a new kind of extension header
gets defined you're not going to be able
to process the header or you're not
going to even be able to skip past the
header to look further in the packet
okay so if you want to find out let's
say if you want to do an ACL based on a
tcp port you actually need to skip
through each of the headers in each of
the middle boxes okay so you have a
router and you say like I pacl blah blah
blah port destination port whatever 80
then the router needs to look at skip
through each of these headers to find
the TCP port somewhere so until it finds
the tcp error okay and this becomes
difficult if if you have
a software-based router if you have
linux box doing this it doesn't make
much of a difference okay because like
it's just software you keep doing it but
if you have like a sick based router
what happens is this packet gets pushed
into a much lower path and you're going
to really lose a lot of throughput and
then this happens yeah and this is other
thing called ha by hub options like
spelt ebil but like this is other
extension header which can have multiple
options sitting in there and the number
of these options is not constrained you
can have like as many options as you
want and every daughter along the path
are every box that's looking at them
need to process them even though it
understands none of them okay so this is
like a surefire way off like doing Adi
dos like or even a Doss on like a whole
path you just send one pack and every
dot along the path is like going to
think for a lot of time with these
things and so usually what what happens
is if some router doesn't understand it
just like throws out an error and then
you attack stops but in this case like
this a set of options that are defined
that keep processing the rest of the
option so you could put like bunch of
options in there none of the rotors
understand it but they all keep
forwarding it along the path ok and you
need to keep doing this for every packet
ok so this really means that you can
have in the indeterminate amount of time
trying to find like a transport port in
the packet okay and this could be like
typically like even 10 times like the
normal processing time to find a
transport port and there's like bunch of
things called like router alert which
means that this is a magic packet that
anybody can send which makes every lot
or take like a closer look at the packet
which means that it this is not like you
can rate limit it right that's about it
like but it makes every router look
inside the packet to see what's
important to it ok other stuff is like
we have tunneling so a lot of the
migration mechanisms are required
tunneling for like people talked about
six rd like 64 all these things are
based on tunneling and the steady dough
as well that's based on tunneling all
these things mean that you need to do
the inspection based on the inner packet
but
routers like all this lot of Rodman this
year the lacy else support for like
inner packets is very very rare it's
very hard to do I just want to show you
like um for Torito ok this is the
heuristic that you need to run to
actually find out at the packet is a
tenido packet okay and then you need to
do the inspection after so you can see
is like stuff is not really very trivial
to do so I just like want to point this
out to people are implementing these
things to actually take care okay and
that's about it so if if you're also
based on a six be careful like what what
is like fixed and what's not thick so
you can adapt to these things thank you
is Bob here pop huh oh yeah this true
yes I've is it should have been more
specific Thanks now so I'm Bob bands
anti work Francisco and the security
technology business unit I work on this
product called email security appliance
a lot of you guys your email probably
goes through it you might just not know
it we do spam and virus filtering so but
I wanted to talk to you guys about today
is how we managed to get these six into
our product all of you have probably
heard this there's no point why would we
ever want to do ipv6 there's no
customers asking for it sorry you guys
aren't calling us often enough no
customers means no revenue means no
project so we do invent a business case
we had to invent away pitch this to
management to let us work on it and so
we came up with a couple of different
things these three the high level stuff
training we've heard quite a bit about
today or folks are like nobody knows how
to do v6 we've got to find a way no we
train them and of course the best way is
experience so developers the engineers
working on this thing how are they going
to get experience working with v6 they
go read a book that's not very much fun
I don't we let them work on some code
sweet or the handful of them that want
to do it let them go at it operations
and IT it's the same thing you know
Google we've got Eric
Lorenzo here and and that's that's kind
of how this stuff comes out they want to
work on it give them that opportunity
customer support the same thing and pick
up the phone you guys call them up hey I
got your new v6 product I have this
problem and they don't know anything you
what's ipv6 that's not a good thing for
us and so if you kind of look down at
the bottom here we planned to stumble
it's the year 2010 v6 is yeah come on
this conference isn't that big v6 is
picking up but it's not that big we
stumble now customer support picks up
the phone and says what's v6 that might
be okay 2012 not so cool and so we're
planning to do that now or that was part
of our pitch get these six out there now
when a limited limited field early field
trials and see what happens can I
discuss one question so we just heard
about all these far government
requirements isn't that enough of
justification you want to solve the
government you know it's really it
depends on who you talk to if you talk
to product marketing and I think even
the gentleman that was talking about it
says it's a checkbox feature and each of
the departments is going to figure out
what that means to them so there's
requirements and there's checkboxes and
there are lots of different ways to
check a checkbox and so I mean you give
a funny look and trust me I give the
same look to the PM when they tell me
this there are lots of different ways to
sell into those things without actually
meeting all the requirements and I'm
sorry but that's and that's actually how
it works so we're going to you know
basically especially with these types of
devices if you're a router you gotta be
able to route v6 ok that that's kind of
like a real requirement on the security
devices it gets a little bit more tricky
I know you're feel the same exact way
but this is what I get and one other
piece of our sales pitches our product
really does rely on data from our
customers we put these email appliances
out into the field we get data about IP
addresses this IP sent this many pieces
of spam this other IP spent a whole
bunch of ham and we can assign
reputation Eyed Peas well what kind of
built a business around that and so for
ipv6 we've got to start collecting that
data we've got to start figuring out
who's sending spam who's spending the
ham build the reputation service that in
2012 when everybody really starts
banging down the door for v6 email or
ready we've got a real good service form
and so what I would recommend in the way
we manage to pull this in its kind of as
a skunk works project similar to the
twenty percent stuff we hear about a
Google all the time
we're going to do this under the covers
we're not going to tell product
marketing that we're spending
engineering time on it and we're going
to make something happen feature parity
I sorry you know it took us I don't know
what eight or nine years to get our
product where it is today it's we're not
going to get there v6 feature parity
that quickly pick a couple features
what's important what do we think is
most important enable it for v6 rinse
and repeat and so we're kind of at the
first stage now early field trials this
is what we call within Cisco and here
you go here's an example of the first
thing there is showing you that I
configured interfaces the v6 addresses
sweet and the second one they're showing
actual v6 email coming in through our
appliance how much evil email is over v6
everybody's favorite slide not a whole
lot a big huge bar at the top is a
reputation system working great for v4
and blocking a whole lot of connections
way way way way down there ipv6
including those blacklisted connections
about a percent and a half so the
current state it's in early field trials
this morning I'm really happy to
announce that actually we have hosted
email where we put our appliances in our
data center and you guys rent them from
us that's actually went live / v six
this morning just in time for this
conference of course which is kind of
cool and then of course they're trying
to apply this model yeah we're trying to
extend this model to other areas within
Cisco we managed to pull this off for
the email security appliance how can we
apply it to the other areas within the
company we're getting customer feedback
we're shaping the product or shaping the
rinse and repeat stage and of course
we're waiting for more ipv6 emails so
gmail smtp yahoo smtp comcast you know
we're looking for you guys now as well
great yep does the cisco mail server
actually already accept ipv6 because
last time i checked they didn't know
you're right and we could talk a lot
about that no Cisco is it was actually
one of our imports first large customers
so we do eat some of our own dog food
but we don't tend to involve ourselves
in beta or early field trials fair
enough but trust me they'll be hearing
from us a lot we really want that I get
a question about the reputation of list
well are you going to do those in these
six I mean it right I amer could utilize
to
absolutely we're absolutely thinking
about that now the service doesn't exist
today because there's no data we don't
know who's sending spam we don't know
who's sending ham we can't build it but
the obvious thing is there's no database
that I can think of that can have 2 2
128 rose in it that's a lot of rose so
that doesn't that's not going to exist
any time soon and so we're thinking
about how we're going to store that data
how are we going to aggregate stuff so
yeah if everybody is getting a 64 and if
you know free is handing out / 60s maybe
we don't store reputation on / 128 you
know today we store them on / 32 it's no
big deal four billion rows in the
database it's not a big deal it's not
going to scale for v6 we have to
aggregate we have to find other ways of
doing a reputation for those addresses
and we're working on it thank you I
think kind of changed things up a bit
here so um ed if you want to hear a
second I will I need to load up the new
presentations real quick you've
wrong one yes I have one other one I
need to put in next sorry about that yes
yes
it I'll do this hello everyone my name
is Ed horley I am was recently appointed
the co-chair for the California ipv6
task force we are going through a
relaunch and I wanted to quickly cover
some items so I wanted to talk about
what we do which is basically advocacy
and education how we how do we support
that basically it's by coordinating
events that are going to be in
california specifically around ipv6 and
then how do you get involved and
obviously we have a website URL twitter
feed and George Lucy who probably many
of you familiar with and I spoke to this
morning unfortunate could make it down
here you just wanted to quickly pitch in
for that reason we're relaunching is
because most of the folks were
originally involved with the California
ipv6 task force all got observed at work
on the North American one and we didn't
have a lot of resources in California to
run this anymore we are breaking down so
many of you folks probably attend in the
Rocky Mountain ipv6 task force convened
we are planning on hosting similar sort
of events in California California is a
large enough region to be doing this
stuff on our own in fact we will be
breaking down into geographic regions so
I'm going to be running the Bay Area
George is going to be running Sacramento
we're looking for folks who want to run
la in San Diego because we think we're
going to be enough interest to be
spreading out geographically across
California please come see me i'll be
happy to hand you my business card or
you can get a hold of me via this way
don't plan to stand between you and beer
tonight so that's it thank you
so I think we're down to the final two
thank you all for hanging in there Andre
do you wanna come up here Andre Berto
come on has recently started to a do
some analysis actually some of our key
six things so this is this is analysis
that I have done tonight so you've some
of the needs of DDT and the details are
not right that will of course make me
blush later but I still decided to show
you somewhere with the results so I
collected the ipv6 addresses that we so
I in 2010 and the first day five months
of 2010 and then computed the number of
subnets at each level of resolution so
chopping off the bits from the end of IP
address and counting how many I'm
subnets vc and i also compared it with
the ipv4 data that we had for two weeks
in march and here is what we get this is
the graph that shows how many subnets we
see in a teacher of this subnet length
mask for ipv4 you can see that this
green line goes up like a straight line
this is because it is a logarithmic
scale so what you see is actually expand
shull function with the effector of
about 1.85 there is normally if the IP
space would be packed absolutely densely
so there would be every IP address would
be used you will see an exponential
function with a factor of 2 which means
that every next bit it gives you twice
as many subnets in a normal ipv4 space
we have about one point 85 at the moment
and in ipv6 space as you see the most of
the growth actually happens between the
mask length of 12 and 48 and then there
is the next interval where the growth
happens between mask legs of 64 and then
eight
by 80 beats essentially IP address has
become unique yeah you can see it in a
little bit greater detail on this other
plot that is essentially the derivative
of the plot I just I've shown you so
here you see the Green Line dipping down
at / 15 and / 23 resolution for ipv4 and
then these two areas where the factors
become really high but they never reach
the level of ipv4 the highest factor is
about one point 71 whereas as I said for
ipv4 it is about one point 85 and it is
about 1.8 at 15 and 24 resolution which
you can intuitively and think of as
people say getting a slash / 23 and
saving half of it for future growth and
using only half of it for current
addressing like that yeah thnkx and Eve
had the honor of work well on about
honor but did me the honor of closing
out the last tech talk session at our
last conference so oops maybe if I had
pointer skills Eve
thank you well gee thanks all those
thank you so let's conclude so
congruence in fact the only one who
talked about congruence was Eric when I
talk congruence I am talking about
quality of service I want to have the
same experience if I do v4 or v6 because
in fact I do not care really if i do
before or v6 one thing we have seen
today is that Lorenzo didn't talk about
round-trip delay the way he did last
year that was a major problem and the
culprit of course was the use of entire
AAS tunnels the evil tunnels so
basically thank you Google Thank You
youtube for generating a lot of traffic
that allowed me to grow that the network
by sixty percent and buy new expensive
cisco cards and things like that and
basically that network nowadays runs
about eight nine percent of of the
world's internet traffic and growing
latest routers added where dar Salam
moscow and cape town or dual stack of
course now if we look at it the last
year 2009 data we were still a much
lower and right now end of the year 25
and the latest stats were up to thirty
two percent your stack why is that is
that we changed our incentive our
salespeople we told them tell our
customers who go dual stack now
basically our customers are about 500
ases we don't have end users so whether
salespeople set i will i am not
interested to sell your stack because i
have to go back to the customer there's
no additional revenue for v6 so
basically why should I bother and there
is another sales order to implement so
the change we made if a customer re news
and basically a customer own order is on
average one year if he renews by default
he get you a stack only if he says I
only need people
or let's get get v4 so basically that's
solved that problem again people don't
care about v6 if you go and tell them
you do you want v6 you will get the
question why or what is that so
basically i would recommend to everyone
in the space including our content
providers don't go and tell customers do
you need v6 he will wait till the last
minute you tell your management my
revenue with Sigma V for pres v6 and if
you give me before and v6 my revenue
stream is guaranteed I will be a
business continuity and I will be
independent of the variable of the
transition speed some recent metrics we
know them we reached 3,000 active
entries I'm growing this is still not
big but is healthy and if we go forward
that in congruence is much closer than
it was a year ago in fact in march in
bahrain at the cisco networkers we
activated v6 therefore whatever kk was
therefore for google and i think going
to correct me if i'm wrong about 700
people connected in v6 the vast majority
didn't know they connected in v6 and
they could not have cared but this is
health you know the missing the grade
cpe equipment vendors i was in the
market by chance for a new little box
and it was between d-link and lynxes now
you know what i bought because on and
again there's one thing to say every
year and committed to ipv6 there is a
difference between commitment and going
to the altar to get married so the other
part missing is load balancing there is
still a lot of load balancing missing I
need content because I was told by
management you spend one-third of your
time on ipv6 it only generates one
percent of the traffic if you want to
get your bonus
year it should generate ten percent of
the traffic so mr. content providers get
working so I get my bonus thank you
