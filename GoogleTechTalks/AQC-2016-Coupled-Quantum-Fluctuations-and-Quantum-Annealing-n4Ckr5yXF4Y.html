around until the very last talk of the
conference so i'll be talking about nano
stochastic hamiltonians and quantum
annealing of icing spin class and this
is a work that is mainly evolved into a
collaboration with matthias Troyer as
well as Ethan Brown and Jessica carlo
who provided the bulk of the data um so
yeah you heard about this is so classic
versus not a stochastic a lot in this
conference but just let me give you a
definition one last time so stochastic
Hamiltonians have a formal definition
and that basically states that in the
computation for the assignment there
matrix the matrix representation of
these Hamiltonians in the computational
basis is either diagonal a soft or all
it has often mattrick's elements that
are negative and physical systems that
correspond to this Hamiltonians are
basically all bosonic systems not
prostrate magnets and those fermionic
systems that do not suffer from the soil
perhaps at the same problem which means
in this not suffering from the same
problem again which means means if these
problems are not hard for other reasons
then quantum Monte Carlo is going to be
efficient for that um okay so
numerically it's been is as we actually
heard about it in this conference as
well it's been shown that quantum on a
call on quantum annealing show the same
scaling for for for tunneling problems
and this numerical observation basically
leads to this conjecture that if a
problem is heart is inefficient for
quantum Monte Carlo then it's probably
also inefficient for a quantum annealer
which works with is stochastic
Hamiltonian which basically has a
stochastic Hamiltonian and then this
conjecture is true then the basically if
we want to pursue quantum annealing just
leaves us with this basically seeing how
efficient non stochastic Hamiltonians
can be for quantum annealing that's and
that's basically the question on trying
to answer to well not to answer but to
shed some light on in this talk ok no no
so classic hamiltonians basically tore
those Hamiltonians which do suffer from
the same problem and this corresponds to
hamiltonians of bit most thermionic
systems and frost
with magnets and so and by definition
quantum Monte Carlo is an affection for
them so known as the plastic Hamiltonian
that such are more complex and cannot be
efficiently simulated with classical
computers and I should also mention that
again as we heard about doing this this
conference and it's a rebel known result
that if the problem Hamiltonian in
adiabatic quantum algorithm can be
encoded in terms of non stochastic
Hamiltonians and then universal quantum
computing is possible but now we want to
answer it sort of want to look at this
known as the class the sitting in a in
the in the context of quantum annealing
and the question we want to try to try
to answer is that Candice additional
complexity can actually help us solving
a hard optimization problems in the
context of quantum annealing and by that
I mean if we start with a problem
Hamiltonian which is still classic but
it's still hard if we add additional
terms are our Hamiltonian our annealing
Hamiltonian such that the total
Hamiltonian becomes known as the classic
whether these advitor the addition of
these additional terms actually help us
solve this the quad the hardest elastic
problem handle Sonia so that's the
statement of the problem so and then so
the initial mention so this is a
numerical work so we picked a particular
problem in particular the and icing a
version of icing explain glass our
problem which is similar to Chris
Cherington cake batter model and in
which we basically define a problem on a
for the connected graph so every two
spins are interacting with each other or
coupled to each other and then the
couplings are basically randomly chosen
from a Gaussian distribution and and in
addition we also add random fields to
add to each to each spin again the
strength of the random field is also
chosen from the random distribution
Gaussian distribution um so and it's
been shown that this problem obvious
okay it's often it it's infinite
dimensional it's been shown that it's
worse cases or NP hard so we tell it's a
reasonable problem to to to to look at
and as for additional terms as we heard
this morning from Peter stock and also
talks probably the simplest term that we
can add to these Hamiltonians is an X X
term with a positive sign and then the
combination of this is X X terms and the
problem Hamiltonian in ADA's a basis
basically gives us an intrinsic non 0 so
classic Hamiltonian and so but uh and
okay but note that this we are defining
these XX couplings with positive signs
on on on a Foley connected graph and if
you start with a hammer and and if so if
that is a restoring point we know that's
be if you have an apparently couplings
on a fully connected graph then that
leads to a huge digit basically
frustration and a huge degeneracy so
that's a bad place to start our
annealing so so this sort in intial
Hamiltonian initial starting point
shouldn't be this this Hamiltonian so
for Daniel inga schedule I basically
picked this this anilingus schedule from
Elizabeth's paper back in 2014 so we
start with a traditional starting point
of adiabatic quantum algorithm which is
that where the ground state where all
the spins are lined up in the X
direction and then we linearly decrease
the strength of this transverse field
basically and linearly increases the
strength of the problem Hamiltonian and
in the middle of a turn on and off these
additional terms and in the addition of
these additional terms basically should
make our Hamiltonian known as the
classic so one choice is as I said just
adding XX terms with with all positive
signs like a uniform XX term we also
looked at a combination of both signs
plus and minus so in this talk I'll be
showing you a version where we look at
random signs but we also looked at other
combinations of plus and minus when it's
not random and vendor some patterns and
that but the results are actually very
similar and i'm not going to show the
results in this talk so these two are
our non stochastic hamiltonians and then
to basically so note that when we when
we add these ex extra
to our Hamiltonian the the sort of you
can see locally the effect of that is
that instead of hat is so I whereas when
we have an X term it basically flips one
Spain at a time when you add these
extremes it corresponds to flipping two
spins at a time so in order to try to
distinguish the effects of non
stochasticity if there is such an effect
from the effects of adding a paired
couple term to the dish basically
corrupt flips a pair of spins at a time
we also as a check look at this at this
additional term with a negative sign and
of course the addition of this term that
in the red box to this Hamiltonian gives
us is still in a stochastic Hamiltonian
but now it's just took a state cop of
Hamiltonian so we have basically three
coupled hamiltonians to not a stochastic
one is so plastic and then we compare
all of them against the case where the
very only have the transverse field as
our driver Hamiltonian ok so before
showing you the results so just just a
quick note on what our tools are so we
have we basically do exactly
idealization to look at the to calculate
the the energy spectrum and find a point
actually finally their lip the result
the the salt the solution to our problem
Hamiltonian and and we also carry out
and also read of the size of the minimum
gap and then we also carry out your
ettore show during your diner dynamics
to try to simulate a process of any link
and so as a metric that as our metric we
basically use success probability which
in this case is is defined as they
overlap between the true grammar sort of
the system and the ground state that
will be read off from the Schroedinger
simulation squared um ok with me this
method they can also calculate residual
energy but again I'm not going to show
you the results for residual energy and
just kind of focus on success
probability as our metric all right so
let me start with the data so this is a
result of this sonus in this program
just showing you the distribution of
probability for a system of 15 spins
ten thousand instances and you can see
that there's a huge peak around one
which basically indicates that the
majority of problems that we're looking
at or pretty easy just with a bit and
eggs within transverse field driver
driver Hamiltonian so we do one level of
post-processing so we just get rid of
the problem the instances which already
give us 99 percent probability and at
the end up with this shape which is a
steal still the majority of cases are
pretty easy but but it's at least a bit
more evenly distributed so and then so
in this case we've sort of get rid of
the very the easy problems we end up
with about fifty eight percent of the
population instances all right um so and
ik and it's just to make a compare so
this is sort of the last definition that
i'm showing here to actually try to
quantify the gain that we have we get
from each type of coupled fluctuation we
define the success probably enhancement
which is simply the ratio of the new
probability resulting from couple
Hamiltonian to the old probability
resulting from just the transfers filter
and we define it to be greater than one
and also we define success probably
enhancement ratio which is basically the
number of don'ts those instances which
will show improvement once we turn on
the coupling terms divided by the total
number of instances and we define it as
such that it's it's a number is the
number of those instances which provide
better probability than X and also
better than every other couple
fluctuation coupled Hamiltonian that
we're looking at I just I just I just
define it to be greater than one I
exclude that I just define it this way
yeah all right um ok so again for the
case of n equal to 15 these are the
successful the enhancement ratios that I
see for for for the three types of
couple time Estonians that I have so far
is the plastic case it's about sixty six
percent of instances show improvement
once I turn on the minus X X term and
then contrast that with
a successful the enhancement ratio that
I get for not a stochastic cases which
is significantly lower its two percent
for the uniform case and about eleven
percent for the for the mixed case but
now if you look at the distribution of
this enhancement we see that for the
through the circus the case this is
basically peaked around zero so in the
bottom line i'm actually showing you the
log of p enhancement so for basically
means 10,000 times better so here the
maximum is about a thousand times better
and the 99 percentile value of p of p
enhancement is only 10 so so i'm showing
you these this this data to basically
indicate that this is a very peak
distribution and the majority of cases
that we see enhancement the enhancement
is pretty marginal now this is so now
this is a distribution that you get for
for the uniform non so class the case
and you can see that it's it's already a
lot more evenly distributed and you can
see that the the maximum and the 99
percentile value are both around 10 to
the fourth so things get better about
10,000 10,000 times better in this case
and for the non us across the case with
the fitted with a mixed sign case again
we can see that it's this is somehow in
between the the first to the the maximum
improvement that we can see in this case
for this particular system size is huge
it's about a million times and then the
99th percentile is about a thousand um
okay so so just to sort of recap the
data that I showed you in the in the
previous slide it seems that for the
stochastic hamiltonians improvement it
basically improve a large fraction of
instances but the actual improvement for
the majority of cases is a small Perez
for an honest opacity case it's a it's
much smaller fraction of instances that
show improvement but the actual
improvement can be large so now let's
look at the particular instances are
affected by each type of Hamiltonian see
if we see a pattern there so this is it
so here the blue bars correspond to the
distribution of those instances
that the the probability of those
instances that actually result from an
uncoupled Hamiltonian but but focus for
those instances that will show
improvement once we turn on the minus X
X terms oh really okay okay so okay and
then the red line basically the red bars
basically show what happens once we turn
went enter turn this on and we see that
it's actually it's many did the easier
problems that are being affected and
this is a scatter plot of the same thing
new probability versus all probability
you see the concentration of points is
there for the poor the knowledge to
class the case again we see that it's
the opposite behavior basically the
peaks are around p equal to zero which
basically means it's the harder problems
that are being affected by the knowledge
stochastic Hamiltonians and you can see
that from these scatter plots better the
concentration of the dots on the P P X
equal to 0 and the vertical line so so
so then it seems that is for us to ask
hamiltonians basically they proved
easier problems whereas for known as
elastic ones it's mainly the harder
problems that are being affected what
can be so what is going on let's so they
basically the only clue that we have
with the tools that there are numerical
tools is just the data that we can get
from the spectrum and in the further the
usual suspect is the size of the minimum
gap so what happens is the minimum gap
here again it's probably better if you
look at the scatter plots this is a plot
of new gap versus old gap and you see
all the points or above the line which
basically indicates that for stochastic
Hamiltonians the size of the gap
increases in contrast for Norman's the
classic ones we can see that there's not
really a real pattern size of the
minimum gap can get smaller can get
bigger again get can stay unchanged so
so it seems that for the classic
Hamiltonians it's they basically improve
it the improvement they basically
improve their size of it's sort of
likely like likely scenario that they
actually improve the size of the gap and
thereby they increase the probability
and so here's an example for a for a
very small case n equal to 6 and so this
is a plot of the gap
with a minimum gap at one minimum gap
and then this is so here the blue line
is a proper they overlap between the
probability there between the ground
state of the the true ground of certain
system and and the the the wave function
from the from the Schrodinger equation
and then the Green Line is basically the
overlap between the shorting your wave
function and the first excited state of
the system and you see that once we
arrive at the minimum gap they switch so
and so we end up in a bad probability
now if we turn on the non stochastic
terms then we see that the gap actually
serving creatures a little bit and with
the consequence it's it really not
doesn't really affect their
probabilities that much anymore and then
there probably is basically increased so
so it seems so that so what happens in
the in the sequester case is kind of
make sense now what happens in the
normal class the case in a normal so
that's the case we see that the for the
majority of cases we basically don't see
a pattern between the changing the size
of the gap and and what happens to the
probability so what is going on here so
here I'm actually going to give you a
very hand wavy explanation and yes so
sort of this is yeah this is basically
sort of Mormon intuition than actually
any real proof so let's just take it
with a grain of sand solve so so so in
this Hamiltonian that very studying so
when I have plus X X terms so again so
these XX terms are defined on on a fully
connected graph so they basically they
just having these ID fermented couplings
they basically leads to frustration in
in the X direction and now when adding
having these X this dispersal in X
Direction basically this edition of
frustration basically means are we have
leads to having near degenerate States
throughout our revolution and then the
presence of these Disney are degenerate
States basically means that sugar will
be additional of anti crossings along
the path oh and so and
and I suspect that this edition of these
additional anti crossings actually can
help and this is one example again so
here I have a minimum gap that is very
small and then this is what is happening
to the two probabilities for the ground
state and excited estate when I don't
have any couple terms and now once I
turn on the couple terms i end up with
two level crossings both of them are
fairly small and then this is what has
happened to the probability it basically
comes down and it gum it has a chance to
come back again and for the cases that I
have looked at this seems to be
especially when the change in
probability is large this seems to be
the dominant effect at least based on
the data that I had so far okay so and
then this is a plot of the number of
level crossings again the horizontal
line corresponds to the X only in a
vertical line corresponds to X X and you
can see that for the uniform not a
stochastic case the number of
double-crossing increases and can
increase a lot similarly for the case of
the the mix design case whereas for the
non stop for the su casa case for the
majority of cases it seems that the
number of level causing is actually
decreases so so so basically this circa
leads us to thinking that ok so for the
non stochastic not whereas the
stochastic Hamiltonian seem to improve
the probability by added by increasing
the size of the gap maybe one mechanism
behind the fact that Donna stochastic
Hamiltonian seem to improve the
probability is that they actually
increase the number of level crossings
and thereby provide the opportunity for
the system to go back to the grant said
if it happened to jump earlier on ok and
so so far I showed you the results for
44 just finite size systems for 15 15
spins but this is a this is sort of a
plot of how things change as the system
size changes so this is a plot of such
as probably enhancement ratio as a
function of system size and so the top
line that red line is the stochastic
case you see that it sort of keeps
increasing as the system size clothes
and then the green and purple
corresponds to a tune on a stochastic
ones and you
can see that they seem to be kind of
saturating at some point and then they
stay constant at least up to the system
size that they've looked at and then and
then this is the part of the 99
percentile of the success probably
enhancement actual enhancement that we
see and you can see that for this
request the case I'm sorry that these
numbers are a little small for the su
casa case the improvement is always less
than 100 times so it's fairly small
birds for the non ahsoka is like one
it's a lot higher you can see that the
green and purple or above 10 to the
first times better so this is basically
the phenomenon and and then sort of to
try to get a clue of what is going on
this is again this is a plot of the size
of the minimum gap the median value of
the size of the minimum gap for affected
instances for each type of Hamiltonian
and you can see that contrary to what we
expect for the stochastic case the gap
actually seems to increase as a system
size grows whereas for the non
stochastic ones it seems to well
fluctuate or slowly decreases and this
is a part of the so so basically this
this plot indicates that the furthest
across the case again it's like it's a
gap that is helping and birds put it in
this point I'm showing you the ratio of
the number of level crossings after I
turn out couple the couple terms / when
I don't have couple terms and yeah so so
this line here so the the red line is
actually below 1 which basically means
for the majority of cases the number of
level crossing this could decreases when
I turn on the stochastic terms whereas
for an honest elastic ones it actually
always almost always increases ah so
that's this sprinter I summary so I
basically showed you that first across
the couple time alphanians they improve
large fractions of instances and then
these fractions actually increase with
the system size the actual improvement
but the actual improvement is a small
and then they tend to improve on
problems with larger gaps and they seem
to improve the probability by increasing
the size of the gap and in contrast for
non-us aquatic hamiltonians they seem to
improve smaller fractions of instances
and these fractions remain more or less
constant as the same system so it grows
the actual improvement can be huge in
some cases they mainly improve on harder
problems with easier with smaller gaps
and one possibility of just thinking how
how they actually do this improvement is
just that they the additional
frustration add to the number of level
crossings and therefore it's there might
be sort of more chances for the system
to just relax us back to its ground
state so with that thank you very much
for your attention questions okay I'm
impressed fire you're very impressive
set of data and I have a couple of
comments according to my experience with
it mean feet below the one is that the
most elastic term should be stronger
than you used in your simulations s x
one y minus one exists to really extract
the power of the most elastic effects
okay so you multiply the term by the
factor of ten or like that then the
there is a perspective that dramatically
different behavior may emerge okay ago
glad my experience and another comedies
that you use just a quadratic ah time
squared Oh term happen as the
representative case of the mosque asked
am one of the reasons is what was that
it introduced degeneracy frustration oh
but but according to my experience with
me p a narcissist even the cubic time
works
sit again cuick 33 bodies I'm not
interrupting nose to casket I'm okay so
I'd like you to try okay yeah sure sure
I mean I sort of wanted to start with
the easiest case but yeah I totally
agree with your interpretation of
frustration and actually I was talking
to mr. Murray sundry months ago what
exactly same interpretation but what
could happen is because in the
x-direction you're creating frustration
you're actually creating parallel paths
and instead of having one adiabatic path
you're having many idiotic path going
together so I'm wondering whether this
effect can be simulated by just
randomizing path in a stochastic problem
and get the same randomization of the
gap and enhancement of some problem
versus other problems at the ad fair he
have experience okay well I I mean I
have no comment at the moment I have to
think about it I have to think about it
yeah well I do you have a last word well
I mean we I did a study on something
similar and I what we found is in a way
consistent with what you find and I do
see an algorithmic possibility here
which is that if you have an instance
you run it non stochastically many times
with different paths the real question
is if you run it a hundred times do you
get one big improvement because that's
all you need to solve the instance so
it's you know so for example when you
say the actual improvement can be huge
and mainly improves on harder problems
with smaller gaps i mean we found that
but we also found that if you do it
enough you always hit a winner in other
words you find a path that improves the
gap a lot mm-hmm so that's very
encouraging from an algorithmic point of
view okay and that's consistent with
what you say okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
