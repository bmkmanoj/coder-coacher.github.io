biology okay thank you very much lef for
inviting me out here and actually
picking me up and driving me here which
was otherwise we've been hard for me to
get out here so if this is a really cool
place it's really fun to visit here and
see what you guys are doing so I'm run a
research lab at University of Toronto in
the Donnelly Center for cellular and
biomolecular research and this is what
our building looks like conceptually and
so if you're ever in the neighborhood
you can look for this one actually
there's other buildings here that the
architectural diagram doesn't show so
it's kind of hidden behind other
buildings but it's at college and
university so guys are welcome to come
by and check us out we have a nice
bamboo garden in here that kind of nice
to hang out so I'm I work in in the area
of computational biology or
bioinformatics
some of you might have heard it or know
something about this field there's a
bioinformatics undergraduate program at
University of Waterloo that I think has
like 80 students a year or something
like that and basically a computational
biology seeks to use computers to answer
biological questions and generally this
is becoming more and more interesting in
biology in medicine because new
high-throughput technologies are
allowing people to generate large
amounts of information about biological
systems that we really never had before
and this is all stemming from the human
genome project that started in the late
80s and 90s so we have you know
terabytes and petabytes of information
and finally you actually so you actually
need computers to to reason over it
whereas before it was more like a
cottage industry everybody in biology
everybody had their favorite gene and
they wanted to know what it did and they
tried to collect as much information
about it as they could and that fit in
their head and and now when you have to
deal with whole systems and larger
larger amounts of data you have you have
to use computers and so the cool thing
about it is
my laptop's should be working I think
it's I think it's some cyclone okay just
let me know i yeah i don't have feedback
from if i'm facing this direction okay
so computational biology one of the fun
things about it is that you guys okay
okay okay well we'd like to just keep it
on the presentation whoever's listening
so one of the cool things about
computational biology is that it uses
information and techniques from all
areas of computer science so there's a
lot of work on and and you get to kind
of learn and talk to people in all these
different areas when you're trying to
answer biological questions so there's a
lot of work on algorithms string
processing for instance and text mining
is very string processing and you're
looking for patterns in DNA and aligning
strings is very important machine
learning is extremely important
predicting looking for patterns and in
large data sets and data mining
statistics statistical clustering math
is used for simulations knowledge
representation is used we trying to
construct ontology x' that organized all
of the the knowledge and descriptions of
biological systems databases and
software engineering to create usable
applications our users are typically
biologists and a lot of biologists
actually aren't always computer literate
or computer savvy so they there's
actually this this I think it's changing
now but a lot of people who didn't like
math went into biology and and so it was
we have to work towards making usable
software that anybody can can use so
that's that's important and most most
people in molecular and cellular biology
are trying to figure out how this system
works at the cell so we're trying to
understand the cells very complicated
system many of you probably know about
this from from high school biology and
we're trying to find out how it works
and how it doesn't work
and disease and if it we know how it
doesn't work then we could potentially
design therapies to fix it and I'll just
say just now that if you guys have any
questions about biology and or questions
by moving too quickly over certain
topics then just interrupt me and we can
have a discussion I think we have plenty
of time for rush it should have plenty
of time for discussion so what my lab is
interested in is kind of developing a
computational map of the cell it's kind
of very similar to Google Earth but of
the cell and we'd like to develop this
basically take all the information that
we know about all the systems in the
cell their geography their connectivity
how important they are what their what
their role is and biological processes
and organize it into this computational
map exactly how we do that we're not
totally sure yet but once we have this
map we'd like to be able to read it to
understand how cellular processes are
working what the as I said the role of
specific components and those processes
are what happens when those processes
fail like disease you have a mutation
and that puts a kink in a specific
system and also study these maps between
different organisms so we take the you
know the fish map and the human map and
a monkey map and compare them to see
what's important we might be able to see
the parts of the map that are important
for speech and language and under and
higher you know reasoning that we
exhibit compared to fish whatever
monkeys so that's those are those are
the types of things that were working
towards and we have a few projects many
other people are working on similar
things like this we work to try and
predict this map from the genome so the
genome is all of the DNA that is all of
the genes basically the set of all genes
in our body and some of you have
probably heard about the genome project
that sequenced all of the DNA it's 3
billion letters of DNA bases code for
about 20,000 genes and all of those that
piece those pieces of DNA are organized
into chromosomes and those are compacted
into cells
tiny tiny
fraction of the meter in diameter and
it's actually basically three gigabytes
are present in in each cell of
information and the way that biological
systems actually encode that information
is incredible because in those three
gigabytes is enough to specify our
bodies and we have about between 50 and
100 trillion cells in our body so think
of 100 trillion times 3 Giga Byte bases
3 gigabytes and you get the amount of
information that sort of just encoded in
DNA in our bodies actually it's not
exactly 100 trillion there's not all our
cells a lot of bacteria and other things
are in us that also have DNA and
contribute a lot to the number of cells
that we have in our body so so the we'd
like to be able to read that information
and figure out how it encodes the
biological processes that make us tick
basically we'd also like to take find
out how the map works over time sort of
get a more dynamic view and I call it
the active cell map project and that is
hard to do because you have to look at
the system over time and make millions
of measurements that's becoming easier
to do as technology allows us to make
millions of measurements at the same
time on these cells I won't really go
into too much of this technology but we
can talk about it if you guys are
interested and I'll talk during this
talk just about two projects that we're
working on one is called multiple
perturbation mapping of the system and
it's very similar to reverse engineering
I don't use the term reverse engineering
because the system wasn't engineered
it's evolved and so instead we're just
returning it and seeing what happens
I'll explain how that works and also
talk about some of the software and
databases that we're developing to help
visualize and analyze this information
so multiple perturbation mapping is
basically trying to understand what's
happening in the black box and we have
you know many of you are probably
familiar with this analogy you have a
series of inputs on one side and outputs
on the other in our case these switches
are all on and this black box is somehow
working and that means this light is on
and so the lights always working and so
the system's working lights on that's
good but if you turn off one of the
switches the you know the light might
turn off right and so this tells us that
if we turn off switch a we have some
kind of direct effect that you know
somehow a is directly connected to see
the light and if we if we change now we
turn back on a and the light goes back
on we turn off B and but nothing happens
when we turn off B so so is this
connected at all to the light
well maybe we also try we also see the
same thing but see see as we turn it off
and nothing happens to light but if we
turn off B and C together then the light
turns off right so somehow B and C are
connected in some parallel paths so you
know if you if you this might you know
if you see this type of pattern you
might be able to kind of tell something
about what's in the black box maybe
these you know either either A or B is
needs to be functioning for the light to
work and if only if they're both off
does it fail so that means you have some
kind of parallel pathway that that's in
that black box logically at least and
then you try the next switch D and also
that turns off the light right but how
does that relate to a turning off the
light so what happens if you switch a it
does maybe you see that you switch a up
and down and nothing happens right so
that means that that do somehow masking
the effect of a and that probably means
that D is kind of upstream of a and some
path that allows you to you know figure
out what's going on so so through these
switching although all the options you
might be able to actually figure out
something about the wiring inside the
box right for something sense to
everybody
so um so our black box is that we're
studying is budding yeast so budding
yeast is also known as baker's yeast and
brewers yeast and all of you have eaten
this actually and this is used it's also
the latin name is Saccharomyces
cerevisiae it's a fungus and doesn't
sound too good but it's actually one of
the fungus that's good that we use in
industry it comes from the Greek sugar
mole
and the Latin of beer so it's used in
the beer industry and it has 6,000 genes
6,000 parts and they're organized since
of 16 chromosomes and here's a little
video that just shows a little bit you
know yeast under a microscope and you
can just see them kind of growing for
for a little bit
they're called budding yeast because
they divide by they grow by budding like
a new bud off the off the side of the
yeast and and then once it's fully
butted then it splits off and it becomes
its own cell and he's sort of just
budding yeast growing this manner
there's lots of other types of yeast
around that that do different things but
these ones these ones work like this so
um you know and if you let them grow
they'll grow into a big colony and if
they have enough food they'll take over
a vegard dish or something like that so
that's they're they're pretty pretty fun
to to look at so why do we study yeast
well basically it's a simple system
we're trying to understand how the human
body works but it's kind of difficult to
do experiments on human body plus if we
don't want to so
yeast is a simple version of us that's
just one cell instead of 100 trillion
cells or 50 trillion cells it's easy to
work with in the lab and 20 percent of
the East genes are very similar to genes
that we have in our own genome so
there's similar processes the similar
core processes so yeast have a cell
cycle that allows them to grow and we
also have you know those types of things
in our own cells and you know a number
of famous discoveries have being made in
yeast Nobel Prize in 2001 went to a
number of yeast researchers who
understood yeast to figure out how cells
grow and how the timing is and how's
that how that's controlled and how the
timing works and that was very relevant
to cancer it turned out because cancer
is a disease of cell growth the group
the cells just grow uncontrollably and
they take over right they're not working
in a symbiotic fashion with each other
they're not working late they're not
playing nice with others basically
they're just growing and taking over all
the resources so understanding more
about cell growth tells us
about cancer and if we could understand
for instance how to stop cell growth you
might have some anti-cancer drugs as
well it's also other types of fungus or
pathogenic so there's different types of
bad yeasts that you don't want to have
and there's important to study used to
find antifungal drugs and also last but
not least the biggest use of yeast is
that we actually farm it we make use it
to make bread beer and wine and
basically yeast are really good at
taking sugar like glucose and converting
it to ethanol and carbon dioxide through
a process of fermentation and in bread
the alcohol is kind of made but it's
baked away so you can smell it in the
air when you're baking really eesti
bread but in wine and beer it's kept and
the carbon dioxide is captain beer it
carbonates the beverage right doesn't
doesn't happen you can get rid of that
if you want but so where would we be
without yeast right Italian restaurants
and and you know a lot of you know think
that Irish pubs would not be as exciting
so so basically we'd like to you know
take you know do this black box thing
that we're doing before with yeast cells
instead of having four switches in that
simple example that I gave you we have
6,000 genes so it's much more
complicated system and we're measuring
instead of whether the light is on or
off
whether the cells grow or don't grow so
if the cells grow the lights on if the
cells don't grow the lights off and this
is sort of a logo from the yeast genome
database which they have a super yeast
they call it super bud anyway this is
their logo so it turns out that people
have done the work to delete each gene
in individually so all 6,000 genes have
been individually removed and people
from that experiment which was a pretty
big experiment at the time about 10 or
15 years ago they figured out that 1,000
of those genes were essential for the
yeast to grow and 5,000 of them if you
took them out it didn't matter actually
the yeast would grow maybe they wouldn't
grow properly in every condition
you threw the mat right maybe they you
know they wouldn't certain things would
be broken but in just in terms of growth
or not growth it it's you know a
thousand genes are essential for that
process and you can actually download
these all of this information that I'm
talking about in biology is pretty much
all open access so you can anyone can
access the information so the other
little difference between that simple
black box that I mentioned is that an
individual gene is not just a switch
that you can switch on and off I mean
we're take we're removing it if we if we
remove the entire gene it's like we're
switching off the gene but that gene is
actually much more complicated so gene
is encoded in DNA and it's converted to
a protein the protein folds up into a
little molecular machine you might have
heard of the word enzyme which is you
know it's bit of a type of protein that
does something breaks things down in our
body and built them back up into muscle
for instance in metabolic pathways and
proteins connect with a lot of different
different other things in the cell they
connect with each other so instead of
just having a simple switch we actually
are working with very complicated
components and interactions and there's
all sorts of different ways that these
can be modified by the cell and fairly
complicated processes which we know
something about but a lot of it were
missing like here's an example of two
proteins connecting these are 3d
structures of proteins these are really
really tiny molecules that connect and
they interact in a very specific way so
just to give you an example of the
complexity of each gene what we're doing
here is just knocking out just knocking
each gene out but if we really wanted to
understand the system we'd have to
understand a lot more about all of these
things so knocking out individual genes
tells us something about how the genes
are important in the system but it
doesn't tell us everything about what we
want to know so it's a it's a good first
step and it helps us get some level of
mapping of the cell and what's figuring
out what's important so obviously you've
tried switching off all the genes
individually by removing them
individually the next step is to and we
found that there were five thousand that
really didn't have an effect the next
step is to try doubles so if you try if
you take double if you if you remove two
genes at the same time you can see some
in
you're saying effect just like I showed
you in the in the in the black box
example with the upstream effect or the
parallel path effect and we'd like to
actually knock out all possible double
double do all possible double gene
deletions and see all of these effects
there's eighteen million combinations
though or actually 36 million if you do
both directions and that's a lot of
experiments to do so if you are doing
each one of these individually you'd
have to do with 36 million times that's
a lot of efforts so I'll explain how we
do how my collaborators in in Toronto in
our building are people are working on
this problem how they do it so but the
basic idea is that you have you know
similar to the black box example you
knock out you know here's an example of
one type of interaction it's the
parallel path interaction that I showed
you before you knock out one gene and
another gene and and the yeasts are
viable they they grow but if you knock
them both out together then the yeast
doesn't grow and this might indicate if
you do this enough times it might
indicate that if you do this enough time
with a and B you might kind of see
pathways or paths through this network
of interacting molecules or interacting
genes appear so here all the yellow
lines are these inter this type of
parallel paths interaction we call it a
synthetic lethal interaction which is
the jargon of the field and so it's a
SLE interaction and you know these these
types of white arrows are you know
connections of in a path one two even
one step then the next step and both of
these pathways impinge on some kind of
essential function and that that that
then is related to growth and just by
doing all possible combinations of
knockouts you might be able to see that
there's actually two pathways and that
they're parallel so that is just an
example to tell you how how things are
working and it's not just growth or not
growth that were that we're measuring
now so it used to be actually that's
that was the case but now we're actually
have learned how to in in the lab
measure Qantas quantitatively so we
measure this so it's not just the light
as you know on or off it's that you know
different types of dimness or brightness
and WT is this sort of the normal yeast
people call a wild type it's just the
type that you've seen in the wild and
that would we'd call that you know one
that's growing normally and then you
knock out a and you go down to 0.5 level
of growth you knock out B and you get to
also 0.5 level of growth you knock out a
and B together you expect that there's
going to be you know because a and B
each have an effect you expect that the
a B combination is going to have a worse
effect right so we have some expected
results that's the neutral neutral
results that's just the multiplication
of a and B basically and there's
different ways you can get figure out
what this expected result is but that's
just the expected results and then you
can measure what the actual result is
and see if it's less than you expect or
more than you expect so if you get less
than you expect you get one of these
synthetic lethal interactions which just
describes which gives you an idea of
parallel systems because you can you can
think of it as you know like the the a B
parallel path that I mentioned before if
you knock out if you have two systems
that are parallel they're back up
they're redundant if you mess with one
of them the other one takes over and
vice versa so you know if you but you've
messed with both of them and you really
get system failure so it's much more
than you would expect given the changes
of the individual perturbations right
and and so that tells you something
about the parallel systems on the other
hand we get alleviating interactions
which are better than you would expect
and these things tell us often about
genes who are our products in the same
type of non-essential system so if
there's some kind of system in the cell
that's working but it's not really
essential than messing with it mate
might affect growth and messing with it
again might affect growth but not as
much as you would think that it not as
much as you would expect if it wasn't
connected so so in this there's those
ways there's three type basic types of
genetic interactions that we try to map
and we want to do that on a global scale
so as I mentioned there are 6,000 these
genes and a thousand them are essential
but that we used 5,000 dollars
jeans and we'd like to examine all the
you know 36 million combinations or 18
million if you just do it one way and
Charlie Boone who is a researcher at
University of Toronto had developed over
the past decade or so a method to do
this experiment in a high-throughput way
so instead of just doing one in at in
one like petri dish petri dish shirt or
test tube at a time you can do 1,500 of
them on a small plate about about this
big and they can be automated as well so
I don't really go through this in too
much detail because the biology is
really not important but basically he's
developed a system in him in his lab has
developed a system that allows you to
delete make sure that you you you
combine single deletions to get double
deletions and that's through a series of
robotic pinning steps and mating and
genetic selection events which allow
only certain type of resistant strains
to progress through the process and if
anyone's interested in details I can get
into that but in the end you get these
double mutants and this actually led to
a network of connections the first way
you can do with this process is you can
take one gene and you can mutate you can
you can query it against the entire
genome or the rest of the 5,000 genes
that are not essential so you take one
against 5,000 and you see how many of
the how many of these interactions that
you get and this is plotted here for
eight of these genes full genome screens
that was published in 2001 and it you
know a few hundred interactions resulted
and then in 2004 this was expanded to
132 screens and we got a bigger network
and these networks don't really tell you
much in fact we usually call these
networks hairballs or Death Star's or
something because it's nice to kind of
at this level to see how things are
connected but when you get too many
nodes and edges you lose that you can't
draw it very well so one of the
challenges in the field is actually
drawing these you know building software
that can lay these networks out and a
reasonable
and interpret them so I'll talk about
that later so and this process is being
automated by Charlie and a whole team of
people and there's there's rooms and in
our building that are just dedicated to
robots and arrays that have plates in
big sort of sort of round you know
loaders that you can load in hundreds of
plates at a time and and over overnight
it just does the experiments it just
does all the pinning and I have a
picture a movie of one of the older
versions of the robots just working here
so you know it picks it there's a play
that has a cover takes the cover off it
takes some pins and it you know it
touches the plate the plate has each of
those pins as a colony it touches a
different colony of yeast growing on the
plate and then it moves the yeast to
another plate where it goes through this
series of steps that at the end by the
end of a couple of days you have double
mutants growing on the plate and you can
measure their growth rate by looking at
how big the colony size is so if the
yeast aren't doing too well it's a
little dot where the pin landed but if
the yeasts are growing nicely then it's
a big circle in the yeast have grown
from that pin prick to be a circle and
you can measure that with them I can't
you just take a digital image and then
process that with image analysis so this
is sort of the output plates that we get
and all the experiments are done in
replicate and there's an there's a
number of algorithms that have been
developed by the team of people that are
working on this project to detect the
colony is here with image analysis and
count this number of pixels in the
colony and and then do it there's a
whole bunch of data correction steps
actually I think I should have gotten
rid of that slide but there's a whole
bunch of data Corrections steps that you
have to then consider to filter the data
but basically the the thing that we're
measuring is the size of these colonies
and that's the and and and there's a
whole bunch of you know one of the
challenges that we have to face when you
have thousands of experiments that
you're running is to deal with variation
that are due to systemic effects in
some of which are experimental factors
and other with other that we want to
normalize out and others are biological
factors which is the actual signal that
we want to detect when we see an
interruption so all of the misses clear
to everybody so far all of the this is
sort of one genome-wide screen all the
plates that actually this is a I guess
probably a couple of genome-wide screams
I think one screen is about 14 plates so
I think this does 14 across a few a few
screens this is the the images that you
get if you look for positive and
negative interactions just on the raw
data and all the the green guys are you
know positive interactions and the red
guys are negative interactions but it
turns out a lot of these things are are
there some artifacts here so and we've
discovered a huge amount just from
running so many screens there's probably
very similar to how you guys how Google
has worked in data centers when you when
you have huge amounts of hard drives you
figure you start figuring out things
about the global properties of hard
drives that you didn't know before right
because now you you've tried it on a
million of them and there was a bit you
know I guess Google published a paper on
that right so similarly we found that
the place that the the boon lab was
getting getting plates from the table
one of the tables that they were pouring
these gels for the yeast to grow on was
slightly lower on one side than the
other so that led to a slight deviation
in the the amount of food that the yeast
were going on and there was bigger
colonies on one side than the other
right so and when we told them like you
know they would have never figured that
out because it's you know they've
calibrated it but they really didn't
know to that level of detail other
things that you know I'll mention some
other things in a second but you you get
once you take the raw data you normalize
it it looks a lot there's a lot there's
a lot cleaner so there's a justments for
the camera that was used
there's plate normalization so it turns
out that the position of the yeast
growing on the plates is important if
they're growing at the edge they get
more food because they don't have
competition from their neighbors so so
the
the middle ones are growing less on
average than the outer ones because they
have more competition for more neighbors
and there's the spatial gradient
normalization it's not just that table
issue it's also when they pour this
liquid gel into the plate and then it
hardens it's an agar type plate and the
yeast are grown on top of it it's that
the gel is kind of somewhat hard but
depending on where they pour it there's
there's a you know waves in some way
that's somewhat hardened a little bit
and you can detect that and normalize
that there's batches so there's say ten
different technicians just loading
plates into these machines and each one
has their own statistics associated with
them right they have to normalize
different batches different days all of
these things are things that you would
never have to deal with on a small scale
typical experiment but you do when you
ramp up to a large scale thing and I'll
knows that very well so in the end you
get this you get an estimate of the
mutant the the deletion fitness and also
the double mutant fitness and you can
use that to drive interactions and you
get the score distribution and you can
do more statistics on this and
eventually with some appropriate
cut-offs you can say there's 45,000
negative interactions and 20,000
positive interactions at 95% confidence
remember that this is just looking at
growth if we looked at any different
type of output like the size of the cell
or how long it takes to grow or the the
maximum density of cells that that grows
all of those things are different
phenotypes we call them they're
different outputs and each one would
would basically get its own type of
network that you you'd get so this is
the network of related to growth and it
tells you what's important and what
processes are in parallel just for
growth so you can keep on doing this you
could have you could do this experiment
with growth on a on a banana leaf which
is where you you know might have been
found from or in the lab on a plate or
in different conditions higher
temperature lower temperature etc so
45,000 interactions doesn't sound a lot
out of
three million gene pairs tested but it's
only one type of context and here's the
whole matrix we can't even really see it
here there's we primly done the boom lab
and and there's other people who are
working on this like Brenda Andrews who
also works with this this team have done
a thousand of these screams its five
thousand and some people in in Princeton
Chad Myers and Olga trance kaya's lab at
Princeton have this really nice display
wall that we can actually view this
thing in and and Anastasia Baryshnikov
as a student in my lab in Charlie
Boone's lab that that works on this data
and so you know there's when you get to
this much data there's somewhat
challenging to display it and there's
certain nice toys that people have that
we can use for some of the stuff but
really what you want to do is find out
more about how the system is organized
that's what we're interested in and if
you zoom in on these these this data
matrix you can see regions that are
clustered so this data matrix is
clustered how many people are familiar
with clustering so basically it's just a
algorithm there's lots of different
types that that put similar things
together and and stop to separate
different things and put them apart so
similar similar screens are grouped
together in in this this is a verage
linkage hierarchical clustering if
you're familiar with it and also similar
similar screens and similar genes are
grouped in two dimensions and so if you
zoom in you see genes that all you can
find little clusters where every all the
genes have similar types of activity and
in this case there's some particular
system that's important to the cell for
membrane trafficking which is basically
just moving pieces moving molecules
inside and out of the cell that's one of
the systems that's important there's
another little cluster here that tells
you something about DNA replication and
repair so one of the cool things about
biological systems is that they're self
repairing we're always repairing
ourselves cells are falling off and new
ones are being generated
skin and we can go out and sunlight and
not worry about it because UV light that
damages DNA is repaired any of that DNA
damage attendant really repaired usually
and you know so that's an important
system and you can you can see also
additional patterns that tell us more
about how these systems are organized
based on the weather the the
interactions are positive or negative as
I mentioned the the positive or green
interactions are more within systems
non-essential systems whereas that a
negative or strong interactions are
between important systems that are
buffering each other or redundant and so
you see this the the green guys all of
these basically each square here
represents a measurement for one gene
and another gene in and the measurement
is the the interaction strength of the
pair of genes and so all of these guys
all of these genes here interact with
each other positively so this is a
particular system called if I'll just
have a huge amount of names by the way
for all sorts of things so that's one of
the things that you have to learn in
biology is memorize all of this
dictionary of things but there's a
something called the vacuole or ATPase
complex which has ten or fifteen genes
in it and it's pretty important for
maintaining maintaining pH and
environment within parts of the cell so
that's you know all of these things you
can just see those coming out in this
clustering so we know immediately that
these guys are part of the same system
so if there was a gene here that we
didn't know anything about and it was
part of this complex this cluster that
that we know something about then we can
make a prediction that says that gene
isn't we think that genes part of that
system so this all of these interactions
are telling us something about
components of the systems and also we we
can see that these two this Trent this
other transport complex is you know has
a lot of negative interactions between
these two complexes here and that tells
us that these interact these these
complexes are probably buffering each
other in some way they're parallel and
you can draw that as a network and where
each each node is a gene
and the lines between them are positive
or negative interactions with the given
strength and this is you know this is
already telling us a lot more about East
than we than we knew so we we've really
seen that this is a system here and the
system is another system and this these
systems are somehow complementary and
you can imagine that if you do this at a
higher and higher scale you can you can
find out quite a lot of information
about how the cell is organized so
that's pretty cool for us we call these
monochromatic effects these basically
see because we see the same color in the
same part of the matrix and you can also
look at sort of different levels of
system system view so this is a system
level map that's a very high level it
lumps a whole bunch of genes that we
know of that are all part of metabolism
or transport or the mitochondria which
is the energy production center of the
cell and we can see how these these
systems are connected to each other from
a very high level so that's one other
thing that we're that we're seeing in
these systems is that there's a lot of
hierarchy so you might have a general
system like energy production but it has
a lot of little components within that
that are each systems themselves and
then those have systems within them and
within each of those levels you see
these types of you see this type of
organization buffering and parallel
process parallel parallel components and
our challenges actually you know one of
the things we want to do this cell map
is is organize that completely so that
we can get an idea for about how these
systems are organized one of the
applications that we could we could have
without such a map is to predict what's
important in we might be able to predict
other doubles or even triples we might
be able to predict that a particular
gene we might be able to read off the
map that a particular gene is important
for one system and another gene is
important for another system and if you
remove both of those those systems are
important for the global process of the
cell so removing important genes in each
system taking down each system will then
take out the whole system
and some people have proposed that might
be an interesting way of treating cancer
one of the interesting things with
cancer is that cancer cancers 400
different diseases it's not one disease
there's you know breast cancer lung
cancers are very different from each
other and but one of the they obviously
have similar outcomes but one of the
similar things that one of the other
similarities they have at a molecular
level is that they're all there's all
new tations and cancer so cancers are
somehow abnormal and if there's some
problem in a cancer cell it's lost a
function that allows it to grow say it's
lost a break in one of these systems and
because it's lost the break it's growing
it's going all the time and it's growing
out of control that differentiates it
from normal cells in that it's it's
missing a component so say we knew
something about the way that these
systems are working we could say okay
this cancer is missing a component why
don't I take out this other particular
component and this other particular
component and now I will predict that
the by removing those components that in
addition to the component that's already
missing takes down this system right and
kills the cell in a very specific way
that doesn't affect normal cells because
normal cells don't have that missing
component I don't have that mutation so
that's very theoretical but it's one
idea that people have in cancer cancer
therapy so just one one example of how
that might work another another example
that that's kind of interesting in the
future to talk about where these maps
what these maps can do for us is
designing artificial industrial yeasts
that can do new things right so we can
engineer a yeast cell to do some a carry
out some process that it could not
otherwise carry out and that might be
useful for in industry like generating a
particular type of chemical it's already
useful for generating alcohol right but
maybe it could be designed people do
this actually already they design
bacteria and used to generate new things
like generate insulin or drugs other
types of drugs a lot of protein drives
like insulin for diabetes has grown it
from bacteria and big bats
these days it's not taken from dog's
pancreas which is where it was
originally found and but the problem
with with building these systems is that
this these systems that we that were
engineering are evolving and they're
competing with each other
and if we introduce something a system
into the into this we introduce a new
process into the system it will it's not
necessarily going to be as fit in terms
of that large competing system right the
large competition evolved all its
neighbors and maybe it will actually
because it's using up more resources to
do something that we want we won't be
able to grow well if another bacteria
comes in it won't be able to grow as
well and the new bacteria will just
compete out and eventually take over the
whole the whole system so understanding
something about how the system can
compensate for how different components
of the system can compensate for each
other might allow us to build
redundancies into these things so and
also consider how how would that
what-what affect our changes would have
on growth and other things that you
could maybe you could figure that out
through simulations and things people
people actually do this
that allow you to design a more robust
system that would be more robust in
terms of the global scheme of things
here's another view of a systems level
map going into a little more detail so
instead of having 10 major categories of
gene function we have a few hundred and
if we look at just sort of very specific
ones we can can't really read these but
just gives you an idea of the hierarchy
we could zoom in on these things and see
progressively more resolution on the
onion systems so so that's those that's
basically the you know it for the for
the multiple perturbation part of the
talk so these screens are going on 24/7
and the Donnelly Center and in a couple
of years we should actually be able to
do complete all 18 you know million
experiments it's probably gonna be 36
million because it's it's easier to just
to just do all of them rather than
trying to pick individual ones it's
easier to just do them all so in a few
years 36 million experiments will be
will be done
would have taken quite a lot of time
without all the robots and we should
have a much better idea of how yeast
work one of the big challenges to
getting towards better more applications
that I told you about would be to try
and replicate this in other other
organisms and see how well these these
systems these maps are conserved is this
the same kind of map or the same type of
properties that we have in our own in
our own you know in human biology that's
an open question that people are
starting to work with right now by
looking at different organisms and so a
lot of work still to be done but I want
to switch gears a little bit and tell
you something about the software that
we're developing to help us develop cell
Maps explore them and analyze them and
we have to consider you know just like
in Google you have to consider all of
the different we're talking with Ilya
earlier and talking about you know logs
dealing with logs and analyzing log
files and and also you know all of the
the web pages obviously that that that
Google is collecting we have to develop
systems to deal with all of this data as
well it's not as much data as Google but
it's it's a still job we don't have as
many people either working for us so you
know there's information that we'd like
to collect from lots of different
sources integrate it together and then
analyze it and we kind of think about
this in terms of we call it I call this
the systems biology pyramid and this is
coined by Chris sander who was someone I
worked with when I was in New York at
doing research there and basically when
we're trying to study biological systems
computationally we want to develop
computational models that will allow us
to predict something about the system
and and then basically those predictions
can be validated or falsified by
experiments that could hopefully allow
us to improve the model refine the model
and eventually the computational model
will be telling us something about how
the biological system is actually
working right so that's that's already
what I what I talked about but the
information cyst
that that and and in building those
models we have to collect all of the
data that we can to to build them
otherwise we're missing information that
we've already discovered and there's
lots of different sources for this
information so the information system
that we need to build you guys are very
familiar with this type of thing but you
need something to store you know
organize search visualize and analyze
the information so we're building this
system called pathway Commons and this
is done with people in New York and
Chris Sanders group and a number of
other people worldwide it turns out that
that a lot of different people have been
developing databases to do this and so
ideally that would actually help us
because we could just go to a database
and download the data but because it was
such a popular activity there's actually
250 of them and that makes it hard not
mostly because there's each database has
been developed in independently and each
one uses a different language different
scope different formats and so you can't
really just collect seamlessly all the
information from all the databases I
guess this is somehow similar to this
deep web thing right so you know we have
that we have that same kind of problem
so one of the things that we've
developed being developing as a standard
language that people can use to describe
the information these biological
processes and they represent all the
different types of biological processes
that we know are important and it's a
community effort open access community
effort that we've been organizing for
all these databases to come together and
then develop this language the standard
language that everyone can understand
understand and distribute then they'd be
able to distribute their information in
a standard format and then you can start
collecting it and using it the actual
format is called bio packs and it's
written in owl which is the web ontology
language it's XML it's a w3c standard
this is an example of what it looks like
I don't know how many people are
familiar with Semantic Web technologies
that are being used
we've also we're trying to use that type
of technology the database software that
we built we built some database software
as well that
allows us to collect once it's in a
standard format it collects it into a
database typical MySQL database that
allowed that makes it available via the
web and via a web service so that you
can query it third party software can
query it and we have a specific type of
software that allows us to connect these
look at these systems visualize these
systems and analyze them and that's
called cytoscape which I'll mention and
all of these technologies are coming
together in a that this pathway commons
project that i mentioned and it's an
open access public library of this
information so we the analogy where we
were using the analogy of the public
library so that these processes these
individual systems that biologists are
studying are like books each person
studies one process in a cell and they
study it for all their lives and they
write lots of papers about it it's like
writing a book the lingua franca or the
common language as this bio packs format
or other standard formats we have the
database to index it it's like the index
cards and the translators to translate
everything to the common format and then
once it's there then it's much more
accessible just like public libraries
made literature accessible a long time
ago we also have once it once we can
collect all this information in a
central place then doesn't necessarily
have to be central but at least it's
conceptually central it's conceptually
you use the same standard language we
can visualize and analyze it and I work
on a software open source software
project called cytoscape which is
originally developed in the Institute of
systems biology in Seattle and now
involves nine academic and industry
groups this summer we actually had
funding from Google Summer of Code so we
had a nine google Summer of Code
students working on on the software and
related software and that was pretty fun
and basically it allows you to load up
networks load up these networks load up
a lot of different types of information
on the networks lay them out
automatically visualize them and do a
lot of types of analysis that people are
interested in
automatic literature mining so there's
tons of publications for this is just
one example there's lots of publications
out there that biologists over the past
hundred years have published and a
number of those are made available
electronically at least in an abstract
form on the pubmed library from the
National Library of Medicine in the US
and those abstracts can be we can
extract information about gene
interactions and view them in this in
this in this sort in this software so
that's that's one of the things that it
can do so that's a way for people to
kind of extract information from reverse
or more easily than just reading it
obviously it has some false positive
rate for instance but it's a useful
starting point for many people so and
the challenges for just maybe people are
some of you guys are interested in this
the challenges that we face in dealing
with this large amounts of information
that are generated by scientists all
over the world in all sorts of different
non-standard formats is you know we
would be it would be as basically how to
collect all that information so the web
is kind of nice because at least there's
HTTP you can you can Det you know you
can download content but then there's no
real structure within those web pages we
don't even have HD we you know are HTTP
is the English language so you know
maybe it's available electronically
maybe it's available you know it's not
even available electronically the
electronic stuff is not standardized in
any way often a lot of computational
biology and bioinformatics people work
in this area just to standardize and
develop languages common languages for
biologists to use so that it would be
easier to work with the information and
to combine the information and so one of
the challenges to develop systems that
integrate with how biologists work so
they can type in their data into the
global knowledge base and that's very
difficult because biologists are very
busy people like all scientists and many
other people and they're not interested
in doing work for other people
necessarily but if you make it really
easy and you give them some advantage
then that number
might work so building such a system
like that would be very very interesting
and challenging we have to do
integration from different types of data
so if someone says this is gene a in one
database and someone says this is gene
ABC in another database maybe those two
genes are actually the same gene but
they have different names because people
just name them differently there's no
standard naming system even for some
some organisms so we have to recognize
those things and pull them together and
look for structural similarity in data
structures we have a lot of problems
with visualization Google Earth is
really nice because you have a we
already know how the you know the earth
is a sphere but pretty much and you can
map everything onto that sphere and we
don't really know yet how to we don't
have a you know that kind of thing to
guide us in terms of laying out these
diet these networks there's a huge
amount of information and we have to
somehow make it very aesthetically
pleasing this is already done in
textbook so biologists are very used to
this if you ever took biology you'll
know you're looking through a biology
textbook there's lots of nice pictures
of biological systems but those were
done by artists and it's hard for a
computer to do the same thing so some
automated way of doing that would allow
you know really engage scientists and do
wonders for communication a lot of other
things that were where are important in
terms of algorithm algorithms and other
representations in this way so so those
are the kinds of things that we work on
in the infrastructure side when we're
developing software and we really want
to be with visualization with this cell
map is you know we want The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the cell right so I teach some
undergraduates from graduate and
undergraduate courses the University of
Toronto and I recently used this analogy
of The Hitchhiker's Guide and none of
the undergraduates knew what I was
talking about so hopefully you guys
remember the hitch I know The
Hitchhiker's Guide I think for the next
course I'm going to have to say that
they hit the iPod or a guide to the cell
or the iPhone guide to the cell or
something but maybe they know Google
Earth maybe that would be a good good
analogy so anyway it shows my age but
what we really want to be
with visualization is this this movie
the the inner life of the cell which was
which was let me just stop this here and
give it an introduction there was a
movie produced by professional artists
who were recruited who were hired by
some some undergraduate we instruct
biology instructors at Harvard and they
kind of made this view of how the cell
works internally and I know some some of
you might have might have seen this how
many people have seen this video in our
life of the cell okay so so it's being
distributed widely but but there's even
on Slashdot I think but I'll just show
this to you and kind of give you an idea
of the complexity of the system that
we're working with it's very simplified
view of what's going on in biology but
it's they try they've tried to be as
realistic as possible
and so each little molecule was actually
taken from real molecular structures and
the shapes and sizes and relative
proportions of everything was taken from
real factual things that people have
found out by looking at cells for many
years and this basically goes through
the little story of a white blood cell
in your body which is involved in
healing and protecting you from bacteria
and viruses moving into a site of
infection and doing something becoming
activated and then then moving out so
I'll just show you this this video here
so you have the the white blood cell
moving through the artery and then it
kind of knows where to go by connecting
with little molecules in on to the blood
vessel wall and recording on its surface
a lot of different types of molecules
that work with cell-cell interaction so
cells communicate with each other
through these molecules and then this
movie kind of zooms into inside the cell
so now we're inside the cell the cell
has a membrane like a bag around it that
pretty much is a lipid membrane and you
kind of see this view of the
cytoskeleton which is the thing that
gives the cell its structure and there's
lots of different molecules that form
like this to give the cell structure and
this is how the
Elle moves it creates structure on one
side and destroy structure on another so
it's like kind of like a tank moving
moving things from one side to the other
these are actual proteins that
microtubules and actin filaments and
things like this that that and this is
how people think they actually form and
and work in this in the cell so this is
a motor protein that actually people
think really walks like this along these
microtubules carrying cargo and these
are other other systems in the cell that
are involved in growth or energy
production this is the process of
protein synthesis so the DNA is
translated to RNA which is then read by
this ribosomes kind of like the compiler
to generate the protein which is the
active running program and then these
proteins interact with each other and so
you know go in and do something and this
video shows a lot of space in the cell
really the space is really full filled
with these things it's not there's no
free-floating
space in the cell this is sort of how
people think these lipid membranes or
these fatty membranes work and people
are familiar with biology this was the
goal Ghia al Pradas and so it's very
fluid and then there's this cargo is
released and these might be molecules
that are important for activity at the
site of infection for instance in this
particular case and once they're
released some of them go into the
bloodstream and others are kept on the
surfaces of the cell and activated at a
specific time in order to say stop this
the cell rolls along and then eventually
stops and then it knows it is kind of
being targeted towards a site of
infection so
this is sort of the the end of the the
video where the cell actually goes
through moves through the blood vessel
to its site of infection you can see the
other blood cells there so so this was a
pretty cool video that's and I like so
with that I just so that's you know
that's where we'd love to be in the
future I don't know how long it's going
to take us to that was done by artists
but it would be great if the computer
could really work like that and we could
have some kind of video game for four
cells that allowed us to organize all
the information and and be able to
simulate what happens when we when we
when we do things to it so the the
genetic interactions were all done in a
lab of Charlie Boone and Brenda Andrews
at University of Toronto and there's a
lot of other collaborators that are part
of this project in multiple labs my lab
works on a number of other things and
there's lots of people around that that
do software development in different
places in around mostly North America
and Europe and some in Japan and we get
funding from federal funding agencies
like Canadian Institutes of Health
Research and the genome Canada and those
types of things that's government money
your tax dollars actually go towards
this my tax dollars too and we have to
you know that's how we fund our research
basically applying for for grants
so with that thanks again for listening
and hopefully that was interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
