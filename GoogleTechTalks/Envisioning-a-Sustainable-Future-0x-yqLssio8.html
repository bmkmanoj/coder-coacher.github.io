friend of mine who also i think is a
thought leader in the field of the
intersection between mental health and
environmental sustainability so i have
with me today someone who is a
psychiatrist she's a board-certified
psychiatrist an analytic candidate did
her residency at ucsf and there's also
the executive director of profound
sustainability which is which is really
the reason that she's here to speak to
you today so please welcome Madeline
Lansky thank you thanks um I want to
thank Brian for having me and for google
for having me and I want to start off
with a little anecdote from Wednesday so
I went to my local produce shop and I
went to buy cherries because I love them
and they were especially beautiful and
there was this big mound of shiny
cherries and I turned to the grocer and
said I think these are amazing cherries
and I think that this could be the best
week of june for cherries and he said I
don't know anymore I don't know when the
best time is for cherries because the
weather is really weird and I said to
him I kind of I because I knew I
becoming her I sort of experimented with
this I said yeah the weather's been
changing a lot and I think a lot of the
growing seasons are really confusing and
he did this thing that I'm beginning to
recognize as a kind of a kind of subtle
emotional moment there's almost this
this sign I see that I recognized from
working with kids and and talking about
the environment which is he paused he
looked down at the cherries and he was
very quiet for about 30 seconds and i
think at another time i would have
thought that he was just kind of looking
at cherries but i realized that he was
very quietly really pretty overwhelmed
by what I'd said
and so I said to him it's really
overwhelming i know i can only really
think about it for three minutes at a
time myself and he said I I can't really
think about it at all and I I said I
know what you mean and so he said so I
don't and and I said I understand it's
really hard to think about and I left
with about four pounds of cherries
because well i was doing what we
probably all do i was distracting in
some way and cherries for me or a great
distraction so I really want to use this
talk to hone in on this moment it's sort
of a particular emotional moment and I
think it's something that people feel
and I suspect that the people who've
come probably resonated with that piece
of my flyer which is that we all know
that we're in a state of a really
tremendous environmental crisis you know
we're seeing every day were several
weeks into the Gulf spill we've seen
what happened with Haiti with the
earthquakes there's just this
ever-increasing number of environment
environmental disasters and we're
learning a lot of evidence about climate
change and greenhouse gases and I think
that people really want to deal with
this but I actually don't think that we
have a way that we're dealing with it
personally and as a as a human race and
my my goal today is to offer the
solution to the emotional despair of
worrying about the environment that is a
solution to the environmental crisis I'm
hoping that the intersection can give
something to both and what I'm really
hoping to offer you in this talk is to
be looking at systems as a whole in more
of a circular fashion or sustainable
fashion and to sort of get off of the
model that I see going on which is much
more linear where there's one issue and
one problem people respond to it try to
fix it get to the end of what they can
do with it and it kind of tapers off
doesn't really get salt maybe people
schedule another meeting for a month out
and and we're sort of all left with that
same horrible feeling that something
hasn't chain
so I I'm a child at a lesson in adult
psychiatrist I see kids families adults
I do very intensive psychoanalytically
oriented therapies with people with or
without medications and I really love
the training that I got in the medical
world and at the same time I think it
has limitations just in the way when i
taught environmental education i thought
that there were limitations that the
environmental peace kind of stopped
short of the psychological realm and how
people feel about the world and
connecting with soil and knowing where
food comes from and that in the medical
world it seemed like there was a really
surprising least small amount of
attention paid to our connection with
the earth are need to know where things
come from of course there was attention
paid to good nutrition but that these
are really essential parts of mental
health that go beyond diagnosis or
particular medications that people might
use even though i use those things in my
practice and don't actually have any
particular problem with them more
interested in looking at the
infrastructure and how we can change the
infrastructure to give somebody the best
shot at feeling good rather than kind of
putting a band-aid over a problem so i
want to kind of go back to my
environmental educator roots which i did
before i went to medical school and tell
you about my favorite metaphor for
sustainability which is the redwood
forest and so to use a redwood tree as
the model you have a seed with a lot of
genetic material in a hard-coded shell
on the ground and at the right time it
germinates opens up and you have the
beginnings of what will be a sapling the
sapling grows into a tree it matures it
can reproduce either through seeds or
even through its roots and it gets to a
point where maybe in two thousand years
because these trees have amazingly long
lives and can grow to huge diameters
that hopefully will die a peaceful tree
death and fall to the ground
begin to decompose and perhaps you've
seen this if you've been walking
somewhere where there is lumber on the
ground or things falling apart that that
the most important part arguably of a
forest floor is actually the little
micro organisms and bugs that break down
the fallen tree and put it back into the
soil that what you know when I would
teach these fifth and sixth graders
they're kind of be this you gross moment
about all these bugs but this composting
is really getting the the really
important building blocks out of the
dead thing putting them in the soil so
that they can reinsert into the next
seed and it's a simplistic model and and
we all kind of know it and maybe it was
in Lion King but you know the circle of
life thing but um it's it's it's
actually something I am amazed at how
little I see when I want to hear about
people doing advanced problem-solving so
that is I think the most pure form of a
sustainable set up I would call that
profound sustainability profoundly the
way we've been doing it and I and I'm
going to take a break for almost like a
little history lesson of how we started
to develop in the Western world
especially United States a kind of
linear model for how we do things and
how we've really hit the wall both
emotionally even psychiatrically and
environmentally so to go back to how the
United States is composed as a melting
pot I'm just going to try to give you a
sense of how I see the the population
here we're a lot of immigrants were
people who fled for religious
persecution people who were brought here
against their will or displaced to areas
they didn't want to live people who
wanted to explore or find new things and
that makes us kind of an unusual country
it makes us exciting unique it also
means that a lot of people came here
already with a fair amount of exposure
to trauma and already with maybe some
vulnerabilities to
psychological distress a lot of people
who fled other countries came because
they couldn't stay where they were
because it was too violent or scary and
I've worked in a lot of state hospitals
and public schools a lot of the people
in those settings will very vividly tell
you that kind of stuff that they saw
before they came here or even when they
got to the US so you have this
population and about 150 years or so ago
the industrial revolution starts kicking
into gear which is basically what we
know today as the machinery the
building's all of the innovations we
have they're really quite wonderful that
made modern medicine proximal germ
theory the fact that doctors started
washing between patients antibiotics
medicines computers Google lots of
amazing things at the same time there's
a huge buildup in waste you know there's
sort of like a ton of plastic that
nobody knows how to break down a common
post and all these other endpoints of
these linear solutions to the things we
want that that don't really have a
solution for what they're going to do
they're kind of like redwood trees on a
forest floor that just sit there and
never go anywhere and then you see as we
enter the Industrial Revolution this
slightly haunting reality that our
capacity to launch really huge Wars and
really maim and kill people really
increases to a to a kind of astounding
amount hi so not to not to diminish what
happened in other Wars but um in World
War winning World War two all the
countries are involved and the capacity
to just just kill hundreds of thousands
millions of people also we have good
enough medicine at that point then
instead of people dying we actually kind
of patch them up well enough so you have
a lot of people who survived traumatic
brain injuries terrible shell-shocked
people who have lost limbs and you have
huge parts of the population that are
now
being exposed to veterans with trauma
who are maybe have been bombed or had
their own losses and I think I'm trying
to maybe show you how much sort of you
know there's twenty percent of the
population at any given time has a
psychiatric diagnosis and I think that
might be true and I think it's kind of
for good reason that we have these
setups to not do so great so you move
into just having this population that's
having increasing difficulties with the
challenges of being alive and after
World War two this amazing
infrastructure develops the post-war
growth the development of suburbs
quality of life goes up exponentially
for the average American but these are
systems that are supported supported by
all the oil growth and petroleum and the
United States is really compelled to put
most of its effort politically I think
into maintaining the oil to maintain the
structures so you see a drop in funding
for Social Services mental health
education the kind of fabric that would
keep more vulnerable individuals from
falling through the cracks you see an
emphasis put on moving into suburbs and
to building out which is sort of the
American dream but I think ends up with
a lot of people feeling very
disconnected lonely and sad and not
really dealing with any connection with
others or with food growth or the lands
people start to really not know where
things come from they start to drive and
not really move around as much somehow
it makes sense that people would go to a
gym and run in place on a machine rather
than to be outside moving around or to
eat things in packages rather than food
that they grow these are things that
actually make more sense to us now but
they do you think about it don't make
tons of sense and then in the urban
centers there's a collapse these become
places where there's a lot more poverty
in the 1980s you see
crack cocaine move in which I actually
remember moving in and just the
explosion of human tragedy that happened
when crack cocaine came in so it's a
drug that works fast it creates a quick
hi creates a lot of violence it's cheap
a lot of babies were born crack exposed
they tend to have a lot more psychiatric
symptoms need a lot more services a lot
of parents of those kids are in jail
rather than taking care of their kids
the jail populations go up there's
actually a reduction in psychiatric and
mental health services and in education
supports and an increase in prison
populations because in a way they're
much less expensive to maintain and I
think people are scared to be outside
it's harder to collect them in public
spaces there's a lot more television
media watching really disturbing stuff
getting overstimulated and that leads us
to today I'm looking at all your faces
and you all look very but it's I realize
it's depressing and to try to shift
gears on you so I don't yeah that was a
good sad face um so I think that nobody
meant for this to happen I don't think
that this was some grand design of some
evil genius to slowly separate each
other from ourselves internally in our
relationships or from the land I think
that people got excited found some new
stuff and wanted to keep going with it
and now we've got a lot of garbage to
clean up it was a linear system it hit
its and it's hit a wall we now have a
whole bunch of people who really need
much more than they're getting and we
have literally a lot of garbage that's
built up and I like to go back to the
Redwood model because what we don't
really have at this point and what I
want to see and want to encourage you to
look for is some kind of equivalent of
calm posters and decomposers that we
have a lot of waste but we don't even
have to see it as waste we have a
surplus of all this monkey gunk
that if we can really look at in a new
way we might be able to find some
interesting opportunities and solutions
that there's building blocks in the muck
and that they're the building blocks
that could go in to support the seeds of
some kind of new opportunity you know
when people come into my clinical
practice they've usually hit the end of
their rope something really really
upsetting maybe has happened but it's it
comes on top of a lot of years of of
things not going well of a lot of
sadness and isolation and symptoms and
so to get to me usually they've hit a
wall and they just don't feel like they
can do anything else and this is a
linear problem so coming into a practice
like mine means looking how to make it
sustainable and going through the
details of how somebody has gotten where
they are is really about trying to
compost and look through the muck of
what they're dealing with it's actually
find what's good and rework it to make
their lives more sustainable takes a lot
of work takes a lot of patience it
doesn't happen overnight certain
percentage of people or everybody that
sometimes says I want this to happen
much faster it's usually pretty
frustrating to hear that it it won't
happen any faster than it happens but
it's often a very rewarding process and
people tend to feel a lot more freedom
and choice and opportunity and they tend
to see positive effects and their
families and in their relationships so I
want to be really really you know it's
so exciting the position you're in at
Google because you have such power to be
not just creating things but looking at
how infrastructures are made and I think
you have such interesting opportunities
to be bringing this sustainable
perspective into the work you're doing
here even into how you are with
yourselves that that this would really
start with ourselves and finding ways to
make our own lives sustainable even for
looking for ways in our lives that
they're actually uncomfortable or
there's some
really unpleasant I think the way we
live in our in our world right now is to
really try to push that away pretty
pretty actively and hope it doesn't
bubble up and then oftentimes it does
and it gets it kind of turns into a mess
but that there's an opportunity to
really tune in and use that as a way to
make one's self sustainable to look at
one's relationships with others and find
a way to make them sustainable or in our
families or in communities you know that
community is where you work where you
live a company a government and economy
a school and even expanding it out into
the world that there's a kind of
paradigm shift that we're really needing
right now to make things into circles
out of linear systems and to be finding
what waste needs to be broken down into
helpful building blocks now this is
where the haiti piece comes in and i
think it's an exciting one I've been
since the earthquake in Haiti in January
involved with the sustainable Haiti
coalition and trying to look at
integrative and even hybrid models for
how to talk about sustainable regrowth
and how to look at how to have an
intersection between the human needs and
Haiti and the environmental needs I
don't know if you guys sort of know a
lot about Haitian history but one of the
big issues that's ongoing is actually
literally the soil if you look over the
island of Hispaniola one side the
Dominican Republic has forest and the
other side Haiti has dry land and so
literally and figuratively Haiti needs
to be reworking think so that the soil
is fertile again so that it can grow so
that there can actually be food
independence and an ability to feed
people I mean there's some I don't mean
to imply there's none but there's a real
opportunity there to be really thriving
in an agricultural way and if you look
at the Haitian population which went
into the earthquake with a lot of trauma
a lot of poverty a lot of
I think feeling of humiliation about
being you know one of the poorest
countries in the Western Hemisphere that
put on top of that that people have seen
their loved ones either be killed or
maimed or they've been maimed been
hungry all these things that that they
really need mental health treatment you
know I was approached a number of times
at a lot of the conference's I was out
are you going to go to Haiti are you
going to go to Haiti and the answer is
complex I would love to go to Haiti and
I would love to go down and provide
psychiatric help but there's also this
kind of knowing that I have that the
infrastructures have to be put together
in a way that if someone like me offers
a medical or psychiatric service that
the person who goes back into their
lives is going to be able to sustain the
benefit that they got from that kind of
intervention so there's this huge
downfall of of amazing economic support
from people who want to help haiti
there's there's this immense amount of
potential and I think there's this
crossroads are we going to look at each
problem in Haiti as a separate linear
issue or are we going to look at the
interconnected sorry interconnectedness
of all the parts look for how they
intersect and find the big picture and
then do the planning and the funding for
how to solve those problems that's
that's the kind of mind shift that I
think that that I'm talking about I want
to end with a quote from one of my
favorite writers who I think really kind
of inspired this journey for me of the
connection between thinking about people
and thinking about the environment Ralph
Waldo Emerson and it's a quote where he
said every wall is a door so I think
we're at a wall I think we're at walls I
think that there are doors to open and I
think that opening a door at a time of
crisis is one of the best things that
you can do for mental health
when you put aside all the kind of
modern interventions we have for those
kinds of problems people need to have a
sense of hope and a kind of way to
develop their own sense of resilience
that they'll be able to get through
problems and solve them and for a lot of
the despair that we're seeing you know
the despair that that brought people to
this talk or the despair that people
might feel in Haiti looking into really
really profoundly sustainable solutions
I think will be very helpful to people
emotionally I think will really help
people settle down and really help shift
with a lot of the symptomatology that
that I think is out there may be more
than we're perceiving and more than is
readily obvious without taking a moment
maybe with the grocer and watching his
face when he gets quietly overwhelmed so
with that thank you for listening and
why don't we shift to a conversation
questions and answers oh yeah I don't
know if there's another mic but I'm
happy to Rene door come up or I'm happy
to repeat thanks
I have two sons 16 and 20 and I asked
them occasionally how confident are they
that their future is going to be
positive and they're they're doing well
they're they're fine in school and
everything but I really have questions
about what they see is the environmental
issues the political issues the all the
crises that seem to be coming together
for them at a very young age when I was
their age I didn't have to face all
these things how do you how do we help
get resilience in those folks who quite
honestly are privileged middle-class
white kids as opposed to or who have
much more advantageous than a lot of
people in this world how do we build
hope for the future yeah thank you thank
you so much for that that's something
I've been really interested in and I've
I've started talking about actually with
kids and I'm and sort of in the early
stages of doing it some kind of
documentary around interviewing kids
about that because they when I talk to
kids about this they tell me that they
feel like they are constantly being told
that the world is falling apart almost
every day and that they're being told
that they're going to have to be the
ones who come up with the solutions and
they get so they feel very pressured
that they're going to have to come up
with it all I think that some of the
more vulnerable kids get very involved
with like the 2012 stuff do you guys
know about this there's this there's
this concern that the world is going to
end in 2012 so maybe the more kind of
nervous kids might talk about it a lot
and have like a lot of bake sales to
raise money for things and it's very
cute and then you know other kids I sort
of see slip more into kind of fantasy
video game realm where they just get
really really frightened and when you
look I mean if you look at how people
sort of behave and how they look they'll
just you know the ones who aren't doing
so great look kind of more fragmented
and night kind of neither here nor there
and they might have a lot of explosive
episodes or not doing well in school but
they're basically so overwhelmed with
anxiety they kind of don't know what to
do what I've been really struck by when
interviewing the kind of kid you're
talking about sort of you know in the
luckiest one percent of anybody walking
around on the face of the earth and and
they're totally freaked out I find that
they don't think very sustainably even
the ones who I interview who go to
really progressive schools I still hear
that people are trying to solve linear
problems with linear solutions and that
there's a kind of looking at looking at
the big system about what a big system
would need to function and then moving
from there to how to make application is
something I think kids aren't getting
either and one of the best things that
we can do for them rather than telling
them you know the world's falling apart
and guess what it's yours to fix or
you're going to die is because I really
feel that way a lot of them is to
actually be giving them a lot of science
a lot of training I would love to be
seeing huge science fairs where kids
compete for intervention in innovations
and inventions and and do problem
solving around huge systems issues that
are difficult you know there's a lot of
programs where kids are actually doing
really neat things like that and getting
our curricula focused around that would
I think be really amazing also teaching
about interconnectedness and how working
out with one part of the system affects
the other because you know otherwise the
task is too daunting and you really kind
of can't get your mind around it and in
my in my experience when somebody can't
get their mind around something that's
really scary and actually involves
annihilation that that that's actually
where a lot of symptoms develop because
they
you sort of can't keep it together so
there's a kind of grounding in education
and an approach to education using this
kind of making lines into circles that I
think would be helpful and then what to
say to kids like that you know i i'm
always sort of i kind of vote for
normalizing anxieties like I would you
know yes of course you feel that way it
is really scary how can we help you with
it and to be you know taking dinner time
to talk with kids well what would you
like to see happen one of the things
I've also noticed is everybody sort of
talks about this like somebody else is
going to fix it and the kids do too but
really we're going to fix it we're the
ones who are going to fix it and once we
make that decision it's actually can be
very fun after that but being
immobilized with fear is is a very
terrible place to be next next question
thank you
the question was what about kids who
aren't fearful about it or don't really
care about it because they're not aware
or adults do you know I'd like to think
that one of the reasons that I could not
for the life of me get in to see avatar
in 3d and imax i had to choose was that
everybody was seeing that movie and I
think a lot of the appeal that movie was
that it was actually getting at a lot of
this stuff so I think it would actually
be really hard to tell who really truly
does not know about this who is truly an
utterly ignorant of it and who is kind
of doing their best to deal with how
scared they are and don't have that much
information about it I you know I really
loved teaching environmental education
because you'd get kids a lot of them
from urban places never been on a hike
pretty scared of the woods don't really
do great in classrooms with four walls
and fluorescent lights they're bouncing
around in the woods jumping screaming if
they're being rowdy you hike really hard
for a mile and then learn science and
those kids did great you know they learn
a lot more in those kinds of settings
and a lot of people just don't even know
that it's like that so getting people
outside having people eat fresh food I
think probably we might underestimate
how many people only eat processed foods
don't need fresh food can't get to any
fresh food it's actually literally to
sort of too far away where they live to
get to fresh produce so there's some
very kind of simple ways to get people
connected I would vote for what's great
first what's delicious what's beautiful
to make a kind of relationship and then
to talk about how to sustain the
relationship I think that maybe that's a
more hopeful that would probably be a
more hopeful twist thank you yeah
so the question was this gentleman was
some humor admitted he's concrete in his
thinking and that he can see examples of
circular did you say circular or
sustainable moving from huh okay moving
from linear to circular beyond the
individual level onto a global level is
that did I get that I don't think the
examples are great I think it's a matter
of degrees that's why I brought up the
Redwood example because it's it's it's
it's so close circuit and it works so
beautifully I'm actually going to bring
up my friends restaurant gather have you
guys heard about gather in berkeley so
there's this really neat place that's
opened up its it's kind of like us you
guys know what slow food is this
principle of kind of getting back into
having really thoughtfully produced food
that's local you know organic animals
are treated humanely so there's this
restaurant that's been built serving
these kinds of foods there's meat they
actually slaughter the animals in the
back and use all the parts from the
animals and there's this commitment to
that all of the fixtures are recycled
and all of the produce and you know
meets come from really local farms with
whom they have a relationship it's
connected to the david brower center and
so I actually think that their energy
supply is probably primarily solar that
all of their alcohol is organic and
it is a system that I think really does
it's very very best any and its really
good food it's not sort of like this
bummer you know tasteless tofu horror
meal it's it's really good but it's it's
really intended to put this into action
now because I also well I'll just say I
can get pretty geeky about this stuff so
I could start to even go into the gather
model and look for all the ways that
it's not sustainable enough you know
down to what about the water supply how
do you do with wastewater what do you do
with actual food how do you actually
compost the food what do you do with
plastics you know then you get into how
does that system which is doing quite
well interface with a bigger system and
then we actually get into how are we
dealing with garbage how are we dealing
with our water supply how are we
actually dealing with breaking down
plastic I think the day we figure out
how to fully break down plastic into
building blocks will be an amazing and
exciting day that would be the way to
think about it and to I think really be
looking at everything we have have you
heard of this line of thinking called
cradle to cradle have you heard that's a
book in it so cradle to cradle is this
idea that whatever you would start with
you know let's just use plastic for an
example that you would look at the life
of that plastic from the moment it was
made all the way to the moment it was
broken down and made into something new
and that there would be attention paid
to every point in that cycle so that's a
wonderful model of something that's
starting to happen and they I think are
very involved with working with
companies and chemicals and trying to
get this going and you'll even see I
don't know have you seen those
playgrounds that are made of like chewed
up running shoes that are bouncy and
stuff so that's great I would say that
that's not quite cradle to cradle
because we still have to figure out how
to get building blocks you know it's
it's this next level
that's an answer to your question so
your question to follow up is is this
going to be mostly small circular
systems not looking at a big system I
would say that the task I think it
should be a big system it's just such a
huge task that's why the haiti idea is
kind of interesting because there's some
you know we have so much infrastructure
in place and it basically works great it
just has a ton of waste and isn't
sustainable so shifting into a
sustainable model takes tons of money in
innovation and change in how we see and
think I think that's the overarching
goal but I think that we're you know
right now it's going to be more and more
little systems putting that into place
and then I think it's going to be the
policymakers and the people who make
stuff who are going to become
interconnected and connect the dots and
to be looking for how to make it bigger
you know in the same way that the
internet the internet didn't exist
before it existed I didn't the internet
didn't exist when I was little and then
all the sudden the internet is an
intrinsic part of every single thing
everywhere at least you know in Northern
California and in many parts of the
world that's not in every part of the
world but it's we take it so for granted
and that's that's kind of a revolution
that's kind of like a internet
revolution I think this is a
sustainability revolution just it sort
of sinks into every level i'm giving you
the most idealistic philosophical way of
thinking about it yeah
do you want to come up or speak up
yeah ah so true and it's usually the
last well let me repeat your question
you said that you're talking about not
just with environmental projects but in
in group projects that you work on that
you're trying to advocate for a kind of
sustainable approach to what's being
worked on and that it's hard to convince
people to put the upfront energy or
investment to get all the way to the end
of the circle and that a lot of times
they abandon at the last would you say
three quarter and it's and in my
experience it's the last quarter that
makes a difference ah so how do you how
do you how do you solve that yeah that's
like a trillion dollar question but
that's a door let's that's a that's a
wall let's find a door I think it's
really hard to convince people to invest
up front you know a lot of times people
will come into my practice and they'll
say this is so expensive and it you know
I totally sympathize with that feeling
but so is having a really messy divorce
or losing your house or you know never
quite meeting your potential because
it's so hard to pull it together at your
work and so I think it's a little hard
to prove theoretical of how much it
would cost not to do it but at the at
the end of the day I think that this is
where the task is to help with the
teaching around that and I think it's
also about making it fun and sexy I
think that's a very silly answer but
it's
there something you know it's sort of
like you it's like with a kid you got to
clean up your room if we're going to
have fun and you know the last it's like
the last quarter of the toys and junk
all over the room might be where you
have to stand outside the door and shear
shear them to get that last piece done
but that's where there's a fair amount
of art and the other thing I think you
can do is look for evidence of
organizations and teams who've put in
that investment and how well they've
done you know toyota is a great example
of that and and the the difficulties
that toyota has hid because they stopped
doing what was sustainable just you know
the toyota system of the five wise where
you just keep looking at how to make the
problem you just keep breaking it down
by five levels to make sure you've
covered all the potential problems and
when all those car accidents happen
basically from what I understood the
president of the Toyota apologized for
not doing what had worked so that's I
think that's a really good example I
think there's a way to get people
excited about finishing the task that's
that's one of the things that I like
about psychoanalysis is it kind of gets
you excited about dealing with something
that would otherwise be kind of
unpleasant or boring it's actually get
excited about figuring out the last
quarter and and that's kind of an
infectious akin to infectious excitement
Yeah right um no I mean it's if that's
okay so let me repeat I you say stuff
I'm excited and I have to get it off the
mic so you're saying that usually when
this conversation has happened it's
already too late that the damage has
already occurred and you don't want that
to happen with the environment and with
the plant well you said the planet yeah
um that's my worry too I think you know
I think a lot about I i think in
metaphor a lot so i think about you know
let's say sorry i'm sorry i always bring
up these bummer examples but then i'll
try to make it light afterwards but
let's say you have a teen who's suicidal
and their end like really like for real
not playing around and so they get into
treatment and you know you try to get
the family involved and say no really
you really have to figure out your
family infrastructure because this kid
isn't doing well and now in some
families they might say well he's just
trying to get attention or all the other
kinds of things that people say when
they're actually so overwhelmed and
frightened with a terrible problem that
they don't know what to do so they
dismiss it and so there's this really
tricky balance I've been in this
position of having to convince people to
get moving on it so that they don't have
to do an after conversation about a
tragedy that wasn't averted and where
you know in the ICU you know when I was
a medical student you'd sort of be in
the ICU and there'd be these terrible
medical things happening and you'd have
to go out to the family and talk to the
family about what they want and you know
fairly often someone in the family or a
lot of the family just don't want to
talk about it they leave you know people
would you know snort cocaine in the
bathroom you know people just don't want
to talk about this but that's when the
outcomes sometimes aren't good and so
what I you know in a way what I'm trying
to bring
with this talk is to get the
consciousness about how we avoid in
front of the disaster because there's a
whole psychology to avoidance and it's
the say we avoid more the more
frightened we are that we can't fix it
now how to apply that on it at a
particular team at a particular work
site I think it's definitely doable i
think at that point you have to kind of
learn the nuances of any given team and
that's what i do in my consulting
practice but that was a big answer in a
smaller answer other questions comments
emerson quotes yeah yeah yeah so your
question if i understand it was that
you're the challenge you face is less
about people who don't know about
sustainability then people who do know
about it and choose not to act on it or
choose sort of two turned a blind eye or
a blind ear or if i understood you or
say i'll be dead by the time this really
hits you didn't really say that but i
thought you kind of were and how to work
with that and i think that's what you
were sort of that seems linked to what
you were asking also the the guy before
a little well interconnected me I think
everything's linked um no I really do I
mean that's really part of I think the
reason I think it's connected is I think
this almost feels like a game of chicken
you know like that racing game where
who's who's going to win in whose car is
going to crash into the off the cliff of
you know who cares and who doesn't and I
don't think the answer is simple but
it's the same answer I feel about most
things being a psychiatrist because at
the end of the day these are really hard
problems and there's you know we're such
complex beings we have so many defenses
against hearing anything hard and I
think the more upsetting the news the
more robust the denial in my practice I
my my big challenge is you know people
will say oh your child psychiatrist is
it all the parents fault and you know I
don't think I am ever I don't think it's
ever acceptable for me to answer yes to
that question because those parents were
all kids so was it their parents fault
well why was it their parents full how
did the whole thing get going so in
these fan I'm describing these families
in the family that doesn't want to talk
about suicide or in the family that is
so humiliated that their kid needs
treatment there's the constant task of
finding a way to connect with people who
might be really disturbing you on a very
core basis I mean somebody saying I
really don't care about the environment
I just don't care i know it's going to
happen i'll be dead i actually think
that that that's a very upsetting
rattling thing to say and and i think it
i would imagine that it creates a sense
of paralysis and sort of astonishment in
you
and I would you know that when if i put
on my psychoanalytic cap i would think
that maybe there that frozen maybe there
that paralyzed and maybe they don't want
to feel that way kind of like the grocer
you know how the grocer said he looked
down he looked really shocked and then
he said oh well live for today you know
you can really only do it from a minute
at a time but what I've learned I mean I
really like my job and I think there is
a lot of hope and these people do
respond to crises a lot of times these
stories do turn out well and so it's
actually about finding the compassion to
help people who don't want to hear and
are doing this and saying horrible
terrible things and want to fight about
it and then you know whenever I seduced
myself back into that line of thinking I
try again I try to make it a game how am
I going to connect with this person I
used to make that a game as a medical
student because you get screamed at like
all day you know it's just like you know
who's screaming at me now kind of and I
after a while because you know either
you're going to just not make it or
you're gonna make it and the way I chose
to make it was to find a way to connect
with anybody anybody for any reason even
the worst person and it was a fun game
it worked I got an award for bedside
manner you know it really paid off so
when people are acting despicable I
think the challenge is to refuse to buy
into it and to insist upon seeing what's
good in them until they have no choice
but to follow your vision of them that's
my technique I know have fun with that
one yeah and you know like really have
fun you know do a lot of fun stuff and
have a lot of great cherries because it
it's really hard work and find allies
and people to kind of decompress with I
think there's a lot of people I most
people want to deal with this I really I
really talked to everybody I make it my
business to talk to every kind of person
I can and a lot of people will kind of
reflexively say some kind of obnoxious
negative dismissive comment and then if
you if you if you go in like three more
layers and talk about things that really
matter that they really care about they
actually will do the face that the
grocer had I have yet to find anybody
who hasn't yeah I mean I i work with
like severely disturbed very violent
people you know people who say that are
have no moral conscience I had actually
have yet to find one was someone who has
no moral conscience they might be out
there I they might be I actually be
interested it takes experience contact
with that but so you're talking about
politicians or people who say outrageous
things and not being able to interact
with them looking for the good I want it
I want to play with an idea in the next
four minutes that I'm being shown I have
I had this idea and you're not
mentioning the tea party but I have this
idea about the tea party okay okay that
i i i i feel that i could could see how
the kind of anxiety and upset and
finger-pointing and rage that's going on
in that particular movement would maybe
be a part of the kind of historical
perspective that I laid out that I think
that on an unconscious level we are all
feeling like we're about to slam into a
wall
at 50 miles an hour and I think people
respond to that unconscious anxiety in
different ways one of the things that
people do is to blame people that they
think have a lot of power for not
getting rid of the terrible feelings
they have inside and you know it's some
of the some of the arguments that I hear
various people in those movements make
literally just don't make sense like
they don't hang together cognitively for
me and I I'm really open to try to make
them work and I can't but if I were to
shift seeing what they say as
everything's falling apart I'm working
all the time I can barely feed my family
I'm scared all the time everything I
watch is about things falling apart
nobody's fixing it I hate you then I
think you can I you know maybe
individually it's it's hard for you to
go find somebody in that position but I
think that there there's huge ways that
we can move as groups to be connecting
you know the way that I see people
connecting with a tea party is with a
lot of anger which I think gets people
riled up but this is about connecting
and bringing in and helping with anxiety
well it's really been fun thank you for
being such an engaging audience and for
having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
