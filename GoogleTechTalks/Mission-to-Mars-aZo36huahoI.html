weeks at a simulated Mars base so I call
this talk not mission to Mars but
mission to Mars on my name is David
Levine I'm a science fiction writer I
have about 40 40 short stories published
and I've won a number of awards been
nominated for or won just about every
major science fiction award in the field
but I don't yet have a novel but you can
find my work in a lot of magazines
anthologies and online so in January of
2010 I spent two weeks not on the real
Mars but in a simulated Mars base
located in the Utah desert near goblin
goblin rock state park which is where a
lot of science fiction movies have been
filmed we were in this habitat which
I'll talk about a little bit more later
the way I came to this started on
December seventh of last year when I
posted a list to my livejournal of a
number of space related things that I
would like to do some day starting at
the top with a trip to the actual
International Space Station which can be
yours for only 35 million dollars and
going all the way down to a ride on a
Zeppelin number two on that list was a
visit to the simulated Mars base which I
knew that I knew that it existed but I
didn't know very much about it and a
friend of mine chimed in on the facebook
echo of this livejournal post saying I
know some people at the Mars Society and
I could get you involved with one of
those things if you are interested and I
was interested and he and I went back
and forth and after a while I did get a
response back from somebody tomorrow
society saying I'm not with the Mars
Society anymore but what I'd recommend
that you do is just go ahead and apply
because sometimes people have to drop
out and they need somebody to replace
them so i centered my application on the
twenty-third and on the twenty-fourth of
December Christmas Eve I received an
email back from the head of the Mars
Society saying on that I have read your
resume and would like to invite you to
be part of the crew on january nine
through 23 which is to say two weeks
later so so basically she said could you
possibly make it in two weeks and as it
happens I could so I packed up my little
egg which is exactly as bacon exactly as
heavy as the airlines will allow you to
take on with a few things that I thought
I might need during two weeks on Mars
including you'll notice the very last
item is duct tape and my goals for the
two-week mission were fairly simple as a
science fiction writer I wanted to learn
those little telling details that make a
science fictional story come alive if
you get the little things right people
are more willing to believe you on the
big impossible things in the story so I
wanted to find out what is the inside of
a space helmet smell like and how does
the dust feel under your boots I also
wanted to get a great author photo and
not to die now you may wonder why I was
so concerned about not dying because i
wasn't going to the real Mars there
wasn't any vacuum there weren't any
exploding spacecraft but there were
these guys we'll talk a little bit about
a little bit about them later so I
became part of the crew I was part of
mission 88 on that had this cool mission
patch on the other members of the crew
had already been coed had already been
communicating and coordinating together
for some time before I came on board
this is actually the revised patch they
had a patch with only five names on it
but this is the new one on so this is
crew 88 there have been 88 different
rotations of two weeks or one week each
at this at this station which has been
going since about 2006 on Steven wheeler
was the commander of the mission he is a
he's a university professor from devry
university in Texas and is also X Air
Force locks in serramonte was the
executive officer and chief engineer
he's from Sri Lanka originally lives now
in Los Angeles area he is the vnp VP of
R&amp;amp;D for a major biochemical biomedical
firm working on ways to replace damaged
heart valves without having to crack
open chests he is a brilliant person a
licensed pilot is building a gyrocopter
in his basement and one of the kindest
most generous human beings I have ever
met palma call our astronomer is a grad
student from Florida he is dedicated to
becoming an astronaut and this is just
one of many steps on his road
to achieving that goal Diego from
Colombia is an electrical engineer he is
of all of us probably the one most
likely to actually make it into space
first he is right now one of the
finalists for something called Mars 500
which is assimilated full 500 day
mission to Mars that's happening in
Moscow starting in just a few months he
is one of four European finalists for
the two European spaces on this
expression mission and they're going to
spend a full 500 days in a simulated
mission to Mars and back I'm very
excited I hope he gets in bianca is a
high school teacher from Belgium she is
also committed to space she's a space
educator works at a works at a at a
planetarium and was also selected to be
Belgium's representative to the
International Space Camp which was held
in Huntsville last year and then the
sixth member of the mission was me I'm a
science fiction writer and my job on the
crew was to be the crew journalist so we
were living in this habitat which is a
30 foot diameter cylinder two stories
tall and as you can see there is a
couple of outbuildings i'll be talking
about them in a minute the the lower
levels on your left sorry he has lower
levels on the left the upper levels on
the right you can see that there are six
little six little bunks in the upper
level and one large main room this is a
view from top of the main room that is
our kitchen our dining room our workroom
our office basically our single common
space we're just about everything
happens this is a view from the other
end of the same room you can see there
are those the stickers on the doors
every member of every crew puts a puts
their name tag on their door and it has
become the tradition that you leave your
name tag on the door when you go there's
mine and so you can see here a history
of all the people that have stayed here
this is a view to the inside of my
spacious stateroom you can see there's
just about enough room to turn around
there basically there's a little bit of
storage there's a shelf to sleep on when
I say shelf I mean I mean it's it's a
piece of plywood you're sleeping in a
sleeping bag and there's enough room to
hang up your clothes and that's about
all the private space that you have
didn't spend a lot of time in our rooms
and you may be wondering why is
bed so high off the ground that's
because of the room next door where the
bed is underneath so basically what you
have is you have bunk beds where half of
the where the upper bunk opens onto one
room in the lower bunk opens onto
another room so you've got you've got a
whole room to yourself but there's not
much room in that room we cooked on this
a three burner propane stove which was
lit with a match the the sink here you
can see the sign that says no you may
not use any of the following things that
includes any kind of soap on the only
things that were allowed to go down the
drain were baking soda and a very very
biodegradable soap that they use this is
because all of our water was filtered
through the greenhouse for for later
reuse this is the storage area located
above the bedrooms where we had all of
the food and everything that we would
need for our expedition there was no
there were no resupply missions
theoretically you had to bring with you
everything that you needed and this
influenced what we did a lot this is me
at my duty station because of my
background in high tech I used to work I
used to work for Intel and for mcafee
and protect ronix because of my
background in high tech I was in charge
of the internet and the computers and in
addition to filing my journalist reports
I was also in charge of basically all of
the electronics and and small plug in
fuzzy things this is our this is our
networking station you can see we had a
couple of different Wi-Fi antennas
satellite internet and a lot of this
stuff is not connected not working but
it's still there this becomes a theme
our internet connection was this
satellite dish um this is the same kind
of satellite that if you have friends
who live out in the boonies they're
getting their their internet from
directv or somebody like that it's kind
of slow kind of glitchy but it was a lot
better than the other forms of
communication we had which was none we
had no landline we had no cell service
satellite internet was our only contact
with earth people always ask did they
put in an artificial 20-minute delay we
did not have an artificial 20-minute
delay we had a very real 24-hour delay
and then our mission support people were
all volunteers this isn't this is
entirely nonprofit all-volunteer
organization so our mission support
people were only online once a day from
eight o'clock so if you had an emergency
we had we had some emergency protocols
to contact remote medical people but in
general we were completely on our own
and we only had we only had email and
that wasn't responded to very frequently
so here we are in the main area and you
can just barely see in this picture two
of the six webcams we were on we were on
webcam 24-7 it only transmitted a still
image every six every three to six
minutes because of bandwidth limitations
so if you did something really stupid
there was a possibility you had not been
captured but we did have somebody who
went downstairs and said okay nobody
nobody come downstairs i'm going to take
a sponge bath and then we told her you
know you're on webcam and so but apart
from that we had no a serious webcam
related incidents so now we're going to
go downstairs the two most dangerous
things on Mars are the ATVs and this
stir well we've had plenty of people
injured themselves on this stairwell
fortunately nobody on my shift got hurt
this is the bottom of that same
stairwell and looking from the top of
the stairwell down so now we're moving
from the from the upper level which is
on your left to the lower level which is
on your right looking from the top of
the stairs this is their science area
this is actually quite a well equipped
science lab there was an autoclave on a
glove box and and a number of biomedical
and and biological and geological
experiment stations is quite well
equipped our particular group didn't
have a bio or geo scientist so we
weren't making full use of this material
but it was available for a lot of the
other teams have people who are more
focused on these areas so we get
downstairs turning back to look at the
ladder the door you see to your right
leads into the EV a preparation room
which is where the spacesuits erect yes
we had to have space suits we were not
allowed while we were in simulation to
go outside onto the desert surface
without wearing a suit this is another
view of the suit area and on the left
you can just barely see the airlock door
to the outside going through into the
airlock you can see it's it's
it's all it's all simulated but it's all
designed to give you the feeling of
actually being on Mars we're not going
to go outside just yet now we're going
to turn around go back out of the EV a
room into the science lab which is also
our engineering work area and around
back to the engineering airlock to
airlocks one front one back the
engineering airlock is located in the
engineering area and to the left there
you see all of the stuff all the tools
and materials and equipment that we had
to keep the hab going it's it's a lot
like living in an isolated cabin where
you're responsible for maintaining and
repairing all your own stuff and there
is no possibility of going back to home
depot or what have you in case you got
the wrong size bolts you have to make do
with what you have therefore nothing
ever gets thrown away you bring with you
what you think you need and anything
that you can't use you put it on the
shelf or you put it in a box where you
throw it out back in what we call the
Arctic pile because it might come in
handy later on also in the engineering
area you can see this pass those
wrenches is the one bathroom that the
six of us were sharing for two weeks and
that wouldn't thing on the wall there is
the hand pump which you use to pump
water to flush the toilet the water that
we used in the sinks and in the shower
when the shower was working would be run
down through the greenhouse and filtered
through a couple of different layers of
plants which I'll show you in a minute
to produce what we call grey water grey
water was not drinkable the
International Space Station has a
recycling system that can turn gray
water into drinkable water but it costs
250 million dollars we can't do that but
we did have this recirculating gray
water system in order to give us some
idea of what it would be like to be
dealing with this so you had to manually
pump water into the toilet in order to
flush it and you had to pump 50 times I
counted them and there's the sign over
the toilet that says if it's yellow let
it Mellow if it's brown flush it flush
down water was scarce our water was
delivered in a in a tank truck a small a
small tank on her trailer once every
week or so and so we had to really
conserve our water but at the same time
we couldn't conserve it too much or the
greenhouse would die because it wasn't
getting enough water so it's a real
balance water on Mars is a constant
problem and too much water can be as
much of a problem is too little we also
had a shower but as I said the there'd
been a hard hard freeze the week before
we arrived and so the type
burst and so the shower was out of
commission our years so our week so we
were we were just reduced to sponge
baths so we're going out the back door
the engineering airlock and now we're on
the back porch now you may be wondering
how I'm standing out there in the vacuum
and the answer is that I'm not in the
vacuum I'm in this pressurized tunnel
the RA Heinlein Memorial tunnel so this
this this is just a sketch of a tunnel
but it represents a pressurized tunnel
that connects the hab with the
greenhouse so we're passing through the
tunnel here to the greenhouse the ODA
memorial greenhouse so in this space the
greenhouse is divided into two areas the
front half is where you can raise plants
if you're raising any plants on your on
your rotation we did i'll talk a little
bit about that later and in the back
half is where the water is filtered the
water is filtered through three
different tanks containing different
kinds of water plants and i'll give you
a closer look at that sign there you may
recognize that symbol that's actually
the orchid symbol so the so the water is
filtered through several different tanks
and several different layers of filters
and a number of different bacteria to
the point that it actually stunk much
less by the time it was through with all
that and we could use it for flushing
the toilet now it may seem that going
through all that work just to flush the
toilet doesn't seem worthwhile but
actually something like sixty percent of
the water that a typical house uses is
used to flush the toilet so by using
recycled water to flush the toilet we
could dramatically cut our water use and
in a real space station you'd be using
something other than water to flush the
toilet but um this is it's only a
simulation so from here you can see that
in addition to the hab and the
greenhouse we also have an observatory
the path leading up to the observatory
is also a pressurized tunnel
quote-unquote so as long as you don't
step past that line of rocks on either
side you will not die on the the green
heavy us are the observatory itself is
too small to move around and inside in a
spacesuit which is why we have this
pressurized tunnel and it has as you can
see a gorgeous view and the skies in
this area are about as dark as anywhere
on this continent we had spectacular
views at night this is a this is a
astronomical photograph that Bianca took
and here is a view down
from the from the observatory to the hab
by night and that bright orange star you
see in the upper left hand corner is
actually Mars so while we were there we
were doing real science in simulated
Mars conditions one of the projects we
were working on was a micropaleontology
project which was done by a Steve who
was an amateur paleontologist he would
go out and climb on rocks that none of
us were brave enough to clamber and come
down with samples of various materials
from formations that he thought might be
good micro fossil beds some of his
paleontologist friends said that sounds
like a great experiment but you're not
going to find anything well he spent a
lot of time into samples and a lot of
times during through microscopes and he
did eventually actually find this this
is called an hasta Cod it is a hundred
and fifty million year old crustacean
critters like this still exists today
and this kind of sorting and searching
and sifting and finding is something
that is probably going to be one of the
major things that we do when we do get
to Mars because if there was any life on
Mars you millions of years ago it would
probably be quite small so this this
microfossil thing the existence of these
microfossils is one of the reasons that
the Mars desert Research Station is
located where it is because there are
plenty of micro fossil beds in that
vicinity another experiment we were
doing was what we call the suit
constraint study in this study we would
go out and look for plants we would mark
out an area of the desert and then try
to count identify and take samples of
every plant in the vicinity everybody
did the we had four different areas and
everybody did each area once and we
randomized whether you would do it in a
suit or not on a suit so we did all of
the non suited parts of the study at the
very beginning of the mission before we
went into simulation after that we were
all going out and doing what i call
cotton-picking on Mars because it was
tedious back-breaking work crawling
around hands and knees looking for all
these little plant samples and I I swear
wearing the gloves the gloves was the
worst part imagine dealing with zip lock
bags and a little pair of scissors and a
pencil and a pad and a camera so you
could record and write down a note down
every sample that you took I swear I
collected my pencil a lot more often
than I collected any of those plants
samples so while we were out there on
our hands and knees collecting samples
Diego was monitoring the experiment but
since he was out there and we really
weren't getting in too much trouble he
decided that he would do a little side
experiment on extrema file life forms so
he was looking for what are called
extremophiles which is to say life forms
that like extreme conditions and which
involve picking up a lot of rocks and
breaking them open and looking inside in
this case he found a green line in the
middle of the rock which when examined
under the microscope yielded this this
is in el djem this act this life form
exists on earth and lives inside of Iraq
where there's no light and no water and
we think that if there are life forms on
Mars today they're going to be critters
like that another experiment that Diego
our biologists did was growing up
ViSalus peruviana which is a plant that
grows in Peru at very high altitudes
it's used to low air pressures it's used
to a lot of ultraviolet light and so we
thought it would be a good candidate for
growing on Mars so we had a number of
them in the greenhouse and unfortunately
by the end of the two weeks only one
plant had come up so in a sense the
experiment was a success in that it had
a result but in terms of actually
growing plants not so much the one
scientific experiment that I was most
directly involved in was the
reconstruction of the telescope the
radio telescope had been put up in 2006
and was built for the altitude of
Jupiter above the horizon at that year
jupiter has moved around since then so
the telescope needs to be pointed in a
different direction this type of
telescope just consists of two wires
held up on poles and so the altitude at
which it is focused is determined by the
elk by the the height of the wires above
the ground so what we needed to do was
we needed to take it down and put it up
again in an adjustable way so this was
all done in suits we went out we
disassembled the existing radio
telescope and took it down then we came
inside and used our trigonometric skills
to figure out how long all the guy wires
needed to be and where the holes needed
to be drilled and then we drilled all
the holes measured all the guy wires
drove the the grove the new of the new
spikes in into the end of the martian
soil using a highly sophisticated
astronaut tool and then put the new one
up
using using again highly sophisticated
astronaut tools and finally there's the
completed new adjustable radio telescope
and then we went inside and actually
recorded this signal from Jupiter so
it's not a very sophisticated instrument
but it's it's yeah a lot of the people
that come to the Mars desert Research
Station or students of one sort or
another so the radio telescope has been
used by several groups that have come
after us to do various scientific
studies the thing that we spent the most
time on each day and the biggest pain in
each day and also the most fun was going
out on extra vehicular activity going
outside of the hab when you're getting
ready to go on EBA you start off by
putting on a jumpsuit under the jumpsuit
I am wearing a wool sweater wool shirt
long sleeves long pants long underwear
and in wool knit cap it was very cold in
January in the Utah desert we put on
these Gators on our boots to keep the
dust and sometimes mud from getting into
from getting inside of our boots the
backpack is actually quite light in
weight but it's a bit awkward to get on
you're supposed to have somebody to help
you on with it but we got to the point
that we could put it on ourselves now
we're all set for the helmet um that's
one of them I got a lot of good author
photos this okay so you have you have
your name tag that goes on so we can
identify the body when it's when it's
brought back in on the things on the red
on the red lanyards are keys to the ATVs
we have this large red thing on it so
that in case you drop it while you're
wearing your helmet and wearing your
gloves you can see it there on the
ground and maybe even have a fighting
chance of picking it up and we also had
handheld radios that we used for
communication so you hook up the radio
you run you run the wire into the
earphone up under the under the ring of
the helmet then you have to have
somebody to help screw the screw the
hoses onto your helmet that was the one
thing that you could not do for yourself
with the angle was just too awkward and
now we're all suited up in the air lock
ready to go and out we go onto the
surface and here we are out on the
surface of Mars and it's it's not Mars
but with the spacesuit and the Red Rocks
it really felt like Mars
we were we were doing astronaut things
we were out collecting samples and
taking lots of pictures and it I came
home with something like 2,500 pictures
after the two weeks it was it's hard not
to get great photographs just just
pointing just pointing the picture at
your friends doing all these marvelous
things and I I didn't think that I would
really enjoy being in the desert um but
I really did I really did grow to love
it it's a beautiful hazardous it's it's
a hazardous it's unpleasant it's
uncomfortable I'll take take questions
later I'll take questions at the end of
the talk thank you um but it's it's
spectacular in its way it i mean buzz
aldrin use the term magnificent
desolation when talking about the moon
and this this utah desert really is
magnificent desolation it and the colors
of the rocks were constantly changing
depending on atmospheric conditions and
what time of day it was many different
kinds of rocks on many different vistas
and you could client you could climb on
things and see for a long long way this
particular rock just fascinates me this
is a case where you have an over layer
which is made of harder rock and under
layer made of software rockridge has
been eaten away over the years we never
did find out the name of that feature
but it's quite spectacular and and the
rocks that you would see underfoot were
red like Mars and and there that's
that's a beautiful shot of the hab from
the ridge above and the this is this is
the area that was known on our maps as
Valles Marineris all of I we have we
have our map of the area with all these
Mars names on it the Bureau of Land
Management who owns this land has all of
their own names for this stuff but we
would call it Valles Marineris or
Olympus Mons or what have you but but
you can see just how much it looks like
Mars how you know you've got the rocks
laying around well actually this is Mars
ah this is this is an actual Mars
surface shot and apart from the fact
that the real Mars is a little bit more
rusty red and Utah is a little bit
Pinker it you kept see
shots that just reminded you of the
shots that you'd see from that from the
actual Mars mission so this is Utah and
this is the real Mars you know look look
how similar they are to each other and
you can tell the shots of the real of
the of the assimilated Mars because they
have people wandering around on them but
it was so cool and i left my footprint
on Mars we also had in addition to our
footprints we had these Rovers um this
was that they were kind of writing to me
at first but I really grew to love them
each of these little guys had its own
personality on they were a lot like
animals they had you know they were
temperamental on they they would they
would sometimes take off without you we
had we had some thrills we had some
spills nobody was seriously hurt
fortunately but with the rover's we
could get out a lot farther and this was
anybody here bended been to Disneyland
you know the Indiana Jones ride it felt
like the Indiana Jones ride on the
territory of Thunder Mountain Railroad
so after after a long hard day of going
out and collecting Roxon and looking for
looking for samples and taking lots of
great photos the Sun would go down and
at the end of this day we climbed up to
20 Butte right nearby and had this
gorgeous amazing view um this was this
is just just a spectacular just
awe-inspiring vista and so as the Sun
went down we would gather our materials
and head back to the hab and come back
at the end of the day now when you're on
Mars things break down all the time so I
became a member of the engineering crew
usually there's only one engineer and
five scientists in this case we really
had three engineers because although I
was journalist my journalistic tasks
only took up about a third of my day so
I spent the rest of my time helping to
fix things so I became the one in charge
of all the small electronics which
included the backpacks also when we had
a crack in a space helmet you can see
that little gray rectangle near the top
that's duct tape we would repair
everything we had with anything that we
could get dealing with water was a big
part of our day
we had to pump we had to pump the grey
water out of one tank and into another
tank a couple of times a day you can see
that that's that piece of piece of paper
taped up on one of the tanks in the
greenhouse it says gray water system has
recently undergone major major
renovations do not do anything without
checking with Mission Support first
everything was changing all of the time
because all of the systems had been
built and then you go out there and
something breaks and you have to fix it
with whatever you've got so the systems
were constantly changing in this case we
had to go in there with it with a filter
and hold this filter under the under the
pipe at a certain point in the process
because the regular filtering system
wasn't working we were constantly having
to fix and improvise though the whole
thing was like there's a scene in the
movie Apollo 13 where um where the where
the mission support people come and they
dumped a whole bunch of stuff down on
the table in front of the engineers and
says you have to fix you have to make
this fit into that using only this stuff
every day on Mars is like that and I
know from talking with people who've
worked on the on the Viking missions and
the and the Mars rovers that this kind
of improvisation is just part of space
travel because anytime you go someplace
new and someplace distant you have to
cope with whatever the environment
throws at you with whatever you have
with you so it's always improvisation
it's always putting together in fixing
now on the on the other end of this is
also a pressurized tunnel on the other
end of this pressurized tunnel is the
engineering area or shed um where we
have our motor generator that keeps us
in power this runs off of diesel fuel
this this new generator called kitty was
delivered the first day we were there
the previous crew had had very serious
problems with generators they're
actually five dead generators in this
pile in addition to two dead generators
that are behind me when I took this
picture um and so on day three when our
power went out it was not completely
surprised but as we SAT there with no
power and no heat getting colder and
colder and as the Sun was going down it
was getting darker and darker it was
kind of scary and it really felt like we
were out there on our own fortunately
this man came through to help us this is
DG
is very rarely photographed I think this
is the only picture anybody has of him
and he is a guy who lives in Hanksville
which is about 23 hours drive away and
comes in when the problems get to severe
or us due to severe for us to solve on
her own so he came in and he managed to
diagnose what the problem was with the
generator which was that when we shut it
down in order to change the oil it
wouldn't restart turns out that it was
running the power system just fine but
it wasn't charging its own battery what
we wound up doing was taking a check of
taking a trickle charger and plugging it
into the outlet rut running an extension
cord out from the hab to a trickle
charger so that the motor generator
could charge itself constant constant
improvisation so our water was delivered
our drinking water was delivered on a
tank it had to be pumped by hand from
that tank into this tank from which it
could be electrically pumped up into
this tank which is located above the
above the bedrooms and from there it
would gravity feed down into the sinks
um if you didn't pay attention when you
were pumping this tank full it would
overflow and if it went above that green
line at the top the one that says do not
exceed then the water would run down
into your bedroom this of course never
happened to us right so dealing with
dealing with water making sure that the
batteries for the backup system were
being charged making sure that the
plants and the greenhouse did not die
engineering is red pomp ekipa ng the the
rover's gassed and oil just dealing with
with the systems of the hab was really
more than one full-time job there were
two and a half of us and and we were
able to get ahead usually most teams
fall behind so we were doing we were
doing very well and actually locks in
our chief engineer was asked to join the
permanent engineering staff and he'll be
he'll be going back there in June to get
the place ready for the next rotation
the next year because they don't they
don't do it during the summer they close
up they close up at the end of the
season and open up again in and I think
about September so our daily life we had
pretty much the same schedule every day
go ahead got up at seven-thirty had
breakfast and a morning briefing we went
out on a morning Evie a anything from
two people the four people would go out
on one or two EV A's in the morning
lunch about noon and then usually time
for two
TVA's in the afternoon we'd get together
for dinner and then we'd spend the rest
of the evening doing our daily reports
the hab was equipped with quite a large
selection of books I took this picture
because it really represents what living
in the hab is all about we have joy of
cooking fundamentals of radiology
microgravity research and the home
improvement 123 book because it really
is like like living in a small cabin
except for the fact that you just can't
go can't go home and get any more stuff
you're stuck with what you've got what
we were eating was dehydrated food of
one sort or another this is this is some
of it and there's a lot more of it in
the loft above the bedrooms this is a
fairly typical breakfast before you add
the water so that's powdered milk
dehydrated fruit of some sort looks like
mangos a little sugar and oatmeal this
is breakfast basically every day was it
was open you know we had a lot of other
things for lunch and dinner but and that
thing on that large brown rectangle on
the right is a shelf stable bread which
was developed for the military and was
about as tasty as you might think the
dehydrated fruit was quite nice and
actually we got in trouble with mission
support because we ate more than our
share of the dehydrated fruit on we were
able to bake if the with the stove which
was lit with a match on and this was
this uh I think was it was a couscous
that that I fixed one day Diego will
raised us some sprouts in the greenhouse
and i have to tell you after a week and
a half of eating dehydrated food having
a simple salad of green sprouts with a
vinaigrette and a few dehydrated onions
on top was probably the best salad I've
eaten in my entire life and and Paul was
a big big eater as you can tell that was
made by mixing together several
different varieties of dehydrated food
and adding water it wasn't actually
quite it wasn't actually that bad so
this is me working on my journalistic on
my journalistic duties we had a lot of
reports we all had a lot of reports to
do these were filed over a web form to
the Mars Society server back in Boston
so I did my journalists report every day
there was also I also copied my
journalists reports to my livejournal
for my friends and family and a lot of
other people of course have read them
online we had the engineering report
which listed all of the water levels and
gas
levels and diesel levels and oil levels
of all the systems and just was a quick
checklist of everything that might
conceivably go wrong so the people back
home could know what the state of the
hab was we had an EV a report that the
person who was in charge of any
individual lee VA would fill out about
where did you go how long did it take
what did you do there was the science
report for each of the science
experiments that was ongoing had to have
filed a science report every day on we
had to upload photographs to the Mars
Society for the views on their webpage
we had our daily was this the food study
yes this is the food study we had to
fill out a survey on what we ate every
single day and how we felt about it we
had the hab architecture study which we
filled out twice a week was what do you
think about this space that you're
living in are any changes that you would
make how long do you think you could
live in this space before going insane
hopefully the answer is more than two
weeks this was the report that we filled
out after each of our suit constraints
studies and the inventory of all the
food what did we eat and what was
remaining and the quick guide that I
wrote that was a technical writer for a
lot of years and so when I got here and
I discovered how messed up and
undocumented the hab systems were
because there was plenty of
documentation we had binders and binders
and binders of documentation every one
of which was out of date even if it was
only a couple of months old because the
hab systems were constantly changing so
I wrote up these quick guides which were
one page bullet lists of this is what
this is what you need to do every day
and if something goes wrong this is what
to do about it because we had lots of
background material but no very focused
usable documentation so I wrote about a
dozen of these quick guides and
laminated them and left them and i left
the file on the computer in the hab
saying with explicit instructions to say
whenever anything changes you need to
update the quick guides and i've gotten
feedback from people that have followed
that this has been incredibly valuable
to them so technical writing saves the
day for sure so this is why if you
looked in on the webcam at any point
during my two-week mission you would
probably see me sitting at my computer
type type type type typing away but then
at the end of the day we were on Mars
and we had this marvelous view out of
our portholes ever
today so what did I learn from my two
weeks on Mars share diversity creates
strong relationships we were out there
all by ourselves there were six of us
and we were dependent on each other
nobody else could tell us what to do
nobody else could help us we had to
depend on each other and we good we got
really really close we were like a
family the isolation are our great
distance from any kind of any kind of
shop anybody that could help us forced
us to become ingenious to improvise to
be self-reliant and what I called
protagonist eNOS which is behaving like
the protagonist protagonist of a story
is somebody who takes actions that
change the plot you have to when you see
a problem beginning to occur you learn
to take action you learn to see that
problem and take action to do something
about it you do not wait for approval
you do not ask somebody to help you do
not assume that somebody else will deal
with it you deal with it yourself and I
just as an example when we came back I
was having breakfast in the hotel on the
way home and I spilled coffee and I
immediately grabbed a rag and mopped up
the coffee and put everything away never
even occurred to me to ask somebody from
the restaurant to clean that to clean
the mess up I was just totally in that
mode of everything that happens is my
responsibility but I did not die I got
this fabulous author photo and I made my
new Morris family these these people are
people who will be important to me for
the rest of my life and I'm so glad to
have met them so this is me
got about 15 minutes for questions yes
this is so cool I have so many questions
I have to pick one I guess for now so I
guess it would be when when I see like
videos and like articles about the space
station they don't rotate the whole crew
at once I guess not to keep not to bring
like a pack of four or five new people
rytas environment did anything like this
is anything like this considered for
this like we actually that was that is
exactly one of the recommendations that
we made to the Mars Society is that um
when you come in the you fly to Grand
Junction Colorado which is the nearest
nearest town with any excuse me nearest
town with any kind of airport and then
you rent a car and you drive about three
hours to the have you have the handover
exchange cruise the old crew takes the
car and drives back to Grand Junction
that takes about three hours so because
of that three hour drive you've got
maybe a couple of hours for the handover
during which time you have to try to
tell the new crew everything you
couldn't write down and a lot of
information gets lost in this big game
of telephone so we were saying we
recommended to the Mars Society that
rather than rotate the entire crew that
you have you you have some people stay
over into the next crew and that is
exactly what they do on the
International Space Station and you've
got to have that that continuity that
that institutional memory because we
made a lot of mistakes in our first
couple of days and looking at the
reports from subsequent crews I see
again and again people make mistakes in
the first couple of days that's when if
you were to have the tank overflow and
run down into your room that's when it
would happen if it happened which it
didn't happen to us officially so yeah
that's an excellent thing they do on the
space station and and I would you know I
wish we could do it the the economics
the whole thing is really run in a
shoestring the the hab costs I think two
million dollars which was donated by a
couple of large donors but all all the
maintenance and and everything going
forward is all done on on
nations and so there's never enough
money to do anything the way that you
would like to do and so just the
difference between renting a car to
drive all the way out there and back
once every two weeks as opposed to every
week which you would want to do to have
that hand over to have that overlapping
cruise you know that's that's one of the
areas where they've had to cut back and
also each crew is independent our crew
belonged to the Mars Society but a lot
of the other ones are sent by Georgia
Tech sends out a crew and the Mars
Society Europe sent out a crew and and
and there are a number of different
organizations that have that field a
full crew of six if you had overlapping
personnel you couldn't do it quite that
way so there's all kinds of reasons they
do it this way but I think for
practicality sake it would be better if
they do if they didn't have overlap yes
oh yeah you know to me I think the most
amazing thing is that at your age and
level of education you still have
trigonometric skills yes most most of us
have lost the long yes yes well ya see
this see this much trig functions okay
this is this is it this is a nineteen
nineteen eighty vintage geek watch with
trigonometric functions um and and all
and actually you know we all we all did
I mean Paul's an electrical engineer
loxton is also is also an engineer
although he's mostly a manager these
days we all we all had those skills and
between us we managed to remember the
formula okay David you're a writer in a
reader what books did you take with you
um I did not let's see what I only took
well I took I took a copy of space magic
my award-winning collection of short
stories which at which I don't I don't
know if I don't know if you can if you
can sell books here but actually have
copies and I brought I did not bring a
copy of red bars Green Mars blue Mars
but there were copies in the library
there um honestly I only brought one
book for for leisure reading and I'd
never cracked it I couldn't tell you
what it was good question though yes hi
two questions the first question is what
did you have in your backpacks along
with your space suit right was it
artificially way down or fortunately no
on the the art the backpack when I went
in to repair the back tack backpack for
the
time I was really surprised because
under that quilted cloth cover is you
know those you know those plastic bins
you put shoes in and slip under your bed
that was what it was under the cover and
in that bin was too muffin fans like you
find inside your typical PC on a
rechargeable 12-volt battery about that
big a switch and a fuse the rest of it
was entirely empty but the airflow
through that empty space was such that
the air would come in would actually
cool off your back which is nice during
the during the warmer parts of the
rotation and then be be pumped into the
helmet so it was really you know the
bulk of the pack was mostly just for
visual effect on but keep in mind of
course that on Mars it would only way
one third of what it does on earth so
that pack is mostly empty but it was
functional and the second question is
why did you have to do that much
paperwork who was reading all of that
stuff a lot of the paperwork that we
were doing was for the Mars Society
itself filing those reports kept us
honest on and made sure that if anything
got broken they would know about it so
that they could maybe send along some
replacement parts with the with the
following people on with the next the
next rotation because people people were
able to pick something up at the airport
at the in Grand Junction on their way
out on so they so they could also offer
advice if anything went wrong and having
a daily report would let them know if
things were happening that they would
consider problems even if we didn't um
and it was basically just to keep us
honest and focused and also its public
relations outreach the same reason we
have those webcams which are publicly
visible also all of those reports that
we posted went up on a webpage that's
publicly visible so that people can
follow along at home on the mission and
I know that people were reading my
reports and looking at the webcams and
reading my blogs because I got email
about it a lot on we were bandwidth
limited we were extremely bandwidth
limited but each of us was instructed
you will get a separate a special gmail
account especially for the mission and
you will not have your regular email
forwarded to that count either you will
only give that account to people that
you that you know will not abuse it so
we were we had we had an account where
we could read a limited amount of email
and we were explicitly told not to use
and not to use hotmail or yahoo mail or
any
other things use Gmail because it's so
bandwidth efficient oh yes yeah so some
of the other paperwork that we were
doing on the architecture study and the
food study were being done by
researchers at I believe with the
Johnson Space Center on this is not an
official NASA thing but there are a lot
of people who work for NASA who worked
for JPL who worked for Lockheed who were
doing this on their own hook and and
they're getting and they get the time
off in their bosses because the boss is
also think that it'll be valuable for
them so there's a lot to be learned
about about what it's actually like to
live in these environments which if
you're designing space hardware can be
very helpful it gives you a a visceral
gut impression of what things are like
that's a lot more effective than
anything that you might read on read on
paper so um so it's not it's not NASA
but there's a lot of NASA people that
are working on it including the people
that are doing the food study and the
architecture study and these things are
being there being published in in
refereed journals there is some real
science coming out not a lot not a lot
but there is some real science coming
out of here yes so I remember seeing
this feature on Discovery about one of
the Apollo missions when they discovered
that they can hop around instead of
walking making it more efficient in the
spacesuits yes but they were talking
there of how they they can't really like
because of the hostile environment that
you know every time you try something
like that it's kind of you know if you
fall and crack your helmet it's it's not
like you're here so i was wondering if
you guys did any limit yourself at all
during those evaa to like not go certain
places because it might be too dangerous
very much so yes yeah on the the
priorities at the at the net Mars desert
Research Station our safety science
simulation and comfort in that order so
bottom line is if there's any question
about whether or not you should do
something if it's not safe you take you
take the safer route um and so there
were absolutely places that were marked
on the map you do not go here in your in
your ATVs we had we had there was a lot
of a lot of the hand over information
was all about how to use those ATVs
safely there was you know there are
protocols for going up and down that
ladder because you could easily you
could easily bust yourself on that
ladder on there were and then we would
we would experiment but one of the
reasons you report on what you've done
is so that mission support can tell you
don't do that anymore it's dangerous on
and the ATVs were the most dangerous
thing and and certainly going out in the
desert is potentially dangerous even if
you aren't wearing a pretend spacesuit
by the way when I went all the paperwork
that I had to fill out when I when I
signed up for the mission included it as
claimer that said in approximately so
many words I acknowledge that driving
around the desert in an ATV wearing a
fake space helmet is really stupid and
so you know so we actually we actually
did not wear our space helmets on the
ATVs we would take off the helmet and
strap it to the rack and wear a
motorcycle helmet and that's why there
aren't a lot of pictures of us writing
on the ATVs because we didn't want to
take pictures of us not in simulation
but we did wear the helmets for short
jaunts and we would put on the helmets
for photographs but you you compromise
science and simulation for safety where
necessary which is not to say we never
did anything foolish but we never did
anything foolish and told Mission
Support about it yes so I had two
questions the first one is how did the
differential plant survey work out I
mean the ok the the people Rove iana
study we tried growing that plant in the
greenhouse in a variety of local soils
and only one seed germinated it was
intended to be an experiment that would
go for several rotations because two
weeks is in a lot of time when it comes
to a plant but since only one seed came
up we decided to terminate the
experiment rather than ask the following
ask the following team to use some of
their limited time to keep going on an
experiment that we'd given them did that
answer the question no I was actually
asking about the plant survey you did
one in spacesuits and one without oh
that one um the I don't remember part of
the problem there is is that the the
person who was in charge of the survey
diego was the one who is now in Moscow
getting ready for the Mars 500 so he
hasn't had a chance to assemble and
publish his results but just from my own
personal experience I'd say that I
spotted and collected something in the
vicinity of forty or fifty percent as
many plants in the suit as not in the
suit the biggest problem was the gloves
and the second biggest problem was the
helmets because when you're wearing this
helmet you can't you can't wipe your
nose you can't you can't rub your eyes
if your hat starts to fall down over
your head I learned that I could kind of
push my head back and kind of scrape it
back on the back of the helmet but in
general um if your helmet fogged up you
know you would you could be you could be
in serious trouble and one of the other
teams had had some very cold weather
they had helmets fogging up all the time
and and sometimes they just had to
abandon Sam and say I need to take off
my helmet and clean it otherwise I
couldn't see at all um so in addition to
that keeping you from seeing the plants
in the first place taking a picture of
the plant and dealing with with marking
down your results on a piece of paper
and maybe holding the plant close to
yourself so you again identify which
plant it is you can only get this close
you can't get this close and that's it's
a big impact and then there's there's
the there's the bulkiness of the suit in
the backpack and all that keeps you from
moving around and getting down and
getting up again was all it was t like I
said it was like picking cotton on Mars
and so it was a big big hit on if we
were doing it for real we would probably
have something better than holding 6 zip
lock bags in one hand while doing all
this other stuff with it with the other
hand if we were doing it for real we
would probably have a specialized holder
to hold the six bags open that would
like strapped to the side of your suit
or something like that but because we
did the same thing in both environments
it was a fair comparison but it was a it
was instructive to be sure some other
teams not ours uh there's a group in
South Dakota university of south dakota
is doing spacesuit design work and they
send a couple of teams out a year with
new prototype spacesuits which they try
out in the desert conditions and those
are those are for real I mean those are
those are much realer spacesuits with
actual oxygen supplies and everything
it's it's quite impressive really got
some great pictures and you had a second
question yeah the second question was
what it was the environment in the green
house like and was it artificially
heated the greenhouse was not
artificially the artificial the
environment in the greenhouse was it was
like any greenhouse that you might have
been in it was it was warm and rather
moist it was not artificially heated it
was uh the outside is that that Wiggly
transparent stuff that greenhouses are
often made of and there was enough
enough solar radiation coming in through
there that it was it was quite
comfortable in there was a nice place to
be apart from the fact that it's tank so
so the greenhouse was working as a
greenhouse in actual Mars conditions um
the fact that you're farther from the
Sun is slightly compensated for by the
fact that the atmosphere is so much
thinner which means that Earth plants
would probably get along pretty well in
a greenhouse on Mars all you have to do
was bring the local atmosphere which is
mostly mostly carbon dioxide up to a
level that's comfortable for the plants
which is only like I think about four or
five psi of carbon dioxide is enough to
keep plants happy so that's about one
third of Earth atmospheric pressure Mars
surface pressure is less than 1% of
Earth's surface pressure but you could
enclose the plants in a in a greenhouse
um pressurize the air a little bit and
they would be they would be able to grow
and they would not be too badly
disturbed by the 24 and a half hour a
day so that's that's a that's a
definitely something that will that will
happen if we ever do go to Mars for sure
as people yes I was going to ask
something else but since you brought it
up what is for a habitat on Mars what is
the design i guess pressurized
environment that you want for the humans
I mean you don't have to have one full
atmosphere right I mean no you don't I
did I've done some research on this i
mean i've been working on some fiction
about Mars obviously um and i've been
i've been studying this and the
International Space Station is kept at
at ground at sea level pressure 15 psi
not for the sake of the people but for
the sake of various experiments because
a lot of the scientific equipment was
built with the assumption of 15 psi so
it's just easier on all the equipment if
they keep the space station at 15 psi
I Apollo was one at a quite a low
pressure of about I think like three psi
of pure oxygen on pure oxygen as you
probably know is what killed the Apollo
1 astronauts so they ran the they ran
the capsule at a mixture of oxygen and
nitrogen during launch but once they
were well above the atmosphere and away
from the danger of fire they switched
over to a pure oxygen atmosphere and
random pure oxygen for the rest of the
mission pure oxygen is perfectly
perfectly breathable for people at
twenty percent yeah yeah i think i think
you know twenty percent twenty percent
of it our atmosphere is like twenty
percent oxygen so if you if you provide
pure oxygen and twenty percent
atmospheric pressure people are
perfectly happy on that as long as
there's no as long as there's no
combustion then it's it's quite safe
running at a low pressure means that
things like spacesuits are much easier
to work in and of course you don't have
to transport all of that nitrogen along
with you so I I can't tell you what
pressure on Mars habitat would be run at
there are good reasons to run it at sea
level pressures and there's other good
reasons to run it at a lower pressure on
the book that I would recommend is the
case for Mars by Robert Zubrin he talks
about all of this it's robert zubrin is
one of the founders of the Mars Society
and just about everything you see here
is based on his ideas so he talks about
all this stuff in great detail and you
can work it out for yourself and you had
another question and the other question
yeah so if you look at the literature at
least the movies and TV series of the
technology level of science fiction on
one end you have like the Star Trek
where everything is nice and shiny on
the other end of the spectrum you have
sort of the Firefly right and you guys
were like some a few levels below that
so I'm kind of wondering if that kind of
spoils the effect or do you get like how
do you like you you're sitting on
folding chairs that you're supposed to
be on this Mars facility with at least
some kind of you know modern
technologies it was a little bit a
little bit of a disappointment at first
when you when you show up and you
discover that everything is basically
everything is made of made of wood and
you have and you have the folding chest
they did as much
they could with the budget that they had
to make it feel like a real space
mission on the I mean for example the
the door on the greenhouse that you saw
had the rounded corners a nice nice
plastic waffle pattern with a big with a
big handle in the middle on what you did
not see in that picture is the fact that
the big handle in the middle says
fisher-price on the hub and the back of
that door you can see where the legs
have been taken off because it was a
plastic picnic table with rounded
corners they're making very good use of
limited budget in order to make it look
as Spacey as possible so yeah it's a
little bit it's a little bit of a
disappointment you first get there but
the real environment the actual desert
outside the portholes and and the end
the spacesuits and just the knowledge of
how isolated you are makes it feel marzi
even if it didn't perhaps look as more
as ye as you might like okay basically I
think we have time for one last question
it's probably just worth mentioning that
there's the other station F Mars which
is the Arctic and yes thank you really
yeah the Mars Society has two of these
Mars stations so far there's the Mars
desert Research Station in Utah and the
flash line Mars Arctic research station
F Mars on Devon island in a meteor
crater in the Canadian Arctic F Mars is
a lot more isolated on the crew and
supplies have to be dropped in by a
c-130 plane they do one month rotations
instead of two week rotations and you
have to do you have to walk down to the
stream to carry your water rather than
having it delivered by by a tanker truck
so so we had it easy by comparison with
them and I do know some people who've
been to F Mars and it's it's hardcore I
had originally thought that I wanted to
go there but having been to the Utah one
I think that's about as far as I want to
go so thank you very much I'll be
hanging around if you have any more
questions
