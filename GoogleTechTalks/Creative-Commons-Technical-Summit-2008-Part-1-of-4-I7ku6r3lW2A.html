supposed to first thank Google for
making this happen and in particular
Chris DiBona do it Clinton bliss Lee
Hawthorne and Tiffany Griffith for
everything and and hopefully this will
be the first of a bunch of these things
and I was suddenly told I think I got
tacked on at the beginning to say
something so I'll try to say something
interesting yesterday I was at supernova
trying to explain creative comments to a
bunch of people who didn't really
understand and actually I was I was with
Larry Page and Jamie in the green room
at the Google zeitgeist in the UK and as
you know Larry's been somewhat skeptical
about some parts of Creative Commons so
I have a kind of a framework argument
that I've been working on and I kind of
want to test it on you guys to see if if
this works and and it stretches the
metaphor a little bit too much but but
sort of bear with me
but I I don't know how many of you
remember sort of the early days of the
internet when tcp/ip was struggling
against ccitt and we were sort of
fighting to make tcp/ip the standard and
actually back then before the internet
you had all these little islands of
networking technologies and things
weren't connected so we had you know the
Ethernet kind of connected the computers
together and then once tcp/ip became you
know sort of the standard you were able
to connect the computer networks
together and then when HTTP came out you
were able to connect all these separate
software services and sites together
into the web and actually in the talk
that Larry and Sergey gave they were
saying that you know they were sitting
there at Stanford and they could connect
their first Google server to the
Internet and they were able to get
people from all over the world to
connect to Google without having
bilateral agreements with everybody
which would have had to have happened if
it were X 25 and if we fail the fight
for protecting the open Internet might
actually happen in the future but but
but the idea is that that you have these
kind of standards that get created like
tcp/ip which enable a huge explosion of
innovation and creativity both
for-profit and nonprofit around these
open standards and I think
that Creative Commons if you include the
technology part of Creative Commons what
we're trying to do is to create at least
at the content and sort of culture layer
something very similar to tcp/ip and so
similar to tcp/ip one of the things
that's very confusing about Creative
Commons is there's one part of Creative
Commons which is the people who wear the
t-shirts who go who you know use
t-shirts to and we feel cool because
we're part of a political movement that
has a message we want the world to be
free but there's another part of
Creative Commons which is the kind of
keeping the trains running on time let's
make it ubiquitous we want Creative
Commons and Nokia phones and in just
about we wanted to be ubiquitous right
because the thing about tcp/ip and the
internet you don't want to exclude
certain people from the internet just
because they don't agree with you the
whole point of the sort of small pieces
loosely joined open Internet is that
everybody can participate and anybody
can innovate even if you don't like them
you don't block them you create tools
that anybody can use so in a sense
tcp/ip and the technology part is
politically agnostic but on the other
hand you have to fight to try to keep
the standards open you have to fight to
protect the process so if you think
about it you have like the IETF which is
really not that political but then we
have this whole movement for the open
Internet and similarly I think that
Creative Commons we have two really
important pieces that we work on and as
a community we have to work on one piece
which is the technical piece which is
includes a legal technical as well as
the software technical which is to make
sure that everything works together
everything is compatible and everything
interoperates and that part I think is
actually should be relatively agnostic
in terms of the politics it should just
just should happen and then there's a
political part which is to try to make
the world more free and you know one of
the things in and again this is what we
have a lot of arguments I mean they
think there's two ways to look at this
you can look at it from the sort of free
software foundation kind of view which
is here's what's free join us you're
either in or you're out and that's a
really important way to set up kind of
the the reference point for where we
want to go right but then there are a
lot of people who could never make that
decision if you are record musicians
signed to a label and we're fighting
with rights collections agencies to even
get them to move an inch they're not
ever going to be able to
make that leap and is indifferent flee
from software and from the internet one
of the things about the internet and
IETF there really wasn't that much
legacy or history the problem with
cultural stuff is that we've got years
and years of history we've got crazy
laws we've got big huge incumbents who
are trying to protect this stuff so it's
pretty hard to force people to make the
jump from completely closed to
completely open and so one of the things
that I think we're trying to do is
trying to create a path from a
completely closed world to a completely
open world now there are people who are
mostly open already like the educators
we shouldn't really even be considering
non-commercial they should just be going
straight for open and but on the other
hand if you're talking to Hollywood
which we eventually want to get into all
this you still you have to start with
some of our more restrictive licenses
the good news is as far as we can
understand from the data that we have is
year by year if you look at the
distribution of our licenses they tend
to become more free so the theory is
that you have on the one end a slightly
restrictive license the non-commercial
sort of no derivatives license and
people enter there but as they taste
free they become more and more free so
that so this is an argument that you
know some people agree with some people
don't agree with but but our idea is
that we want to provide a whole choice
for everybody along the spectrum the
chain from completely closed to
completely open
assuming that open is going to win in
the end and that people will will will
travel along that path and so anything
that's pushing people in the wrong
direction we should fight against but I
think the idea is to create a platform
that allows interoperability and to
create a movement that pushes people
from closed to open but to do that in a
you know in a rational and civil way and
so so those are the two things the
movement and the and the technology and
and they're separate and sometimes they
get a little confused and as we become
more successful we have people who are
politically not very aligned with us I
won't name names but you know I've had
you know people adopt Creative Commons
licenses or adopt Creative Commons
technology and have the community say
how can you let these guys use Creative
Commons or how can you let these guys
sponsor our conference and things like
that but that's not really the point we
want everybody using it we want
Republicans using it we want you know
the Arabs using me what we want
everybody using it and so so that we
can't exclude people at the technology
level and so I think that's just a
another thing that we should we need to
be aware of so so anyway that's that's
my theory and I
would love to have Holloway
conversations with people to sort of
pick at it and figure out whether that's
the right framework I realize that it's
not perfect and I think somebody was
suggesting that the software metaphor I
mean is is this is slightly different I
see Michael there I remember what I was
on the open source initiative board we
had 500 licenses that called themselves
open source I think the black dock
people are saying that at least I think
we've been tough enough to prevent too
much of the license proliferation but
some people are still saying six
licenses is too many but anyway enough
ranting and so I look forward to hearing
everybody's presentations today and
thanks for showing up do I need to thank
anybody else okay all right thanks
presentative and so if you like some
coffee or whatever we have out just a
minute here and so he's gonna be talking
about the CC rights expression language
and then we'll follow that up with a
panel about some current technology
initiatives we have going on at Creative
Commons
my name is benedita I am the Creative
Commons w3c rep and I've been working on
the stuff we're about to talk about for
quite a while mostly in the dungeons
that make up the w3c working group rooms
right no I I kid actually all of the
discussions for the last four years are
all public you can all go see the
development of this technology CC rel is
the Creative Commons rights expression
language it's how we express the rights
that you know in the Creative Commons
licenses if you have any questions as I
go along this is gonna be a lot of
material packed into 45 minutes of fun
if you have any questions please
interrupt me this is work that the
entire technical team at Creative
Commons has done and it's it's been a
lot of fun there are three ways in which
Creative Commons license information is
represented right we like to joke about
this especially the technical people
like to joke about this that it's human
readable machine readable and lawyer
readable and we think these are all
mutually exclusive so the wet the
one-way we're interested in right now so
here's here's the human readable right
nice little icons that tell you you can
share this work you can remix this work
and you should also
credit to the people who created this
work in the first place
nice human-readable here's the detailed
lawyer readable version of that with all
of the caveats and all the things you
need to know if you're a lawyer and
you're signing contracts here's the
machine readable version of that which I
have to admit currently doesn't look a
whole lot prettier than the lawyer
version but what this says is Larry
Lessig's blog is licensed under Creative
Commons license
the license is specifically you can't
quite see it over here but it's the
probably the attribution license
that's all this says one big chunk of
text and when we started in 2002 and we
told people you know when you license
your webpage under a Creative Commons
license you should put something in
there so machines can understand that
it's licensed under a Creative Commons
license this is what we told them well
sorry just let me tell you first why
we're doing this
why do we even have machinery tabouli
right and people asked us this why do we
need this there's an icon
everything is beautiful well in some
bright future we'd like to have the
following things we'd like to have
programs that can answer simple
questions as you copy and paste content
from one application to another first of
all what's the works license right you
take some data you move it around into
Photoshop and whatnot what is the
license under which this content is
distributed simple question a little
deeper can I make use of this content
for commercial use and this is the
question you would ask probably at the
point where you're about to use the you
know the work that you've created and
you've handled a couple of components
you've merged a couple of components and
suddenly you think wait a second am I
allowed to use this for commercial use
derivative works can I even begin to
create a derivative work and distribute
it and then finally the probably the
most important part for our early
adopter is the bloggers right how do I
give attribution so I'm told that I have
to give attribution I have to give
credit to the person who created this
work how do I do that where do I link to
what's the knit is it been or is it
Benjamin edita which one is it right and
to specify that would be very nice from
a
machines standpoint so that maybe it
could be auto-filled in your blog right
so the idea is if we let machines
understand a little bit of what's going
on then the programs will be a lot more
helpful the previous recommendation
looked like this and that's why it's in
red right because we weren't very happy
with it even when we started in 2002 it
said you have an HTML page we don't
really know how to put any structured
meaningful machine readable data in
there so let's put it in an HTML comment
that big chunk of XML that you saw
earlier let's put that inside an HTML
comment brilliant brilliant idea we're
still suffering the pains of that
obviously not something we wanted to
have for the long term but as it turns
out the problem was quite complicated
and there are a lot of other folks
working on how you can add some kind of
meaning some kind of machine readability
to the existing web to the HTML web so
the problem of course is if you put
stuff in comments parsers don't always
see it comments get stripped out by
various tools at various times certainly
humans don't see it so what might happen
is you add a Creative Commons license
you add the XML and then later you
change the Creative Commons license you
point to a different one maybe you
upgrade to version 3.0 right but you
forget to change the RDF XML that was in
the comment that happens all the time so
not not so good for humans very easy to
screw up right you've got this really
big chunk of XML inside a comment
nothing telling you whether it's even
well-formed right if you've closed all
your tags correctly and of course you
saw that massive chunk of text to just
say this is the license that's a little
verbose so this year we're introducing
the Creative Commons rights expression
language and the Creative Commons rights
expression language attempts to address
all the issues we have and let you
express in HTML what the license is and
further details about your work and we
actually also addressed this for things
other than HTML but given the time
constraint I'm going to focus on HTML
today the web
this is what we say in the introduction
to the paper that you can find on our
site and I'll give you the link
compared to the previous recommendation
CC rel is intended to be both easier for
content creators and publishers to
provide this is important to realize all
the players here there are publishers
they need to publish information and say
this is the license for my content so we
want to make it easier for them that's
one right we want to make it easier for
also user communities and tool builders
to consume that information to extend
that information because you can apply
Creative Commons licenses to lots and
lots of different existing files and
types of information but there are many
more in the future we don't know about
so we need to make it extensible in some
way and of course easy for people to
combine and redistribute so you combine
a couple of items under a Creative
Commons license and you want to
redistribute the result we need to make
that process easy in some way we think
we've accomplished that with CC rel and
of course we you know we're hoping to
get a lot of feedback from you today and
in the next few weeks and months the
first thing we do with the Creative
Commons rights expression language is we
think about abstract notions we don't
think about actual markup and angle
brackets and whatnot let's just figure
out what the concepts are that we need
to express right first we need to
describe works the things you produce
and second we actually need to describe
the licenses that we have so that you
can answer questions like does this work
have a license that includes the right
for me to use this for commercial
purposes right so I need to describe the
work and the license under which it's
under the work properties are pretty
straightforward right what's the title
what's the license URL who do I give
attribution - what's the name and what's
the URL where does it come from
meaning if this is a derivative of some
other work it would be nice to know what
that other work is and cc+ which I will
let Nathan explain a little later so
that's the work that's how you describe
the work you have and you should
probably at this point think wow I can
come up with a lot of other fields I'd
like to add to
work this is kind of constrained and if
you think that then you're right and
that's why we picked a framework and
work with a framework that allows you to
add as many other fields as you want and
still have all of our tools function
correctly
now the licenses there's a whole bunch
of ways that we can describe them we
describe the things they permit the so
they allow you to redistribute content
the requirements they make of you you
have to display the license under which
it's it's distributed and the things
they prohibit you to do for example if
you have a non-commercial license you
can't do this for commercial purposes we
what's the attribution URL doing here
huh typos nevermind okay there's no
attribution URL the jurisdiction that's
really important if you're in the u.s.
you may not have seen this but we have
extended this to how many jurisdictions
now like 45 45 jurisdictions lots of
different legal systems the same license
has to be ported in to all these
jurisdictions a day when it's deprecated
we have versioned all the licenses so
3.0 is the latest version we have and of
course a pointer to the detailed legal
code because that's what actually
applies right that's the law that
actually applies okay and I know some of
this there's a little bit you know it's
a little bit tedious but what I want to
make sure of is that if you have any
questions you raise your hands right
there should be enough time I've until
10:30 right there should be enough time
to convert for questions so don't
hesitate you might have more questions
in about two slides but so great we have
all these abstract concepts how do we
express them in HTML what are the design
principles we should have for expressing
them in HTML well the first design
principle is the idea of visual
correspondence and I'll explain that in
a second but at a high level it means
that what you see on the screen
corresponds to what the machine is
telling you what what the program is
reading so what you see with the human
C's corresponds to what the machine sees
don't repeat yourself if you have one
link for the human and one link for the
machine chance
are you're gonna make a mistake so
ideally you express the link once remix
friendliness this is something where
when we started people didn't quite
understand this as much but now that we
live in a world where it's web widgets
and widget dis and widget that everybody
understands what that means right
whatever we do better be compatible with
the idea of grabbing chunks of HTML from
various sources and putting them
together in an iGoogle and normai Yahoo
or whatever you want to do right
extensibility and modularity well that's
you know big words to say you should be
able to add your fields right you should
not be constrained to the types of works
we envisioned today in 2008 for
licensing to licensed under Creative
Commons if you have additional ways to
describe your work that should be doable
so let's dig into that the technology
that we're using is called RDF a which
is RDF in attributes in HTML attributes
that's what the a stands for if you
don't know much about RDF or if you've
heard scary things about RDF how many
people have heard scary things about RDF
come on admit it
sorry well you can't be that old then
how many people don't know anything
about RDF ok great
so we more or less than and and and the
other bit so everybody else everybody
else loves already half is that what
you're saying yeah ok great uh RDF means
resource description framework which is
again three big words that you can
forget right away you don't need to know
what those I'm gonna give you the primer
you need to ideally describe RDF if you
haven't heard of it and sooth you if
you've been scared before the idea is
that there's so much data on the web
here's a webpage of a guy I work with
Yvonne Herrmann he's become our mascot
for these slides so he appears in every
talk and on his web page there's a lot
of data but your web browser doesn't
know anything about that data and your
address book doesn't know anything about
the fact that there's a phone number and
an email address and a mailing address
and all of this stuff up there there's
data here you just can't get at it with
parsing it yourself here's Craigslist
right there's a lot of data here but if
I want to make a nice little spreadsheet
of all the Craigslist items that know
the apartments in the area that I can
afford I can't do that all right
there's no I mean I can do that but I
have to do it all manually but there's
data here and they know the structure on
their end and if they could express it
in some way then maybe it could be a lot
more useful to me there's data here in
Flickr right there's the license there's
the camera there's the settings on which
you took the photo there's all sorts of
information and interesting data in this
case it's a little bit better because
some of it's actually embedded in the
image in the exif data but a lot of it
is not the tags are there but again if I
want to copy this to my iPhoto or
whatever Picasa and have all that
information come along you have to write
some kind of custom tool to do that but
the data is there if only we could get
at it and here's the program for this
today there's data there and I don't
think there was an iCal link but in any
case if you wanted to add this to your
calendar it would have been really nice
if you could right click or drag and
drop or something the data is there and
you can't get at it right so you have a
whole bunch of people working on this
thing called the data web or some people
call it the Semantic Web but I like to
call the data web there's a whole bunch
of people working on the human web which
is the web that everybody knows and
loves and what we're doing is we have
this chasm where you have on one side a
document that is for humans and a
document on the other hand a document
that is for machines and those two
documents are maintained separately
they're distributed separately there are
two different document types they're
usually read by two different tools
that's wrong
it's not going to work it's not going to
work because what we need is we need to
go from a browser that looks at a page
and sees this I see a headline I see a
sub headline I see italics I see text
and I see four links but actually what I
want the browser to understand is that
there's a title there there's an author
there there's a publication date there
there's a abstract there
there's three tags on a copyright
license I want the browser to understand
that and if I can get the browser to
understand that I'm a good deal of the
way towards actually having machines be
that much more useful so there's a gap
and we want to close that gap and that's
what the RDF a technology is about RDF a
just so you know has been work in
progress at the w3c over the last four
years we are in the last throes I hate
to use that phrase in the last throes of
getting it through to recommendation
it's something that Creative Commons is
worked on but a lot of other folks have
worked on it too because it's for more
than just Creative Commons so let's get
back to those principles really make
them precise visual correspondence means
what it means that if you have an
article here at I think this is nature
proceedings Nature has just published a
an online journal where you can publish
preliminary results right away and it's
under a Creative Commons license visual
correspondence means that if I have the
title there and I can point to it I know
that's the title right there and if I
have a listing of five different items
on the page when I'm pointing to the
first item I am able to extract the data
for that item so there is a way to map
what I see to the corresponding machine
data that's really critical if you want
to actually do things with that data so
here's a life sciences blog where you
have a lot of proteins and genes that
get mentioned at random times right
wouldn't it be great if the author could
markup that string it says gcn4 it's a
protein and say this is a protein and
this is the URI that describes that
protein so that if you have a browser
that's properly augmented you can get
contextual information right away right
click and find out all the papers you
have read that have something to do with
that protein and for that you need the
visual correspondence of being able to
point to something on the screen and get
at the data for it
okay that's visual correspondence point
to the screen get the data for it don't
repeat yourself a lot easier to describe
if we have a link to a Creative Commons
license the attribution license and we
change that link to the attribution
non-commercial license so that when
humans click on that link they go to a
different license we want the machine
readers to follow that's it don't repeat
yourself you change it once it changes
it for both humans and machine readers
any questions so far got visual
correspondence oops
visual correspondence and don't repeat
yourself
yeah who's sleeping oh that's the wrong
question who's not sleeping okay good
remix friendliness this is really
important to Creative Commons if you've
used our site which I'm guessing most of
you have you go pick a license and you
get a chunk of HTML and then you copy
and paste that chunk of HTML into your I
don't know my space maybe right or
wherever you paste it so whatever we do
has to be part of that chunk of HTML and
it has to be self-contained because
there's no way we're not going to be
able to have a second file that you put
on your site we're not going to be able
to modify the header of your HTML page
we're not going to be able to do any of
these things we need it to be such that
you grab that chunk of HTML you paste it
into your site and you get don't repeat
yourself visual correspondence and
everything in that chunk of HTML here's
another reason why you need that right I
google widgets if you control just a
widget a part of the page you need to be
able to carry all of the information all
of the metadata you want to carry with
you along in that widget so there you
have it the four principles right the oh
no sorry that's three principles there's
one more extensibility and modularity
this is something that's a little bit
more subtle but very very interesting
here's part of my Flickr stream if I
express as much data as possible on this
page if there's the title the photo the
license the date it was taken etc then
extensibility and modularity means that
you can have different applications
looking at different slices of that data
and still functioning correctly without
me having to target each application so
I express the data once all the data
fields once and I get a newsreader that
can pick up just the titles and the
dates of my photos because that's all it
cares about a news reader just cares
about titles and dates right and a link
ideally a link to the photo but those
two fields with the same data not by
targeting a different application with
the same data you could have a digital
photo frame that's looking just for
photos right and you can have an asset
management program that's looking for
everything I want to suck in all the
data the license the photo that
everything so I know all the digital
assets that I have I express the data
once and I get these overlapping
applications that can function in sort
of this loosely coupled way I don't have
to target each application individually
I just express my data in a fine-grained
way and then the applications pick and
choose the fields they want does that
make sense yes no all right I should
shut off the internet for three seconds
that would be like what yes it makes
sense yes what does it mean for Creative
Commons for Creative Commons it means
that if you're at Flickr we can have an
application yes cute dog everybody look
out for cute dog on the page yes now
you're paying attention it means that if
I have an application that looks for
Creative Commons license stuff I can
have an image and I noticed that's a
Creative Commons license item I can have
a song at magnitude and I don't have to
know about songs ahead of time I can
still say AHA that's another Creative
Commons license item because I get this
modularity and extensibility where they
can add fields about audio they can add
fields about video they can add field
about whatever I can still pick up the
Creative Commons license fields and make
partial sense of what's going on whether
it's a video at blip that's licensed
under Creative Commons license again we
don't have to foresee all of these
things the technology allows us to
express the fields individually and pick
out the ones we want
all right let's start looking at some
angle brackets I gave you all the
principles we need to see how this works
the web is very bland all the links you
have are plain links if I link somewhere
you don't know if that link means that
you know this is a license for the site
or it's my friend Nathan or it's
somebody I hate or it's my favorite 17th
century author you don't know what that
link means so let's add some flavor to
the link let's give it flavor right this
is what the HTML looks like to start
with and this is how we give it flavor
we just label that link we say the
relationship expressed by that link is a
licensed relationship we can do that
because license is a reserved word in
HTML and rel is an existing attribute
that lets us express how we what that
link actually means so we already do
this right if you get the HTML from our
site you already get rel equals license
and those characters in red are the only
things we added so that's a lot less
verbose than that
crud you saw earlier right and also if
you change the clickable link then of
course you're changing the machine
readable link and for a machine to parse
this it's fairly straightforward you go
down and you see a ha rel equals license
that expresses a licensed relationship
between the current document and the
target document now I understand this is
a copyright license it's not a 17th
century author so we like to represent
that as an graph right some kind of
diagram with these two nodes that are
basically the URLs my blog or in this
case alice's blog the Creative Commons
license and an arrow between them so far
you're thinking yeah I can crack that
diagram no problem they're gonna get a
little more complicated but we've got to
start easy right so far so good
so now we know how to add flavor to
links but what if we have text right
this is the blogpost that Alice has and
has a title and has a an author so let's
add some flavor to that again I don't
know what this is this
be you know the abstract or it could be
the title or could be the author name I
don't know so let's add the following
markup we use the property attribute you
don't have to remember all of it the
paper describes it in great detail but
the property attribute is for marking up
text whereas the rel attribute was for
marking up links now who's confused
right now
who is there something on this slide
that's confusing yes
who said that great thank you why DC I
said rel equals license why don't I just
say DC you know property equals title
property equals creator where what the
heck is this you know is this like DC
Comics like what is DC right so it turns
out that license is a reserved word in
HTML but there are no such reserved
words for title and creator we could
start to come up with a whole bunch of
reserved words but at the end of the day
this idea of having a central definition
of every possible concept in the world
may not be so scalable right we the web
does not run on one computer and so
maybe we should have concept definitions
by various different communities in
various different groups and of course
there's another question when you say
title what do you mean do you mean the
title of a work do you mean a job title
do you mean something related to real
estate what version of the word title do
you mean so I like I said license is a
reserved word title is not so let's
import this concept from somewhere right
somebody must have defined the concept
of the title of a work turns out it was
not DC Comics it was Dublin core and
Dublin core is DC so let's import DC the
DC vocabulary is located at this URL
we're on the web so everything is on the
web even vocabularies and it defines a
whole bunch of concepts like title
creator etc etc so let's import that
vocabulary here's how we do it okay hold
on there we go
this is the ugliest markup you're gonna
see xmlns : DC it means xml namespace DC
equals that URL what that means is in
that div in the HTML
whenever you see DC : we mean the
concept defined by dublin core good so
now that we've imported the vocabulary
and now that we've added property equals
DC title dc:creator this is what it
looks like that's still maybe this is
still better this is what it looks like
fantastic we've expressed the title and
creator and this is what the graph looks
like what's important to realize the
only thing you need to remember about
this graph this diagram is that the
arrows are still labeled with the full
URLs in this world of rdf what i'm
giving you here is a very quick RDF
primer without saying the word too often
every label is a URL and the reason why
every label is a URL is because it's a
nice way to go discover more information
about it if I go get that URL the one
that represents the title concept I get
a whole bunch of additional machine
readable data that tells me what the
label is in a nice human readable way
this is the title of a work that tells
me what kind of nodes that expect at the
start and end of the arrow this is a
document and this is a person no in this
case this is a piece of text for the
Creator it's a person and all sorts of
other things so if we define concepts by
grounding them in the web where every
concept the title the Creator the
license etc is a URL we get this nice
distributed system for defining
vocabularies for defining concepts that
we can reuse that we can reuse
granularly one field at a time and that
we can dis you know autodiscover
basically any questions yes
we don't have a tool for showing the
graph we do have tools that lets you
show a description of the graph so then
it would be just a visualization project
but I can I can actually well why don't
I just do that right right actually hold
on yeah let me do that right now live I
will here's a little bookmarklet we have
called get and three and three is the
notation three it's a way of writing
graphs as like representing all the
arrows subject-predicate
object and then if you go to my webpage
which has some rdfa in it and you click
get in three and you get a little
warning that says I need to you know
boom you extract all the triples from my
page live so if you'd had a little bit
of visualization you could render that
as an as a graph but you know it's just
a resource constraint is that does that
make sense what I just did by the way I
literally went to my site click that
bookmark which which is JavaScript which
went through my page extracted all this
rdfa and just gave it to you it's
describing you're not seeing it very
well here but it's describing the arrows
where does it start what's the label on
it where does it end each one is a
triple right three three values so
benedita hashmi has as homepage been
dotted eat it up net as name benedita
here's my email address etc etc etc
right yes sorry
well this can be interpreted by a
machine right I can get this into my
address book I can get this in if
there's information about the projects
I'm working on people can find common
interests automatically you know you can
get your browser to flash a pop-up and
says Oh Ben's interested in cryptography
just like you are you know things like
that and all whatever whatever your
heart desires really yeah
right that's a very good point yes
absolutely the question is since we're
talking about the creative commons
context is this drm is this digital
rights management that we're talking
about now so thanks for the softball by
the way both of you over there oh okay
so at Creative Commons we've always said
that we express rights we don't enforce
them right and in fact we are very
careful to say that if you were to use
Creative Commons works in a DRM setting
you would have to be very careful to
support all the rights granted to you
under copyright like fair use etc the
point is here we're just expressing
rights and what we're expecting is an
environment and ecosystem where you're
informed of your rights not where you're
blocked if you try to do something
because frankly we I don't I'll speak
with myself I don't believe the machine
will be able to know exactly what your
rights actually are so you can you're
notified of your your rights you're
notified of the things you can do of
what you should do to give credit and
then it's your responsibility to do the
right thing what's the follow up
you know I could I could list a few
ideas I have about this but I actually
have taken there's gonna sound like a
cop-out but it's true I've taken a sort
of a principled stance of saying I'm not
gonna tell you what I think this is
gonna yield because the whole point of
this technology is that it can yield
whatever you want it to yield you want
to add extra fields you want to have a
different way to interpret those fields
go for it right and I don't want to
limit in any way the design of this
technology with whatever I I envision
for the future so like I said partially
a cop-out but it's really not up to me
right yeah
yeah that's right and so the quite that
the point was you can start to query the
data in interesting ways given this RDF
technology and that's absolutely true
what's what's important to realize is
that this builds on top of years and
years of very interesting work by
different folks at the w3c some of which
will take years to realize some of which
will never be realized and some of which
I think is not within reach and in
particular the point was about querying
data so let's say you've browsed a whole
bunch of pages and your browser has
picked up all of this data as you go
along which is really not that hard to
do because it's right there it can be
parsed it can be indexed etc then you
can start to ask questions and say out
of all the articles I've read who are
the authors of the blog posts written
last year who has share interests with
me you can ask questions like that about
the data you've seen and that's pretty
exciting
any other questions yeah
I didn't hear it what
yeah absolutely in fact we do that's
what the that's what happens on our
website and if you actually enter extra
information like who to give credit
there's a little extra link on the site
where you can say I want to enter my
name and how to link to me etc it puts
all that in the chunk of HTML and all
you have to do is copy and paste it that
was one of the important design
requirements for the technology that we
be able to have that chunk of HTML be
entirely self-contained because if we're
telling people well paste this and then
download this file and make sure it's in
the same directory and also make sure
you configure Apache what you can figure
what right so that's that's an important
point and absolutely we have those tools
and we hope to make more I hope other
folks for other vocabularies will make
more so you know the fofo Cabul arey
which was for defining people and
friends friend of a friend both it would
be nice if we had a little generator
where you could list your friends etc
and boom get a chunk of HTML you put on
your page and there you go you have your
your social network on your web page and
you don't have to re-enter it 20
different times for you know Facebook
plus plus or whatever any other
questions all right a little bit more
and I think we're actually running on
time which is kind of shocking a few
more things just to let you know because
some questions might start coming up in
your mind and say well what if I have
multiple blog posts on a page which
happens all the time right if I have
title and creator twice on the page what
does that apply to well rdfa has a
solution for that too and that is we use
an extra attribute called about that
says whatever is inside this div is
about this particular piece of content
so you don't have to remember all of
this but just to let you know you can
have different items on a page and you
can describe different items is that
clear
yeah all right and this is what it looks
like right you have two different items
each with a title and a creator it's
good when you if you end up writing rdfa
to think about this diagram approach to
the data because it's there is an
abstract representation here that your
serializing as HTML so sometimes it's
good to have that diagram in your mind
what if you have a blog post and inside
that blog post you have an image you
know here's Alice say if you've been
following the story line err because
there is a story line behind the blog
post titles and Alice says the trouble
with Bob and the trouble with Bob is
that he takes much better photos than I
do
and here's a photo he took of a
beautiful sunset it would be nice if I
could label that photo and say this is
the title of the photo it's not the
title of my blogpost it's the title of
the photo so I can add another about
over here and at this point I don't know
if I can you see that there's this about
here on this on this div and then
there's this about here on the outer div
and so what this means is that the top
level about applies for these fields at
the top and then on this inner div this
about takes over and applies for all the
fields inside it so because we were
trying to make this as HTML friendly as
possible and only using attributes
you're able to basically use the
structure of your HTML to define new
items you want to describe and that's
what it looks like as a nice diagram
actually I don't have the really
complicated diagrams I I cut them out
since I didn't have too much time but
it's important to note that you can go
deeper than just one layer there are
ways of saying I work at an company
named you know Creative Commons and
Creative Commons is located at this
address which has this street number and
this zip code so you can go very deep in
the graph using RDF a I just didn't want
to try to squeeze that into 45 minutes
all right
so what's the conclusion if you've been
thinking about the fact that there's a
human web you know the web that has
billions and billions of web pages and
that's not going away anytime soon and
the fact that we're trying to build a
data web you come to the conclusion
pretty quickly that it's only going to
work if we bridge them somehow in fact
if we grow the data web out of the
existing web there's an important
concept here in RDF a which can you know
slip under the radar if you're going to
build the data web in a web friendly way
then you have to let
anybody create a vocabulary you have to
let people mix and match vocabularies
concepts write the title from dublin
core the the homepage from foaf the
license from Creative Commons and
potentially other fields you come up
with I didn't have time to show you
these examples of mix and match but you
should be able to do that you should be
able to pull in fields from whoever
wants to define them and that's
distributed extensibility that's the
data web in an actual web friendly
manner right you can find out more about
our DFA at RDF a dot info and at the
wiki it's a there's also a mailing list
that you can find from there if you want
to join and find out more about it and
you can find out more about CCL and how
it uses our DFA and a lot more details
about this at our website that's
actually I wrote cc org but obviously
you have to write Creative Commons org
slash projects /cc rel and if you have
any questions we have a wiki for the
tech summit and I actually have five
minutes to take any additional questions
shocking yeah
yeah
outside of the way of your saying so the
question is if I have a wave file which
doesn't give me any opportunity to embed
any metadata in it how do I say anything
about it how do i express a license one
way to do it is using that about
attribute that I showed you earlier over
here I use the about attribute on a
photo on a JPEG you could put your wave
file in there and say this wave file
which has title whatever and I'm the guy
that I created is licensed under this
license that would be that would work it
would be a little bit weak in the sense
that if that wave file ever gets
distributed in a peer-to-peer fashion or
in a way that's not rooted in your
webpage anymore
it's hard to find that information again
so that's a very good point that the the
place where rdfa and microformats
intersect is rail equals license and on
certain of the design principles there's
a lot of commonality there and then
there are some differences if you put
rel equals license and you have an about
attribute in our DFA that's going to be
interpreted as you're talking about the
wav file because you have that about
attribute if you don't use the about
attribute meaning you're not using our
DFA then it is exactly the same thing as
the micro format basically so if you
start using our DFA attributes you're
using our DFA basically but what I
wanted to point out is there's another
section in the CC rail paper which I
strongly recommend you take a look at
for more strongly binding together these
media files with their descriptions I
won't describe it here it would take a
15 minutes but it's really interesting
and you should check it out yes right
that's a very good point out so whenever
you use text in age using the property
attribute and you you know if you go I
mean just if you use if you do this
basically the RDF a will inherit the
language defined in your in whatever
your HTML file is so if you say US
English in your HTML file we'll carry
that through to the actual machine
readable version if you want to express
multiple version you absolutely can do
that with xml:lang that says the
language now is French right and then
we'll pick that up too yeah
any other questions no I have hold on
let me try one more thing
cute puppy any other questions yes it
worked
right so there's a there's a worry
that's often expressed that oh my god my
page is gonna be huge and oh I'm sorry
the question is there's a lot of extra
characters there for the semantic markup
and what's the effort involved in doing
that and I'm guessing you're worried
about the actual file size to is or not
really about adoption right you you want
to answer that for me yeah go for it oh
yeah I work on the Drupal project and as
a core developer and one of the things
that we're doing to put push forward
these technologies is we're taking the
content management systems that people
are already using on the web and we're
integrating these kind of markup tools
into the output that these systems are
making so if you right now have
something that is a location module on
your site that just allows you to put in
an address we're converting that over to
be a location module that is actually
marking up the address with the
additional semantic markup technology so
as long as you're continuing to move
forward with newer technologies for your
actual content management then a lot of
this is going to transparently be added
to the content that you produce and I
think that's that's great to have Drupal
folks saying that and I take that as an
rdfa endorsement right let's talk yeah
your your platform neutral I understand
the point being that there's there's a
lot of tools that are going to help you
do that and what we wanted to do in the
design is let allow two different things
first of all make it easy for people who
use HTML templates and things like
Drupal and other systems to mark up the
template once and then of course have it
work so there's no separate file there's
no separate delivery mechanism if you're
ever delivering HTML it's trivial to
deliver rdfa on top of that and then
second there's this sort of a wizard
like approach where you go through the
Creative Commons wizard you get a chunk
of HTML that you can paste into the
footer of your blog or something and
we're hoping that other folks who you
know have a chunk of HTML to paste in
your site like YouTube and other folks
who do that will also carry some
metadata along with it
since they can write they can just add a
little bit of markup and do it
the answer is humans can mark this up it
is an effort I expect that most of the
RDF a markup will be machine generated
with human input basically yes
yeah yeah I think I I think that means
I've gotten that question every time
I've talked about our DFA so that's
great
the question is sorry this seems ripe
for spam yes absolutely you can use any
technology that makes it machine
readable for spam the advantage that we
have with our DFA is that we encourage
people strongly to use what's already
human visible as part of the machine
readable data so the spam techniques
you're using to detect existing visual
spam can also be used to detect this
stuff and if not if you're using our DFA
there are ways to use our DFA and that
so that's not visible to the user like
when you want to override a pretty fide
date to be a machine readable date for
example then I it's actually trivial for
Google or anybody else to say huh this
looks very spammy because the persons
have has a lot of embedded data that's
not visible to the user it's a lot
easier to detect than a 1-point div one
point size text one point font which a
lot of spammers use for example yeah
okay okay okay totally different
question yeah yeah so the question is it
sounds like I can claim that I own Larry
Lessig's blog or you know I can make all
sorts of claims especially I'm guessing
using the about attribute right so I say
lesson lessons blog is you know its
title is crappy blog right I could say
that on my page anybody could say that
on their page and I think you have to
trust the provenance of that information
in the same way that you trust the
provenance of any information on the web
so who's making that statement well Ben
is making that statement well he doesn't
know anything you know why would I trust
any statement made on his page so it's
important to realize that just because
it's machine readable doesn't mean it's
solved anything about reputation or or
you know quality of source you still
have to use other heuristics to decide
whether you trust that information or
not that's right so it would not be
surprising to me if as a start any site
that makes statements about other sites
would just get ignored basically you
only get to make statements about things
on your domain that's probably what
would happen yeah oh yeah
so I don't share your your principled
stand against imagining the future so
let me offer mine this is why I'm Jamie
Boyle I'm from Creative Commons I deal a
lot with teachers and teachers are have
a bipolar attitude towards copyright law
half the time they completely ignore it
and the other half of the time they
believe that they can't do anything but
everything they're doing is forbidden
but they're basically there's nothing in
between you know it's completely the
distribution is all at the end and there
are now wonderful open educational
resources sites like oer commons stuff
that ccclearn is is working on a lot of
great stuff around the world
imagine the teacher who doesn't want to
have to try and understand what he or
she is allowed to do who just says show
me all the pictures of this particular
nebula or this particular this
particular starfish that i can use and
that i can print out and give to the
entire California School District right
and that person wants to be able to do
that but they don't even want to look at
a Creative Commons license which already
we've tried to make easy they just want
that to be just automatic so it's like
can I do this will my tools just tell me
this as I do it will it just fill in
everything and the thing is this is what
people don't realize Google relies
Google's existence relies on a set of
default rules that make it presumptively
okay for Google to go through and read
web pages and say this is what the web
page says the presumption could be the
other way then Google would be
impossible right yeah there is a legal
substrate to all of the tech that we use
all the time so the the hope for this is
this is stamped 2.0 in that legal
substrate imagine what we could build if
you never had to think about the law
when you were doing sharing just give me
the stuff I can use show it to me right
so it seems to me that that's I think
it's science it's maybe even more
exciting than that but for education it
seems like that's one of the key things
I know we're about to talk about that in
the next session but I just wanted to
flag that it's not just the puppy that
should make you excited that puppy is
cute though and now that thanks thanks
Jaime is I'm over the time so if you
have any questions catch me at lunch or
anything else and email and thanks
everyone
thanks Ben
so now we have a panel of some people
from CC who are going to talk about some
current technology initiatives we're
doing across the organization and sort
of set the stage for stuff we're doing
and mic links fair our vice-president is
going to moderate that panel I'm I'm
moderating the panel primarily because
nathan is speaking he's the CTO but
we're gonna have three three speakers
about current developments we kind of
have three divisions right now Creative
Commons which does the infrastructure
and cultural stuff science Commons was
started in 2005 I think and then CC
learn which is our new division and
they're all doing interesting tech
projects so let's start off with Nathan
as Ben mentioned the question was
brought up during the last session about
how a layperson could generate CC rail
or RDF a metadata to put into their
document and Ben mentioned the expanded
information that you can add when you
select a CC license at
creativecommons.org and I think which is
about a month ago now we turned on this
used to be all hidden under a you know
provide more information disclosure you
could add and now we're actually showing
it by default and we're really trying to
encourage people to add this information
so you can add the title of your work
how you want to be attributed and where
people can go or to find out more about
more permissions for your work for
something reclines CC plus if you
actually add this information to your
HTML or add it here in the HTML and you
add it to your page when you click
through the page the deed will be
annotated to give you some more
information so this is an example for
magnitude and maybe I'll show a live
demo here in a second an tempt fate but
basically this
this portion here with the plus sign was
all added based on the metadata that
magnitude embeds in their pages you
can't really see it I'm here which will
I'll do a demo but they also include the
attribution information on their page so
we actually provides a copy and paste
attribution information now that reads
how they want to be attributed and gives
you a really easy way to include the
license link and the link back to work
when you want to reuse say a song or
something like that the other thing I
wanted to talk about well let me do a
demo of that first so if I go to
magnitude comm or any this is just what
I happen to know has all their stuff
marked up with CC rel and I go and look
at a particular album say Artemus and
stay at the license link here when you
click through this our servers actually
go back and look at the refer and check
and see what sort of metadata is on that
page so when the deed comes up okay I'm
gonna go back and talk about the other
things since we're on a schedule here
and I'll come back and look at this in a
moment so the other thing I wanted so
much better okay thanks epiphany so you
can see here the attribution information
from that page was scraped and added to
the deed and if I want to attribute that
work I've got some HTML here that
includes the reuse information right
there
yes Ashish what is your question that's
a great question the question was did
magnitude modify their link to license
and the answer is no it's a normal link
it does say relic was license like been
described but they also includes other
metadata so we're actually going back
and looking to see where you came from
and what metadata isn't that page oh yes
okay so the question is if it if it
includes metadata about multiple
documents or multiple objects such as
maybe an image or something else how do
you know which one to show here so we
apply a couple of different filters to
this first of all we look and see which
ones are under this particular license
we're linked to and if there's more than
one of those we've just chosen the
default is that's going to be the
referring page if if there's more than
one and neither of them none of them are
the referring page we don't show this at
all so we tried to kind of err on the
side of concern more conservative side
about giving this advice okay let me
open back up my slides okay so the other
thing I wanted to talk about a little
bit was the CC Learn education search
project that we're working on right now
a few years ago we ran a prototype
search engine at
search.creativecommons.org to
demonstrate how you could look at what
was then our recommendation for metadata
to search just for CC licensed works
this is before Yahoo first and then
Google added CC search to their sites so
it's just it was never intended to be a
full production search engine or
something you'd use every day it was a
prototype that we put together and we're
repeating that experiment now with
education and we and this time we're
using the CC rel metadata to augment
this full-text search using nudge so
this lets us do things you can't
currently do well this theoretical ends
do things that you couldn't currently do
with say Google or Yahoo CC search which
is say show me these images that are of
a particular subject and that I can
reuse in a particular way and we're
doing this in this in the CC with CC
learn and open educational resources
because it provides us with a nice
limited domain to kind of start and
scope our crawl and also there's a lot
of organizations out there
both as far as university OCW sites and
organizations like oh we are Commons and
other groups that are making a lot of
effort to annotate stuff already so we
have a really rich set of metadata to
work with this is sort of a little
diagram of how we're doing this where we
have
we have sources of whether there Adam
RSS or oai-pmh they come in and we
aggregate them and throw everything in a
triple store and then when we do our
crawl we get our URLs to crawl from that
triple store and when we index it we
also reindex that metadata in Lucene so
that we have fast access to it and then
when we do this nut search we actually
can provide this sort of user interface
where you can filter by tag or by
license do I see a question okay
so this is a project it's currently
we're currently still working on it and
we're doing some initial crawl work and
some initial work you know this is an
example of a MIT stuff we haven't coming
in from chemistry well actually I just
heard from chem for chemistry last night
and there's obviously a lot of holes on
it still but we are able to do the
license search we're able to search for
particular types of objects as well so
we hope to have this is a wider testing
soon are there any questions I guess
will we go on do the other ones and then
do questions okay so with that I will
turn it over to Ashish well right we're
done
John sorry about that so um I can and
and have talked for an hour or longer
about what we're doing with technology
at science Commons so I'm gonna serve
race through a couple of the larger
initiatives that we've got but the main
goal of science Commons was to take on
this task of how do you make the web
work for science the way that it works
for culture and for commerce which is
that we sort of take for granted that
Google gives us accurate answers to
questions about culture and commerce and
that we can use Amazon and other vendors
to acquire physical things using the
network and neither of those things are
actually very true for science I'm not
gonna do any demos but I have links on
the pages that you can click through and
look at them while I'm talking rather
than we try to do this so the if you
think about sort of the CC symbology and
iconography what do these things mean in
science because they mean different
things to scientists than they
necessarily mean in the cultural space
so this is an example of a science
database this is a chemistry database it
has structures and chemical formulae are
these things creative works or not there
are different
is of opinion to put it mildly about how
these things need to be licensed and so
we've been working to develop a some
lowest common denominator legal options
and be to look at the implications of
using things like share alike in that
world we currently recommend a public
domain approach under these new cc0 tool
in which you essentially say that in the
context of science at least if you want
the interoperability of two databases
then licensing these things like
software or culture is the one of the
worst things you can do because if you
think the Wikipedia GFDL cc-by share
alike is difficult wait till you look at
25 to a thousand molecular biology
databases with different terms of use
and given that your Google query itself
is a data product it is unquestionably
difficult to start attaching Terms of
Use
to these databases so this is the first
place that we started looking in this
space at least technically for database
integration and it was driven by in many
cases the search result itself being a
derivative work or a data product the
second thing that we did was build on
the existing CC infrastructure but not
for digital things this is Creative
Commons for DNA products cells bacterial
vectors even transgenic mice so you can
go to this address and actually generate
a Creative Commons style agreement which
is to say human readable lawyer readable
machine readable but the goal of this
was to actually enable e-commerce for
biological materials so that we can
identify them when they're sitting in a
refrigerator in a laboratory or at a bio
Bank which is sort of like a greenhouse
for these tools and you get all of these
great benefits and in many cases for
example CC host turns out to be a great
idea because the same thing that lets
you track derivative works and family
tree genealogy of copyrighted materials
is actually really useful in tracking
derivative works of biological materials
which are just as important so this is a
place where both in CC 0 and at the
Creative Commons licensing methodology
we've been able to take that underlying
rights expression language automated
generation and metadata and reuse that
in the science space the bulk of what
I'm going to talk about comes from this
this
of making the web work at the data level
and so this is a something we put
together where we put some images from
the Allen Brain atlas into Google Maps
you would be shocked how hard it was to
do this first we had to break the rules
of the database involved which did not
want to allow any data downloads of
their images second we had to scrape the
web pages where they showed the images
because it was designed for single query
individual user access not machining and
then we had to transform the data by
reverse engineering it into an RDF
compatible format so that we could
actually put all this stuff together
until this was done you actually
couldn't look at two images side-by-side
from this 100 million dollar science
project and annotate them
collaboratively so this is how it's much
easier to share information about what
hotels were staying in then the
scientific information we're looking at
and it sort of propagates this is you
know as classic science query in Google
which is show me signal transduction
genes and pyramidal neurons think about
this as give me putative drug targets
for Alzheimer's disease because of the
information formats that are that are
sitting at the in which the science
information sits and the legal barriers
to transformation your answer is read
one hundred and eighty nine thousand
papers and what you really want is a
list of genes that MIT that meet that
requirement and so a lot of what we do
is database reformatting integration and
a lot of the best practices that are
required to avoid having to go back and
do the database formatting and
integration and we do all this in a way
that sort of it natively links to
Creative Commons metadata whether that's
on copyrighted objects databases or
biological materials and now the reason
you would do this and so and been
referred to rdfa this is a higher order
of Semantic Web stuff called sparkle and
this actually lets you write that query
and this is hideously ugly and the
reason I'm showing it to you is that a
it traverses four databases this is what
we want Google to do instead of us is to
actually have enough information about
the databases and a comprehensible in a
format that you can actually traverse
four of them but that the ideas that the
users can now start to transform these
things into clickable HTTP links which
means that the second person runs
query from this interface instead of
from the query interface and just like
when I got started writing HTML in 1994
I wrote copies of other people's web
pages where I just changed the things
inside the tags that operates now at the
query level because no one really wants
to look at the data in RDF or RDF a
really the important thing is the query
and what we can do is begin to grow a
powerful corpus of these links and this
is again getting at making the user
driven web something that works in
science the way it works in culture and
commerce and there's a legal barrier as
well as a technical barrier because if
we don't have the right to transform
these databases into these formats all
of these queries are illegal data
products that violate what's going on
even if we open up an endpoint and let
someone at Pfizer click on that query it
may well be illegal if someone somewhere
put a non-commercial license on a
database so the law and the technology
are converging here in a way that makes
things really hard to do and last you
know all of this depends on some sort of
structure technically it depends on
unique names it depends on ontology Xand
taxonomy and this is gonna be very
important as the RDF a web and the
linked open data web come online is sort
of who controls these namespaces this is
a coffee ontology which I like because
it's a lot more comprehensible than the
science ones and you sort of see how
stupid the computers are because you
have to tell them that drinking coffee
makes you feel away again makes you feel
jittery and that there are these things
called people that might want to be
awake but not to feel jittery but there
are really important rights associated
technically with this stuff if you want
to do something interesting with an
ontology you have to have a right to
make reference to it imagine if it were
if it were a licensing transaction to
refer to someone's URL right that's what
licensing ontology creates because
there's got to be a URL behind that idea
of feeling jittery if a computer is
going to understand it and we have an
open domain name system what we don't
have is an open domain name system for
science and for semantics it's scattered
all over the place and and no one really
is worrying about persistence on it but
you have to rev a right to refer to
these things you have to have a right to
use the names you need to be able to
refer to the piece of the ontology that
you care about
I might like a piece of your ontology
about coffee but I might hate cream so I
want to throw away that part of it I
need to have the right to copy the piece
that I want to use I need the right to
make extensions to it I need to say you
didn't get detailed enough about coffee
I'm a coffee dork I want to add classes
that talk about fair trade and
shade-grown if you don't have that right
technically this whole web of data
starts to break and last you need to be
able to understand the right of
integrity which is I would like to have
a web in which I'm able to give you the
right to add classes about shade-grown
coffee but I don't want you to add
shade-grown coffee to my ontology and
then label it as the same one I put on
the web and that's a very important
right of integrity so I've put up you
know my own name one of my Google
gangers is actually my cousin John
Wilbanks and Texas he's a flash
developer we'd like to have different
personal ontology x' and then there's
the will blanks family in South Carolina
we need to be able to distinguish
technically between these things and we
need to be able to legally distinguish
between who's allowed to do what and all
of this now ties back into things like
ctrl and rdfa because as the web gets
more machine readable whether it's from
the top down Semantic Web stuff I have
been showing or the bottom up Semantic
Web stuff that Ben's showing or
microformats
or tags because it's gonna come from
everywhere if we don't get the law right
fundamentally in the in the basis of
this it's going to be prevented from
coming together this was not a problem
on the web because people weren't paying
attention so it was okay to do
everything openly but people are
definitely paying attention to this now
and there are companies that are trying
to get into this and lock it up but none
of those network effects from the
technology are going to come together if
we don't get the law right at the very
beginning with that I'll stop you can
click on the nura Commons org site if
you're a semantic web nerd and you want
to see our URI recommendations you can
run all of the things I showed you on
your computer they're not demos they're
live and you can find sort of the
classic marketing level discussion of
this at science Commons org Thanks
hi so I don't have any slides so y'all
can enjoy the no signal but what I'm
gonna talk about is a product I've been
working on that started out as an intern
project last summer call lib license
it's really a product for software
developers how many of you are software
developers in the room how many of you
use software built by other software
developers ok so there's probably some
interest and how many of you use media
files like mp3 or JPEG for safe sound in
photos okay great so um I presume that
then you all know that mp3 and JPEG of
formats on the machine for sound and
photos and they also store some
information about this sound photo like
in a sound file the title their band who
performed that track and some more
details like the date in a JPEG the
camera the shutter speed that that photo
was taken with and the time sometimes
but you can also store we've worked with
bunch of metadata standards
organizations and sometimes it turned
our selves to create standards for
adding license information and
standardized author information and
other metadata that relates to what you
saw the magnitude page so that magnet
tune demoed that Nathan did involves
taking going to magnet tune by page for
an album going and then clicking on a
link to look at the license but that
relies on thee that relies on being
online it relies on this looking at the
web it would be nice if we could do the
same sort of extraction just out of the
mp3 file itself so that's what the
metadata standards we have do they let
you store the metadata for the license
inside the mp3 or the JPEG or the PDF
they let you say here's where you go to
buy more permissions if you want to say
buy the rights to use it without
attribution and we've had published
these on the wiki for ages and there
they have a very slight amount of usage
let's say one of the problems is that
each of the formats has its own
different standard for encoding this
information which is a totally boring
technical point that makes off
developers go too
sleep you think even soft developers go
to sleep when you want them to cooperate
and so you want that you want that if
you're using a photo viewing program if
your photo contains the license it can
show you a button that says this is the
license if it says if the photo says
this is where you have to go to buy more
permissions it could say that in the
software but to support it in an mp3
file and the JPEG and in a photoshop
file heading to PDF and so on there's
piles of standards so last summer we
began to write with intern than I'm Bob
polishing up now this library call
libbed license that if you're a software
developer lets you just ask I don't care
what type of file this is would someone
play with this library that I wrote
please tell me what the license is of
that document you know a PDF jpg mp3
will you tell me if you can
who is who I'm supposed to attribute if
I use it and that's that's just sort of
to smooth over this landscape so
hopefully we can get some more soft
developers using it it's under an
open-source license that allows it to be
used in commercial products in
proprietary closed source commercial
products as well as open source products
and we we also have bindings for the
Python language and the sample program
it comes with that lets you just inspect
a file on the command line on a Mac or
Windows or Linux and type in licensed
space the file name and they'll tell you
what it knows about that file just like
a 93 tag program for mp3s might say I
know the title and the artist and the
year so that's what live license is for
and even if so hopefully we want to get
more software offers using it so that
you know they can they can know about it
and the rest of you can not know about
it and just benefit from it yeah
creation pools that are using live
license today uh well I'm gonna be
demoing it some integration of it at
OSCON which is an open-source conference
in Portland there's I don't think well
so Inkscape has long had support for
Creative Commons licensing but in its
own way actually not using live license
and it's sort of modeled upon their the
way the integrated I guess as far as
viewing content I'm gonna be demoing
having it added to the file browser
which I actually demoed that at the
genome summit in November of last year
and I'll be demoing a photo viewing
program that if you open a JPEG or a
Photoshop file or whatever it'll show
the license information and it doesn't
care and that's the whole point to make
it easier for them so that program is
called I've genome Nautilus is the file
manager and there's another tool rhythm
box is a music player we're targeting
also and that's using the Python
language bindings
um and that that'll be demoing in a
month or two I guess that's that's a
very good point though that we need
integration both that the production and
consumption yeah programs I just want to
give a quick plug for another technology
that we use it has nothing to do with
licensing but has everything to do with
semantics and every single one of these
projects or all of the cc's divisions
user is called semantic MediaWiki and
you owe it to yourself to check that out
actively looking at how to how do you
stick semantic MediaWiki on top of a big
triple store that you derive for a bunch
of databases cuz that's the human
interface to edit this stuff so
do we I guess we have like one minute
for another question if anybody has any
this is the this is the last panel
that's really Creative Commons exclusive
Oh
so the question was if lib license can
be used to add metadata to a file that
lacks it in addition to reading the
metadata out of a file and the answer is
yes to the extent that the file format
can support whatever metadata you want
to add you can add it
it also supports setting a default
across your setting a default preference
so that you just say license it's the
way I usually license things and it'll
figure out what file type you're
modifying look up your preference and
then store that so we have a 15-minute
break now and then we're going to have a
panel on digital asset management on the
web and the desktop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
