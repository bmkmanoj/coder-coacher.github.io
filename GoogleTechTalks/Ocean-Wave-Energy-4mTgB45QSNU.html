today we are privileged to have some
visitors from Scotland who are
representing company called ocean power
delivery and they have a very exciting
technology that promises to extract
useable energy from ocean waves and
they're going to tell us about it today
and our talker will be max carcass from
ocean power delivery so take it away man
all right thank you Thank You Jamie so
yeah I'm delight oops sorry is that okay
that delighted to be here and tell you a
little bit about ourselves company a
little bit about what we're doing here
in terms of the the wave energy resource
and what the sort of practical
considerations and economic
considerations are with with this kind
of technology this isn't quite web two
point oh this is possibly energy to
point Oh looking at new renewable energy
options and what or maybe the sources of
energy into the future so this strange
long red thing is is our product it's
called the pelamis wave energy converter
and it's used for converting electricity
used for converting wave energy into
electricity you may wonder why it's
called pelamis it's pelamis is the name
of a surface swimming sea snake and when
you see it how it operates I think
you'll probably find the name is quite
apt so moving on I've tell you a little
bit about ourselves as a company first
of all just so you've got a picture of
who we are we started in 1998 so a good
good while ago actually and we've grown
steadily since then we currently over 70
employees and really covering all the
disciplines that are required to deliver
this as a technology are very heavily
focused on engineering the engineering
disciplines covered things like
mechanical engineering structural
engineering control systems electrical
engineering hydrodynamics mathematical
modeling naval architecture offshore
engineering and increasingly we've been
expanding our production side as we're
moving from being a technology developer
through to being
a manufacturer and so on the production
team we've got now 24 people and very
much a focus on bringing this technology
through into manufacturing the just a
drawer a couple of names their own
experience and Stephen Harrison our
production manager he he formerly was
with with General Motors with sovereign
Sweden and obviously brings a lot of
that experience really the challenge in
renewables is to make things as we said
in Britain as cheap as chips you've got
to really get the cost down and the only
way you can do that is through is
through volume and I think the
automotive industry is a very good
example of that and so it's great to
have him on board and help drive that
forward so to to move on again to give
you kind of a flavor of what we're doing
as a company and before we get into the
resource and how our technology works
and if you look at the electricity
sector that are generally companies that
make generators and then there are
companies that develop projects and
there are companies that then own and
operate those projects so if you think
of wind turbines there are companies
that make wind turbines companies that
go out and find sites and go through the
permitting process for those sites and
companies that then we'll go in and own
and operate those projects we see
ourselves very much in this box here
which is to basically deliver the
technology to to assemble machines
install them and provide operations and
maintenance services for those projects
and we don't really see ourselves as
project developers or owning wave
projects a lot of people think oh you're
into wave energy you're about supplying
wave energy electricity to the consumer
and in fact that's that's there are
plenty of people who do that kind of
thing so our objective is to sell
machines to energy companies to
utilities and and it's really the best
use of our capital I'll come on to that
in a moment but we're with venture
capital funded and that that money is
very expensive and so we're trying to
deploy it where we can best deploy it
which is which is on the technology and
really by focusing on these aspects by
being at the heart of the assembly and
commissioning process it means that we
can ensure the quality and performance
of the product a lot of people say when
you just license this technology
but it's not really a technology which
lends itself to licensing certainly at
this stage in the process we've got to
work very closely with suppliers to
bring them along with us and
particularly get to drive down costs as
we go forward it also allows us to
secure and expand the intellectual
property as things are going forward we
think it's a very scalable business
model as well so how we've been funded
this time we've we're not yet profitable
we've been going for eight years which I
think's quite an achievement in itself
how well we've managed to secure a range
of investors over this time which you
can see up here ranging from more
industrial investors like General
Electric and norske dro the Norwegian
oil and gas company to two more purely
financial investors like 3i and
sustainable asset management which is a
Swiss Green Fund very much focused on on
green technology investment so we've had
some government support through this
time we've had about 5 million dollars
UK government support for some of the
technology development program that
we've been doing but on the back of that
we've managed to bring in about 50
million dollars of private sector
contracts and an investment and that's
how we've managed to fund where we are
today but I have to say it's not always
been a smooth path sometimes it's been a
little bit close to the edge so the
starting point to this really I guess if
you look at energy policy there are
three legs to energy policy and these
are the kind of three legs and this is a
UK perspective but it really applies to
to any any country's energy policy
clearly they're increasingly so the
environmental challenges in terms of
mitigating the effects of climate change
we had a quite a milestone report the
other week in the UK a report called the
the stern report which sounds
appropriately Stern and in fact it was
appropriate stone and it really
highlighted the potential cost impact of
climate change going forward in the
future and how taking measures paying
for things now to mitigate those costs
is actually just a very sensible
economic decision let alone err
a very sensible moral decision and
environmental decision so and clearly
that's one of the key drivers behind the
development of renewables also there's
the security of supply aspects one of
the nice things about renewables that's
that you're looking at an indigenous
energy resource and that is local and
not subject to to vagaries of distance
and different political systems in the
UK again just to give you a UK
perspective we've had a big move here
from coal-fired generation to combined
cycle gas generation in really quite a
short period of time and that's allowed
us to meet our Kyoto targets because
gas-fired generation produces a lot less
co2 them than coal but this dash for gas
that we've had is is a little bit of a
shame because we've just become a net
importer of gas we've been an exporter
for quite some time we've just become a
net energy importer and importer of oil
and an importer of gas and by 2020 it's
reckoned that will be importing eighty
percent of our gas needs in the UK and
that has to come from further and
further afield and in fact the whole of
Europe is looking to import more energy
and the question is where does it come
from certainly Norway still has a
reasonable amount of gas but a lot of it
comes from very long pipelines from from
Russia and the Middle East and then the
other aspect is socio-economic and
clearly conventional generation has
hidden costs in terms of the impact not
only climate change but also things like
acid gases what you see in this context
is renewables becoming increasingly
competitive things like wind turbines
and indeed the potential industrial
economic potential in building the new
industries of the future in terms of
jobs and exports that that can that that
can secure I think one of the nice
things with renewables is you've got
absolute price certainty going into the
future you've got no no uncertainty
about what your future fuel costs are
because the fuel is inherently free the
thing that drives the price of
renewables projects is really the
capital costs in the first place so it's
against that context that that that
we're moving forward and here's another
little statistic here there in the EU
there's a requirement to invest 1.1
trillion
dollars in the electricity sector over
the next 30 years may need to replace
existing generation capacity it's quite
quite a big figure now in this context
and I think what's a very big success
stories been wind power today there's
something like 58 gigawatts installed of
wind power that's 58 thousand megawatts
and it's been one of the fastest growing
sectors in the electricity generating
industry and countries like Denmark
which were the first to really
commercialize the technology I guess in
a sustained manner have a fair number of
people employed in the manufacturer wind
turbine similarly here in California in
fact in tehachapi there's a reasonable
production facility there wind turbines
and in line with this growth in the
market the costs of generation fallen by
about 80% as the technology has been in
refined developed production eyes and
again you know you only have to wind
back you know a few years ago and you
know wind turbines were seen as very
much sort of brown sandals and rice kind
of approach very nice rice here by the
way right but but you know it there now
the big boys involved you know the
people like the Siemens the GES of the
world who are involved in this market
and so if winter is such a great success
story why would you want to bother with
something like like wave energy well
first of all it's a huge energy resource
that at the moment is almost completely
untapped if you look at this this this
picture here what this is showing here
is energy densities in kilowatts per
meter now to it for just for comparative
purposes if you take a square meter on
the ground of solar energy you've
possibly got about a hundred watts per
square meter of solar energy if you take
a square meter window bisected by a wind
turbine blade you've got perhaps a
thousand watts of energy available in
that square meter but off the coasts of
of Europe and North America you've got
energy densities ranging from say 20 to
70 thousand watts per meter width of
wave energy and so it's a very
concentrated and
form of renewable energy and really what
happens is what wave energy is and
shouldn't be confused with tidal energy
wave energy is is created by ultimately
created by the Sun and it's the transfer
of energy to the Sun that creates the
wind and it's the transfer of wind
across the oceans is that time average
transfer of energy to the sea that
creates waves so basically wave energy
is stored concentrated wind energy and
some numbers here that you know quite
interesting to look at this if you take
the the world resource and then
constrain that down to the technical
technically an economically recoverable
resource in other words applying a
variety of constraints to that the world
energy council have estimated that the
potential world market for wave energy
will be something like 2000 terawatt
hours per year which is broadly exactly
equivalent to the existing nuclear or a
hydroelectric contribution to the world
electricity will these things there's
never a magic bullet that solves
everyone's problems but certainly the
potential threat is to displace an awful
lot of co2 emissions if that market was
developed that would be broadly
equivalent to the current emissions from
the the u.s. electricity generating
sector if you take California is another
example again taking the total resource
and then constraining it down to what
might be practically acceptable these
kind of figures here have been looked at
which could provide something like
twenty twenty-five percent of demand and
you'll see that the resource is really
concentrated in the northern latitudes
and the southern latitudes and and
indeed that's that's where a lot of the
industrial applications are for this
there's another zoom into the the u.s.
wave energy rules this is produced by a
pre the electrical power research
institute in palo alto have looked at
the sort of total u.s. resource and and
the opportunities that that exist there
another nice thing with wave energy is
that it's also very for castable energy
resource and a with one of the
difficulties with maybe not less so here
in california
where the Sun seems to always shine but
one of the difficulties with with solar
energy and with wind Energy's that
conditions can change quite quickly and
be quite difficult to predict with wave
energy because it's this time average
transfer of energy to the sea waves
change very slowly so what you're seeing
here is a forecast hero a five-day
forecast this is actually from a website
called Lola which is a surfing web site
and they've got very good graphics
actually which it's nice to use which
shows the the wave height here and the
period the the the time between wave
crests and it's the two together that
give you the energy in the wave it's the
wave height squared multiplied by the
period and what you can see his the
waves develop out in the mid ocean and
they take your cycling through here at a
number of days which actually can't
really see here but it's cycling here
through through five days here and you
can see that it takes a number of days
for those waves to reach the coast so
you can actually measure wave height
with satellites there's a NASA I've got
very satellites that can measure wave
height and there's a whole network of
wave breweries around the coastline that
store historical data for wave height
and period and so but as I said one of
the nice things is that the resource
actually changes very slowly we've done
some work with BC Hydro in Canada
looking at how the resource changes on
on a sort of three hour early period and
if you did what's called persistence
tracking if you said in the next three
hours we just produce what we've just
produced in the last three hours in
other words no forecasting at all you
find you within about five or ten
percent so with a bit of gradient
tracking a bit of forecasting you can
probably hit it on the nail and this is
important for electricity grids
electricity grids want to know what
they're going to be producing in the
next hour what they're going to be
producing the next 24 hours but beyond
that you know what are going to be
producing in in sort of three years time
is of less interest in the sort of daily
management of the grid so what we're
looking at is offshore wave energy and
if you look at wave energy concepts
there are a variety of different
concepts there are some that a shoreline
based and some that are offshore and
what we mean by offshore is is getting
sufficiently offshore in order to
capture most of the energy
or the highest amount of energy that
that's available then if you look at
this graph here you can see water depth
fear this is water depth here along the
x-axis against wave power and what
happens is the waves travel for many
thousands of kilometers across the ocean
without losing any energy but when you
get to about half a wavelength depth
that's where the wave which consists of
a series of orbiting particles and
starts to touch the bottom of the sea
bed and that's where you start to
progressively lose wave energy so the
best point to be is round about here at
around about the 60 70 80 meter depth
contour we are machine sits on the
surface there to capture most of the
energy if you if you're on the shoreline
you've lost a lot of your wave energy
now those of you that are surfers will
know that waves tend to pile up as they
come into the coast but you've actually
although the wave height gets larger
they're actually becoming compressed so
you're actually losing any and at losing
any losing energy the other thing is is
that it's also quite a destructive
environment on the coastline if you look
at the picture on the top there you get
these crashing breakers on the shoreline
which are not very pleasant and whereas
you go a bit further out to sea and you
have a more more benign swell I think
you can you can say so just to reiterate
the waves that we're looking at the
deeps well waves so you're looking at
wavelengths of typically 100 120 meters
between wave crests and time periods
between those wave crests of anywhere
from eight to 18 seconds that sort of
thing and that deep square wave really
is the same all the way is very similar
all the way up the coast so a project
like this doesn't need to be in front
front of a prime surfing location the
symmetry that produces good surfing
waves is totally different to what you
need in terms of good wave energy
conditions and to give you a context of
how far you need to go out to get to
that depth the picture here of the UK
shows where the 50-meter contour is it's
this orange to green area and generally
speaking on the western facing coast
you're looking at distances off the
coast to get to that depth contour of
anywhere from 2 to 20 kilometers and
here in California the kind of locations
that one would look at are generally
speaking of that order sort of five five
to ten kilometers off the coast
one of the nice things with that I guess
is that it means that you have a minimal
visual impact if you're standing on the
beach looking out to sea and there's any
appreciable swell it's actually very
difficult to see our project I'll come
on today on to the technology in a
moment but it you'll see that the
machine actually has quite a low
freeboard in the water and again these
are things that always have to be looked
at in a power project but we think we've
really got a minimal environmental
impact of course we're biased but we
really think that the technology has
potential to be one of the least impact
technologies and in in generation we've
got no greases or fluids in direct
contact with the seawater soro very
unlike a ship with its prop shaft in the
water and we've got no rapidly moving
equipment or machinery that might upset
things but that's not to say that you
shouldn't go through the due process to
make sure that any particular site that
you're looking at doesn't have any
particular features that would be of
concern and that's something that we're
very focused on as an environmentally
aware company one of the questions that
a sorry we can say not 60 70 meters here
yes the question was is there any reason
why we couldn't go to deeper water and
the answer is no and the the quest the
reason you don't really is because the
the extra costs of submarine cable isn't
really getting you extra benefit but
there are applications whether you might
want to be further out and see and
really all you're doing there is having
a greater mooring length for the machine
and indeed it actually becomes easier to
more in deeper water um and the question
I was asked a lunchtime actually was
that you know this technology has been
around a while I've seen some patterns
from from a long long time ago and you
know so why is it already happened you
know and some some of you may remember
in the UK we we had some wave power
research done in the 70s and some people
say you know why is nothing happened
well I think you know one of the big
changes since then since the 70s and
equally since the 1700s is that the the
offshore oil and gas sector somewhat
ironically perhaps
has gone out and developed a lot of the
basic technology building blocks that
just didn't exist back then and what our
focus has been is to been to try and
utilize that technology whether it be
wet maple connectors electricity cables
your connectors you can connect
underwater or whether it be the mooring
dynamics or operational experience and
really utilize that technology and apply
it in this in this different area of
wave energy so really this the
conclusion of the study I'm quoting here
really said that there were no major
issues that couldn't be addressed the
technology transfer from other sectors
so finally on to the the concept in the
machine the machine is actually an
articulated cylinder which you can see
here in profile on the site and also a
top view here from the top what happens
is the machine is more at its nose and
it's self orientates into the direction
of the oncoming waves so a bit like a
flag on a flagpole or a ship a tanker
waves then travel down the length of the
machine and in doing so each section
articulates both up and down and also
side to side that movement is resisted
by hydraulic rams which pump
high-pressure hydraulic fluid through
smoothing accumulators which evens out
there are the lumpy input energy into a
nice smooth flow of hydraulic fluid that
turns a hydraulic motor and generator
and the nice thing about all the
component technology is that it's all
pretty much off-the-shelf technology
which has been tried and tested in this
kind of environment really the concept
is what's quite different and to
anything that's gone before in wave
energy but the actual component things
what you want to avoid as an engineer is
to have prototypes within prototypes
within prototypes and really kind of you
know stick on one thing at a time and so
the machine consists of four long
sections that you can see here and
separated by three smaller sections
three what we call power modules which
I'll show you in a moment so too and the
complete machine is is 140 meters in
length three and a half meters diameter
so about the size of four train
carriages with a rated power of 750
kilowatts which would be similar to a
wind turbine a modern wind turbine of
maybe six or seven years ago and we
provide sufficient electricity for about
five hundred households now the idea
with this is that you
quiet multiple machines in in what would
be called a wave farm so similar to a
wind farm where you've got multiple
machines connecting together and sharing
a common cable back to shore but what we
have in the machine these power modules
here this is this is one of these power
modules so just going back to the the
previous slide there are three of three
of these here within the machine I
connected together electrically but what
we've got is as I said we've got this
movement that's occurring we've got two
hinge joints one that's a substantially
vertical direction and one that's in a
substantially horizontal direction and
that movement is resisted by these
hydraulic rams here so there are
effectively let just like big pumps the
ripped like like a mobile power pack
that we used on a crane but we're kind
of using it in reverse with some funky
bits and pieces in there as well but and
you can see the hydraulic motor there
these are the smoothing accumulators
which are kind of like a pressure vessel
it's a bit like if you imagine pumping
water up a hill to a tank what we're
doing is restoring sufficient energy in
the machine to even out the wave to wave
variations so we can produce good
quality high power good quality power
into the grid and this to access thing
is an important feature of the machine
how we control the response of the
machine to maximize energy capture in
particularly in smaller waves in the
summer so I'll move on to that in a
moment but the key thing for a wave
energy converter above everything else
is to be survivable and again in the
past people have perhaps approach this
from the wrong direction some people
have looked at how to be the most
mathematically efficient to capture a
meter width of wave energy and actually
that's not the most important thing the
most important thing is to be survivable
and in fact what directly follows from
that is the economics because that's the
other most important thing is to have
the best cents per kilowatt hour and
that's really the reason the machine
looks the way it does this kind of
strange long snake-like object by
pointing into the waves it gives us
excellent loadshedding capability in
extreme waves but what we're trying to
be is very be very closely coupled to
the forces that are there most of the
time the buoyancy forces the hydrostatic
forces buoyancy
wait but be almost invisible to the very
large hydrodynamic forces the dragon
slam loads that occur in extreme waves
what you can see here is the machine in
different sort of see states here and as
you can see in the larger sea States
what happens it's a it's a physical
property of the Machine rather than it
being a sort of add-on system to do this
is that the machine just cannot continue
to go up the wave it starts to go
through the wave and locally submerge
and re-emerge through those wave crests
and so what we call this is a
hydrostatic clipping where the power of
the machine the energy absorbed by the
machine that the movement of the machine
is limited by the wave height and again
this is similar to wind turbines where
you feather the blades in high wind
speeds because it's not worth capturing
that energy only occurs for a
statistically small amount of time and
if you if you were absorbing that energy
then you'd need to throw lots of steel
and concrete of the machine to make it
be able to cope with that and of course
that has a negative impact on on the
capital cost you've been Yuri then
throwing lots of money at things so if
your concept is inherently survivable
then that directly translates through
into the economics and so being too
short to react against extreme storm
waves is sort of key to this now I can
probably show you some some video that
perhaps explains this or gives you a
slightly better feel for it you can see
that this is a some tests here in a wave
tank here of one of our prototypes and
the nice thing and wave energies you can
get very good repeatability from a wave
tank to full-scale if you imagine this
machine being three and a half meters
diameter these are some quite big waves
and what you could see in the top here
is the output of our numerical model
we've got what we believe to be the most
sophisticated numerical model that's
ever been developed for for wave energy
many many lines of code going into that
and this is the graphical front end
which is of course great for things like
this because showing your reams of data
is perhaps not so not so interesting but
you can see this this the machine how it
basically goes through the waves and how
it reacts against itself the machine is
not yanking against the morning it's not
using the mooring as a source of
reference the mooring really keep still
on station so the machine will pull back
in big swells will then recover in
in as those as the swirls swells pass
see what you can see that bit sort of
sticking down there is what we call the
mooring yoke and this is the bit that
attaches the mechanical and electrical
connections to the machine this is a
another sort of frontwards look at look
at the machine here and i should say the
numerical model here is and this
actually getting the same data as was
fed to the wave makers here in the tanks
here and so you can see there's a pretty
good repeatability between the model
here and the wave tank test data is as I
say it's a model that we're very proud
of because it allows us or so of course
to model lots of different things for
the future in terms of increasing energy
capture and and sort of novel designs
going forward as you can see it's a kind
of it is a pretty biological type of
movement so I think that the name
pelamis is is is quite apt and again you
can sort of see it getting through those
waves there so in terms of power cap
jury and you remember that I showed that
the power module has both a vertical and
a horizontal component and now what we
can do because waves are harmonic in
nature they have a periodicity and you
say that to an engineer you start to
think about resonance it's actually
quite different to most other energy
sources in fact I don't think there
really is harmonics in the kind of
delivery of most other forms of energy
and so what we can do is we can tune the
machine to to the predominant wave
condition if you look at a typical see
switch state it may be characterized but
by a period between wave crests of a
sort of 10 seconds see with a
significant wave height of 3 meters
within over time over several hours that
may change to being a 12-second sea
state and what we can do is we can
change the natural frequency of the
machine to be to be tuned to that and
the way we do that is we can restrain
the Rams in different directions if we
if we restrain in in the vertical
direction we produce much more of a side
to side movement of the machine and in
fact this is why the hinges aren't at at
sort of perfect angle angles to the to
the to the sea they're actually the sort
of drunk an angle
because if you give things an escape
route then you've got some way for
things to go if i push down on this pen
here on the table it's got nowhere to go
but as soon as I give it an escape route
it'll shoot off to one side so what we
do in the summer is that we can control
the system when the waves are small to
produce much more of a side-to-side
movement and therefore capture a lot
more energy than would otherwise be the
case whereas in the winter we have much
more of a vertical movement the other
thing is that this system because it's
this really gets into the theory but if
with all wave energy converters there's
there's something called point absorber
theory which is really at a point you
can capture a width of wave energy and
it may seem so lightly counterintuitive
but you can capture a width which is
naturally much larger than the point
that with with which you're capturing
that energy if you've got a point
absorber a buoy that that can move in
one direction if you go through the
maths the the maximum energy captured
that that point absorber can capture is
something like the wave length divided
by 6 so a wavelength being of the order
of 100 meters or so the theoretical max
emerge catcher capture is that
wavelength / 6 multiplied by the the
kilowatts per meter per meter width in
our case we are a little bit like a
phased array of point absorbers and a
bit like a sort of radar antenna we can
we can tune that so that we can capture
a lot more energy so the theoretical
maximum energy capture of our machine is
actually a wavelength over to and which
essentially the end of the day means we
have a very high power capture per unit
volume per unit weight of the machine
we're nowhere near that that theoretical
maximum at the moment but it's nice to
know that that we are nowhere near it
because obviously there's a lot of room
for improvement moving forward this
gives you a little example here of
resonant response this is there's some
early tests here but as you can see here
the waves are quite small but we're
getting quite a lot of movement on the
machine I'll show you that let's see if
I can show you that again quite used to
the waves are coming to you across here
and they're really quite small but
you're getting a lot of movement there
through the restraint
another example of tuning attuned
response here these are images from the
Carbon Trust website if you get a chance
have a have a look at that website and
this really shows that you know an
energy converter with a this is showing
the sea state here varying this is the
spectral density this is the the wave
spectrum of the sea and its variance
with time and the roylott's trying to
represent something with a fixed tuning
ability obviously is not able to capture
as much energy as something where you
can vary that the tricks to be able to
vary that as quickly as possible with
the sea state and that's really where it
where it gets gets harder to do because
it you know there's a lot of control
that goes into that but potentially
through through improving the software
over time we think we can capture a lot
more energy which gives us a lot of a
lot of confidence in the future so a bit
of about technology development as I
said we've been goin yes we yes that's
right we tune but at the moment it's a
fairly coarse tuning algorithm so you
know the sea States changing very see it
changes slowly but if you are God and
you could see each wave wave by wave
then potentially that's where you want
to get to in the longer run so this is a
bit on the concept development here how
the technology is developed over time
and the nice thing is you can do a lot
of testing in wave tanks we've tested it
at 80th scale at 50th scale at 33rd
scale a twentieth scale and seventh
scale and what you're doing is you're
testing all kinds of different things
you're testing survivability or testing
mooring dynamics you're testing energy
capture and you can get very good
repeatability from wave tanks through to
full scale and what we what we did what
we undertook to do ourselves was to to
fully understand and test each of these
aspects before going to full scale and
again in the past people have tried to
jump too far too fast and you've got to
take these things one step at a time and
we've tried to ensure by doing that so
before we've got to a full-scale machine
there were two or three key steps and
that we we did we built an intermediate
scale prototype which is this one
seventh scale prototype at the top here
and we tested that at sea
in the Firth of Forth outside n bruh
where the waves tend to be about seven
scale as well and that gave us a very
good feedback and confidence in going
forward and to build a prototype because
you can do that at that scale and do
things that modest cost without making
big mistakes but what this this seventh
scale machine which we build in 2001
didn't do because of the scale was
produced electricity because that scale
it's just not worth it you can model the
energy absorbed but it's not worth
putting generators on on that sort of
scale of machine so the other part of it
was to build one of the power modules
that I was talking about earlier on land
and to test that fully on land is much
the same way that you don't test a jet
engine for the first time up in the sky
you want to test it on land first and so
we had a 2 megawatt power connection
coming in here driving a hydraulic power
take-off system that then acted around
this fulcrum here and then our power
take-off system then converting that
mechanical movement back into
electricity not surprisingly there was
far less electricity coming out than was
going in because otherwise we'd really
absolved something but but it would gave
us a very good confidence in the overall
power take-off system and the
efficiencies that we were getting with
the power take-off system the overall
mechanical to electrical efficiency is
of the order of seventy to eighty
percent and I think I've got a little
bit of video of this I'm afraid is a
little bit Strutter II but this is the
typical sort of ram speed that you'd see
in the sea it's not a sort of very rapid
splashy kind of movement it's quite a
slow sort of process remember this is
time periods of 10 seconds between wave
crests so it's a very sort of slow
process to these these are the hydraulic
power packs that go inside the machine
that convert that energy into into
electricity you can sort of see it again
their efficiency yes yes it's some funky
bits in there then the third aspect that
we did before we built a full-scale
prototype was go through a full design
verification and now what this is is
something that's quite common in the
offshore oil and gas sector if you're
developing a new bit of kit you get it
verified and we nobody asked us to do
this but we thought it would be a very
good idea to do it ourselves
to to have the design independently
verified to look at the extreme loads
and fatigue loads over the design life
of the machine these machines have to
last out there 15-20 years and you go
you've got a look at the fatigue and
you've got to look at the extreme loads
and this is what Atkins did to Atkins
who are specialists in an offshore
engineering be involved in a lot of the
structures in the North Sea and this was
an 18-month process where they looked at
all of our design and slightly
frustrating for some of our engineers
because they kept wanting to put more
steel on things and you know quite a
conservative process but ultimately I
think very rewarding because they meant
we fully understood everything that that
applies through that and this is really
taking off shore design codes debt nor
spiritus and american petroleum
institute an offshore design codes and
applying it to this machine because
there are no design codes for wave
energy converters so we're trying to use
as much as possible what exists at the
moment this is it this looks at the
extreme loads so you define a
hundred-year wave condition this is what
you'd normally do in the offshore oil
and gas sector new place factors of
safety to to everything based on that
what's different to this compared to the
offshore oil and gas sector is clearly
we don't have explosive hydrocarbons on
board or or people so it's arguably less
of a requirement to be as as as higher
level of safety but equally because this
is upwards our first machine we wanted
to make sure we're applying the best
possible standards so it meant for
example the steel thickness in the in
the machine is about an inch thick and
to really be kind of belt and braces as
we'd say in Britain and but this again
is part the reason why costs are high
initially and what this has allowed us
to do is secure insurance for the
machine commercial insurance which is
obviously a key part for commercial
development somebody wanted by machines
wants to know that that can be insured
at the end of the day that's the bottom
line if it's insured job done then
they're happy so what we wanted to do is
educate the insurers you've got to get
insurance down a learning curve you know
with a car you have your no claims but I
presume you do in the UK we have that no
claims bonus if you don't crash it each
year your insurance premium goes down
same sort of thing applies here m and
then this is one of the this is this
hundred year wave this is a twenty eight
meter wave and which is the is the sort
of extreme wave condition that was
find at the time for the machine and
this is this is a big wave so I don't
think a wave like that has ever been
recorded at all can you where we we've
tested the prototype but it gives you an
idea of the kind of the process that
we're testing against so he could sort
of summarize up this technology
development is sort of from this to this
but sorry your question I was just I
mean the oceans a very caustic
environment sort of like I don't know
it's I was trying to figure out if it's
like sealed around these joints or
something like that it is yeah with this
new biz note we've got double up triple
seals actually between the inside and
outside of the machine so all of the
equipment inside the modules is
completely dry yea indeed yeah and what
we've applied here is the the sort of
best possible offshore experience you
know there's offshore structures and
ships that have been out there for many
many years so use epoxy poke it paints
to offshore standards and and as I say
to be honest even if you didn't have
pain with inch steel it does actually
last quite a long time even in in a
salty environment and then this is the
full scale machine here kind of jumped a
bit there under test now this machine as
I say it's it's the size of four train
carriages it with its ballast it has
sand in it as ballast about 300 tons of
sand ballast the whole machine weighs
about 700 tons and when you think of
moving that on land it's actually very
difficult but here at sea it gives you a
real impression of the energy that's
there in the waves and that can be
utilized and here's another one at night
time just to get a flavor for it and you
can see it's a very when you know it's
it's quite a benign sort of movement
it's not the sort of rapid thing that
you might imagine that things can
splashing around so I've kind of just
run through these points here I've
talked about survivability and
power capture using available technology
very important having a hydraulic power
take-off system being very well matched
to the resource you know waves are
characterized by very high forces but
relatively low velocities so that kind
of ram speed there is an ideal match for
for hydraulics and that also allows us
to smooth the power because we have
these hydraulic accumulators these
pressure vessels we can store energy in
the machine for several minutes which
evens out the kind of lumpy input energy
to produce smooth energy and good
quality energy and the nice thing from
our point of view is that we've been
able to patent the whole device concept
because there isn't really anything like
this so you can patent the whole device
concept something like a a wind turbine
unfortunately you can't really patent a
fan on a stick you know it's been done
them for a while and an independently
verified not just by Atkins but by a
number of external parties who have been
casting their eyes over over the
technology in terms of the resources i
mentioned it's a very full castable
output with negligible visual impact we
believe minimal the environmental impact
but we're happy to be put under scrutiny
and then two vital points I think we
have no construction on sites so again
in the UK we've got a big program on
offshore wind building wind turbines
offshore and in full marks to that I
hope it's it's very successful but you
know equally I think what's quite
different with our technology the
machines are built off-site we deploy
the mooring system from the back of a
boat when we choose to do that and then
the machines are brought to site so
we're not trying to construct these
machines out at sea and then equally we
don't try and do any maintenance on site
either if you send a guy offshore to go
and tighten up a bolt it'll cost you
maybe 10 times what it will do on land
so we think it's much better to bring
the machine back to shore bit like
bringing a character your car to the
garage rather than try to bring a garage
to the car and the advantage of that is
if you can do that in a fairly short
period we've got a rapid attachment
attachment system it means that
statistically the weather windows when
you can do that a much more frequent if
you need to spend several days or hours
out and see the the time when the
conditions allow you to do that of
statistically far less frequent so
coming to more down to the economics and
how you look at the
technology in terms of the power
production what do you go is the first
thing to do is establish the resource at
a particular location as I mentioned
there are wave buoys off the coast which
which record this data NOAA National
Oceanographic administration and
absolutely whatever it's called has has
data on all of these for lots of
different and I'm sorry I don't know
what the abbreviation sense a little bit
and has data for these sites here in
different locations and more you can see
here this is through the year here the
kind of wave energy increasing and this
is variance between three years here so
you can you can get a feel for the
resource variation across the year now
what you do is you build up what's
called an occurrence table for a
particular site so you look at the the
wave period and the wave height and you
you accumulate that data of the air and
you'd say okay I'm in this box for five
percent of the year when this box for
two percent of the year and what this
particular thing here is is we call our
power matrix so we're saying what power
we would produce in each of these sea
States so if you take the resource data
at the top and multiply it through our
power matrix which is what we believe
will produce and those sea States you
come up with an overall energy
characteristic of the energy that would
be produced by the machine there clearly
it varies because the sum of the waves
are smaller and the winter the waves are
larger and what we're trying to do is
capture the most energy and the most
economic cost and through that a little
bit on markets because I think it is
important to talk about the Markaz you
know we've got a technical challenge
which is to talk it which is to deliver
a technology that works and works
reliably we've also got a commercial
challenge which is to find the right
partners in which to to to work with
develop projects sell machines etc we
also have a political challenge as well
which is to try and bring two feeder
markets for that it can allow this kind
of technology to come forward because
any technology always starts high and it
has to find a route through here through
to deployment what we're trying to do I
was just saying earlier is perhaps what
any business school would tell you not
to do which is to bring out a new
product in what's a commodity market you
know the electricity that comes out of
the socket is just a commodity so it's
not there
really or they haven't been to date
early adopters who will go out and buy
you know wave power electricity because
the electrons are blue or whatever it's
not like buying the latest kind of
mobile phone or so that kind of thing so
you really need government to take a
lead in trying to bring forward these
these technologies if you're going to
get them out into the market I'll come
on to that a bit more but where we're
focused initially is is markets that are
more than 20 kilowatts per meter with
these kind of market and neighbor
measures for wave energy and and really
in particular at the moment that the
focus is on two particular locations
which is the UK and Portugal where these
these measures have been established for
a while but increasingly receipt
starting to see these tech things come
forward in different locations and this
really comes back to what is just
talking about to go about in terms of
cost if you look at all of these
technologies they all have a cost
profile against the deployment into the
market what this is is a log-log graph
here showing cumulative megawatts
installed against cost in terms of I'm
sorry it's in pounds but in pounds per
kilowatt and so this is just looking the
capital cost of a project and how much
it costs to build it in the first place
what you see is that photovoltaics have
seen a tremendous cost reduction since
the early 80s through to the sort of
present day in this this kind of
learning process you see a typically a
reduction in cost of perhaps fifteen to
twenty percent for each doubling in
capacity so as you get to the far right
of the curve you need proportionally
much more capacity to really drive these
costs down I mean these learning
learning curves are very similar to not
just to power production but to mobile
phones or computers or oil field
development you see very similar sort of
cost projection is all about the volume
if you look at wind turbines here
initially a rapid rate of learning and
then kind of flattening off a bit and
towards the right hand side gas turbines
a huge period of development in the
aerospace and and maritime sector before
they could be used for electricity
production and that so it's a slightly
unfair comparison here the first the
first gas turbine was really that the
jet engine in the mish MIT 262 in the
Second World War and it had a mean time
between failure of 21 hours
the average flight tight flight combat
time with seven hours so I guess that
was all right but you know you compare
that today with gas turbines with
meantime failures mean time between
failures of many many thousands of hours
so again I was talking about offshore
wind in the UK we've got a pro got a big
program for offshore wind and in terms
of its deployment is perhaps over here
on the left-hand side of the scale but
in terms of its basis of technology
being onshore wind turbines it's perhaps
more on arguably more on the right which
means that to get the cost down with
something like offshore wind you perhaps
need another 50 gigawatts to really
drive that cost down another fifteen
percent well so what gives us tremendous
hope is that our opening costs are over
here on the left-hand side of the scale
now of course there's no guarantee that
we would follow a similar cost and
projection downwards but I think it's a
very good place to be starting this is
all kind of top-down approach looking at
the technology here and equally we've
done a sort of bottom-up appraisal
looking the individual components and
seeing you know do we have sensible
assumptions and where those component
costs could go in order to drive the
cost down and and we do actually so we
think this has tremendous promise
because of this but the challenge for us
is that the costs are up here at the
moment which is above the cost of wind
for example above the cost of
conventional generation below the cost
of solar and but you know we need to
market in order to to drive that forward
now capital cost is only one aspect the
thing that really counts of course is is
the cents per kilowatt hour and come up
with the cents per kilowatt hour you
need to look not just to the capital
costs but also the cost of finance what
debt and equity go into the project the
length of the project life and what the
cost of operations and maintenance are
and the cost of connection and and lots
of factors that go into it so it's a
little bit more contentious when you
look at cents per kilowatt hour what
what's actually goes into that but again
for comparative purposes this this is
the what's happened with wind tremendous
success story but in the early days in
the 80s the costs were right up here and
those costs have come down over time as
the technology has been refined and
developed and our first project said
coming out kind of over here in terms of
the the project we're doing in Portugal
at the moment is as being able to go
forward and our customer is able to buy
machines because the government set
in tariff of around about 15 pence per
kilowatt hour which allows them to make
a sufficient return on an early project
this is very similar to what's happening
in California at the moment for solar
energy there's a California Solar
Initiative which pays a premium price i
think it's between 39 and fifty cents
per kilowatt hour for the first five
years for a solar installation and that
really allows the technology to be
deployed and hopefully the cost to
continue to come down as that technology
gets out into the market so about the
project so you get a kind of flavor of
RIT this this project we're doing in
Portugal is with the company called NSS
which is they started off in
hydroelectricity about 17 years ago
moved into to wind about about 10 years
ago and they they see wave energy as
being the next sort of opportunity there
a substitute of babcock and brown which
is a leading power company if you look
at it from the portuguese context
there's there's a there's a big wave
energy resource here the portugal
imports a lot of its energy and and
that's um that's a big driver but right
behind behind it I'm not going to spend
too long on here because this is a
little bit more commercial and possibly
less of interest but it's really a
staged approach that we're looking at
here the first stage being a small scale
project but then being able to expand
that up to a larger project just two
ways through some pictures here of
production these are production of the
modules you can see here this is inside
one of the modules these are the tubes
very much like wind turbine towers you
can see some of them fabrication here
painted tubes these machines here being
shipped out to Portugal this is in
Portugal this is where we're doing the
final assembly we see we're using a kind
of rail system here which we then deploy
the machines into the water this is
something called a habitat that we use
for connecting machines up this is one
of the front of the machine that's the
Portuguese Minister for economy and some
machines here ready to go out also
working on some other projects but we
haven't signed contracts for these yet
but we're working with scottish power
here in in the UK and hoping to move
forward with a 5 machine project with
them soon and also with another company
in of the southwest of Cornwall a
company called Yeon but importantly here
in the states at pre has done a lot of
great work in terms of looking at sites
and potential application particularly
here on that on the west coast and we're
very encouraged by that and hopefully
things will move forward and on this on
this front and obviously lots of other
places we've got little toes in the
water and hoping things to develop but
still a long way to go just quickly to
say there are other opportunities for
this technology not just in in
electricity production but potentially
in desalination as well you can use the
direct mechanical pressure to drive a
reverse osmosis system and there are
some other niche applications as well so
really that's a very quick run through I
wanted to just give a time for any
questions if if anybody has any
questions and so thank you
yes mr. curious sort of from the ocean
navigation perspective these things
installed in places that are marked on
navigation maps and have you done any
kind of collision testing yep yeah you
know there's a very good question and
I've just realized I've left out a slide
on that but the machine as you can see
here this machine here off Orkney there
are actually four cardinal markers that
called cardinal buoys that delineate the
perimeter of the project and the same
happens in portugal and this is you
basically is as normal kind of practice
for a marine hazard at sea and whether
it be a submerged rock or reef or oil
platform or offshore wind farm and the
sites delineated by four cardinal
markers these have navigational lights
and radar reflectors on it it gets
marked on charts as any other marine
hazard would do and in notices to
mariners so quite often there's an
impression that ships kind of blindly go
across the sea without really knowing
where they are but they have to know
where they are because quite often it's
foggy out and see it's night time at sea
they've got to know they're not going
over a rock same thing applies here the
key thing for us is to be where we
should be so that's not to say that an
instant might not happen at some point
in the future you know we have car
crashes but we still drive but I think
that the key point is that anything the
risk is significant and clearly you
wouldn't site a project like this in a
key shipping lane there's plenty of four
locations where you can find a
reasonable place for it to be located
yeah yes the the mooring is a compliant
mooring system you have this yoke
extending downwards and then we have 38
chains that come off that and are
anchored with mooring blocks and anchors
into the seabed so it's quite a small
footprint on the seabed the anchor
blocks are sort of you know this kind of
size I mean they're big but you know not
that big as it were yes she
all of the world's electricity needs how
many machines would it be required a lot
and I don't think it would be practical
to supply all the world's electricity
with with wave power I mean this is the
thing in energy there is no magic
bullets you need a range of options but
that market potential and that I
illustrated I think would be equivalent
to something like I think it's about
twenty percent so you know it is it is a
large energy option and that could be
utilized and what would that be in terms
of machines it would be depending on the
size of the machines which you know we
have a certain rating at the moment
books intend to increase that over time
I guess it would be something like six
hundred thousand machines yes particular
reason there's four signals yes there is
particular reason and its really an
economic cost optimization we we
originally as you might have seen with
the kind of yellow model that we've
looked at machines with more joints and
we look to them less and you kind of
optimize it to what makes most sense at
the moment but it may well be in the
future that we have more joins yes
and that's a question about how much
routine maintenance is necessary and
that's an interesting an area that we're
continuing to develop the machine is
inherently got a lot of fault tolerance
because we have multiple generating
units each with double motor generator
sets if one of the generators stops
working it doesn't necessarily mean we
have to pull the machine back means
we've lost maybe a sixth of our capacity
but it's not necessary to perhaps dive
in there straight away because you're
only getting full output in the full
sort of see condition we have a strategy
that's both reactive and preventative in
terms of maintenance and depending on
you know the machines are fully
monitored we have fiber optic
connections to it and radar and wireless
links so we can fully monitor everything
and categorize whether things need
immediate action or whether there's
something that can can wait over time
but it's it's something that I mean if
we knew what the least reliable
component was we'd make it more reliable
but we have to get more experience to to
establish that and improves over time as
well yes it's going well and we we've
been testing a new kind of mooring
deployment system which allows us to use
very modest vessels and for that kind of
work and so as soon as we get that
mooring system in then the the project
will be will be up and running yes you
know how much power
waves the ocean affecting the climate
and
the question was do we know how much
energy could be taken from the oceans
before it affected the climate and
currents do they um we've done some
studies and others have actually
independently done Studies on terms of
wave energy abstraction and a project
like ours out to sea obviously we are
capturing some of the energy but if you
imagine an island out at sea an island
absorbs one hundred percent of the
energy that hits it or reflected and
absorbs it now if that island is a
kilometer off the coast and it's a
kilometer wide you're not going to have
any waves there on the shore but if
you've got that Island you know maybe
ten kilometers out to sea waves reform
and refract around it and you still get
waves that the shore maybe slightly
diminished in our case we're not like an
island we're not absorbing 100 then the
energy that goes through a project or
wave farm we're absorbing about ten
percent of the energy that goes through
it and the impact of that on the shore
with the typical distance the regatta is
actually pretty small whether there are
any wider impacts with with much larger
deployment I couldn't really say I mean
that's something that that would have to
be looked at but I can't immediately
think of as long as you take you know a
reasonable proportion and not you know
you're not absorbing 100s in the energy
that's passing through an area I am I
don't think it would make a huge impact
I think the other thing is is that when
you look at storm conditions our machine
as I was saying earlier it isn't
designed to absorb that energy so some
people say these would be great prevent
coastal erosion in our case it wouldn't
wouldn't apply because all of the energy
in those extreme waves passes straight
through to the coast so you're still
getting a lot of the sedimentation
change and erosion in those kind of
conditions because we're not absorbing
the energy okay I think there's one more
lest yes yes perhaps I did mention them
we've got three part with the question
was what do we do to power before it
goes into the grid we've got three power
modules in the machine they each
generated 690 volts three phase and then
we have a transformer in the nose which
steps the voltage up to a higher voltage
for transmission to shore to minimize
losses in the case of the Portuguese
machines that's a 6.6 kV so we've got a
transformer stepping that voltage up
powers fed down through a number
local multiple machines share a common
static cable back to shore that then
would feed into a substation which will
then may again step the voltage up to
feed into the transmission network okay
well I guess that's it thank you very
much
