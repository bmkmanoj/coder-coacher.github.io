angstrom and it's a great pleasure to
introduce Amy Jo Kim on this special
functional and fun edition of google
techtalks amy joe-- is CEO of shuffle
brain she's an internationally known
expert in online community architectures
her company shuffle brain build smart
games for social networks
starting with Facebook and she's helped
design social games in social
architecture for a vast number of
companies online companies that
everybody knows like electronic cards
digital chocolate Viacom even even Yahoo
in 2000 she wrote a book called
community building on the web that some
of you might know it's been translated
to six languages so far seven so it's a
great pleasure on behalf of Google to
welcome Amy Joachim
thank you so much for inviting me to be
here it's a pleasure to see you and I'm
looking forward to sharing some of what
I've learned in the work I've done and
learning from you as well the
interactive portion will happen a little
later in the talk so just to mention I
chose this shot from YouTube for my
cover because this is a great example of
something I never would have found
without game mechanics this particular
video is called pool meets dominoes and
we're Domino's and Rube Goldberg machine
freaks in our house we build them we
love them and I found this because of
the game mechanics on YouTube and I'll
be going into that in a little while and
I and I'm very happy to have found this
video and many others so briefly that's
a little bit about me my PhD is in
behavioral neuroscience which is part of
why I'm doing brain games because I'm
not very familiar with how that stuff
works but I also have a background in
science and engineering and I'm
basically a social architect I do that
for games and for social media at
shuffle brain I'm working with Scott Kim
some of you may know Scott he's a well
known puzzle designer he's the puzzle
columnist for Discover Magazine and he's
done a lot of puzzle games on mobile on
the web and also physical toys and we're
collaborating on the projects I'll be
telling you about later today some of
whom we work with we work with a lot of
companies my latest game that shipped
was rock band I was the social architect
on that that was very fun but also did
work applying game mechanics to eBay z--
infrastructure and those kinds of jobs
so I've been at the intersection of
games and social media for a long time
so I wanted to define a few terms since
a lot of these words gets thrown around
and mean different things
first of all social media what is that
you know you can define it in a lot of
different ways here's how I define it
three key things one player created
content now I use the word player
instead of user because I do games but
also I find that if you use the word
player yourself when you're designing
something it puts you in a different
mindset
try that sometime in your documents and
in your conversations just call the
people that use your software players
and see what happens so player created
content stuff that's created by the the
people that are using the system key
feature of social media social
infrastructure content sharing networks
chat systems social objects and Jerry's
terminology social infrastructure is a
key aspect of being able to share the
the artifacts that you create and the
third is tools that make it easy for you
to share if you can't get your video
posted if you can't get your photo up
there and tagged you don't really have
the means to share so those are key
elements of anything that you can call
social media what about games what's a
game well the formal definition is a
system where players engage in an
artificial conflict defined by rules
with a quantifiable outcome that's from
an excellent book called rules of play
that if you're interested in this stuff
I'd suggest picking up you can get it on
Amazon well that that describes a lot of
games that describes chess to some
extent it certainly describes rock band
and its predecessors and many other
games but there's a whole lot of games
that don't fall under that definition
the Sims does not fall under that
definition for instance biggest selling
PC franchise of all time and eBay really
doesn't fall under that I mean yet I
would argue that eBay is in many ways a
game so I have an informal definition
that I use that's broader that I find
useful when I'm thinking about what a
game might be in today's internet which
is a structured experience that has
rules and goals that's fun and a lot
more things fall under that category and
that's really what I'm going to be
talking about today
why are games so powerful why is
everybody all of a sudden there in the
last couple of years so interested in
game mechanics well games basically are
incredibly good at manipulating behavior
they get into our primal response
patterns this is a chart from my old
days in behavioral psychology that's
what my undergrad degree was in how many
of you know what reinforcement schedules
are
yeah so you probably recognize this
chart long story short the most powerful
way to manipulate behavior is to do a
variable reinforcement schedule where
you get either small or large outcomes
without being able to predict what
action is going to cause that and
there's many other reinforcement
schedules as well but that's the
schedule that keeps people pumping
quarters into a one-armed bandit and
understanding if you understand these
schedules you can look at games and say
yeah this is basically not that
different from a pigeon pecking on a you
know a lever trying to get a pellet in
an experiment so that is very deep
primal stuff you can see the same
behaviors emerging from these patterns
of reinforcement in chickens and mice
and monkeys and humans it's very deep
stuff games also engage us in flow which
is that term is from a book it's called
flow by someone who's got a name I can't
pronounce Mikael what is it yes what he
said yes it's incredible book every
great game designer I know has studied
read absorbed that book and basically
the long story short punchline is that
an activity that has just the right
level of challenge not too much or you
get anxious not too little or you get
apathetic but just the right level of
challenge and that adjusts the challenge
based on your changing skill and mastery
is going to keep you in the flow channel
which is that channel in the middle
really good games do this they unfold
their challenges over time in
conjunction with your evolving mastery
and that style of design designing
something that changes over time in
response to the user it's very much what
games do but it's also what you were
seeing more and more in social software
now so game mechanics are the underlying
system and features that drive this I'm
not today I'm not going to be talking
about the sparkle of great animation and
sound that's also important in games
talking about the mechanics the
behavioral mechanics that engage people
so I'm going to talk about five game
mechanics today this
think of it as a primer this is an it's
these are foundational elements this is
not the whole story this is not a recipe
to go out and make a game these are
practical useful things that you can
apply to what you're doing and their
building blocks first one is the
collecting game mechanic and that's
basically all about show me your stuff
what are you collecting what do you have
it's an expression of what matters to
you and the time you've invested in
something it's something you can compare
with other people and it's just a fun
human activity
you know eBay is really built on the
urge to collect here I show you trading
cards collectible trading cards I have a
ten-year-old kid my house is full of
these things but also there's my twitter
friends and you know my and my followers
that's another form of collecting
friends on social networks it has a
similar feeling to it basically if
you've got a cool collection you got
some bragging rights within the social
circle that cares about that collection
part of the collecting mechanic is the
power of completing a set you know this
you know people have collected baseball
cards know it just cards that let you
that you can buy over the counter at
Target like for habbo hotel the have oh
did a brilliant experiment a few years
ago where they took the standard card
you buy it and you get a certain amount
of credits and they just made four
different kinds and said collect them
all boom their sales went up you see the
same kind of thing now with the your
profile is 40% completed on Facebook and
on LinkedIn it's the collecting mechanic
it's the completing a set mechanic
Pokemon is incredible that doing this
there's the checklist so again this is
the kind of thing that if you're trying
to get somebody to do something you can
frame it as collecting and especially
make the things that someone's
collecting look and look tangible you
can get a lot of power out of that
another basic building block is points
earning points now as a few different
kinds of points there's game points
which are given by the system for
example you play and bejeweled and you
get a certain number of points or in our
game photograph we'll talk about that
later you play you find details in a
photo and you get a certain number of
points that's
player to system interaction a more
interesting kind of point is what I call
social points and those aren't given by
the system
those are given by other players so
Flickr has a very interesting metric
called interestingness that's basically
social points it's a bunch of behaviors
of other people viewing your photos
tagging your photos discussing your
photos forwarding your photos putting
them in a group all that behavior
aggregated is distilled into a metric
called interestingness that's a social
points metric YouTube's favorites and
ratings are also social points and
social points create a very different
dynamic in a system then then game
points do because you can't get them
just by playing you have to somehow
engage with other people there's another
kind of points redeemable points that
you see a lot of people using now
especially on systems like Facebook and
systems where they're engaging with
virtual goods business models and
basically redeemable points drive
loyalty there's a you know from S&amp;amp;H
Green Stamps many years ago on up to
frequent flyer programs and drugstore
comm if you can have people earn points
that they can then redeem for something
within the system either a virtual good
or sometimes a physical good or service
you're gonna get a lot of loyalty you're
also going to be tweaking something that
is it isn't often talked about cuz it
can sound sexist but it's really true
one of the biggest barriers to women
playing a lot of games is feeling like
you're wasting your time there's a
psychology that many not all but many
females embrace I certainly do
that I don't like to waste a lot of time
how can you play World of Warcraft for
three hours I got kids to feed that kind
of thing
redeemable points can really play into
this whether you're targeting females or
not that feeling I'm not wasting my time
I'm earning points I'm earning you know
I'm gonna get that toaster for my family
or whatever it is
so another once you have points you can
have leaderboards it's kind of as simple
as that
and you can choose to have them or not
there's some interesting history with
leaderboards backfiring I know that at
Orkut that was an interesting topic but
they drive player behavior they
introduced competitiveness
they they also express your community
values if you're going to have
leaderboards what are you celebrating
with the leaderboards are you
celebrating just the person who plays
the most you saw mean the person that
brings the most friends in you cell you
mean the person that leaves the most
comments on something that's social
that's going to express what's valued in
your system another once you have points
you can also introduce levels levels art
there's nothing magic about them they're
just shorthand for how many points
you've earned it's just an easy way I
was working at eBay when we introduced
levels and into the rating system and
all of a sudden people that had just you
know eight hundred and ninety points
we're almost at a thousand and they'd
work really hard to get to the next
level it's a way to both express to
other people how good you are in
shorthand like with karate belts but
it's also a way to drive behavior and
keep people essentially on that
treadmill
so the third mechanic is feedback this
is not solely the province of games but
games are particularly good at
delivering feedback and once you have
really good feedback this is gonna
accelerate your drive to mastery anyone
who's played any of Harmonix games from
Karaoke Revolution to Guitar Hero to
rock band knows how incredible that
company is making great feedback that
makes an exciting experience but gets
you better you become a better singer by
playing the game brain Age is another
great example that's a DS space it was
originally D s it's now on every
platform by Nintendo and it gave you
this feedback over time that showed your
brain getting younger which was an
incredible hook for a lot of people so
feedback comes in many forms there's
real-time feedback yes I click the
button then what I thought I was gonna
do I did basic real-time feedback but
there's also feedback over time how are
you doing are you getting better how are
your friends doing etc all that kind of
feedback is very engaging drives
engagement drives repeat use drives the
person toward mastery
feedback also just plain all that's fun
I would argue that Google Maps one of
the reasons that took off and was so
successful other than incredible product
design and engineering is it you just
get better feedback with Google Maps you
can move stuff around and you have more
control it's that's one of the key
things and here's an example of a hit
game big surprise hit game called
Cooking Mama how many of you have ever
played Cooking Mama it's a great that's
cool yeah so you know it's this very
mundane activity learning how to cook
and it's all gussied up with this
incredible feedback that's just right
and it's at least for me and for my kid
totally addictive and so once again it's
just the power to engage you of feedback
now just like with points there's game
feedback but there's also social
feedback social feedback in the form of
say notifications on Facebook and people
friending you and people are retweeting
your tweets and all that stuff that's
social feedback and again as with points
that's even more powerful
so when you're engineering your systems
thinking about okay how am I going to
give the person feedback from the system
but also from other people how are they
going to see that how often are they
going to see that how can I design that
to be effective and not overwhelming
those are all key questions when you're
putting great feedback into your system
the fourth is exchanges an exchange is a
structured social interaction a
back-and-forth call and response in
music a conversation taking turns when
you're playing chess trading gifts those
are all exchanges and this is a very
primal basic form of social interaction
many games have this built right in
chess checkers two-player games any
turn-based game is a form of an exchange
trading this is a trading screen from
wow trading is an exchange it goes back
and forth now both of these are an
example of what I would call explicit
exchanges that means that it's built
into the actual structure of the system
that there's an exchange trading has you
both people put their objects in its
held and then it goes it is one person
can't do it one way
that's an explicit exchange
there is another kind called implicit or
emergent exchanges and this is even more
interesting and potentially more
powerful eBay is a great example of that
you do not have to leave feedback for
someone who's left feedback to you it's
not built into the system we argued
about this a lot to whether to force it
whether to build it and like you're
forced to do it to a friend
it's not how eBay works what happened is
that it's become emergent in the social
culture of eBay that if somebody leaves
you feedback if you buy something and
that person leaves you feedback they're
expecting feedback in return and you can
get some very unpleasant interactions if
you don't depending on the seller that's
a implicit exchange another example that
is gifting in just about every gift
application I've seen as it is in the
real world you don't have to give a gift
it's not built in it's not like you know
trading but it engenders obligation when
you give someone a gift and they're
likely to give you a gift back or to
give you something else back in return
again that's implicit exchange if you
have both you tend to have a richer
social environment both MySpace and
Facebook are good examples of that
adding a friend is an explicit exchange
it's two-way as you know it can be one
or two way it's to a both have to do it
just as with a trade however leaving a
comment is more like a gift you don't
have to do it both ways but people do
tend to leave comments for people who've
left them left them for them so that's
letting the exchange be emergent out of
the system is something to always think
about if you can facilitate that
customization again a lot of software
does offers customization games are
particularly good at it you can get
great ideas from looking at games
character customization is one basic
type if you're designing your character
and Wow or you're designing your profile
on MySpace you're expressing who you are
in a way and basically the more fully
you're able to do that the harder it's
going to be to leave that system because
you're more invested another kind of
interface customization if again using
WoW as an example you can just in
customize the hell out of that interface
it's it you can do a lot and you see
that that's very typical especially in
console games but we also see a lot of
interface customization on the web I
think YouTube is a great example the
extent to which you can customize your
channel and you know really have
something that looks different from
everything else that's there that's a
good basic kind of mechanic to offer so
I want to turn the tables a little and
I've been talking about how games are
influencing or can influence social
media but what about social media going
back and influencing games what's going
on there so there's a few trends that
I'm very interested in and I've been
following the first is making software
accessible and there's three things that
I mean by that one is making the UI
accessible we've seen a dramatic
increase in easy to use you eyes the
last couple of years it's a big thing
partly it's the changing demographics
partly it's you know Ruby on Rails and
other ways of letting people build stuff
quickly but it's also just an
expectation it's competition there's
people like Google I think pioneered the
easy to use interface and a lot of
people are following that the second is
devices you see more and more web
services launching and they reach out to
many different devices wherever you are
it runs on the web there's all these
clients it runs on your cell phone
Twitter is a good example of that and
the third is open api's make software
much more accessible and much more able
to live in different forms if you're
developing a service that's something
that makes sense all of those are part
of a trend of software becoming
dramatically more accessible to more
people second trend is what I call
recombinant recombinant data objects and
what I mean by that is more and more
social media service and software
services are allowing their basic data
objects to be remixed and redistributed
YouTube is a good example of that Flickr
you know Twitter they all have basic
data objects that you can search and
sort and then deliver different feeds of
and people can have different clients
that run on them and all of this is
enabled by this very basic architecture
which might seem obvious but if you're
coming from games most games aren't
designed that way they're not designed
to be recombinant and the third is
syndicated now this is built on top of
once you've got our Comment data objects
in a some sort of content sharing
network you can basically syndicate that
if you choose to I YouTube was an early
leader in that by allowing people to
post videos on their blogs so I'm using
the term syndicated in a very pure sense
which means content that lives outside
of where its source was and you see more
and more services that aren't just a
destination or maybe not even primarily
a destination site which is what I think
of as the older model for web 2.0 but
really live everywhere and are
generating a constant stream of content
that lives many different places in many
different forms remixed and also re
skinned so I want to do a few quick case
studies and this is the part where if
you're so inclined I'd love to have you
tell me what you think just by you know
raising your hands are calling out about
I'm going to pose some questions okay so
I think YouTube has done a great job of
integrating game mechanics in a very
natural way into their software and I
like to use it as an example so first of
all what what do you collect on YouTube
anybody favorites you collect favorites
anything else
you collect subscribers anything else
I collect videos I have my list I just I
feel like I collect I have my videos so
there's a the point is there's a lot of
things you can collect on YouTube that's
why I showed the list all those
different things one of the things
YouTube could do if they wanted to make
the collecting mechanic more powerful
was to make your collection look more
like a collection to the player that
just make it feel and look more tangible
that's one way to drive with that
mechanic how do you earn points on
YouTube
star ratings views see that whole list
all of those are ways to earn points
again YouTube has multiple parallel
leaderboards that's what I would call
them and that's great because that means
there's a lot of different ways to rise
to the top there's a lot of different
ways to get your moment there's a lot of
different ways to explore and discover
content so that's very powerful how do
you get feedback on YouTube comments
you also get feedback with something
called the video response oh I guess I
have that in the next one sorry it's an
example in exchange and then there's
this inbox that shows you people
messages things people have shared with
you another way you get feedback on
YouTube is staff I circled that there on
the right of the screen YouTube gives
you a bunch of stats that's another
great way to get feedback in some
systems stats can be an alternative to
leaderboards if leaderboards introduce a
competitive element that's not working
for you you can surface stats like
you're in the top 15% that sort of thing
so that's something that it's game
designers we're often thinking about
where can you have an exchange that
one-to-one exchange on YouTube does it
offer that well I would argue that the
video response is one form of exchange
it's that back and forth feeling
comments or another form of exchange but
you know there's probably room to do
something else interesting there with
videos and exchanges to make it more
game-like and then the fifth is so how
do you customize your experience on
YouTube this is an example of a
customize Channel are there other do any
of you who use YouTube have you done
anything else to customize your
experience right so you can customize
your profile that's skinning it right
and you continue determine what's on
there
so you can kind of decide which widgets
are there yeah these are all ways of
customizing your experience which gives
you a different experience but more
importantly it lets you present the a
version of yourself a version of what
you want to show to other people in you
know
that you control so is the service
accessible I would argue yes I think one
of the main reasons YouTube took off
there's many reasons is you can upload
videos really easily it takes different
formats and walks you through it that
was a big thing when they launched it
was a big thing for me getting my videos
up there so easy runs on a lot of
different platforms runs on mobile very
easy to use you send somebody a link my
mom can use it all the all those
checkpoints I think it has an open API
correct yes yeah so all that whole trend
YouTube's right out there are the data
objects recombinant yep you can have
different sorts and streams of videos
it's pretty easy to put together a
playlist not a problem can the service
be syndicated absolutely it's continuing
to innovate in that space and it was an
early leader so now let's take a look at
Twitter very different service but has
some of the same trends flowing through
it what do you collect on Twitter
anybody followers you also collect
friends but really you collect followers
and you see that and part of it is the
way it's expressed visually as you can
see here but it's also what people brag
about it's what people are you know
feeling measuring as valuable how do you
earn points well on this pay I'm sorry
on this page you can see there's points
anything that's a number people are
gonna think it's a point they just are
um so there's updates followers and
following there's services like Twitter
holic that turn this in the leaderboards
Twitter itself doesn't have leaderboards
they don't need to they have an open API
somebody else built it how do you get
feedback on Twitter do you guys use
Twitter
how do you write so there's several
different ways to get feedback and
what's great is that you can decide
which of those you want to get in email
if you live in your email I personally
still live in my email client
so where do you have exchanges same same
thing really @replies direct messages
that's how you have exchanges there they
probably could express the exchanges a
little more concretely and that would
amp up the power but basically you know
they have the underlying mechanisms to
do it and what we're seeing is that a
lot of the innovation in the UI is
coming from the third-party clients not
from the main service can you customize
your experience on Twitter a little bit
you can have a custom macron so this is
my favorite custom background so far
this guy this is he it's just a you know
it's just an image he made this custom
background that looks amazing
for a custom background so people are
getting very creative within those
constraints and again I think there's a
lot of room that Twitter could improve
with customization but the direction
that that service is going is to leave a
lot of that kind of front-end
improvement and innovation into the
third-party clients and if they can just
figure out a business model that whole
thing should work really well is the
service accessible what do you think I'd
say dramatically super easy to use super
easy to get on your desktop on your
mobile wherever you want in a super easy
and importantly super easy to integrate
integrate with photos integrate with all
different kinds of services are the data
objects for common it tweets absolutely
and the all the flurry of activity
around them is partly based on just the
basic fact that you have this simple or
common it data model can the service be
syndicated and is it syndicated yep
definitely it's you can put it on your
blog you can you know put it on
different kinds of places and it takes
many different forms part of that is
because of the simplicity of the service
and of text but nonetheless I think it's
a great example of these trends so now I
want to talk a little bit about the
project that we at shuffle brain have
been working on for the last six months
it's called photo grab and it's
basically our first small steps in a
larger vision of brain
games that is games that are good for
your brain meet social media the ongoing
stream of your experience isn't it and
your artifacts that are generated by
interacting socially online it's a
photograph and it's not first of all how
many of you have played photograph okay
so that's something fun you can try
later it's search for photograph on
Facebook you'll go right there if you go
to shuffle brain calm it's linked on the
front page it's very easy to find so
I'll take you through this quickly what
so in photo grab what do you collect
well there's two things on the left hand
side this is my profile it's another
player's profile you collect awards
badges this is a very common game
mechanic that I'm starting to see other
people introduce into non game software
if you've ever played Xbox Live they
have a great award system and you're
seeing more and more of this it's
basically you say okay you've done X
you've played five games you've shared
your day and you've gotten five people
to play your game etc all these little
achievements you mark them with
collectible badges and then you both
tell people what you expect them to do
but you also give them something they
can show off and get a sense of
achievement for the more that you expand
your identity and this this is a form of
expanding your identity all the badges
you've earned just like being a Boy
Scout the more you do that the harder it
is to lead the service because you've
developed your identity and people get
very attached to that you also collect
games you can create games and play
games and we make them visible all the
games you've ever played are created we
could certainly do a better job of
making it look like a collection so I
think there's a lot of room for
improvement in our own software there so
how do you earn points well there's
quite a few ways the basic one is you
play games and you level up you do
better you get faster and better at the
game you prove your skill you can earn
points that way you can also earn points
for leaving comments you can earn social
points and most importantly you can eat
earn points by creating your own games
which by the way takes about three
minutes it's very easy and having other
people play those games and those are
all ways so there's a variety of ways to
achieve
within the system how do you get
feedback again there's a couple of main
ways within the game itself in a very I
would say a traditional game way we give
you a feedback after you've played how
did you do it's social you can see how
you did against everyone else who's
played that game friends and everyone
you can also see how your rating is how
it affected your rating and how that's
related to your friends ratings as well
and that's in-game feedback pretty good
standard stuff makes you want to get
better but we also have a lot of out of
game or meta game feedback especially in
the form of notifications so when you've
created a game and people play it you
get notified if people leave a comment
you say hey respond to their comment if
somebody that is on your friend list
passes you you get notified and these
are all more social graph ways to give
people feedback it's what I would call
social feedback what about exchanges I
think this is actually one of the weaker
parts of our current game partly just
because we've were in beta and we've
only built out so much
we have comments and the comments are
nice you can leave comments in-game and
also on the HTML game pages and we you
can have notifications that function as
exchanges similar to how comments
function as exchanges in YouTube I think
that in a game another kind of exchange
to look at and this is something we're
currently in the midst of designing is
challenges and you can also apply this
to general software so you can have the
social exchange comments etc but you can
have a challenge you know hey I got this
score on this game or I got this this
total score on these three games can you
be me and those are another kind of
exchange that's game-like
that's also can be applied pretty
broadly can you customize your
experience in our game yes you can have
custom backgrounds for your game and the
game itself customizes what you see so
this is a home the home page on there on
the left that's the home page of the
metagame
where are you seeing what's available to
you to play and that's completely
customized for each person that each
list you see is essentially a feed so
you get you note you get notified there
when your friends have created new games
and your friends have leveled up when
they've
certain achievements when they've played
etc so that in and of itself that's a
different kind of customization there's
skinning which is very visual but
there's also data customization where
what you're shown is really customized
to who you are and who your
relationships are it's a service
accessible this is the thing we probably
worked the hardest on is making an
extremely easy to use and accessible
both game UI and also game creation went
through a lot of iteration I know you at
Google are familiar with that and made
something that you know my mother who's
in her seventies could use that was one
of our targets was 8 to 80 we designed
this to train the brain so that older
people could use it but also we believe
brain training is an everyday life
activity we don't think it's you know
old people in a retirement home only for
them with a white guy with a white lab
coat shaking his finger that's today's
kind of brain games but we think of
brain games it's just games are good for
your brain games that are designed to
not screw up your life and get you
addicted and you know playing all the
time games that are designed to be
healthy in every sense of the word for
your brain but also for your lifestyle
and so that's what we're striving for
here we I think we got the interface
well we're working on the API right now
on turning this into a platform so that
it can live in a lot of other places
which is the other piece of
accessibility that social media has
really led the way on are the data
objects for calming it this is something
where I feel that we're at least trying
to innovate in saying okay how do you
make games into recombinant data objects
that can have feeds and be sorted and
delivered and blogged and all the things
that you can do with recombinant data
objects so each of our games is three to
five images each image gets marked up
just like you mark it up with tags but
your marketing up with details and then
stored so you can both recombine the
photos you've marked up into new games
and you can say oh you know I took a
trip to the beach and I remember I made
that game I can use those photos from
the beach and add one more and I have a
new game so it's recombinant within the
system
but it's also recombinant outside of the
system in that you can just have feeds
and we actually have that in the game
now you could subscribe to a game feat
of everyone's games your friends games
just this one friends games however you
like and so that's something we're
really pushing on and think will become
more popular as more and more games are
built to live everywhere not just in one
place and can the service be syndicated
yes because of the recombinant data
objects we have a widget that shows you
the latest games that's on shuffle brain
comm and it's live and we're working on
widgets for external clients that will
show the stream of games that's specific
to their content so that's some of what
we've been thinking about games and
social media I'm really interested to
hear about what you're thinking now in
the QA but also please feel free to go
to shuffle brain comm share your
thoughts in the comments send an email
join the discussion and here's my
contact info if any of you want to
follow me or email me or play the game
feel free to friend me on Facebook and
then you'll have access to all the games
I've created so that's it
well thanks a lot I mean um I think we
have a few more minutes for questions so
um just please raise your hand and
what's your question and then Amy if you
could please repeat the question so we
get it recorded for the talk
so you're correct in that it doesn't all
have to apply so don't depth oh I'm
sorry
so the question is Sharron right Sharon
is designing a programming environment
for non-programmers to write Android
programs and wonders how this applies
how these ideas apply to her programming
environment so the short answer is it's
completely contextual and I can't really
answer that without knowing more about
your programming environment what I can
tell you is that there's some
low-hanging fruit here that you can
apply immediately feedback is I think a
very obvious one giving people really
good and really fun feedback putting a
little energy into making the feedback
fun huge payoff people and again it's
that accelerates mastery so that's when
people ask me you know what if I just
had to pick one I'll usually put on
point them to feedback because it's so
accessible and then also don't forget
about that feedback over time how am i
doing am I getting better showing people
that they're getting better is
tremendously powerful in making them
feel confident and making them feel like
they want to keep learning so that's
that's one place to start
the question is how do you deal with
customization when you're customizing
the game itself and your experience is
impacting other players do you have a
specific example you mean the ugly
profiles okay yeah that's you know
that's I'm glad you brought that up
because that's a really great point the
so the question myspace versus Facebook
MySpace people have tremendous variety
of options for customizing their
profiles music graphics animation you
know blue text on the light blue
background well all that stuff and this
really impacts the readability and the
perceived quality of the profiles so how
do you balance that is the quite is that
correct so I would argue that myspace
one of the reasons myspace took off in
the way it did it's not it's no longer
than new darling but I mean it really
took off was exactly that power of
customization and I as a designer I'm
horrified but as a social architect I
look at that and say man are they smart
and I look at myspace profiles kind of
like the room of a teenager especially
if you look at who the demographic is
it's you know you walk into a teenager's
room there's music blaring there's
posters all over the wall there's
clothes on the floor it's just like a
mess right but it's them and that's what
it's about it's about but it's my mess
if you're a teenager and I think that
this is my mess this is my expression be
it loud and obnoxious and not
particularly well designed is for the
myspace demographic for the people that
use it that's just what they want and it
has definitely differentiated myspace in
terms of their who their core audiences
you don't have nearly that much freedom
on Facebook Facebook is much more of a
communication medium than a
self-expression medium partly because of
the affordances
what's there to your point so I think
the answer is you need to know who your
audience is and sometimes your audience
isn't who you thought they were
who knows if myspace set out to be that
but once you know who your audience is
and what you want you basically deliver
what they want and I think that that
level of customization very much gave
the people that were you know teenagers
and young young people finding their
identity experimenting with different
identities it gives you a lot of power
that way
it also gives up-and-coming musicians
which is in a sense the core DNA of
MySpace a way to really differentiate
and express themselves and I think as as
people grow most sophisticated because
people aren't going to just reproduce
MySpace they're going to do something
new and different you can find ways to
take that level of powerful
self-expression and make it a little bit
more well designed so put just a few
constraints on it what it's probably
what we're gonna see more of in upcoming
services that that tackle that but I
think there's a lot of wisdom in those
ugly profiles in terms of what the
audience actually wants
that's great so the question is if you
add a lot of game mechanics to your
software does that privilege the
competitive people that just want to get
a lot of points and YouTube is one
example where there's both people
posting a lot of videos and people
posting high-quality videos so neither
one of those is right I mean I think
YouTube is as a service serves both
people the high quality videos probably
do more for YouTube in terms of its
business model and where it's trying to
go but without all those people
uploading out YouTube couldn't be where
it is today so do so your specific
question does it privilege the
competitive types when you have a lot of
game mechanics it depends on how you
actually reward and surface the results
of the game mechanics so I can just
speak to our own experiment with
photograph which is still in beta it's
pretty new on Facebook we have a lot of
competitive elements we also very
specifically created a non-competitive
thread to make it so that if you weren't
competitive you could still gain some
fame you could still have your game
surfaced you could still have people
play them etc and what we've learned is
that our audience
naturally subdivides and we've got maybe
a fourth or a fifth of our total players
are rabid gamers and they're competing
and you can see that when somebody
passes them they get really competitive
and passed them again it's great for us
they're playing a lot of games you know
they're they're generating an
interesting dynamic for us but that's
not the majority of the people the
majority that people are playing a game
every now and then they're creating a
game out of their vacation photos to
share with their friends because they
think it's a more fun way to share their
photos which is really the point of our
software and those people aren't playing
competitively when we look at our
analytics and look at the play patterns
we get this like obsessive twenty thirty
games at a time play pattern over
several weeks and then then
it'll sort of die out for the
competitive ones for the other ones
they'll come back a couple times a week
maybe miss a week then they'll come back
and they'll play in this way that we
actually designed it we designed it not
to be played obsessively we designed it
to be played in a healthy way which is a
little bit all the time and so we've
struck that balance if you look at the
leaderboards those people aren't in the
leaderboards but our leader boards
aren't front and center they're there if
you're interested but they're not in
your face you could never see the
leaderboards and have a great experience
and have all kinds of social engagement
that was what we tried to do to strike a
balance I think the challenge as a game
designer who's embracing social media is
to get enough engagement without the
obsessive play that people will actually
keep coming back and you can make a
viable business and part of why people
use game mechanics and do that obsessive
form of play is that those are often
people you can extract money out of so
what we're trying to do is create this
very healthy style of gaming that can
generate enough volume and enough
business that that can be the primary
mode of play not the hyper competitive
yes
that's a great question so the question
is how can you use game mechanics and
specifically points to reinforce and
surface high quality rather than volume
is that correct so well one thing that
you should always ask yourself is is
points the right mechanic for what I'm
trying to do personally when I've seen
people try and attach points to email I
have not seen that work I'm not a fan of
that
however if somebody gets it just right
it'll be fine but that to me doesn't
doesn't seem like a natural fit for the
points mechanic so one thing is step
back and say am I using the right
mechanic that's one way to reinforce the
I mean the traditional or the more
common ways of surfacing quality is
crowd sourcing through ratings or
through you know metrics like
interestingness but that takes time
to do crowd sourcing you have to have
people play it and then you get the
rating etc we have that within our
system as well but if you're trying to
do it in real time and you're trying to
reinforce quality I you know again the
devil's in the details I would have to
know in detail what the challenge was
and then which game mechanics in the bag
of tricks to apply to it but basically
if if there's two things you can give
people points that's a system can give
people points or you can try and
crowdsource it with social points
another thing you can do another tool
you can use
which isn't so much a game mechanic tool
it's more community management tool is
to shine the spotlight where you want it
to be and this is a trick that you see
in everything from MMOs to you know very
simple social games and social
environments if you can find a way to
highlight and surface the best games the
best game creators the best emails etc
through some metric whether it's
editorial or it's statistically
generated then people will fall see that
they will follow it they will do more of
that so one of the most powerful ways to
shape behavior is kind of technological
role modelling show people the behaviors
up front and center in the environment
in a way that is celebrated and that's
another trick yes in the back
get starved
so let me make sure right so let me make
sure I understand so the question is in
Gmail so in Gmail you can star the
messages that are important to you and
so that information flow back in any way
do you think it should I mean it could
depends how you do it there's a few
different ways to do it one of the
tricks that game designers sometimes use
to balance that kind of potential system
problem is to give you a limited number
so one thing you could do is say you
know you have X stars a day or X stars
total you have you you make it a limited
resource and that can that can do like
90% of your work in terms of balancing a
system because then you're not just
going to star in discriminately you're
gonna star the ones that are important
to you but considering how to feed back
feed that back to the user seems like a
great the person who sent it seems like
it's got some problems but it's
potentially a great idea and worth
pushing on because that can give you
that kind of feedback that one makes it
more compelling and game-like and two
will drive quality to Jerry's point uno
mas Mike
you me so the question is does it make
sense to look for universal game
mechanics that could apply to a product
like Gmail and everyone who uses it or
is it more something that would be
relevant for a niche community right so
the game accountants I talked about
today are pretty basic and they're
pretty human and they apply broadly
whether any one of those game mechanics
make sense in Gmail is a question that
you know has to be looked at in the
whole context first of all there isn't
like Gmail should or shouldn't have
points I don't know each of those and
there's many other game mechanics I
didn't talk about today that might
actually be great for something like
Gmail but the general idea of game
mechanics I would say that the basics of
like collect how powerful it is to
collect something and see your
collection that's universal whether it
makes sense in that but points earning
points and leaderboards tends to not be
as effective with older people for
example it depends I mean if you if you
get the 50 year old women are playing
bejeweled 24 hours a day then you know
that's a separate issue but in general
people that have grown up with games so
there's a dividing line that we see a
lot just in play patterns people that
have grown up with games grown up with
consoles and Nintendo etc and now have
grown up with playing game like
experiences on the web tend to be much
more comfortable with and not as
stressed out by things like points and
leaderboards I've seen I've done a lot
of user testing for clients and I've
seen older people just really get
stressed out they might be motivated by
points but it stresses them out oh no
now I'm performing and you know that
it's just not necessarily a great a
great technique but something like
really good feedback that's universal
you know in showing people getting
better over time I would say that's
really universal I think the
presentation layer the layer of what you
is incredibly important and if you show
a leaderboard that looks like a
leaderboard someone saw on a game they
once played bingo
that's the Association they're gonna
make if you show someone a search box
that looks like the Google homepage
bingo
so the game mechanics generally useful
not applicable all the time the
presentation I think that's where often
having different presentation layers for
different niches can really you can see
a lot more success with that because of
the associations people have with a
particular experience I'm not sure if
that answer your question but okay thank
you guys for the great questions and for
having me here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
