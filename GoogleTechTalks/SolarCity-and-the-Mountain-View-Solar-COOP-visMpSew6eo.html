are behind us knock on wood I'd like to
introduce myself I am Bruce Carney and
I'm the person who started the mountain
view solar buyers group the genesis of
it was a visit I paid in the middle of
January to a home in Portola Valley
where a man named armando Carmen's I was
there to do an energy audit on his home
as part of something that act era of
Palo Alto is going to be rolling out
called the green at home energy audit
program an Armand told me that he had
just put together a buying coalition of
about 70 families in portola valley and
that they had gotten solar panels for
their homes at a thirty percent discount
over the market price I had been doing
enough research on solar on my own to
know that a thirty percent discount
would bring the price of solar below p g
d's tier one rate and i wondered whether
or not something like that might be
possible in Mountain View where I've
lived for the last 25 years Armand and
his folks in Portola Valley had worked
with a company called solar city who
they had found by doing what you would
normally do when putting together a
co-op which is to aggregate the
purchasing power and then go out and
find a vendor who can give you the best
price but being lazy and wanting to move
quickly I didn't do that i just called
solar city and said will you give us the
same deal that you gave portola valley
if i can put together enough people can
we have that price and the answer i got
back was yes if you put together enough
mountain view homeowners and business
owners we can give you the same price we
gave portola valley so i took that
challenge on started sending out emails
to people i know using email lists that
I'm familiar with writing in the Old
Mountain View neighborhood newsletter
which I edit and as a result of that
effort 250 people came to the first
public meeting about solar city and
subsequently a hundred other people have
come to two more meetings one of the
people who responded to all that
marketing on my part was Steve Lacey
who's a googler and Steve now has solar
on his home and he's just waiting for
the city inspector and pge to come and
turn it on about 40 homes in Mountain
View have signed up for this program so
far and it looks like it's almost
certain we'll meet the threshold and get
the maximum
discount my wife and myself or certainly
one of those families who have signed up
I doubt that anyone in this room needs
to be told about the environmental
benefits of solar I think what you're
probably here to hear more about is the
financial aspects of the program and
Lyndon rive who is the CEO SolarCity is
standing tamiya sitting to my left and
will soon be standing right where I am
and he will tell you everything you ever
wanted to know about this program and
more and at the end of the presentation
both he and I would be happy to stick
around and answer any questions you
might have let me preempt one question
which is Bruce what is your role my role
is as somebody who really wants to help
the environment I'm not being paid by
SolarCity to do this the reason I'm
dressed in this audit ire is I had job
interview today but for the last few
months I haven't been working and I've
had an opportunity to use some of my
free time as I'm retooling myself into
more of an environmentalist to try and
advanced solar in the city of mountain
view I mean if I can spend twelve
thousand dollars of my money and
leverage a million dollars of my
neighbors money to put solar on their
rooftops it will be the best best
investment of time and my money that
I've ever put out so please give linden
your attention thanks for coming out
when bush contacted me we just completed
the Potala value program and the demand
actually blew me away it seems that
there's a lot of awareness are today
most of us have seen inconvenient truths
extra show of hands who's boucing that
yeah so it's the what people are
starting to know is the problems there
they're looking for for solutions are
looking to take action and those
community programs get the community
together to leverage the buying power of
the community to get a discount at a
commercial company with no they get so
what I'm going to cover today is many
talking about half solo works the
incentives in place today and the cost
savings that you will have
as you color if questions will come up
and I will cover most of the answers
during the presentation so we can hold
questions to the end that'll be great
this is a quote from bruce that i always
use i really think it's impactful the
thing i like to point out is this
picture this was published in New York
Times a bottom month and a half ago and
this is where the UN essentially ignited
and said that global warming is a real
issue so instead of talking about it a
sort of words is a picture's worth more
than a thousand words in this case well
back to electricity who your own homes
thank you so you've all seen this price
increase so it's consistently increasing
that bull has its ups and downs the
market tends to be volatile but over the
last 30 years it increases and it's
going to stay increasing our dependency
on foreign fields is not reducing so the
price will continue to increase serve
hands just whose electric bill is above
eighty seven dollars a month thank you
that's great oh look good but it's a
sexy house for the returning investment
for solar we had the one a meeting and
the thing about month of you the climate
its natural air-conditioning it's never
too hot never too warm and never to call
this just perfect so you don't spend a
lot of electricity in air conditioning
the point here is that electricity is
sold in tears the more you use the more
expensive it is which makes a lot of
sense believe it or not they are call
polluting states that the more you use
the cheaper discount you get less
backwards thinking we're working those
days later
so the first two tiers is the best here
that's 13 11 cents that has a dramatic
increase adjuncts to 22 cents 1032 and
then 37 just to put it in perspective
where you know if your electric bill is
about 240 you in the top tiers if it's
above 87 you you in the average market
who's in the top tiers you guys never
know there's more than you in woodside
we actually we're doing this program in
website as well in fact we doing the
program in woodside Mountain View and
menlo park and in woodside we had a
similar conference and we asked who's
electric balls under two hundred and
fifty dollars a month not sure not one
hand it's most experienced of electrical
I've seen monthly electric bill was just
under ten thousand dollars um but
they're going to go solar to illuminate
their their bow so the beauty of solar
is it actually addresses your top tiers
so you end up selling to PG&amp;amp;E the the
expensive electricity there's this new
program called net metering well it's
not that near it's been around for about
five or six years which forces the
utility to buy the electricity that you
produce at market rate solar producers
doing the most expensive electricity
time which is from noon to six or 12 7
depending on the different rate
structures this is when all the office
buildings are cranking up the air
conditioning and price of electricity is
expensive it's about thirty cents a
kilowatt hour your solar system is
producing that and you sang it to PG&amp;amp;E
at thirty cents a kilowatt hour at night
when you come back you consume it at ten
cents a kilowatt hour it's perfect yeah
the sell or buy low sell high you've all
heard that before I got a riding solo
I'm still working at stock thing solo is
not a new technology it's not like
computers it's not like software
Microsoft's not going to come up with
vista and replace the technology it's
proven it's been around for many years
the solar systems that are 50 years old
out there that are still producing
electrons the technology will evolve but
it's not going to be dramatic shifts as
you'll see in the software industry the
thing I like to point out this graph is
just showing you the adoption of solar
in california since the introduction of
net metering you'll see if the last many
years most of the solar has been
off-grid solar so people that do not
have access to the utility and they need
battery backup system and that's that
was the solar market since the
introduction of net metering has just
exploded and california is the leading
state right now in the US with solar
because it it makes financial sense the
environmentalists in all of us get us to
look at solar what actually gets to buy
it is you can look at the returning
investment so how does it work has
anybody seen a solar system before they
do most of you know how to actually
looks it's here yeah it's a panel on the
roof to me it's very good looking in
fact it's more good looking in towels
and that if she a roof with our solar
it's an ugly roof
and so the solar system goes into your
roof it's not that thick this is just
illustration it goes then through an
inverter which connects to your panel if
you add home you actually use your solar
electricity if you're not at home your
meter move backwards it's the fun
novelty to see you need a move backwards
but there's only that much excitement
you can get out of your meeting moving
backwards so after while you stop
looking at it but we monitored for you
forever so you know that your systems
always under our watch so in the event
that something ever happens we can react
to it the likely that something happened
is very small otherwise we're going to
offer that service for free we offer for
free and then all the excess electricity
that you produce during the day it goes
back to the utility and you build this
credit your electric bill goes from a
monthly electric bill to a yearly
electric bill so in the summer you
overproduced electricity that you
consume and the winter you consume more
than you produce net-net you want to try
eliminate about ninety ninety-five
percent of your bill you don't eliminate
more than one hundred percent as PG&amp;amp;E
will not give you more money than you
consume so you'll end up giving bring
the thirsty to PG&amp;amp;E which some customers
don't mind doing it and support show you
this we have got to love one of your
programs tremendously in fact we
incorporate it into every one of our
commercial designs so we did one for
lower residential just explains the
original amateurs we're just getting to
know this program yes how solar system
goes in your roof
see the cool shading analysis this is
not us of course you know they say for
those who don't know this is your tool
sketchup you're familiar with sketchup
so one day maybe five years from now
when we look at the Google Earth
pictures and you look at residents you
just see homes with solar systems that
would be very happy day so the sun goes
there as i mentioned earlier ghost in
your inverter the inverter converts DC
current to alternating current in there
there is a slight efficiency loss and
I'll discuss that in a minute the Nexen
moves your meter backwards
so in the conversion of DC to AC there
is some efficiency SI los direct current
is what gets produced from the solar
modules itself it goes into the inverter
and gets converted into alternating
current which is what the grid uses with
your heart users in that last there's
about a 15 22 eighteen percent loss
there's also something called the CC
rating for the solar panel the panel
manufacturers rate the efficiency of the
own products well of course there's
slight bias T in their own rating so the
CDC rates every module themselves and
you combine those things together you
combine the efficiency loss of the
inverter the true module rating the AC
module rating and the heat will give you
the AC result often you'll see if you do
go out and get competitive bids I wish I
encourage you to do because it's always
fun when you see the difference in
pricing make sure they aren't quoting
you in DC if it's a three kilowatt
system DC it's more it's more like a
one-point fastest kilowatt system I
start a 2.5 closed system AC so you
really want to make sure you're matching
AC to AC as in fact if someone presents
DCI i find it misleading because it's
much bigger than it really is so always
make sure that you're looking at AC and
then we'll give you a true AC per watt
and the market pricing I'll get into
that is around ten dollars AC so what
happens in order for us to determine
whether solar is a good fit for your
house will actually come to your house
we'll look at the shading tilt
orientation location everything about it
in order to determine the production of
your solar system we then calculate into
a financial return and present you with
with a proposal that proposal will tell
you your return on investment if you
electric bill is below eighty dollars
most cases the return is not so great
it's not bad but you can probably do a
better return in a stock market we have
a lot of customers in fact the smallest
customer in mountain view as a lectric
below twenty four dollars they're not
going to receive a turn but they don't
care so these factors I serve have an
impact towards your rebate today the
rebate is two dollars fifty or what if
you live in Orange County I don't think
any of these homes are in Orange County
so it's there's a design factor that
goes to that and so it's in in this area
you should see around 2 45 240 or 248 it
all depends on your location the
orientation the tilt and shading aspects
and this is a public website that the
PG&amp;amp;E host all this the California Solar
Initiative host in order to to address
it I don't understand why don't they
just do apples for apples give the mess
that much electricity the rebate is
having the market price of whatever you
like the so there's a difference between
the rebate and the electrons produced so
you still get paid the electrons
produced from the utility that's based
on a production so that's every month
the rebate is a guesstimate because
they're not going to monitor your your
system in commercial it goes from our
one-time payment to a monthly payment
which is called the performance-based
incentive it's pays monthly and then
they pay you per kilowatt hour but in
residential is just too difficult for
them to track so they just look at your
system they'd give it a design factor
based on that design factor they give
you money we take care of this for you
it's an absolute nightmare it's a lot of
paperwork but we will streamline it for
your printer on exactly yeah in fact
I'll cover that in a couple of slides so
you know a little bachelor sort of
30 why us we've been doing this for a
long time the company has acquired two
existing companies would be in this area
for over six years in fact part of solar
Owens polyps in the market in Palo Alto
so that they join our company we offer
certain things that that no one asked
does today won't be long before they do
which I like it it brings up the level
of quality in the solar industry so
performance guarantee we we don't know
when it offers a performance guarantee
will monitor your system make sure it's
performing in the event that it's not
performing will get notified and then
give you a call and take action it's not
an output guarantee so I control the
weather but I'll make sure that it does
perform base price you're not going to
see a better price the pricing is public
information every solar system yet gets
installed this public knowledge so I
know what the pricing that day is 10
year warranty most of warranties today
are five years we offering a 10-year
full service warranty and it will float
the rebate to your question the rebate
takes four to six months to get paid we
floated for you we view that as your
last payment so what is the company's
vision without see myself today we have
seen yourself in the future the
company's vision is to to bring trust
into the solar industry trade a trusted
brand but at the same time reduce the
cost of installed what without
sacrificing quality we can easily reduce
the cost of install the water if you
sacrifice quality but you don't wanna do
that and this community program is one
of our first initiatives through just
the cost per per installed what the
company's goal is to keep up with the
rebate reduction that's a tough call I
think the rebate reduction will exceed
our ability to keep up with it for
probably the next year or two and then
we'll catch up again but the rebate is
dropping fast very fast we are in the
level that we should be that they were
forecast has to be at this time with the
rebate in 2009 and we three months into
the program so it's almost a 12 X
incorrect forecast
this is specially for commercial we have
the highest certification available we
thus numbers changing all the time we
actually close to do 80 81 82 employees
and well-funded the main offender is a
person named Elon Musk he was the
founder of PayPal ESO is the primary
investor in tesla motors have you heard
of Tesla Motors so so you know he really
has an incredible vision you combine
electric vehicles with solar your carbon
neutral in fact you can even be carbon
positive so it really creates a
sustainable life or a nubile I this is a
demonstration of our technology so I
technology store in development it'd
probably be installed but four to five
months after your installation actually
gets done my previous company was a
software company with a remote
monitoring that's what we did sir the
financials go ahead the our monitoring
tool is an alpha right now we're going
to deployed to a couple of customers the
April most likely get deployed to your
system between 4-6 months after the
installation actually occurred which is
not an issue the the things went if
something ever goes wrong with your
solar system it's in the first month or
around year five or six the first month
of nullity is definitely there you go to
that meter the killer spinning back but
after the first month then the knowledge
is not anymore so this is the rebate
program it's right now at two dollars
fifty it's going to drop very soon to
220 and just keeps on dropping
commercials already yeah so that we
expecting to be in step 4 in 2009
eventually just going to get down to too
close to nothing the program is designed
to incent earlier
so the earlier that you adopted the
cheap it is for you people ask me is the
best time to buy solar the best time to
buy solar was four years ago it really
was the rebate was four dollars fifty AC
what so paid for more than half the
system that's 250 in fact I've had
customers that have tended these
seminars in a while my neighbor bought
solar four years ago and your price is
not much better well four dollars 50
rebate is what made the difference so
sort of illustrate a exact comparison to
the cost savings that you'd see based on
waiting to go sooner or jumping on board
on this on this program so the market
price right now is just a little above
ten dollars the price that we are
offering is 790 this is a see what if
you wait the next step and the rebates
going to be two dollars 15 if you react
now your rebate remember this is plus or
minus will be at 245 you articulate this
art so 3,000 a three kilowatt system
which is about the average size in
mountain view the system cost of about
30,000 market price also be 23,000 the
rebate reduction will be six if you wait
if you react right now be seven your end
result a system would cost you out of
pocket sixteen thousand dollars versus
23 there is this federal tax credit that
could reduce that will reduce to stand
to 14,000 there's possibility for an
extended tax credit that would take that
two thousand two thirty percent of the
system cost but I don't set your hopes
too high if that will be retrofit to any
system board before 2000
palm genuine first of this year so if it
does come through great if it doesn't
it's still a great offering so since Lee
fourteen thousand dollars for the
average solar system in mountain view
now there's a caveat the caveat is in
order for me to offer this pricing I do
need a hit efficiency of scale if I
don't achieve it then it just doesn't
work for me the target is 175 we about a
hundred and twenty 101 there we've got
41 homes I I'm confident we're gonna
exceed 175 by a healthy margin again
it's clearly defined on me its first
first thing is required is is to
understand the community mentality now
well the community embrace a co-op so we
have people reaching out to us every day
saying please start a community program
in our area Bruce reached out to us
beginning of the year and was really for
solar and that's what we need in order
to see the adoption because we can't
spend much money in marketing or
advertising otherwise we can offer the
program so so the program is done based
on who reaches out to us so more
opportunistic Martin view restart to us
Miller Park we start to us would cite it
reach out to us so these are all the
programs are running now once you
complete these programs will run more
boo but we can't run more than than that
at this stage
yeah well you still get a great deal so
we offer best price guaranteed and
throughout most of California so we
today we have offices in LA San Diego
Fresno Sacramento north bay east bay so
if you live in here in those areas it
won't be this price probably be closer
to closer to nine but it'll still be
better than market price sort of give it
a few more examples so if you electric
bills around 80 you probably could do
with the three Claude system costume
about 15,000 you'd save 7,000 from
market price if you have a high electric
boat for those who did not want to put
up their hands 75.5 kilowatt system will
cost a little more but your paybacks a
lot faster so this this I like this
illustration saying that essentially the
larger electric bill the bail return
investment that customer i'll talk to
you about that had that massive lecture
ball they have a five year payback now
this dis bank its new bank called new
resource bank if you ever have any of
you heard of this bank in San Francisco
it's a bank that's focused on green
investments they relatively new and
they've come up with home equity loans
customized for solar if you it nor
difficult home make you learn is often
very painful these guys you just do
through effects application you get
approved or disapproved within 24 hours
and it's customized for little loans of
30 or 20 thousand dollars so they make
the process real easy they have pretty
good rate and the golden number is one
hundred and fifty dollars if you if your
electric bill is above one-hundred and
fifty dollars a month your cash flow
positive from day one if you finance the
system the cost the financing costs
combined is your new electric bill is
less than your old electric bill
for those who have a electrical of other
150 there's no reason why you should not
explore solar it it's going to be free
money to you and it agree the often we
get the question especially this
customer that a couple questions that
have electric bills of $25 they will see
the payback the equity in the home
increases proportional to the cost of
the solar system so whilst Fargo did a
study and they said it's the best time
improvement you can do and it's changing
the mentality towards solar is changing
an example I use this doesn't happen too
often we ran across the cast me that
says I want my solar system in front of
the house so all and I thought the best
place is facing north because no no I
want everybody to see the solar system
so we are actually we would really tried
hard to convince him not to do it but he
doesn't care he wants he feels that the
impact that we will have by showing
other people to go solar will be more
than the additional savings you'd have
of having a faceoff and so not all homes
are the same I wish the were but they
not so some homes or three stories high
tile roof and somewhat of a death trap
so you'll tie down and it takes a lot of
time to install but we still want them
to participate so they are depending on
on the complexity of the home if it's a
towel these additional costs costs for
what sort of stitch expectations so if
you do get a proposal that it's not 790
there's an adder for tile roof or
multi-story or changing some some people
have a grand market system we're going
to change 200 yards so those are all
additional costs program details talk a
little about the success of portola
valley the it was an eight-week program
so a little shorter than this one it was
november december the goal was
25 kilowatts we ended up with 355 the
average size was 4.5 kilowatt so it's
just a little bigger than the mountain
view average size what I I was very
nervous the on week six we were around
80 kilowatts week seven and eight it's
just this flood that came in we were
Christmas we worked every single day
every night to accommodate that so try
to implement a program to prevent that
from happening but it didn't work too
well i'll tell you now with what
happened but our mark nikuman because of
his efforts in converter talent in his
community to go solar they have reduced
3.5 million pounds of co2 emission
that's great Solar is a measurable
aspect so if you want to take action you
could actually measure the result often
some of the energy efficiency is out
there is not that easy to measure the
result Solar is a clear measure clear
aspect or clear device to measure so how
does the actual process work I used to
have a five-thousand-dollar raffle line
over there it's in order to prevent the
infusion of customers coming on both the
last two weeks I offered up a
five-thousand-dollar raffle for the
first study they came on board so that
rifle is going to be announced our next
conference I think it's April sixteenth
is that right 17th so we have somebody
pull out the raffle but we already over
the 30 marks or doesn't really apply to
you guys it's super came to those
earlier conferences anyway so we do the
assessment someone will give you a call
in fact did you all get little brochures
who didn't get a brochure do you have
any brochures again on the brochure
itself there's a little sad assessment
card if you can write your name as clear
as possible and phone number will give
you a call to set up a site assessment
so I've entire team that the entire the
job in modern view is to do site
assessments based on that will be able
to print out your proposal so if you
decide to go the you sign the contract
we take a ten percent deposit and let me
file for your rebate we file immediately
as we don't want you to hit that next
year you will do I will send a field
engineer out who actually does the final
design which we do the AutoCAD diagram
and get the permit approved and then
power once you the permit gets approved
or start delivering the equipment in
some cases we may have to deliver the
equipment before we do the installation
up to two weeks before the time if you
can accommodate it if you're not we'll
find a place to store it what I do is I
go out and buy all these panels in bulk
and then start delivering it actually
summer Martin via residents I've
actually already started getting
installations done and Steve's one um
there was totally coincident not because
he organized google so the installation
occurs and then it's the the fun period
of waiting your solar system is there
you all excited about it it's up on your
roof all you're going to do is just put
this one little lever and it produces
electricity but you cannot you know wait
for PG need you can right there and they
have to sign off it used to be 10 days
they've increased it to 30 they may even
increased to 60 and so it's it's you
just gotta wait for them to come out
there once the Sun off occurs then the
rebate gets approved that's the sense of
your final payment when we deliver the
equipment that's your final cash payment
but your true final payment is when you
son off the rebate to us and then we
start to wait another four months before
we collect that any questions on this
process go ahead
I haven't heard of a saw and maybe
everyone in my customers but it happens
all the time if it does happen i'll just
recommend you turn it off before the the
PG&amp;amp;E guy shows up don't like it the
detailer are you turn it on here yeah
yeah it's it's a so used to it but it's
it's it's not recommended I get a hand
step good it it's tough but you can't
start back to the utility there so
that's where you make your money the
California is Solar Initiative which is
actually managed by PG&amp;amp;E oh it's managed
by whichever the utility is in the area
so it could be Southern California
Anderson the viewing in seven California
that's right
so the program is designed to eliminate
your bowl if you have a solar system
let's say you only need three kilowatt
system install a six kilowatt system
that excess electricity that you produce
PG nice thanks you they won't even send
you a gift card but they thank you you
just give electricity to your neighbors
bring a cursory but there's no
compensation it doesn't add up to the
next year so it just after the year that
take your credit and if you produce more
than you consume then it's just lost
money the they might is some push but
even if there were to change it'll be at
wholesale not at retail so we've been
reduced down to four cents a kilowatt
hour and still not worth it when we
sighs your system we take entire years
of electric bill to to get a really
close estimate and it's pretty accurate
so we normally do around ninety
ninety-five percent unless you're
getting a Tesla and then we add
additional kilowatt a one-off kilowatts
two kilowatts so we actually install the
charging stations for the Tesla so we we
do have a few customers that do you have
testers okay
hey it's they are so based on your
electricity consumption if you sighs the
system larger than your production and
you say why you doing it then they will
pay you that additional rebate if you
just do it and you can't justify why
then you won't get the additional rebate
in fact I won't even prove your
application again yeah you could exactly
yeah no problem but remember the payback
one occur because most your money is
from net metering and so you get the
rebate additional discount but you're
not going to make your money back from
electricity yeah it's minuscule it's a
really tiny so half a percent the
forecasted half a percent per year so
it's really really tiny i really suggest
sticking to know more than then
ninety-five percent in fact if you have
the consultant camera doesn't like this
hand no leave the hand on you if you
have the consultant come out they could
even toggle the cost difference between
making it 95 seem like they say
ninety-eight percent it's a big
difference because you hitting those
bottom tiers instead of the the hyatt
ears
so do we have to speak any happy to be
working you know great great question so
what happens if there's a black heart in
other words your solar system will not
be producing electricity so the inverter
senses the frequency of the utility it's
a safety precaution because if there's a
black heart PG&amp;amp;E sending somebody asked
to fix the problem they think the
electricity is off if the electricity is
not off they're going to get a shock so
it turns off so it's built into it so it
has to turn off yeah this is there's
this product called grid point it's not
cheap it's about ten thousand dollars it
has a set of batteries in it as well and
then if the utility goes off you can
wire with certain whatever load you
wanted to carry and it has three
kilowatt hours is built into it but any
battery backup system unless there is a
specific need for you it makes no sense
whatsoever you do run across the one or
two individuals that absolutely hate not
having power for one hour and there was
they're willing to pay ten thousand
dollars to prevent them from happening
but it it's not a financial decision at
all yeah they Sam from the power so you
actually you get a different meter so
you get a time of use meter
okay um great question asked you back to
your network I'm actually expecting
quite a few technical questions which I
will not be able to answer it covers
repairing the roof in areas that we were
yes s 10 years now there's a slight
caveat we just happen yesterday we ran
across the roof that it's a wood shake
roof it book most likely need to be
replaced in the next five or six years
so I can't warranty that roof then if
the roof is as 10 years blessed in this
definitely warranted
we don't if you if you know your ruching
replace next year or 2 i'd recommend you
do it now if you loosen the place you
know five Blissett 10 years thats that's
the tough one the rule of thumb that you
can use is that the cost of moving it on
and off is between five or ten percent
of the entire cost so you can run your
own numbers to see by waiting loosen all
that rebate missing the program is it
cheaper than just to move it all in all
and I don't know the answer but it's an
easy for me to answer yourself sure so
the directions most most directions work
well other than north you know we in a
pretty good area the best of course is
Israel Southwest but all the others
store work pretty well that is some
efficiency lost the worst is not we if
your roof has a tilt we tend to stick to
the total SAP remember ethics is also a
big big aspect of the installation you
run across some horrendous looking solar
systems where they have this roof in
this big structure and marking it up and
then it looks pretty pretty nasty so for
the additional two percent gain we'd
rather stick to the slope of the roof if
it's a flat roof we do put a slight tilt
to it 22 degrees is great a great
optimization dan
the the rebate program allows you to
install the system within 18 months from
the issuance of the rebate that's new
construction not new construction is
within 12 months this actually this
question scarab an hour ago and by Bruce
I don't gain my efficiencies if i
install the system after the the group
installation because i send all the
crews art everybody works in it to Kruk
and how crew a can help to be all within
a mile driving range so i do rely on
that i still give you a good price
though no they do get a good price they
actually get the but they get the 840
price which is still significantly below
market so for the next two months
they'll be getting the 840 price but not
the 7i i mean the reason for the program
is for you jumping board if you mess it
then we'll still offer you a good price
can we still have a team out there but
you didn't participate okay
okay it's not it's what we do is we
actually take the the previous owners
years electric bill and we if you know
anything about the previous owner that
house you know if the previous owner was
a single person there and you may have
team of four or how's my wife kids you
know so it's it all depends on your
livelihood and whether it's going to be
a similar consumption often people ask
me every 2,000 square foot house what
should I size of that well the bay area
you may have six servers in the bottom
of the basement it's it really varies
based on your consumption oh actually
the best best analogy is to use what you
using right now yes next lecture we use
is the best analogy yeah
composite shingles that's that's the
best hmm and gets ugly from there so I'd
say cement ow well I standing seam metal
roof center seam metal roof that's just
you don't see this too often residential
but that is the next easiest facts 10
seam metal roofs even easier than
composite single then then goes into
cement I'll Spanish tile and then our
favorite wood shingles the other factors
are not fun either Don gravel yeah yeah
so it's let surrounded by by its cement
tiles I've been here the kitchen we run
right across that I think just ran
across one the other day I don't run
across the steel tiles too many times um
its repression what we did for that one
is you pastor at a typical towel but
actually actually it tilted so some of
our customers intensely shift the panels
to a list the master bedroom is
underneath it so that the master bedroom
stock cooler at the day so it does
shield it absorbs all the light and then
there's a gap between the panel and the
roof and that allows for the airflow
30 days from now so end of the month
it'll be done so then we close the
program then we start all the
installations in April yeah 30 days from
now yeah its energy in the March right
now so said you have April it's just
Martin view you say more than that I
don't know is the address sir it does
address a mountain view do you want to
do yeah it's the busiest one vs one of
you it got launched last week at ends
the end of may so it's it's a month
later commercial actually has been
extended to the end of May for Martin
view as well
yeah the solar thermal has been around
for a long time the rebates make a big
difference it is two different skills
you didn't with plumbers electricians
and we only electricians so there's not
enough business instead of thermal for a
company like us to get into it so that's
why the adoption probably is not that
high but it does tend to have a lot more
labor and maintenance associated than
with electric if you can shoot your
piece demand hot water if you have to
move it may be even better pay back
that's over the Christian really depends
on that it also may depend on how
old your existing hot water tank is
whether you've already invested in
tankless what hot-water heater so the
ROI is is there depends on some
behavioral issues whereas this once it's
up and running you can just forget again
actually Peter needs the most efficient
better in the world injection of those
few batteries actually give you more
power than if you need it they actually
give it yeah yeah i live in santa clara
we don't get our lectures yeah how does
that change it changes thing is quite
dramatically so they didn't know know
that they actually I think they have a
more aggressive rebate program I think
this is run three dollars a while but
your cost electricity is cheaper so the
final roi is probably another three or
four years and top of PG knee but but
the rebate program is a little healthier
but also utilities in the same situation
our next cubanita be launching right now
the talk is is San Jose so willow glen
is it right either so let that be the
next one and and then we going to do a
neighborhoods program in Atherton so
accident has the highest electrical per
square foot and in an entire day
Northern California so put square foot
so it's not because they have bigger
hands as they spent my electricity per
square foot the electrical consumption
is the highest good side a second so the
way I view is get the polluters first
big polluters first yeah
it's real tough so how the program works
is if it's an apartment building is it's
based on per meter so you can't do one
big install and have every drain off
that that one everybody's electricity
unless it's full service apartment
buildings which are very rare where
everybody shares the same electric balls
just cost to stock a levy and so then
then it's difficult partially have to
get buy-in from from everyone but if you
own the apartment now we can prevent you
from doing it so there's no homeowners
association can prevent you from
installing there's law that pass that
prevents them from doing it but
apartments or tough yeah you think
exactly um we are speaking to some
landlords actually own the building
themselves and they they entertaining
the idea of selling electricity to their
tenants with a move everything to a
single meter and because they actually
commercial the connection with
commercial rates these lands are kind of
fat and happy and they don't want to
hassle us electricity
yes so there's there's the there's the
existing Stanfill technologies available
where the price difference is is not
much it's couple pennies and between
traditional panels there's new
technology coming down the line company
called nanosolar and mia soleil it'll be
a long time before that gets adopted in
the residential market I'm excited about
it because it will lemonade some of the
strain that we face and the availability
of panels and that will help us keep up
with the reduction of rebate but I'd be
a long time before gets adopted in
residential just just square footage of
your roof you just do not enough space
again so the the 10 the focus program
will use BP solar and the efficiency is
around fourteen percent but it's the top
manufacturers today number one minute
based on volume is a sharp BP solar
world kyocera mitsubishi senior and then
there's a couple other players is some
power which is a high efficient but
volume-wise they've still pretty tiny in
market share price for what it's a lot
more expensive so we do have we do offer
send your modules which is the most
efficient module on the market today
somehow is the most efficient self they
actually the most efficient module but
its price for what is a little more
expensive about fifty cents additional
so unless you have roof space
limitations financially I would not
recommend it again about 300 square feet
so one kilowatt equals 1 1 100 roughly
a great question so there's exemption so
your profit X did not increase for solar
investment oh it's okay great man yeah
so in order to grow silicon the amount
of energy that it takes to create it
ingot and then actually make the panels
and go through the whole process is a
fair amount of energy so often some of
those who have published using someone
energy 30 years ago smoking wasn't bad
for you if you guys seen thank you for
smoking right here so a lot of people
are publishing bad stories about solar
and the reality it's two to three years
or two to four years depending on the
manufacturer when the electricity
produced from the panel exceeds the
production from their panel but yeah
thank you for smoking it's a great movie
it just related to to the energy
industry and it'll be the same thing 20
years from now yeah okay so we're gonna
rip out los question yes all the time
but we do that so we we take on
responsibility with either your
homeowners association with your
permitting your building department with
whoever and we need to get the permit
approved
you got to play nice cuz it's and I'm
actually thinking on undoing this in in
Southern California actually i'm going
to i'm considering taking on a legal
battle for one of the plan review people
it's they charge five percent of the
system card for the permit this
outrageous so just in top of this it
didn't take another three three to five
thousand so i'm not gonna pay nice for
them and it's illegal yeah it's
physically do okay thank you very much
for coming out today we appreciate it if
you want a side assessment just give me
the cards and if you want the brochures
the writing on the table
