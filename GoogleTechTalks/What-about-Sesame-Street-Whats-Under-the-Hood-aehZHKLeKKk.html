the Search Group here over in building
43 and it's my extreme pleasure to
introduce to you our guest for this
morning I actually first met Nadine at a
panel in Austin Texas
where we were accidentally sat next to
each other and in the conversation that
was a panel about online education for
four children and it was such a
fascinating conversation we've been in
touch ever since and that was about a
year ago Nadine is as you saw in the
abstract the vice president for Sesame
Street productions and she has this
really interesting background in
educating the world and educating kids
in particular so among other things
she's been the executive producer for
Sesame Street in Bangladesh in India
right
which since she's from South Africa she
really has much more of a global view
than I do so that's I think a
fascinating thing she's also done a lot
of work in helping kids in particularly
understand the impact of hiv/aids on
their world and on relationships and
love and so on and I think you produced
a directed I'm not sure which is
shoo-shoo chacha-chacha-chacha-chow
yeah I'm sure there's a click in there
I'm not getting but in South Africa a
fantastic series that was done on
relationships and how to best think
about these things and understand them
so let me introduce to you
Nadine Zylstra from Sesame Street
pleased I am to be here and particularly
after I saw those colored bikes I'm like
in love with Google I'm like oh my gosh
there's colored bikes this is awesome so
so pleased to be here with you guys
today I thought I might start by just
reframing some of the things that I we
add sesame kind of know about who we are
and we always presume everybody else
around us knows those things too but
some of us for those foundations people
might not know so I thought I'd just
kind of wreath just frame us quickly
Sesame Workshop is a not-for-profit
organization and I think you know some
parts sometimes people can forget that
there's all these products out there
that are you know people kids running
with Elmo plush but those products
actually help us support the work that
we're doing in many many countries
around the world and I think our
not-for-profit status is one of the
things that really helps us stay focused
on our core mission which is to help
children reach their highest potential
and you know our audience and this is
another thing that's interesting about
our our brand is we really are able to
spend this incredible range of people
that we have fans you know crazy Muppet
wiki people who know me because I'm a
director on the show nobody else knows
that and then you know kids obviously
and then grownups and grandparents and I
think it's one of the things that helps
us really stay relevant and stay
connected to our audience one of the
things that I find so surprising is one
of our most successful apparel lines is
the one that's for 11-year olds which is
kind of you're like wow that's
interesting so our promise is to educate
as preschoolers with our recipe for
success which is using the power of
media and the magic of our characters to
around an educational curriculum and I
think this is really the heart of what
what drives everything we do that we
have a educational curriculum that
guides each of our content choices along
the road to producing content and you
know while that that curriculum was
developed 44 years ago it is absolutely
in flux at every year we are coming back
to it and saying what are the needs of
children now how can we address those
needs how have those needs shifted in
the last year and I think it really does
help us stay true to trying to be
educationally effective and have impact
well we're kind of at the end of a
two-year curriculum cycle that was
focused on science technology
engineering and math so two years ago we
had a very dynamic educational seminar
and at our seminars just so that you
have a sense we have everything from
educators to academics to teachers
two artists and I think it really is
important as we kind of go into those
seminars to be listening for different
voices and out of how to hear from
different kinds of people about what the
specific needs of children today are so
we had the science technology
engineering and math curriculum seminar
and it was really opened up a very
exciting direction for us that our goal
was not to teach each of those as
independent disciplines but to see them
as a joined set of set of curriculum so
in this whole season that we were trying
to teach them we wouldn't have one
segment that was just about science or
one segment that was just about
engineering we were really trying to
pull those pieces together which was a
huge challenge for our writers so that
was in the first year that we did the
curriculum and then in the second year
what we found was that for preschoolers
the arts presents a really exciting lens
through which to teach stem so kids are
you know naturally inquisitive and
they're their exploration is so much
about arts and crafts or about dance or
about music and you can use those as an
opportunity to teach science technology
engineering and math and that has really
opened a very exciting year of content
for us that we just premiered in
February and I'm going to kind of break
down for you some of the process that
went into producing some of that work so
we use this model which is thinking
about the needs of a country and
addressing it in media with our Muppets
all over the world and the educational
needs we address in different parts of
the world are different the characters
we use to speak to those needs are
different and it really is powerful once
you start thinking about the the
potential you have to address hiv/aids
in South Africa but to get address girls
education in India or you know the in
Kosovo we have a huge curriculum that's
all about mutual respect and
understanding and it does
our model leaves us open to being very
in tune to what the kids in a specific
part of the world might need so one of
the big things that that's also changed
in the way we think about the work we do
is we've started as a TV show and we of
course had very powerful outreach and
we're working with teachers and
communities right from the beginning but
over time we've started to see the power
of not only just the TV show but the TV
show and our digital landscape and the
and kids in their classrooms and we
really see our educational framework as
feeding a very broad content ecosystem
and so in all of our thinking now we're
thinking we're not just thinking about
how do we make a TV show we're thinking
about how do the messages of the TV show
connect with the digital pieces connect
with the mobile pieces you know really
looking at that ecosystem has it in its
broadest sense so forgive the kind of
70s Venn diagram because it is actually
one of the original images that we've
used to describe our model and you know
the workshop basically is comprised of
three different groups we have a Content
team and and the content team is the
team that are looking at the production
and what we're making whether it's games
or video or whatever it is and finding
ways to make that more education nice
salient and relevant and then there's a
research team that's taking that work
and testing it and saying well we tried
this with kids and this worked but this
didn't and it's a really interesting I
mean sometimes a little volatile Venn
diagram there's a lot of debate that
goes into you know I think this is the
best entertained pick your most
entertaining you know piece of comedy
and the educators are like oh but the
kids aren't getting it and you know it's
a very volatile back and forth but I
think it's in that passion for wanting
to do the right thing to educate kids
that some of the magic of Sesame lives
in that dynamism so I have a little
video to just kind of
speak Tom model the children's
television workshop is an experiment
research is woven into the total fabric
of the show every segment is being
tested and evaluated by the toughest
critics of all the children themselves
13 the job is helping children reach
their highest potential we're always
looking to identify what are the
critical educational needs of children
one example because we have a literacy
crisis that our country has been facing
for a while
we've worked with the military on a
whole series of shows dedicated to those
families and those families needs we're
in over 150 countries internationally
programs focus on girls education
specific health initiatives to mutual
respect and understanding the needs of
children are constantly changing the
show is always evolving that's one of
the main reasons why we're still around
40 some odd years later today we are
launching the educate to innovate
campaign a nationwide effort to help
reach the goal this administration has
set moving to the top in science and
math education in the next decade I
remember reading the times ago we have
to teach this I mean we're so far behind
Sesame Street has a new mission this
season to help American children catch
up with the rest of the world in math
and science one of the first things that
we do in an initiative is bringing a
bunch of experts around the table and
really hear from them how to best
address this issue with children if they
learn a very simple kind of the skill
set that I've been talking about they
gained a measure of control when we
enter a country internationally what's
really key to our success is that we're
working with local partners once we get
informed by these content advisors we've
revised the curriculum and we start
creating
now without stem curriculum we know that
children learn through failures stem is
science technology engineering and math
all sort of into one discipline like
okay this is a subject we don't know
about like how this was a teacher
through three-year-old I know my letter
Q that's easy but it's really it's
problem-solving is what we found with
super grover 2.0 we are actually
modeling the processes of stem but we're
also giving children the language about
these concepts what's a ramp
what's a lever what's a pulley we're
trying to understand what children know
before they're exposed to our context
you tell me what a hypothesis says that
a tricky one say like Super Grover we
ask them a whole bunch of questions
about particular topics and then we'll
show them some content that addresses
that particular subject and what we
tried to do is make sure that the
educational message is embedded in
what's funny then after they watch we
want to see what they learned from the
content and how did he get it up nepali
that's STEM education for a preschool
audience we don't just say we're an
educational company that makes
educational media we prove it there are
more Studies on Sesame Street than any
other television show and for the
40-plus years that we've been around
lots of academic researchers have been
focusing on what we're what we're doing
here but we don't rest on those laurels
we make sure that with each new
initiative that we're delivering on what
we're promising we know in our hearts
that that's working but it's also really
nice to have evidence from the academic
community that
it's really showing an effect no other
program works as hard as we do to make
sure that its content is relevant to the
lives of children it's entertaining to
these children to stop but as they're
entertained they're learning and that's
what one of our founders Joan Ganz
Cooney wanted from the very beginning so
it's you know that video does actually a
great job of kind of sharing the process
and how we do it but I just wanted to
take a minute to echo some of them so
this is kind of the journey our piece of
our content moves through you can see
there's that deciding what we're gonna
you know what direction we're gonna go
in and then this curriculum seminar that
we've spoken about and then the
production piece which is you know very
dynamic and ongoing and then we haven't
spoken much about the formative research
part so we will not dive into producing
something new without really taking a
minute to say how did kids learn from
that did they look did they learn the
things we wanted them to learn and how
can we change what we're teaching with
the way we present that information to
make the learning more salient so a
really good example is part of our stem
esteem initiative with a new format that
we were making with Elmo called Elmo the
musical
and it was Elmo using music and
performance to teach math lessons and
there was a big piece of it that was
about you know Elmo imagines his world
and there was a whole lotta and it was
what their out of the curriculum seminar
and it's really amazing the gems that
your creative team kind of hang on to so
we were at this curriculum seminar and I
was sitting next to behind Joey
mazzarino who's their head writer who
you saw there and they're they're
academics were just talking about you
know what the needs were and how we
needed to address them and it just kind
of in passing one of the women said you
know there is something so powerful
about the free
is what if and then she kind of moved on
and I was standing right behind Joey and
I saw him just right what if like okay
that's kind of cool what ifs a cool
thing to hold on to and then two weeks
later we got the script back and he had
taken that gem of the what-if and
created a whole opportunity with it that
Elmo every time Elmo starts an adventure
he said he stands and he says what if
what if what if
and that's how he imagines his world and
so that what-if moment became really
important for us because it was a wave
to really model for kids if you're gonna
try and imagine how do you do that and
what language can you you use to try and
inspire your own imagination and we had
a visual effect and it was really funny
actually the internal debate with how do
you visualize imagination and all the
writers were like well you can't like
you just imagine and then it pops into
your head so it needs to be a pup and so
okay well okay let's work with that pop
and so we made something that was kind
of like a pop and we tested it with the
kids and they didn't get it all they
were like what is this thing is it
fireworks or like what's popping like
they totally didn't understand what we
were trying to teach at all and so in
the end and and it's so wonderful to
create space in your production world
just to look at that just kind of step
back and say are we doing what we think
we want to do so in the end we totally
rework the imagination effect so that he
has these kind of objects that swirl
around his head and then one of those
objects becomes big and that's how he
imagines but it was a really great way
to remember the power of that formative
research and making some space for it so
with our steam initiative I thought I
would just take you through one of the
scripts we just developed and it's
actually gonna air next week just as a
way to illustrate how the content
evolves through the production process
so we were one of the writers had this
idea
to do this awesome script that's all
about Oscar hosting a trashgiving Day
parade and of course Oscars trashed
giving day parade can't be bright and
sunny it's gotta be grouchy it's got a
you know the music's gotta sound bad the
colors have to be grey you know it has
to be a grouchy trash giving day so he
wrote the script that was truly an
awesome script and there were kind of
three beats the one was the marching
band the other one was a big float and
the third one was a big floating balloon
and in each of those in his first script
in each of those events like each of
those beats he found a different way to
solve the problem and when we our
advisors and our educators looked at the
script they were like look if there was
one consistent thing that he was using
to solve each of these problems you
would you would have a much more
compelling message and what one of the
ones that he had been thinking about
already was solving a problem with water
and water is a whole unit of study for
preschoolers and so the educators were
like let's jump on that water idea why
doesn't he use water to solve each of
his problems and as in doing that
suddenly we were really able to explore
the properties of water and you know
some really great properties of matter
issues that might in another context
have being quite difficult to teach but
through through the context of the arts
and stem suddenly these things felt much
more accessible and available so this
particular script went through five
different iterations the first one was
the one where would all the three things
were different the second one was once
we honed into water working for all
three of them and through the the third
fourth and fifth we were just
continuously crafting that message and I
what I loved about our work and our
process is there's never a point when
anyone says okay yeah that's good enough
like things are always like but if we
just did this a little bit better maybe
they'd learn a bit more off we just did
this maybe that message would pop a
little bit more so I have a clip that's
from that
which I just thought was fun for you
guys to see how it ended up just what's
wrong this is a grouch parade this
supposed to sound terrible I just hope
it's a disgrace we didn't hear that
bastard
Oscar what is that I hear melody rhythm
this is supposed to be a grouch man am I
gonna have to fire you no no of course
not this is great I get the solid it
roll on I'll make sure that you do
because nothing then I mean nothing had
better do anything but rain on my parade
okay now you heard the grouse play it
again
this time make it sound awful
no no no stop the music you sound too
good
Oh what could I do to make this band
sound terrible I have an idea what what
water water water dreams lot of
refreshes no croats problem to be solved
with water maybe this one can oh yeah
pumping water help of bocce ban sounds
terrible
well wouldn't you blow into a warn the
sound travels through the air in the
morning it sounds good right so so the
sound will move differently through
water and I'm pretty sure it'll sound
horrible oh no what are we supposed to
do genius fill a whole street up with
water no but we can fill the horns up
with water terrible I did put that's all
I got what are you waiting for Chris
fill those holes with water okay let's
get some water for the trumpet good and
some more for this horn here play
something
great idea Chris don't sound terrible
and they work people
impressive work Oscar my boy impressive
work
thanks mr. disgracey thanks anyway so he
goes on to really have a pretty grouchy
parade at each turn the water just makes
things worse and worse and worse so I
thought it was help maybe helpful to
take a minute to just share with you
guys some of our thinking about how how
we use the broader echoes content
ecosystem to try and push one particular
educational goal or focus and I'm
pleased to see how San Bruno friends
over there because they're a huge part
of us helping to make this all work so
you know us when we package our show
we're really conscious of the pieces we
put together so the street story might
be one piece where and and and it's a
really important part of how we are able
to shape our educational message but we
also have a whole lot of short form
pieces that work around it so pieces
that went in support of this particular
clip we had a word on the street that
with a word on the street was inflate
because they're kind of climax of the
story was Oscar trying to make the
balloon float when of course you on a
grouch parade you can't have a balloon
floating so there was a lot of work they
were really using the word inflate so
inflate became our word on the street
and we had Don Cheadle doing a whole
little small insert piece that was all
about the word inflate we also combined
it with a really awesome Super Grover
piece there was all about they're also
all about water and the properties of
matter there was you know he was trying
to move to what he was making lemonade
and the lemonade was frozen and he
couldn't have figure out how to unfreeze
the lemonade and so but in the context
of that our suddenly these messages
about water and matter and the
properties of matter start to be more
relevant because there's many
opportunities to try and teach the same
thing so when we're putting our content
out there
you know broader ecosystem we are making
sure that YouTube has the don cheadle
clip all that our street org site has a
Super Grover game that helps us teach
you know deepen their learning from the
street story and we're really trying to
program a kids world so that there's
some even in a fractured environment
there's some sort of thinking to how
these pieces so can can support one
another and we've seen some really
exciting evidence out of this strategy
so you know when we did Elma the musical
we at the same time as we broadcast the
show we launched a game online and it
was a really great yeah we did a lot of
testing around it and and some summative
testing too and what we what was such a
good reminder to me that different
platforms present such different
opportunities for learning and there's
things that we can do on the linear show
that we can't do elsewhere but there's
things we can do in the digital world
that is that deepens the learning in
such a powerful way so we had in Alma
the musical there was one piece that was
all about one-to-one correspondence and
and we did some pre and post-testing and
the after having played the game kids
were 23% more likely to be able to
understand the rationale for one-to-one
correspondence which is just such a
heartening reminder of the power of
different platforms to educate in
different ways and you know we're also
always thinking about what is it that's
going to make this particular piece of
content work on the specific platform
it's on and even if we're in the middle
of a steam curriculum if carly Rae
Jepsen's going crazy on YouTube we want
to think about how do we jump on the
back of whatever's happening there and
convert it into something that can teach
kids in in a way that that's true to who
we are so we launched just last year we
launched our version of call me maybe
and maybe my the highlight for me in
this particular experience was I got a
call from the head of our kind of social
media stuff
and he was like Nadine Nadine it's gone
viral in the playground and I was like
what do you mean what are you talking
about and he said look they were cyber
just some mom just phoned me and she
said her kid came home singing share it
maybe and the mom said to him no no no
darling you've got it wrong it's call it
maybe call me maybe it's not shared
maybe he's like no mom Cookie Monster
just at his own version and it's shared
maybe and it's like oh my gosh we've
gone viral in the playground that's
awesome
we've got no wish on me mine it is not
chocolate chip kind we looked at you and
me down you may have snickerdoodle
betrayed me soul or a fight me spell it

baby
hey crazy but you got cookie dough
Jarrett baby
chocolate boy Dee
it don't phase me but you got cookie
you guys must you know enjoy viral
success Oh be on the wave of them all
the time but for us it was like this is
it was crazy that everyday we were
giving a million views and we were like
oh it was very exciting so you know dan
and I were looking for provocative
things to talk about and we were like
what is innovation look like in 10 years
so I thought I'd take a stab and you
know I really think innovation so in
America you can do anything and the
innovation looks so techie
we were just in the middle where you
know we're at GDC that's the reason I'm
here and part of the things we're
demoing there is we worked with Qualcomm
on this super cool way to use the old
joint
technology that lets characters be in
the TV and then dive out of the TV into
the iPad and we've had this crazy
experience with kids testing it they're
like oh my gosh a piece of my iPod and
then Abby's in the TV and it's so
exciting and it was this like really
dynamic experience cuz you can see in
the picture that you see that crazy box
like it was one of two boxes that they
that they had this you know technology
on and it was literally like in order to
get it to work you had to put a tape
dispenser on it and then like hold it
and then it wouldn't work I mean and
then two weeks later they came back and
they turned this huge box into something
as big of it as a soap bar and you're
like my gosh like innovation is so in
our life and in our world and you can
just do anything and then just take two
weeks later I got an email from somebody
one of our partners in India and they
had done something truly exceptional for
their show you know they have a big
problem reaching rural populations and
so they had created this rickshaw where
they put the TV on the edge of the
ritual and this ritual goes driving
through the streets of India and
literally hand
hundreds of kids will gather in a public
space so that they can watch the show
and it struck me that in it those two
are just equally innovative they're
thinking about the needs of the audience
and they're responding to them in the
most intuitive way and it feels to me
like one can get sidetracked by
technology and okay that's what
innovation is but so long as you're true
to your audience and what they need you
can't really make a bad decision and and
I you know I had a personal experience
just recently that I'll leave you with
that is the point that I think the
moment where I kind of realized the
power of being true to what people and
children are experiencing in their
everyday it was hurricane sandy and just
on the East Coast we were literally all
of us immediately on the phone saying
what are we going to do to help respond
to this crisis that is going to face
children as they start dealing with the
implications of Hurricane sandy and it
was so gratifying for us to be able to
do something we had shot a show with Big
Bird year like literally in the 80s
where over five different episodes he
had the hurricane had come to Sesame
Street and had blown away big bird's
nest and we were able to take these
shows that have been done many many
years ago and edit them together into a
one-hour piece show that broadcast on
air and making the show was in and of
itself this incredible journey because
no no trains were working you know we
had editors down in Red Hook who were
riding on their bikes up to get to the
office one she got knocked over ended up
in hospital like you know people just
really putting their lives at risk
honestly so that they could make this
show and it was so it felt so good when
we finished the show and we handed it
off for me like oh we did a great thing
then three weeks later I was going on
tours to find a new preschool for my son
and I happened on one of these
preschools and I had a huge big thing
where obviously you know they're
hurricane impacted children's lives and
in their preschools their teachers were
talking about and trying to frame it and
so
there was a big sign that says what is
hurricane sandy mean to me and they were
like 10 quotes from therefore this
preschool class and of the 10 quotes six
of them were talking about Big Bird
losing his nest and it was this crazy
moment where you're like wow we're not
just in a little edit Suites doing what
we're doing we changing the way their
kids see their world and that was just
so it's such a vital thing to remember
that you know and you guys have our in
this incredible incredible have this
opportunity to speak to the world and I
could imagine it can get easy to forget
that the world is not a globe but a
whole lot of kids in a little preschool
class who are thinking about Big Bird
losing is missed anyway so that was
that's kind of what I had does anybody
have any so you know when we were
working in South Africa and that was
actually the first year that I joined
the sesame team I had the privilege of
being on the T the first team to develop
the so wait maybe let me go back my
section when we were working in South
Africa our curriculum advisors obviously
said to us look hiv/aids is a serious
serious need and we need to address it
and you know it's relevant to children's
lives and we need a way to address it in
South Africa and so we had this
curriculum seminar and I was lucky
enough to be in the room as we were
talking about what we were going to do
and it was really interesting actually
because you know you come I'm just a
producer like I'm not an educator and
you're learning you have fun I'm
learning so much every day about how to
educate kids and so all of us sit in the
room and we're like well what can we do
to try and deal with this and you kind
of get in touch with your own
stereotypes or you know your own
personal issues with dealing with some
of these things and I remember everyone
the room was like there was some quiet
person in the back I said what about if
we made one of our characters
hiv-positive and there was this like
crazy vibe in the room it everyone was
like oh oh no I think that's a bit much
and it was that moment where everyone
was like that's exactly why we have to
do it is that there's there's no no
other brand honestly that's strong
enough to do the bold thing that is the
right thing to do but it was there that
real moment of kind of grappling with
our own issues in dealing with the
disease and you know our own kind of
issues with it anyway so out of that we
created kami who was who is hiv-positive
and it's I mean it's incredible she's
been invited to join the UN as the
spokeswoman for kids and it's I really
think she's been hugely powerful in in
the hiv/aids message and being able to
speak to kids about how it impacts their
lives and and what that looks like and I
think our feeling particularly because
of the journey we've been through with
kami is provided you true to the needs
of the of the community you're working
in and you know when we when we dealt
with them hiv/aids in South Africa there
was a huge backlash in the u.s. that you
know the news went crazy they're like
what is Sesame Street doing teaching
hiv/aids inside in you know and what are
our kids learning on Sesame Street and
somehow they'd missed that we were
teaching it in South Africa where it was
a chronic need for children so my
feeling is so long as you're true to
what the audience in that country needs
we will teach anything if it's what that
group of people need
dealt with any other health issues so
yes we have we actually working on a big
water program that's all about diarrhea
prevention and healthy kind of water
practices so that's a big one
we haven't gone to diabetes I'm trying
to think a lot of hot stuff in South
America there's a lot of kind of healthy
heart healthy healthy habits messaging
and you know in the u.s. we obviously
have a huge healthy habits curriculum
that's all about exercise and healthy
eating
that's why Cookie Monster's but you know
cookies are sometimes food the research
you do because in the clips you have the
researcher sitting there with with their
their notebooks in front of the kids I
mean it is true so how do we actually do
the research we do because in the clips
we had researchers actually sitting in
the room you know we are very hands-on
in that way like we do sit with the kids
and and moderate that research
experience and you know we have so I
think the point is we have different
kinds of studies depending what that
what outcome we need so those are
content research studies that you were
seeing where we the nuance between
understanding what the child got or what
didn't get we are going to use that to
inform a practical production outcome
and that's different to some of the
summative research we may do which is
much more analytical that's that's where
we don't want to get in the middle of
you know complicating the data because
we are actually talking with the child
so that and many of those studies we
actually don't do ourselves we work with
another party to actually do those so
that they can be objective
so I mean Jen Cotter would be it would
be able to speak to it better but I
think we basically we change our
research practice depending on what
outcome we need and how objective we
need to be in the given situation
field studies where you're in their home
they're natural we have we haven't Oh
what do we ever do field studies sorry
sorry do we ever do field studies yes we
do and we don't forgetting what the name
of the study was we just completed a
piece where we were leaving materials in
home with families for them to self
report on what the children learnt and
you know what the parents impression was
of what the children learned from that
piece what's your question can you hear
us yeah great
um curious as to how you think about
digital video and the future that versus
terrestrial video and traditional
television and if you're if you're
thinking that they will continue to kind
of act in parallel or they're going to
diverge and you're building are you
starting to build more for digital and
is terrestrial gonna kind of go by the
the wayside or is it is it gonna
continue and you're just going to build
to reach the largest audience how do you
think about winged production and and
the time and resources that you devote
to each do I have to actually repeat
that question it's a good one so you
know what we've found we obviously do a
lot of analysis of our audience and
where our audience is and for now we
still see our hugest audience being in
terrestrial TV and I think because so
much of our drive is to reach kids who
are otherwise now aren't necessarily
connected I think for my my feeling is
in the Internet in the foreseeable
future terrestrial TV will be a driver
for what we need to do but I think we
are really excited by the potential that
different platforms have and you know
certainly it's not that we're not
thinking about it it's that we are we
are thinking about it and making choices
according to how our audience shifts in
a given year
and and we're definitely you know we
just launched or not just a year ago
maybe launched project with with
Microsoft with the Kinect Sesame Street
TV there which was basically taking the
linear show and making it interactive
and I think we're always looking for
what is the next idea that takes our the
foundation of our linear experience and
extends it digitally in an interesting
way
but whether whether or not any of those
things are going to be see changes for
us I don't think we're we are there yet
you observe people are watching the show
if we went back and watched it
Assessment University 10 20 years ago
would be able to see how like
pedagogical incident made me the intern
are there like big see changes in best
practices I think so and actually so
much so that you know we are educated
now have kind of termed it because we
need to be able to help the audience
differentiate by the things that were
made within a different educational
framework and the things that are made
in a modern one and so we've started
using this definition of classic as a
way to try and help the audience
understand because there's some crazy
stuff that that used to be okay I mean
there was I actually think we even have
some clips where people are smoking like
you know they're there it was a
different world and we and that content
then was resonating with that particular
context so you know like we have whole
volumes of content
old-school one old-school to that's all
classic content that if we put that
through the lens that we now use to
educate I don't think we'd be
comfortable I think it's some way
mid-80s but rosemary would be able to I
think like once you get into that mids
own it's kind of case-by-case that are
watching Sesame Street for instance not
in their native language they might get
ahead on the concepts but slower on the
you concern yourself with that category
do we consider our there atypical
learners when we're producing the
content we're working with you know I
think when when you're producing for a
two-year-old a lot of those decisions
get made for you because you have to
simplify it so much in order to resonate
with that two-year-old that many of the
times where we are making it available
to a typical learners not because we're
intentionally trying to but because by
making it work for a two-year-old many
atypical learners will be able to learn
with it and I think it's one of the
reasons why adults feel like they can
learn English from the show or you know
like their there are many communities
that I think resonate with our content
specifically we get incredible emails
from parents of kids who have autism who
just seemed to connect with the
characters in this very apparent way so
I think the power of the two-year-old is
that you kind of get to reach a whole
broad audience
I'm wondering how you characterize you
think about the your audience its
two-year-olds materials are very
different than four-year-olds and so how
do you when you're doing your production
design hit such a broad audience in some
ways that's broader than I mean the
cognitive differences are very different
between those different groups
especially when you try to think about
say US versus Canada versus say New
Zealand and South Africa
so the question is how do we deal with
the relative developmental differences
between a two year old and a six year
old and it's really interesting actually
so we went through a phase where we saw
how many two-year-olds were with the
content of our show and we very
intentionally built content that would
work for them and I think Elmo's world
came out of that phase we were really
simplifying the messages it's like
Elmo's World
balls Elmo's World you know mouths like
very simple concepts and what we found
was we were losing some of that older
audience so we very intentionally worked
on developing content that would skew to
the older and I think what we found is
we can do that and still be stay with
relevant to the two-year-olds whereas we
can't develop 40 year olds and stay
relevant to four but we can develop for
four and still be relevant to two and
one of the so that's been one of the
shifts we've been moving through but
very recently actually we were we've
it's interesting you raised it because
we felt we needed to just be much
clearer about where our audience was on
the specific goals we were teaching
depending on their developmental phase
so we've been working on this really
incredible framework that maps out like
if you're teaching you know conflict
resolution to a two-year-old that looks
like this to a three-year-old that looks
like this to a four-year-old it looks
like that and we're not using it as a
tool to say okay now I need an idea for
the - an idea for the three or an idea
for the full but we are using it so that
we have a sense of the larger needs of
the audience
knowing that there will be some things
that work particularly well for one
audience and something and I do think
that's one of the opportunities of a
magazine show is that you get to do a
lot of things in that hour is that some
of this stuff Sesame Street has done has
done a fantastic job about introducing
incredibly sophisticated concepts at a
very low age so my best example there is
that is the schoolhouse rock song it is
a song that introduces the notion of
dollar cost averaging which most adults
don't understand but I've seen 10
year-olds talk about dollar cost
averaging we in there myself it's just
astonishing so I was just wondering if
you especially with the stem stuff if
you try to think how to communicate that
down the grade levels well I mean it was
Joey referenced it they're like so you
know we're entertainers so we like to
find ourselves having to learn in order
to know what we need to teach which is
truly fascinating and you know a real
challenge your question is sorry I lost
you damn stuff and design it for
six-year-olds but also make it work for
a year all right I think this is where
this is this is where our educators are
really really hustle is when we tackle a
very complex educational goal they don't
give us the complex paper that has the
complex educational goal they say this
is what this looks like for our audience
so when we start content production we
working at a much more contained level
you know we really are much more it's
much more accessible and I think that's
a good way to get at it
content and then you do a lot of smaller
clips within a longer show do you try
and focus certain concepts to shorter
lengths of time you know that this how
do we feel about different lengths of
content short form versus long form so
our longest form content is probably
those Street stories which are like 12
minutes long and we really are excited
by that chunk of time because it not
only lets you get at an educational goal
in a robust way but these real emotional
journeys through it's like you your
characters get to you know they have
highs they have lows which in a five
minute clip it's very one-dimensional so
I personally as a Content producer not
necessarily with my kind of distribution
hat on because that short form content
is so powerful and is so portable and
you know there's so much about it that's
vital and valuable but when you're
trying to connect with with your
audience and make a emotional connection
I do think that longer form gives you
more scope the question is do we worry
about things do we consider that when
dealing with the complexity of the
message we teach in specific clips you
know one of the things that's been
eye-opening to me I've been the
supervising producer on the show for two
years now and one of the things that's
just like it's actually such a relief is
we have such incredible creative writers
that honestly if you've got a good idea
and it's a 12-minute idea it's gonna be
a 12-minute idea and if you've got a
good idea and it's a 2-minute idea then
it's gonna be a 2-minute idea and
there's something about that that's
really affirming because it's not like
hey creative genius make your genius
work in 30 seconds it's like come up
the idea and if it's a good idea we'll
find a place for it and I think that is
maybe one of the things that's helpful
about our magazine format is we can kind
of roll with that in a way that's
liberating any other questions so that
that model of a curriculum seminar we
replicate oh how do we deal with the
differing needs like understanding the
different needs of different the
different countries we work in so we
have the first thing we do before we
start a co-production in a new country
is do what this kind of assessment of
need phase which is even before we get
to the curriculum seminar which is us
mapping out like what are the specific
needs of kids in that country and can
media help us address those specific
needs and those are like white papers
that are looking at the media landscape
looking at the specific health needs of
a country the specific social emotional
needs you know we kind of bucket it into
big broad educational curriculum areas
and then out of that assuming out of
that we're like yes there is a need in
this country and we believe media can
help answer that need not many times we
don't think we can but then we have the
curriculum seminar and those curriculum
seminars are honestly maybe my favorite
part of the work we do internationally
like in India we I remember sitting at
this table but I there are people who
had shaped the national curriculum
sitting at the table telling you what it
is kids in India need to be learning and
you're like and you know in India like
whatever idea you can think of
somebody's written three doctorate
papers on it's like these are the the
top of their field and I would find
myself sitting there thinking what on
earth am I doing at this table this is
crazy
these people are brilliant they know the
needs of the country their country and
it's there's something really comforting
about that that it's not on us
our job is to just create an environment
that the people who really know what is
right for the people the kids in that
country are able to share so we're gonna
have to stop there
the Dean will be around for lunch for
anybody who's here a big table for
people in San Bruno
she'll be there in a couple hours so
she'll be there but join me in thanking
our speaker once again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
