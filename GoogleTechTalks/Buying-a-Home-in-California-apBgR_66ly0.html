Stephanie hi first I want to thank minna
for organizing this and thank all of you
for coming this is a great opportunity
for us and we're very excited to be here
as minocin I'm a real estate broker and
I've actually worked with many Google
people here and have helped them
successfully buy houses so it's really
you know I think I have some
understanding of the way you all think
and operate around here and i know that
steven ahmad have also worked with
several google people but this is our
first time coming to give any kind of
talk or presentation here and actually i
don't give these presentations very
often usually i'm just now meeting with
clients and looking at houses so this is
kind of fun for me to do first just to
get some general
idea about all of you do any of you own
a home can you raise your hand if you
own home ok l so that actually thus
those are more people than I thought who
would currently own a poem if any of you
do any of you not own a home but owned
one in a different state ok all right so
um yeah I know that someone had come and
I think I'm giving a talk a few months
ago and talked about how it's horrible
you know to buy a house right now and in
some cases you know for some people it
probably is but I think that we also
feel that in many cases it's actually a
really good thing to do and so we'll
talk about the ways you can try to
decide for yourselves whether it's the
right time to buy or not and then if you
decide you do want to buy we'll talk
about the process you go through and
qualify for a loan and then actually
buying a house so the first step in the
process of deciding whether you want to
buy anything and then buying it is
determining how much you can afford so
I'll turn it over to Steven Ahmad to
discuss that well good morning everyone
thank you for having us here we're
excited to be here what I like to start
off talking about today is basically the
mortgage business has changed
drastically since august of 2007 today
the mortgage market is extremely
specific and the way I like to explain
it is every I is dotted and every T is
crossed so it's really critical that you
guys get pre-approved and what I'd like
to highlight here this morning is the
difference between mortgage pre-approval
versus mortgage pre qualification
pre-qualification is basically you call
a mortgage loan officer and you're just
kind of curious curious what your
general parameters would be to try to
determine you know your price point your
maximum price point your low price point
and see how you fit into the whole
equation so we go we talk about your
credit you know what your credit look
like is it good excellent what is it
your asset position down payments and
then your income and your employment
very very high level and then we see how
that fits into current lending
guidelines for two
10 at the end of that discussion
typically I can give you an idea that
you're qualified for eight hundred
thousand dollar purchase putting twenty
percent down go ahead and start
generally looking in the marketplace but
what you want to do is the next step and
that's actually getting pre-approved the
difference is pre-approval we get all
the financial supporting documentation
from you and we review all of it it also
includes running credit on you guys to
determine what credit scores you have
and once we get to look at all of that
we could see that it fits within all the
current matrices of lending all of our
current product and pricing guidelines
once that's complete typically it's
pretty straightforward then we could
issue what's called a pre-approval
letter which we tailor specifically for
the home in what you're going to put an
offer home condo or townhome and then we
go ahead and get that off to the realtor
so definitely if you have never been
pre-approved and you're just curious
about you know what's out there and what
opportunity you have via buying capacity
I highly suggest you research and
connect with a mortgage loan officer
that can assist you with that so that's
the first part the second section today
is just basically general mortgage
information and guidelines of importance
ahmad and i are going to share some of
these bullet points i'll cover the first
three basically the mortgage types are
actually fewer and far between them they
were prior to august of 2007 everything
now is all full income documentation
where we verify everything prior to that
we had mortgage vehicles that if you had
plenty of down payment there was no
income verified those days are long gone
so the mortgage mixed today is basically
a fixed-rate product line of 15 20 or
30-year fixed we do still have
adjustable rate mortgages they call them
high bred loans because they're fixed
for a period of times and that's
typically three five seven or ten years
and then they become an annual
adjustable rate mortgage after that
point in time and many of those still do
have an interest only provision clients
often like having an interest only loan
because it helps with the monthly cash
flow and as we all know living in the
bay area here it does indeed cost a lot
of money so that's basically a product
type today
the loan limits for 2010 conforming
loans still stop at 417 but there's we
call super conforming which takes it up
to seven hundred and twenty-nine
thousand dollars at this point in time
in the Bay Area now different counties
have different caps so you'd always want
to check what county in which you're
going to buy some cap it at 625 500 but
in the bay area here at 729 750 and
that's can consider a conforming loan
the great thing about that is you still
get conforming rates so there's no
pricing variation between a loan of
417,000 or alone that 729 and then we
have our non-conforming product line
which technically is jumbo and that's
anything greater than 7 29 750 and a
bank of america we lend up to 5 million
dollars that's all considered jumbo /
superjumbo down payment requirements
ideally if you could put twenty percent
down that's going to get you in the best
driver seat because it'll be typically
one loan we know what's called PMI which
stands for private mortgage insurance
and we lend up to twenty percent down up
to a two million dollar loan at Bank of
America now if you want to put less down
we can do as little as three and a half
percent down and that would be an FHA
loan so you could literally get into a
property with 3 and half percent down
the maximum loan is 729 750 and that
does have what we call built in private
mortgage insurance to the tune of it's
about 2.25 percent of the loan amount
but the good part is you get to add that
and build it into the loan amount and
then there's monthly mortgage insurance
on top of that but FHA is a great way to
get into a property whether it's condo
townhome or single-family residence with
minimal down and those are basically the
offers with no down payment always the
more the better I mean when you go above
2 million dollars you're going to need
to put typically twenty-five percent
down and then as the loan amounts go up
down payment does increase so with that
like to turn over to my business partner
Ahmad gavi good morning I'm going to be
starting with the three C's of lending
number one being a capacity the other
word for that is debt to income ratio so
the lender wants to make sure that
whatever amount of loan you th is in
line with the income that you are
typically in this market will work on
pretty specific set of underwriting
guidelines and the forty five percent
debt to income ratio is pretty much
universal now the other word the lender
wants to take 40 maximum 45 percent of
your income the other what if you make
ten thousand dollars a month 4,500 of
that income can go toward your principal
interest tax insurance and any other
debt that you have so it is important
that if you're out there looking for the
property and you don't go out and lease
a car or you don't go buy a car just to
give you an example if you lease a car
with the four hundred and fifty dollars
car payment that would take a thousand
dollar of your income just out of the
equation remember 45% debt to income
ratio so to eliminate some of the deaths
I mean things like student loans and I
stabbed there's not much you can do
about it so we'll count those into your
ratio but you don't want to go out and
purchase new items just before you get
into contract the second C is credit and
it is crucial it's probably one of the
most important things that you need to
be careful i will highly recommend you
might want to go one of these free side
and run your own credit to see what your
credit rating is it's not as a specific
as what the lenders look that because we
go through three different companies to
pull your credit but the credit FICO
score if you haven't heard that it runs
anywhere from high 402 low 800 typically
anything under 680 considers a weak
credit score anything between 680 and
700 is okay between 700 to 720 it's good
over 720 is X
salon and typically on some product you
get a bit of a discount on interest rate
if your credit file goes over 740 so i
will highly recommend that you run your
credit at least once a year and if there
are issues on your credit that you need
to take care of do it the next one is
collateral that's the last see of the
underwriting collateral is basically the
appraisal value of the property when you
purchase a home the lender has just as
much of an investment if not more into
that transaction as you do especially if
you put in twenty percent done and the
lender come in with eighty percent
mortgage they want to make sure that the
house that you buying is worth the value
that you're paying for it they want to
make sure that there is no help and any
any kind of a health hazard exposed
electrical wiring things of that nature
the appraiser will look at those and
they come up with a value that is
acceptable to the lender and based on
that they move forward with the
processing of the mortgage the piti is
just a lingo that y'all I'm sure heard
of it stands for principal interest tax
and insurance going to mortgage deduct
ability none of us are tax accountant or
CPA s but generally up to a million
dollars on a first mortgage and up to a
hundred thousand dollars on a line of
credit that is used to improve the
property is fully tax-deductible along
with your property tax so that's as far
as the tax deductibility good it changes
from person to person obviously based on
your income by versus rent analysis we
sort of put a scenario here together for
you again I don't know whether or not
it's a good investment for you to buy
now or wait the rule of thumb is if I
mean the house prior to two thousand
seven when the property values were
going up every year no doubt invested in
property was
always a great idea as long as you're
not under a deadline to sell the
property let's say you say you think of
it hey in two years Google going to
transfer me to some other state what
perhaps it may not be a good idea for
you to buy if you have a deadline within
two years to sell it and move out you
may not recuperate the cost of that
purchase and sale but if it's a long
term it's your home it would make sense
perhaps to look into it more but in this
example x versus rent if you purchase a
home for about eight hundred thousand
dollars and put twenty percent download
are you looking at about six hundred and
forty thousand dollars mortgage roughly
at five and a quarter percent interest
your payment will be a little north of
thirty five hundred dollars a month
after the tax deductibility let's say
you make a hundred twenty thousand
dollars a year and you're at forty
percent tax bracket after the tax
deductibility that thirty five hundred
dollars a month is really equal to about
twenty four hundred dollars rent payment
when it comes to down payment Steve
mention about the amount of down payment
if you could come up with twenty percent
down you typically get the best program
and best rate now some of you may be a
little short of coming up with a
20-percent maybe you have only fifteen
percent so two ideas for those of you
who have a family member and the
underscore is family member it cannot be
your neighbor and not it cannot be other
googooli ins has to be a family member
grandparents parents brother sister who
really really loves you and are willing
to give you gift then you can go ahead
and come in with all twenty percent if
you put in twenty percent down payment
the whole twenty percent can be a gift
if you put in less than twenty percent
down and say you put in ten percent on
hold on then the five percent has to be
your own fund the other five person can
be a gift fund another idea let's say
you
seventeen percent down payment and you
really want to push it to twenty percent
to get the best program and let's say
you have fifty thousand dollars worth of
401 K here in a lot of institution you
can borrow against the 401 K the beauty
of it is because you pay back to your
own fund we don't debt service you for
that payment so if you have a $300
payment to pay back on that loan against
your 401k we don't count that as a death
against you so it won't go against your
debt to income ratio property tax
typically these are the things that you
need to consider when you're looking at
the property on top of your payment your
property tax depending on which county
or with slee you buy it runs 11 from
1.125 to one and a quarter percent of
the sales price so you're buying an
eight hundred thousand dollar property
at one and a quarter percent that's
about ten thousand dollars a year now
you pay that semi-annually 5,000 every
six months or you can have the lender
collect that money 112 of it every month
on top of your mortgage payment so you
don't have to worry about it escrow this
is I'm sure some of you have heard
escrow company is a neutral third party
that gets the information from the buyer
from the seller from the lender from
your realtor organize all of that to
make sure your close escrow successfully
Steve thank you much okay I'd like to go
over the mortgage process and indeed
notice the word process in the olden
days when we started we literally could
close escrow sometimes in two weeks
sometimes a week but those days have
changed so the process basically starts
with you guys we give you a very
detailed list of items that are needed
pay stubs w2s tax returns asset
statements and then we set an
appointment up it's always great to meet
my recommendation with your mortgage
loan officer faced
days because you can see how they work
with you how you interact and I think
just creating that bond is really really
powerful because you are actually buying
you know pretty big ticket item so now
we get all your financials we run your
credit and it's our job the mortgage
loan officer to go ahead and see that
all the documentation that you've
provided fits into our current lending
mortgage guidelines so there's boxes and
matrices and we make sure everything
fits out and then we have a dialogue of
what you're comfortable with buying I
always like to know whether I always
start up front with you what are your
goals and opportunities what you see
yourself doing is it a condo is it a
townhome is a single-family residence
what price point do you see yourself at
because that gives me some grounding as
to where you are thinking and then I
could take all the documentation and
consideration and start kind of forming
this path if you will so once we get all
that and you leave and you know you
could buy a million-dollar home you're
happy basically I take that file and I
create a beautiful working document
notice the word beautiful it's all about
you and what I'm doing is representing
your file to our processing team and
then to our underwriting team there's a
very detailed cover letter that goes
over the goals of what you're trying to
accomplish I explain anything in the
file that may be outside of guidelines
possibly showing it as a compensating
factor of consideration and then it goes
into processing so processing is
actually a job function they're called
processors and what they do is they take
all of that data and a key it into an
origination system and a bank of america
we call it i originated so that is a
second set of eyes that are looking at
the documentation of which you provided
and which i released to them once that's
entered in they do what's called all the
variable verifications they order the
appraisals they check whatever they need
to check and there's a lot of things
they check the fourth phase is
underwriting now underwriting is a
specific job function they're called
underwriters the reason is they have to
take all of his data now and ensure that
it fits all of fannie mae and freddie
mac's current lending guidelines because
when I call out and say congratulations
your loan is a peru
that means they stamped off on that loan
as an approval and I will not call out
an approval until we have that nor will
Ahmad until that part is complete so
underwriting definitely is an important
part of the process now you're all happy
a final approval the appraisal came in
you're really excited you're picking out
paint now we go to documentation that's
a different Department called our loan
doc department they run all the loan
documentation which you'll be signing at
the title company and once that's
complete we go through the sign off its
called a sign off the loan comes back to
the lender it goes into a final review
final quality could control check and
then the loan funds your loan funds one
day prior to you owning the home and
then the next day you go on record at
the county recorders office and that's a
really happy day so I'm happy to call
you in the loans funded and then a
realtor will be elated to call you when
you go on record and then you're
entitled to the keys to the property so
that is the process and we wanted to
highlight that because it's not as if
you just meet with one of us and kind of
just walk over here and make it all
happen and it's done no there's
different legs that it has to go through
to achieve the end result so that's the
mortgage process a mod back to closing
costs so the last part of our
presentation at least would as far as
the lender goes is the closing fees so
you need to budget for besides the
twenty percent down payment or minimum
of three and a half percent you need to
budget for closing costs and what's
called reserve and i categorize those in
three parts number one is what we call
lender fees lender fees is consist of
appraisal fee credit fee tax service fee
processing leaders so many fees that
they have different names for it but
combining those it's pretty set for
instance with bank of america it's
somewhere between fourteen hundred
dollars to 1700 hours depending on the
size of the property and the value of
the property so you need to budget for
that the second thing is the title and
escrow fees title and escrow fee is
vastly varies
which County you're buying it depending
on whether or not you're santa clara
county or san mateo county it could cost
thousands of dollars different for
instance Santa Clara County the seller
pays eighty percent of the title and
escrow fee San Mateo County the buyer
pays all of those be Southern California
they're two different escrow company and
title company Northern California they
are all the same so you need to figure
out what stage of what County your mind
and your Realtor can come up with those
fees from the title company or your
lender can come up with those fees for
you you also need to budget if you're
buying a single family for things like
fire insurance if your property is in a
flood zone you need to be prepared to
purchase flood insurance the last part
of the closing fees is if you know the
difference between well first of all how
long you aren't going to keep that
property if you are going to keep the
property for a long time it may make
sense for you to pay some points up
front I'm sure you've heard our points
versus no point loan simply give you an
example if if we provide you with the
interest rate or for example five and a
quarter percent for a 30-year fixed on a
conforming loan at zero point you can
reduce that interest rate from five and
a quarter to five percent but it costs
you one point each point is one percent
of the loan amount so at close of escrow
let's say you take you buying a house
for eight hundred thousand dollars
you've taken a six hundred forty
thousand dollars mortgage and you choose
to pay one point that's sixty four
hundred dollars additional funds you
need to come into escrow width and the
calculation that we do typically you say
well I see myself living in this
property for the next ten years points
are fully tax-deductible so when you
take the after deduction of costs at
that point if it takes you two years to
recoup
at that point and then for the next
eight years you will have a lower
interest rate obviously that's
worthwhile doing but if your time period
it's shorter than that you thinking of
just keeping the property for three
years it may not be worth one for you to
pay points with that I will pass it on
to suvidha okay
yeah okay so now after you've met with
Stephen Ahmad or with a loan officer you
should be coming away with knowing how
much you can afford to pay out pay for a
house or a condo so hopefully you will
have in your mind the maximum price that
not only your approved for and you
should have a loan pre-approval letter
but also what you're comfortable
spending you know they all have gone
over what your monthly payments will be
and all that and so in your mind you
know how much down payment you have
hopefully you have a dollar amount that
you're willing to spend on a house okay
so that's your target amount that you
feel like you can afford to spend so now
it's the fun part now you're going to go
look around and see what you can
actually get for that price and that's
the next step of really deciding if it's
the right time to rent or to buy so the
first step would be to just start
fiddling around online there's a lot of
sites mlslistings calm zillow trulia you
can just start plugging in your price
range and i would suggest when you first
start searching online to go up a little
bit in price so maybe you're you're you
know cap you think is eight hundred
thousand dollars maybe search up to
900,000 or even a million for a couple
of reasons one sometimes houses will
come on at that price and then
ultimately sell for a lower price and
then also it kind of helps to know what
you could get for your target price and
also what you could get for a little bit
more because it could be that when you
start searching you say gosh I just
can't find anything i liked for eight
hundred thousand dollars i mean i'd be
better off renting my rental is a lot
better than whatever i could afford for
800,000 but you know for 900 or a
million those houses are looking pretty
good and about a year from now i
probably could afford that so you know
that would be in that case maybe you
would wait a year before you want to buy
something or maybe you say well you know
for 800,000 i can actually get a small
house in a great neighborhood where i'd
love to stay and I know
Oh in about two or three years you know
some of my stock options will vest or
whatever i'll have some extra cash so
that maybe i can have that great house
or that small house in a great
neighborhood and then in a couple years
i can expand it remodel it and actually
stay in that house so you know it all
kind of factors into your decision about
whether it's the right time now to buy
or just to continue to rent so searching
online kind of gives you a general sense
for what's out there but i'd be careful
when you search online because first of
all if you I'm going to pay too much
attention to the value some of those
zillow's and some of those sites give
you their valuations are often not you
know really accurate but those sites are
good as far as you know you can see
what's available and also you can go
oftentimes they have maps google maps
you can you know check things out there
but then i would suggest finding a
realtor to talk to you to really then go
through with you the ins and outs of the
different neighborhoods you know what
the school districts are like you know
what kind of shopping is nearby just you
know really explain to you kind of the
nuances of the neighborhoods and that's
why it is important to find a realtor
who is familiar with your target areas
and as a buyer it really does make sense
to work with the realtor because you
don't pay the Commission's the seller is
the one who pays the realtor commissions
and sometimes buyers think well I could
save money still if I just go maybe I'll
go to an open house see a house I like
and I'll just go straight to the realtor
holding the open house and say okay why
don't you just kind of write up the
offer for me and all somehow I'll save
money and you actually don't save money
that way what happens in that case is
that felicitations the seller's realtor
just keeps both sides of the commission
they keep six percent instead of giving
three percent to a buyer's realtor so
and then you're not represented as a
buyer so it actually I mean honestly
doesn't save you any money so it really
does make sense i mean you know a
realtor especially of buyers realtors in
the business of looking at houses you
know researching the market you know
understanding kind of the nuances of the
neighborhoods
so the first step would be to talk to
friends who may be live in those areas
and get referrals for a realtor meet a
few people see if you have some sort of
rapport with with the agent you're going
to be spending a lot of time with that
person so you know like anything you
want someone who you kind of connect
with but I think a realtor more than
even more than a loan officer or anyone
else you're really going to be spending
a lot of time with that person driving
around it can often be a stressful
period of time for people when they're
buying a house oftentimes people are you
know under heavy stress and sometimes
the realtor could be kind of sued being
sort of counseling you through the
process I've actually become very good
Fred some of my closest friends are
clients of mine because you just spend
so much time with them during a
stressful time then if they end up
buying houses you know near me in my
neighborhood well then we become friends
so that's kind of nice and then once you
do have a realtor then you know it's
good to work as productively with that
person as possible like anyone I mean
just give them feedback be responsive
and the more you give back and the more
you show them that you're serious the
more they'll put out for you and a lot
of Realtors can find out about
properties before they come on the
market they know good strategies if
there's multiple offer situations and
and things like that so and then another
thing when you are looking at houses it
really is important to consider resale
value even though you think you might be
in a house forever chances are you won't
and even if you have no kids say today
you might think well I don't really care
about school district I don't have any
kids but when the time comes to sell the
house what what the school district is
has a huge impact on the property values
and then also who knows maybe you might
not have kids today but you might have
kids you know five years from now or
something and still be living in that
property and the same thing is if you
buy a house in some sort of questionable
type location like on a busy street near
train tracks near in
cereal area near something else those
types of factors are always going to
impact property values when you try to
sell the house and in a tougher market
the properties that are in more marginal
locations have more difficulty selling
so let's assume then that you've decided
okay i want to i want to buy a house and
so the way it would work is you'd have
your realtor their search browsers with
you showing you houses at the same time
you should be doing your own research
and looking at as many houses as
possible going to open house is
continuing to search online the more you
know about the market and what's out
there the more prepared you'll be to act
when you finally find that right house
I've had several instances over the
years where I've had clients and you
know I know what's out there and so I'll
show them a house that I know is exactly
what they're looking for and they see it
and they love it but unfortunately it's
the first house they saw and you know
most people just feel like they can't
just buy the first house they see they
feel like well gosh I need to go look at
all my options if the first house I saw
is the best house how do I know you know
this is easy how do I know I won't find
ten houses that are just as good or
better and so it and they have a good
point they do people need to feel like
they've explored all their options but
unfortunately sometimes by the time they
explore the options then that first
house which was the perfect one is gone
and you can't really avoid that but I
think what you can do is once you get
serious about looking for a house really
try to get out there and see as many
things as you can so then hopefully when
the right house does come along you will
be ready to act because in today's
market the hot properties right now are
actually getting multiple offers and are
selling so in Palo Alto say anything
under 1.3 million is a very popular
price range and so a lot of those any
good house that comes on in that price
range is probably selling within a week
after coming on the market often
multiple offers so to really have a
chance you have to be able to see a
house and then be ready to act on it so
to be ready to act be prepared to act to
be ready to act you need to have done
your research looked a lot of Alice's
know the market no this is the house I
want to go for you also have to be
pre-approved for a loan you have to have
a Priam a loan pre-approval letter
letter from a reputable vendor no seller
is going to take you seriously and want
to consider your offer unless you have a
strong pre-approval letter I mean from
like a bank of america or some really
strong lender that's the best so then if
once you find the house in California or
in this area it's a little different
from some other areas so in this area
the seller actually gets property
inspections upfront before they even
list the house so once you find a house
that you're interested in you ask for
what's called it's called a disclosure
package and they'll be a whole package
where the seller will have filled out a
bunch of disclosures disclosing
everything they know about the property
that's you know that would be relevant
to you and then they'll have a whole
property inspection that talks about
about a 30 page report talking about the
condition of the property and also a
termite report sometimes a roof report
you know some other reports so you'll
have the opportunity to review all this
and really know about the condition of
the property before you make your offer
so you'll have to then sign all that
sign the contract have your pre-approval
letter and then if there are multiple
offers that's where their strategy
involved that you'll talk with your
Realtor about you know how to make your
offer look better than the others
besides just price and actually that's
where a realtor especially one who has
been successful in multiple offer
situations can have huge values actually
I mean at that point honestly who your
Realtor is could be critical because all
the other realtors in the area know each
other and they kind of know
who they can trust who has a good
reputation okay so then you make the
offer could be some counter offers going
back and forth let's assume the seller
then finally accepts your offer so then
at that point you're in contract and
that's what we're you're also in escrow
you would then have to write a check for
three percent of the purchase price that
you deposit in escrow and escrow is
really here in Northern California
escrow is really the same as the title
company the escrow company the title
company are the same thing so basically
it's one neutral third party who takes
in all the money and just organizes and
handles the whole transfer of the
property so you put your three percent
to pause into the title company and then
at that point the escrow period stars is
usually a on average 30 days during that
time the lender is getting all their
loan documents together you organize
your homeowners your fire casualty
insurance you get your utilities
transferred you know contact your
current landlord give notice you
basically have 30 days to get ready to
move and then in Northern California
again how it's a little different you'll
go sign off at the title company about
four or five days before close of escrow
and you sign off on all the loan
documents and the other escrow documents
and then you'll arrange to wire in the
rest of your down payment money and then
after you've done that three or four
days before close of escrow that's it
you don't have to do anything else
nothing happens on the day of closing in
some states on the day of closing
everyone sits down and signs but in
California or at least in Northern
California none of that happens so a few
days before sign off then day of closing
simply the title company sends someone
one of their people down to the county
recorders office and records the grant
deed which is the deed granting title
from the seller to the buyer and once
that's recorded with the county
recorders office that escrow has closed
and you own the property and you get the
keys and
move and you're happy so anyway that's
basically the process of deciding
whether to buy and buying a house so now
we'll just open it up to questions does
anyone have a question yes you mentioned
that a realtor might help your offer
look more attractive to a seller in ways
other than just raising the offer price
so what are some of the ways in which
you're that could happen like what are
some of the things you could put in your
offer to make yourself more attractive
in the contract there are continuing
their contingencies so some offers will
have contingencies where you say I make
an offer but I want a week to do my even
though the sellers already provided
inspections I want another week to do my
own inspections seven-day property
condition contingency or I want a
contingency for financing I want 14 days
to make sure I'm really pre-approved for
a loan so those are contingencies so of
course the fewer contingencies or the
shorter the contingency period the more
attractive the offer some properties you
might take as is that means you're you
still can put up a contingency period to
do inspections but then once you've and
let me back up the contingencies if you
have a contingency period is a period of
time say for property inspection or
financing during which if you just if
you discovered something during that
time that you didn't like you could pull
out of the contract and you would not
lose your three percent deposit so
sellers don't really like contingencies
because basically until the
contingencies are removed you can still
pull out of the contract and get your
full deposit back but once you remove
contingencies then if you were to pull
out of the contract you would lose your
three percent deposit but anyway so
contingencies is one way you shorten the
contingency period or no contingencies
in a highly competitive situation also
as is
versus not as is as is means you're
willing to take the property in whatever
condition it is in at the time you enter
into the contract and the seller doesn't
have to fix anything or you know do
anything else but vs. not as is would
mean the seller has to fix a lot of
things before close of escrow so
obviously sellers don't like that as
much the shorter the period of close of
escrow is important and that's where it
depends you'd have to talk with your
lender to see you know how quickly you
can get a loan of course if you can pay
on cash especially in this type of
market I mean all cash is the best I
mean sellers of course love all cash
because that means there's no there's no
uncertainty regarding the loan at all
and also you tend to be able to close
escrow faster you know sellers want to
get their money as quickly as possible
those are kind of the main things and
then there's kind of the intangibles and
this and these intangibles are actually
are more important than you think again
just the other Realtors kind of knowing
each other knowing what realtors they
can kind of trust who they believe have
user villagers have a reputation to
probably have more trustworthy clients
who and the realtors are just known that
they'll get the job done versus others
are known to be a little flakier and
you're just always not certain what's
going to happen with that transaction
because when a seller goes into contract
the main thing they want they just want
to make sure that thing closes they want
to make sure the transaction goes
through like it's supposed to and you
close escrow the worst thing that for a
seller is to go into contractor than
have the buyer back out because then it
just changed the whole property it just
is a mess so anyway those are some of
the things so I hear a lot about the
resale value and and how you should
consider these evaluating your going in
but you isn't that priced into the price
of the house like I hear like condos
have a very low resale value but that
means you're paying less for a to write
so so why is why is recent value
different than the value you're paying
for the house but now that's a good
point and actually that was something I
originally was even going to touch on I
mean it is a good point if you're if
you're buying right now and
you are you're paying less anyway so if
you truly are buying a property at a
discount so for instance if you're in a
bad school district or you have some
naked if you're on a busy street next to
the train tracks or something like that
if you are paying right now that
discounted lower price for that property
then and knowing that when you sell it
you're also going to you know be selling
for discount then you're okay so
actually in today's market probably you
would be okay where you would get into
trouble more trouble would be in some
markets when the market is really
booming so say in 2008 one everything
was selling it just didn't matter where
you were those types of markets you
might end up buying one of these condos
or these houses that in a pad school
district and you might not be buying it
for a discount and then when the market
goes down and it's a bad market it's
those types of marginal locations that
really go down even further than the
others and so that's where then you'll
just have to wait longer until the
market picks back up before you can sell
if you want to try to recoup your price
so question in San Francisco wait hello
hi are there any good Wiz or online
tools to rate neighborhoods or to find
good school districts or basically just
what are the neighborhood valuation
tools that consumers should be using
well you can definitely look for the
school district so you can online you
should be able to figure out what school
districts is in and then there's their
sites grade schools calm and there are a
couple of sites where you can look up
schools and get all their test scores
but even then it's helpful to talk to a
realtor because sometimes the test
scores alone don't really tell the full
story I mean in the elementary schools
and middle schools probably it's called
the api score you know if you want
something i dealing the 900s or the high
800
those are usually considered strong
school districts but there's also you
know a lot of other factors the high
schools it gets a little more marginal
for instance i live in menlo park and
our public high school is called
menlo-atherton and if you look at the
average sort of test scores api medium
median test scores and they're not super
high and that's because we bust a lot of
kids in from East Palo Alto East Meadow
Park you know where they would have
lower scores but the people who are in
the know know that actually that school
has very strong AP classes I mean many
kids who go on to the top colleges it
just that you know a lot of the kids
give about so we have very strong AP
classes but also many kids who pull down
two scores and so even though the you
might look up online and see the average
scores are not high in reality you know
that could be still a very good high
school for a good student but yeah so I
think it's mostly that online would be
you look at the schools as far as the
neighborhood I don't know I can do I'm
not sure I think you really would always
just have to talk to people who really
know the neighborhoods to really
understand that I don't know if an
online site for that so the length of
escrow is determined by what there are
some you know 30-day close of escrow
there are some 45 days like who
determines that and what can a buyer due
to reduce it if they want to that's one
question the other question I had for
armor then steve is regarding a mod cage
like hunting or you know looking for the
best mortgage when is the time to do
that because I hear conflicting things
that you know when you made an offer and
you're in contract you don't have time
to really start looking at that time you
should have done it before but how do
you do it before when there is no
property that you will be you know given
a consistent rate on right the
pre-approval doesn't come with the rate
it so first of all answer the length of
close of escrow and then I'll let these
guys answer your other question that's
just something that's new
the length of time for close of escrow
is just something that's negotiated in
the contract it's put in the contract a
lot depends on how fast the lender can
get the loan pre approved and it really
so actually that's almost the main thing
is it's really so actually maybe you
guys should talk about that it's really
probably more up to how fast you can get
the loan if you're paying all cash you
know some people close within a few days
although even all cash there still are
logistical things you need to get
together you would probably still put a
week or two but so 30 days to 45 days
you know people will accept sellers tend
to not want to go much longer than that
if possible just because too many things
can happen if you have a long close of
escrow 60 days I mean they're just too
many variables suddenly the whole market
could tank and I mean just you know and
then to sell the buyer could just panic
i mean just people get uncomfortable
letting the period go more than really
about 45 days butta let these guys to
answer that question regarding when it's
a good buy really if you look at last 40
decades for the kids I'm sorry 70s 80s
90s typically when you get the market
that is down the other word the prices
are down is typically because the
interest rate is very high this is such
a unique market that not only property
values are down but also the interest is
down we don't know how long the proud of
the interest rate going to stay down but
that creates an opportunity for those of
you who are perhaps been waiting not to
wait any longer if you're going to keep
the house for a long time as far as the
45 verses 30 days 30 days when you log
into your interest rate once you're in
the property once you're in contract
30-day interest rate 30-day interest
lock is cheaper than 45 day 45 days
cheaper than 60 day it is crucial for
you to do your homework and that goes to
pre approval
you seriously considering purchasing a
home within the next six months talked
to El and their get pre-approved and if
anyone for instance bank of america if
you talk to us we'll put on our sites so
on a weekly basis on a daily basis you
can monitor the interest rate on your
specific kind of a loan and see the
direction of the interest rate you can't
lock it until your employee in contract
but you can sort of follow the trend of
the interest rate and then you can do
your comparison call to three different
banks and find the haight today on this
particular rate where are you that's the
base of comparison before you get into
the Contra got home answer your question
thanks a lot I also think once I can
please to answer the little more then
it's really important that you hook up
with someone that you can work with
because we find that there's many
lenders out there that promise you the
moon and they cannot deliver so I
caution you with that make sure you talk
to a reputable lender bank of america
we're doing bank of america loans but
i've been a broker before but that
broker model right now has changed
drastically because you broke her alone
to a different entity you're subject to
all their underwriting guidelines and
you may not know it as well as you know
your own so we're typically going to be
within an eighth of anything you find
out there and our pricing just FYI at
all you right now is extremely extremely
attractive so just peek get involved
with someone that you know you can work
with and that you trust so I have a very
basic question maybe you mentioned and
cover the debt to income ratios arm in
that context at least as far as bank of
america is concerned what exactly
constitutes income because I guess a lot
of people in the room will be in a
situation where they have a certain base
salary and it might just be a third of
their income or something and so far
from different lenders I've heard while
conflicting or against a conflicting
information might depend on the lender
some go with thirty-six percent but
they're willing to take into account
your bonus
some take forty five percent but they're
only looking at your belly Bay celery
maybe you could explain that in an
elaborate a little bit as to what
exactly constitutes income for bank of
america excellent that is a fantastic
question because we run into that all
the time so when it comes to income
first of all it there's different if
you're self-employed versus if you're
employed if you are self-employed will
take your adjusted gross if you are
employed like you guys are we take your
gross income now within your gross
income your base salary is set we'll
take the full base salary as if you get
the razors or whatever as of last month
we'll take that salary what varies
vastly is your bonus and other income
you liquids stock every six months or
whatever anything else that varies we
need to have two years history of that
and we will average that do I answer
your question on that excellent hi I
have to really basic questions so the
first one is our property taxes and
interest is that deductible for state
tax calculation purposes and the second
question is generally is there a
prepayment penalty associated if we want
to make like more than the monthly
payment at any given point in time for
loans as far as a prepayment penalty
from lender to lender some lenders do
have prepayment penalty generally these
days you find you really need to look to
find a lender that has a prepayment
penalty but that's excellent question if
you want to avoid that you should take a
loan that does not have a prepayment
penalty bank of america does none of our
loans have prepayment penalty you can
take the loan you can pay it off or pay
down the next day six months down the
road you're such an question i'm sorry
was well owe taxes and insurance again
i'm not a cpa but in at least a state of
cali
your property taxes are fully
tax-deductible even for state tax
purposes or just federal taxes I just
give you in a nutshell I won't get to
the detail I'm sorry thank you sure if
we were to borrow some money from the
401k do we need to pay interest do you
pay interest yes you do pay interest but
you pay it back to yourself then do I
need to return those among money to my
account typically what happens you
borrow against your 401k and typical the
general guideline is this you cannot
borrow more than fifty thousand dollars
so let's say you had a
two-hundred-thousand-dollar 401k the
guidelines typically will allow you to
borrow up to fifty thousand dollars of
which time they'll start out of your
monthly paycheck paying that loan back
at a very attractive rate by the way so
you end up paying it back through time
as long as you're employed if you were
to leave that particular employer then
depending on what you do with that 401k
plan whether you roll into another 401k
you'll either have to bring in money to
pay that off or they'll just take it out
of the valuation at that time of that
401k but it's great because it does come
out of your payroll I heard as fifty
percent is that fifty percent were fifty
thousand dollars fifty you know what
every company is different typically
it's up to fifty percent not to exceed
50,000 it's one of those double
guidelines okay I also heard that it's
not a good idea to our money from your
401k to buy a house what's the reason
for that um we've had a lot of clients
do it it's a very inexpensive source of
funds so if you're short and you really
want to get into a property I mean I
think it's a great idea I'm because they
charge you typically three to four
percent sometimes five percent it comes
out of your pay automatically every
month so and it gets paid off pretty
fast so we see a lot of clients doing
that I've actually done it way back when
on a home that my wife and I purchased
one of our first homes and I worked out
really well for us thank you you're
welcome
hi can you talk about any differences
that exist between borrowing from your
401 K versus IRA the IR again we're not
tax pros on this but i do know in the
IRA typically does not have a borrowing
provision against it there are some
guidelines that allow first-time buyers
to take funds out but i'm not exactly
sure whether there's it what kind of tax
consequence would be associated with
that my recommendation to you would be
to call the IRA administrator plan
administrator and just say hey listen
i'm thinking of buying a home what's the
pros and cons of borrowing against that
a law in conjunction with your 401 k
plan okay in addition to the down
payment how much money should i have set
aside so that's a good question so down
payment is one component and then
there's something they call reserves so
reserves typically represents if the
loans up to seven hundred and
twenty-nine thousand dollars you need
two months reserves which is
post-closing funds put aside and that
includes principal interest taxes and
insurance on the subject property the
home you to spot now will typically it
needs to be liquid but they will also
take non liquid funds IE or 401k or
retirement but then they only take sixty
percent of the value of that account to
establish those reserves when you go up
to between one and two million dollar
loan amount that bumps up to 12 months
reserves now part of your question I
think maybe as far as closing costs
above beyond the downpayment what you
need no just no just the residual yeah
the lender want to see I have yes so two
months typically is a requirement up 27
29 up to a million I think it goes to
six and then a million 22 it goes to 12
and then two million to three million
it's 24 and then if we're gonna do three
million 25 million they want you to
establish some funds with Bank of
America one more question how long is a
good at the pre approval before so the
pretty good question typically it's 60
days but what I tell my clients is this
if you're in the hunt and nothing
significantly changes in your financial
profile you didn't go by that Ferrari
you didn't go buy a boat you
basically everything still constant and
nothing's really changed radically that
pre-approval will go on what I do
encourage you to do though is call your
lender and get an update on rates
because rates are indicative of your
purchasing power as rates go up you lose
more buying power its rates go down you
gain buying power so I would always
check in with them you know if you think
you found this home and you're gonna put
an offer on it definitely it should be
one of your first calls what a rates
look like everything is the same my down
payments gone up a mite good to go okay
one more question sure so how long does
a loan process let's say I didn't do
pre-approval one dad just show up as a I
went alone how long does it take okay so
you just show up my door and you know
you're qualified new you're in contract
on home i will close your purchase deal
in 30 days if you said steve can i
closed it in 15 right now the answer
would be no that's kind of what running
is 30 now hi so my question is how do
you thought of somebody qualify for the
FHA loan and between and that end to the
arm and the fixed-rate mortgage in what
condition which one is more permanent
beneficial you want you an answer you
want so the FHA you qualify as you do
you qualify for any other loan we look
at all the same information that we went
through today you have to have the
capacity to make the payments we look at
income the debt to income ratio is
slightly lower on an FHA loan it's
forty-three percent versus 45 but the
guidelines are typically the same as far
as what underwriting looks at the
benefit is you basically get down with
lower down payments and the rates are
actually really attractive because just
because you're borrowing ninety-seven
percent the property doesn't mean the
rates going to be bad it's going to be
right in line with eighty percent loan
so now regarding different loan types
kind of depends like a modest saying
when how long you think are going to be
in the property 30-year fixed-rate loans
right now or at a 42 year low bar none
rates are extremely attractive we
thought they were low last year they
have stayed this low this year so most
clients say I want to get out of an arm
right now and go into a 30-year fixed
but there is that by our first time
buyer that's going to go into a property
and say you know what Steve this is a
good three to five-year property for me
and if the rate differential which it is
is about three quarters of a point
between a five-year arm and the 30-year
fixed and you know that's not your last
property there's a lot of money to be
saved there so we do see clients kind of
tiptoeing back into the a RM market a
bit and it just when it comes down to is
just your comfort level of payments you
need to be comfortable with what you're
doing because that bill shows up every
30 days whether you like it or not they
answer your questions okay great
hopefully this isn't something I missed
at the beginning is there any negative
associated with getting multiple
pre-approvals like from multiple banks
just so you if you compare rates the
time and go through quickly and negative
you say well yeah the the negative part
of that is you do not want to run your
credit over a number because every time
you run your credit it affects your FICO
score it goes lower so you can talk to
the lenders to three lenders I mean not
a whole many of us left after two
thousand seven you can talk to a couple
of lenders and you choose who you feel
most comfortable but have just one
lender run your credit one lender do the
pre-approval for you for those of you
who perhaps come up with questions
afterward we have some cards and some
fires on the back and you more than
welcome to call us email us anything we
can help you that's what we're here for
anything we can help you with any
question we can answer email us and
we'll respond back to you right away any
other question a quick follow-up to the
previous question so what really
determines the rate difference between
that's a wells fargo and bank of america
what's the difference so if i if you
both run my credit scores and you see
the same financials how do you this I
mean who would i go with really
different so our secondary market prices
all of our loans and it depends what
kind of profitability they have in the
loan just the rates that show up on our
desk every day we're actually on our
computer every day so typically wells
fargo is a well-priced lender as
is Bank of America and there's normally
not a huge variance between that now we
as mortgage loan officers have the
capacity to help borrowers out with
pricing if need be and we will do that
based on certain pricing promotions they
have on a given month sometimes day and
sent a certain product over another
product and that typically drives up but
most lenders most of the big lenders are
priced pretty much in parity right now I
mean they may you may find an 8th lower
you may find an 8th hire some of the
boutique lenders these private banks if
you bring large deposits to their bank
sometimes they'll just tailor a loan
that then possibly we can't compete with
but other than that I mean it's
typically all driven by our secondary
markets with the bond yields doing
junction with the stock market and we're
you know typically right there you want
to add any of that yeah I'm independent
lender to lender up bank of america at
least right now we are extremely
competitive on a purchase market so i
really don't lose a loan to a competitor
if you're in a contract purchasing the
property and you say another one a
30-year fixed-rate mortgage I doubt very
much that if we lose that to a price
because we have some flexibility there
anything else
okay well thank you all and we've left
