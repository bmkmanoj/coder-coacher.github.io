talking here about an operating system
we started developing like five years
six years ago more or less it was
actually inspired by another operating
system called BOS you probably heard of
it I know some of you did because
actually working on it and we will try
to show you we try to explain the wise
than house and home in whose of this
operating system and especially why we
do believe that it's a good idea to
continue developing it and in the same
spirit that being corporated who create
a BOS originally I started working a did
work on it so my name is Bruno I'm
actually the open BFFs sting lead which
is the file system that we use all its
design was actually created by being
corporated we just stole it more or less
and reimplemented is from scratch we
also will have here micro Phipps which
is the our project leader he actually
created all this we have axial doerfler
who is our main Cardinal engineer and he
is responsible for most books that we
have but also things but he's
responsible for most of the stuff we
have working and we have also our
marketing guy here he won't be talking
but ahemadi have been helping us to get
this stuff done and everything else so
we have the presence here of someone who
without whom I I think we would not be
here because he ate was his vision we
started all this with BOS and everything
so I would like to invite young
leadership to say some words for for us
so please
Thank you Thank You Bruno good a good
afternoon it's quite i should say quite
quite moving and amusing at the same
time i see some faces of people I've
worked with at Abby and others as well
and to be to be inside the Googleplex to
have this talk about the vos iz VFS the
haiku my english not so good that are
getting so to have this discussion of a
haiku is is quite interesting i I went
before coming here I went of course to
the to the website to the new to the new
website and the screenshots where where
where are quite impressive and then I
saw some some screenshots on the screen
here so it's a it brings all sorts of
memories for from my perspective on this
is not so much about nostalgia you know
the joke about nostalgia it's not what
it used to be it's a so I'm sorry I
couldn't help it's it's it's about
pushing the the technology into all
sorts of directions because you know if
he if it were left to a certain company
we would still have an operating system
with three letters and a graphic shell
on top of that that that operating
system because that would be revising it
there would be no competition there
would be no no need Ling and no
agitation of ideas I don't want to use
the D word because it been it's been
overused in the state of California so I
I try not to not to do that but you you
want an equal say technology ecosystem
that has all sort of you know alive
components and the combination of those
components sometimes yields unexpected
results and look at look at the company
that hosts us today you know I remember
when when these guys the founders went
to see the venture guys I'm now one
you know I went over to the dark side
I'm a vulture capitalist the people at
from the bdays recall that I had two
pigs on my desk right in 91 I hated the
VC so much that I bought I was in France
on vacation I went by an antique store
and I had the start so i bought these
two ceramic pigs you know
turn-of-the-century costumes you know
one as a butcher the other one is a
cattle merchant and I call them Victor
and Charles V you know very subtle so
when when the entrepreneurs now give me
guff about about you know the venture
guys I take them to visit Victor and
Charles but the interesting thing is
that this company came to see the
venture guys and the venture guys ah we
have search engines already you know we
have alta vista we have yahoo buzz off
actually they use another word before
off same number of letters and and we
know of course with a with perfect
hindsight we know what happened so the
maintaining or developing strange
components and the technology seen is
precious sometimes that doesn't apply to
to haiku but I used to say that there is
no culture there is no good culture
without bad taste this is not about
haiku but there's nope there is no
culture without people i'm not going to
use the the pushing the e word either
because that's that's been that's been
abused there is no there is no good
culture without people trying something
new trying something you're different so
it's quite it's quite precious to to do
this so are you i feel very touched to
be to be invited here I see Steve
Horowitz and we have great memories of
being on stage together Steve giving a
demonstration that get that got us a
standing ovation at at agenda in in 95
where we thought we were dying
a few weeks before if it hadn't been for
Leah Lorenzo know who was the producer
of agenda the company would be dead she
pushed me and pushed me and pushed me to
come and give a demo to agenda and that
gave the engineers that at be a push
that they thought I was crazy and please
they thought I was crazy this was
impossible and everybody rushed and
finally delivered you know it's a class
it's a classic and in our business you
you have an insane deadline and as a
result good the good things happen so
thanks for having me today thanks for
the haiku team first for choosing such a
nice name for for the effort I think I
think it's quite poetic if I can if I
can if I can use the word and on to the
next host the next speaker okay Michael
so thank you very much I just wanted to
remind you guys that this presentation
will actually be sent to google video
and everything so no confidential talk
here to avoid any problems and actually
the original name we thought about was
Walter but no one liked that so we got
with haiku so just so you know so i
would like to call them Michael Phipps
our project leader to talk now and by we
women Bruno no one else like the name I
promise no bad puns so you've been
spared that at least so haiku what is it
all about it's a new OS and
interestingly enough based on new OS
written by a former be engineer named
Travis it's our first release will be
binary backward compatible with Bo sr5
and a lot of people have looked at that
and sort of tilted their head and said
why I'm sure there can't possibly be any
software still worth having in truth
there are a few reasons for binary
backward compatibility one is to keep us
honest make sure we don't accidentally
something or forget something another
possible good reason is that there are a
few applications left that we don't have
source for we have a custom kernel
design for responsiveness I just came
from a Linux conference and I love Linux
I use it all the time but there colonel
is designed for a number of situations
our kernel is optimized for
responsiveness with something like Linux
you when you want to make a linux
desktop you pile X Windows on top you
pile gnome or KDE on top or
enlightenment or a number of different
environments we think that by creating a
unified and cohesive interface we can go
one step better and bring a little bit
better user interface to the user we go
for the best defaults not maximum
maximum configurability you know any
cases where we can choose what most
people will like and either avoid the
option or have an option only in an
obscure place is a little bit better
than may be presenting a user with 2,000
checkboxes and we're open source MIT
licensed we believe that that will give
us the best opportunity for expanding
the haiku ecosystem how does haiku
compared to BOS r5 we implement the
entire are five public lay out a but we
have some extensions some things like UI
layout which I know was coming in BOS
are six but we sort of went our own way
there because we didn't have access and
we have a disk device API that makes it
a little bit easier to do things like
partitioning we have drivers for current
hardware something again that I'm sure
be would have had had the time come
around we've added complete USB 1.1 and
two point O support we have SATA we have
basically all of the current video
drivers covered at ac97 audio another
item that be i'm sure was and i know for
a fact was working on was networking in
the kernel and we knew that that was the
right way to go so we were able to
implement that
another item that I'm sure Dominic was
really interested in was the file
caching integrated with virtual memory
it scales a little better so if you have
a lot of memory you can get some
performance benefits and it also means
that applications will not have to load
twice in some circumstances we have
vector based icons and this is something
that a lot of people are implementing
now because with ever-growing monitors
it's nice to be able to have something a
little bit bigger than 32 by 32 but it's
also a little bit tricky because a lot
of the vector formats out there like SVG
are too big to fit in the small space
that you have four attributes for quick
reference so what we've done is we've
designed our own vector format that
actually compresses the icons more than
something like SVG I think we're going
to cover that a little bit later on we
have support for more modern hardware we
there Bo sr5 had a 1 gigabyte limit and
that's for all map devices so if even if
you had less a little less than a
gigabyte you could get stuck we've
removed that limitation and in fact the
laptop will be demoing on has a full gig
of memory and we've improved POSIX
compatibility one of the big sticking
points Rubio sr5 was that it didn't have
things like em map which made porting a
lot of Linux tools and a lot of UNIX
tools a little bit difficult we've
implemented that as a sort of a benefit
of the integration with the file caching
why haiku a lot of the same reasons for
our five simplicity is the key
multi-core multiprocessors the future
you know the old slogan one processor is
just not enough for anyone well we
believe so too and in fact the hardware
market is very much proved that out so
we focused on keeping the the threaded
technologies that the what was it used
to persuade pervasive multi-threading we
focused on keeping that we have a
desktop focus we don't want to be a
server or
watch or blue jean or anything else
we're on the desktop and nowhere else
that gives us the ability to make some
trade-offs and it very clearly allows us
to set our priorities we have a small
footprint and fastboot we actually have
improved I think just a little bit on
our 5s boot time and we're at about 60
Meg for a full distribution which is
right around where our five was this
integrated approach brings a lot of
benefits I alluded to it earlier the one
operating environment allows maximum
platform features there are a lot of
features for example that the Linux
kernel brings along that gnome and KDE
can't easily take advantage of because
freebsd doesn't offer them by having one
integrated environment the kernel can
make decisions that we know are
appropriate for the UI and the UI can
may take every advantage of the kernel
and we have fewer cases to test and
debug if you look I feel sorry for the
poor KDE and gnome guys because they
have to test into bug on freebsd openbsd
net bsd multiple linux kernels and
sometimes on occasion windows history in
progress we started the day that be
announced the end of BOS on August
eighteenth 2001 we have dozens of
contributors from all over the world we
have you'll hear people Bruno is from
Brazil people we have a presenter here
from Germany we have developers in
France Italy Australia and more and
we're nearly feature complete there's
still a few little things that we want
to implement but we're real close but we
still have many many many bugs to find
and fix and you folks are of course all
welcome we also have over 7 million
lines of code so there's not a lot of
lack of bedtime reading philosophy
proprietary OS is forced you to follow
the manufacturers direction it's it's
actually sort of fun to watch vista
applications because a lot of people
that use their own toolkits their own UI
controls they look odd when microsoft
releases a new OS
open source projects encourage Forks and
alternative projects and there's been
lots and lots of forks of many different
projects haiku encourages you to guide
from within so rather than say taking
the haiku code forking it and going and
doing something else we encourage people
to come into the project and work with
us and add more rather than having Forks
we have one desktop one UI one media kit
everything is tied together at first
maximum integration do the right thing
human interface design is very important
to us we have frequent heated debates
let's say on what the human on what the
interfaces should look like we want to
be easy enough that your mom can use it
but powerful enough that you want to our
one common look makes documentation
supporting you a easier you don't have
to test under ten different themes
different window managers whatever we
just with one way of doing things
everything should just work and we
choose common cases as the defaults so
for example if you have a network card
we assume that you want to use it and we
probe for it we hide as much as possible
the inner workings of the OS sometimes
there are things that have to be exposed
but we're possible the user doesn't
really want to know they just want to
boot up and have it work so we figure
out where possible instead of asking we
assume the normal but allow the unusual
technical stuff the small footprint and
fastboot I alluded to this a little
we're around 60 mega and compressed
we're small enough to fit on a flash
drive there's all sorts of neat embedded
possibilities that that allows we're
working on pxe boot an application start
quickly under haiku it's it's very
interesting to watch other operating
systems and it takes five six seven
seconds for an application to start
sometimes whereas our start much more
quickly
with a smaller footprint and faster boot
there's less need to leave the computer
on we boot depending on the hardware in
seven to ten seconds which for example
I've seen people put a computer in their
kitchen to use recipes and it sits there
and gathers dust because by the time
they turn the computer on booted up get
to the UI and and pick a recipe the
food's already burned C++ is our native
language we have a little bit of C++ in
the kernel and C++ everywhere else we
believe it's the best option for writing
an operating system today it's the best
balance between performance and
readability and there's lots of code
available for virtually any tasks if I
need some C++ code I google C++ and
whatever and there it is the
object-oriented API allows faster
development and low-level C++ is is
possible if you're careful we actually
our entire file system is written in C++
C++ is also low overhead and you don't
need a vm so it's a little bit better
choice than something like Python which
is a wonderful language which I adore
open BFS is fully buzzword enabled
64-bit journaled has attributes indexes
live updates it's multi-threaded and its
object oriented which sounds very
familiar to ensure a bunch of you it's
built for large files like movies and
mp3s we're sort of coming into our glory
there you know he was looking a little
bit ahead and and now people are
starting to really see the desire to
have movies and mp3s on their desktop a
little bit more than they did in 1997
the database queries but database light
queries that BFS offers allows us to
make gmail style labels work on a
desktop so you can say things like show
me all my jazz albums show me all of the
songs recorded in 1986 it's a way of
working that Google is actually bringing
to most users and it's something that
will enable on the desktop in an
interesting way and files our mimetypes
note elas or three-letter acronyms
needed kids a kid is a complete API like
the networking kit the interface kit the
media kit the print kit it's a lot more
cohesive than the what the Linux folks
do it a lot of cases with things like
imagemagick or lib jpg those aren't
really quite fully comprehensive and
when you have to use two together
sometimes it's it's a little tricky
these rich api's are built into the OS
you know coming just coming from a Linux
conference this is one of the things
that I really hit a point for the Linux
folks that fewer libraries mean fewer
dependencies everybody asked me how we
do package management I said we really
don't do package management because you
can just take an executable drop it on
them on the desktop and it works it's
easier to build apps with this complete
rich API you know beyond a doubt what
will be on any given haiku are one
machine and it makes it more productive
to code you don't have to go and look
and say is there a library around that
does this it's just available on the
desktop with a complete set of
documentation for example building an
application that reads bitmaps it
leverages our translator kit instead of
coding again and linking with lib jpg
lib Jeff etc replicants a replicant is a
serialized instance of a haiku
application and they're one of my
favorite features it's one of the things
that I think really sets haiku apart
they've been around since nineteen
ninety eight or so probably longer
internally but I saw them first in 1998
and they used a Serie the need of cereal
and serialization and messaging
technology other platforms call these
gadgets or widgets but ours are
embeddable inside applications there's a
good application out there called be
happy which uses the net positive web
browser that be developed to view
documentation and they just instantiate
a web browser inside another application
files are power contacts and emails
could the people application and be male
in particular our applications that are
designed to use the files saved with
attributes a standard format means never
converting I've used probably five or
six different email applications in in
my time with BOS and haiku and I've
never once had to import or export it
just works any application including
trackers our desktop can view these
files so you don't need necessarily a
special application to change somebody's
name and attributes give database like
functionality I see this over and over
again I'll search for files from Axl
within the last week about Google more
file types are easily definable and
extensible I had someone ask me how they
could build an application to store all
their jazz albums and I said just make a
new file type and set up some attributes
this person doesn't code it all and he
was able to do that without writing a
single line of code and you can easily
build mini apps I referred to people and
be male there's a really sort of mini
apps they don't manage your email all
they do is display an email or display a
single person and you use the desktop
windows to manage people or email
messages add-ons are an enhanced library
loading interface they make it easy to
extend applications and the OS it allows
people to build up applications instead
of building everything in Photoshop does
this for example with photoshop plugins
but BOS and in haiku make it a lot
easier to do that with every application
and there were a wide variety of
applications that used add-ons because
the original author can't think of
everything and it means that apps don't
have to be monolithic scripting another
favorite topic all applications are
fully scriptable the OS standard
scripting mechanism can be implemented
in any language I've seen it in Python
I've seen it in the shell with actually
marcos hey
and it allows people to do things that
are very difficult in another operating
system adding more scripting nouns to
your application is easy so you can say
hey hey tracker quit hey hey be male
print and there are a number of nouns
that are system standard and there it's
easy to add more it allows for inter
application interaction in new and
different ways but still with a standard
mechanism I think I think here's the
point where I hand over to axel yeah I
won't want to talk a bit about the
virtual memory subsystem and the file
system cache oh okay better now I want
to talk about the little memory
subsystem and the file system cache
implementation it probably won't take
that long bill don't worry the basic
design is very beast alike in that we
have memory caches that stack up
together to build them the memory that
backs up an area or region or whatever
you want to call it every piece of
memory is backed up by a little memory
cache object that and those might be
stacked up on to deliver every page you
want it to look for anyway it also has a
reverse page mappings and a global page
scanner unlike boso the file system
cache is fully integrated with a myrtle
memory which means that every file just
have appointed to a vertel memory cache
object
defi system interface is one point where
we didn't duplicate the r5 API but
improved it a bit and so that you have
to actually porch the file systems over
to IQ if you wanted to use them it has a
transaction API and it comes not only
with the block cash but also with a file
cache the transaction ipi has actually
support for sub transactions which means
you can stack together several
transactions and commit them at once so
you can also unlike us which has the
similar thing it also joins several
transactions together but therefore it
cannot undo them it can just not write
them out or write them out from due to
the sub transactions we can also undo
single implement a single transactions
which simplifies the file system
implementation a lot actually BFS for
example brunner we'll talk later about
it now uses both caches the blockage for
its metadata and five cash for
everything else but actually the file
system is free to choose whatever cash
alimentation wants to it's fully
transparent the virtual memory subsystem
will just call a file system hug and it
will do the rest another feature of our
file cache is that it allows for add-ons
which means it has hooks for every file
cache operation whenever you open a file
or reach from one a file and hope gets
called if you want to those add-ons are
stackable you can for example we have a
logging at on which just blocks
everything you do and it still allows to
have an additional add-on that actually
do something useful right now we have a
launch beat-up module both modules are
very basic actually
which just sees what files are opened
when you launch an application and pre
cata soon as I said it's very basic
right now when you boot haiku for
example it will actually load about
twice as much data as usual boot what we
would do but it's still like a few
seconds faster because it's so basic
it's not yet enabled by default though
and there's an API that allows to switch
those casual if so those modules at
runtime another I'm cashing it on I
implemented is the rule base later on it
actually works hand-in-hand with logging
a dond and it's currently needs another
system to actually evaluate and analyze
the log output and there's some
inductive logic system which has a set
of rules or creates a set of rules out
of the logging data and the rule base at
on passes those and improves flight
system speed for example when you work
on a project and you run your integrated
development environment it will maybe
automatically cash GCC for you or the
fights you're currently working on well
oh that was actually actually all what I
wanted to talk about and I take it over
to Google okay sorry so I'll talk a bit
about our file system as I mentioned and
the side of the presentation this was
actually completely designed by the big
guys and we actually use the dominicks
book the outer of the file system
actually printed a book about it so use
that as a base and we were able to
recreate it but we changed some stuff
and we actually added more features as
long as we could without breaking on
disk structures compatibility so the
first thing we did is that we decided to
actually write that right the file
system in C++ some kind of engineers we
actually will be complete think we're we
are completely crazy or something like
that because c++ in the car no is like
something that's basically forbidden we
decided to go that way because first
it's a lot easier to maintain second you
can actually make the code a lot more
clean so it's easier to understand and
it's easier to implement the code piece
by piece so for instance the first thing
we added was actually read support then
we added a right support then we added
query support the transaction support
and it was very clear how we would add
all that sings from the start of the
project so that helped it development a
lot we we also decided to to actually
implement some stuff that we consider
that was missing from bos so we also
implemented support for knowing the exit
attributes you couldn't in BOS you
couldn't really search for knowing the
exit attribute so we added that
and but all in all is basically the same
file system so for the ones of the
people who does not know what exactly is
open VFS so as Michael mentioned open
BFS is a 64-bit multi-threaded object
oriented database like file system I
think the most unique feature of in open
BFS it's exactly the fact that is a
database like file system what exactly
does that mean you can you have a open
here you have a file in your file system
usually have standard you attributes and
those will be the file name and file
size and permissions and ownership and
stuff like that open BFS actually
actually takes that a step further by
actually allowing you to attach any
arbitrary attributes to your file so you
can for instance in an audio file you
can have an attribute that says who is
the artist that composes that file what
is the album what's the year and other
stuff like that this nature this feature
alone is not really really exciting but
then the file system also has an
internal index implementation so you can
actually index those extended attributes
so you can you are actually able to make
search it really fast search actually
based on that on those attributes so for
example I have a huge collection of
mp3's at home I still run vos by the way
and I actually I can do stuff like show
me oh mp3 files that I give a give a
rating of eight that are from the late
80s and that has rock on its general
some some place so it will return me
like 200 files and it's like almost
instantaneous to takes like one second
two seconds to to actually do that and
you can extend that to any file type you
want because you can actually create
your own file types and you can do those
kind of search without
with without having to actually code
anything so it's pretty easy to do that
so as I mentioned we actually added
support for no index ii attributes which
in BOS you could not really search for
an attribute that was not in dec said it
would simply return nothing and wouldn't
not will not say anything about that to
you so we actually cheat because when
someone does a search for any any
attribute that is not index it we use an
attribute that we always know that we
know that always has all files for
example a last modified date and then we
iterate over the results which are all
files on your hard drive and we check
for the attribute that is not indexing
it's a lot slower than the standard
queries but it's a lot faster than
actually trying to search your entire
disk for that because you just load the
indexable and you process it we also did
several generations in open BFS that
actually make it a bit more fast than
the US version to to actually retrieve
the data we actually implemented several
optimizations for partial matches we did
several I want to really go much into it
in too much detail here but we basically
can use the user patterner to actually
give it a smaller subset of files and
for it to search in the index so it can
actually return results a lot faster
especially if you are doing search for
like the name index who has that has all
the files or possible files indexed said
sorry we are we are another thing that
we did is that we came up with our own
implementation of a bleep b plus three
for the for the files it's also for the
on-disk structure it's also c++ and that
also helped a lot too during development
because we really really found several
problems several bugs that we could
easily fix them with that
and this is one of that this is deserves
to show the direction we are trying to
do actually go which is exactly
improving upon BOS as soon as you we
have our first version release it
another thing actually I move these
lives here but I don't have any slide
for that so anyway another thing that we
actually implemented and this quite
interesting is our I conformant they are
vector icons and probably most being the
xB engineers here know why it's not a
good idea to actually use vector icons
in the case of open in the case of BFS
but especially considering that when you
are using like an SVG icon you probably
have icons which are bigger than 5k
that's compressive size so we actually
came up with our own icon format which
is called hv i it's actually a vector
format but it has several restrictions
that were designed for icons so in the
sense that if you are going to use it as
a general vector format for files it
will suck big time but when you use that
first icon specifically it's very good
we did some tests and we had because we
also created a program that would be
able to actually create those files and
we did some tests we had SVG files with
8 to 10 k compress it and the same icon
when made with our vector format it's
only eight hundred bytes so for the more
technical inclined especially be people
here 800 bytes still fit in the small
data section so we don't have paid a
penalty of actually having to fetch the
icon it's what how this works like this
we have the Phi Y node and after putting
all standard attributes very final
information you still have some space
left on the inode so when you start a
file have to actually read the inode so
we got that as a that free space
actually it wasn't again it was an idea
that came from BIA from be itself
and we use that spec we call that space
that small data section and we can
actually write some attributes there the
icon itself is an attribute so as long
as they are confit that area when you
fetch their I note for the file you'll
actually get the icon to so we managed
to to have vector icons with the same
performance that be had with bitmap
icons of course we still pay a penalty
but it's very small because we actually
have to handle the icons and then
hindering the icons is also pretty smart
we do single pass handling so the
borders looks actually perfect SVG tend
to do mood paths handling and when
compared to the quality of our icons it
sucks it really sucks and as it is one
pass Henry it's also a lot faster so
this is something that we created and we
are kind of proud of actually it was a
developer a developer from Germany
called Steven asmus and he did a great
job with that well after we have we
finish our first version which is what
we intend to do real soon now you guys
probably remember that too and we will
basically have our five with some minor
new features and some minor new
optimizations here and there but we
still have a lot of work to do so we are
what we intend to do from now on after
we have our one out so basically we will
stay with our focus but there are
several several things that we want to
actually make better right now we have
four just as an example our cisco
mechanism is like 10 times the slower
than linux we are completely aware of
that we know how to fix that we just
decided not to do it right now so we
would just get it out of the door and
then we actually work on improving that
we have several ideas on how to do that
another thing that we will do and that's
that's really really required we will
create another BFS open VFS which will
be version 2
will completely break down disk
structures because well Dominique had
six months to do open baby of the
original BFFs so the fact is that it
does not scale else especially with the
small files our file system sucks
because when you're actually the
lighting files you have to also handle
the all the method at extended
attributes indexes and stuff like that
and we are actually considering ideas
for improvement upon that and to
actually get it faster we will emit we
will be faster than our five in this
respect because we have as actual
mentioned we have an integrated 5i okay
chef API and the vm so we can actually
use all available memory as cash and
that will give a good speed bus for us
and we are we're really a small team of
developers auto we we should have an
around 40 would Gas Act developers that
contribute one way or another were
really really writing cold there should
be around ten developers and we didn't
we didn't do a bad job considering that
we have seven million lines of code with
that were written in six years by ten
developers there is this site I don't
remember the name that it tries to
evaluate the amount of work that was put
in a project and how much it would
amount if you someone was actually
paying for that project to be design it
and they decided that our project is
worth more or less 83 million u.s.
dollars so I want some of those I don't
know how but I would try ask the guy who
generated this number in and then sell
them without the project to them before
like thousand bucks that okay okay
perfect okay so uh well I hope you guys
enjoyed this presentation oops we have
here some contact information so you can
find our site which is haiku dash OS org
we have a channel on our IRC which are
always full of people
with great ideas on how we should do
everything but that don't move one
single finger to do anything but that
that's the usual stuff with open source
projects we still have a mailing list
actually our project started being
called open BOS but what we didn't want
to be get the we didn't to avoid the
possibility of getting sued eventually
due to that so we end up changing the
name and but we do have this mailing
list it should change soon but it's you
called open BOS and you can find it on
freely Zork so thank you all for coming
if you have have any questions feel free
to ask them and please do actually we
are here to join sure that any questions
oh yeah of course I thought we would do
that okay we need his depth at his
laptop so there we go that was a good
question actually
Oh
Oh
I just want to point out that's the
actual r 5b bounce binary running I
thought you might appreciate that yeah
what do you want to see it kdl the right
thing and start with with what they will
be seeing a lot okay our second best
user on the face looks like this you
might be familiar with it the kernel
debugger on screen which is very comes
in very handy for laptop down to F a0
debug output like this one for example
but other than that it's not that useful
for the common tasks although someone
actually brought some chrome Anton's for
playing games while you're bored and I
crashed anyway anything particularly
want to see it runs currently at 600
megahertz let's wife a bit slow and it's
also not optimized at all at this point
like Bruno sat on the cisco mechanism is
like 10 times slowest linux and there
are lots of other places where probably
the same numbers apply except sorting
the outline lists which is about
thousand and thousand seven hundred
times as fast and i cou I don't know
what some of you are doing there just
wanted to mention well you see you see
the vector rings here where for example
on
when it decides to come up our I
chromatic the name song should sound
familiar as well and they can for
example see what kind of optimizations
are done to actually achieve small file
sizes the usual size is about 200 or 300
bites I can add some some curves here
and multiple shapes can reuse the same
path so I can have second shape which
reduces the same path path of them oops
what did i do there that's okay and I
can move them and turn them around like
I want I can have different styles for
each one like ingredients of course
and if I change afterwards change the
path should be able to change the path
this application is quite a few bucks
both on screen will change accordingly
and it also has a level of details so if
I don't want to see a certain object in
a certain size like and text on a text
icon and when it's smaller than a
certain amount i could use like 04 and
this preview I see it's gone at that
size but others it's still there
there are other other things like
perspective on core control and Stroke I
can apply to existing shapes so to save
actual space I don't have to re-do
placate a lot of part of Arthur's to
create an eye but that's just one thing
any other stuff you want to see um yeah
of what yeah so i can actually we we try
to have some play but someone ended up
using undocumented the api's on it so we
have an older version that works with
the most recent version doesn't but
another one does I don't know you
remember not sure some I think it was
something to actually lists all the
atoms that were installed and to figure
out what today or I think it was the
name was indicated that it was that
something the media kids actually so
it's your fault it is not too runny okay
just for you briar but yeah it should be
honest on here somewhere there is one
thing that I want to make clear you see
when he was moving rindels around around
the you see the jittering on screen and
everything that's because we are
actually running at the bugging version
that does full locking of the
application server when you do anything
so that's why when you move on one
window the other stop but that doesn't
usually happens but if you if you were
not be using the dubuque version it
would crash so it's better for you to
see the G trained in the crash another
buck you see here those nice little
rectangles
currently I disabled outline phones
because they were just hang the server
somehow and it looks not that bad
actually with also a net positive
running and the the beaverton our five
version of Firefox runs as well some
games don't work for some reason like
warmth can't be played yet burps I'm
again yeah exactly
oh sure
you should show a little bit the track
flight okay go to them and largely itens
of course it's quite slow as you can see
right now but as I said it's not
optimized I think all text on screen is
actually ran out each time and not cash
in any way we have a media players
it's actually bitmap drawing but we also
have overlay working it's just that the
media player the native media player
just don't support it yet but if you use
VLC for example it would use the overlay
as well and another thing you can see
you the mouse cursor is blinking because
we have software only right now it's not
that hard to change but somehow we
wanted to have a shadow on our mouse
cars and was impossible with the
original the observer graphics
accelerant API oh yeah and of course um
no those won't work as well with a soul
difference if I close and reopen it
actually stores where they were ah well
anything else you want to see query yeah
ok I can do that whoops not let was the
wrong one
um I melt my media partitioning it
actually has an old I can as you can see
well what could I look for maybe
I searched for a JPEG image with with a
from DC in it there should be some of
them this is of course a search that
isn't optimized at all as you might know
because of the on this structure of BFS
just doesn't allow for certain
optimizations but if I oh obviously
there are no notify ok checkers just
changes I look out for DFS so there are
some pies at least yeah a great one
okay if you want me to I can do that
survive i gratify like BFFs and as soon
as i created it of course shows up in
the query and as soon as i delete it it
should also be removed in korea we're in
you as well oh and album tracker now
also can has this little item up here
where you can grab the contents of the
current window and like just copy it
here this works was all all of the stuff
so I can grab this fold and can copy it
anywhere I want to that right now sup oh
yeah my crash it's not good in it we're
doing a demon
yeah yeah then we do have Firefox yes we
can start up not from here but usually
we would have yes mateu dhcp sm
implemented tcp most of it works but not
by reveal where we very well at that
point Firefox is one of the few
applications that actually take a long
time to load that's true I want no I try
to compile it before but somehow there
is a kernel regression and as soon as I
compile anything there comes a nice kdl
on top of the screen I won't show it
right now so there's Firefox just
crashed but usually if it would work not
today of course but since we don't have
network I couldn't network connection
from here at Google I think it's not
that much of a problem
any other questions it's what BBBS video
oh we don't have pdb we have portege DB
over and but we don't have an actual
graphical form front end for it I can it
looks like this I just started again it
probably crashes again we'll see about
that okay any other questions while it
loads Firefox
the only thing which our viewers
executables you saw as be bounced and or
five net positive everything else if not
them like sound play it's a haiku code
so the debugger came up and should be
familiar to and unix developer I won't
look into this right now it might be
haiku regression I don't know but
probably
it shouldn't even crash when you do that
so Detroit right now any other questions
the relationship to 2 Zeta actually
there's not that much of a relationship
well some we have our Zita offered some
code to us and there were actually very
few lines where we shared code but it's
not that much actually it I it's hopeful
and we hope that it will improve over
time or that we get more code they
promised some drivers that we could use
from them but right now not much has
happened in that regard
GCC runs under haiku but it Chris I'm
not adjust GCC button haiku for some
reason it tends to rights its
environment variables some when the
colonel who doesn't like that I don't
know yet why but it used to work like
for my master thesis which actually
actually was of the vacation stuff the
rule-based one I talked about at that
point about two years ago it would
compile on cracker completely not much
more about that it is any other
questions obviously not well then thanks
a lot for your attention and coming here
