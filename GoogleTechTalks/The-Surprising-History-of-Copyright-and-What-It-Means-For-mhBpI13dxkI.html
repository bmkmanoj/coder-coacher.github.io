really the only slide you need is the
one right behind me everything that I
refer to is linked to from this site
question copyright org I'm very glad to
see you all here thanks thanks a lot for
coming it's nice to see that many people
interested in copyright its history and
its effects before I begin the talk
proper I want to tell you about a talk
by the Google policy team at
three-thirty over in Tech Talk 42
partner Evo they've come in from
Washington DC and they're gonna tell us
what they're doing their net neutrality
child protection other stuff I guarantee
you these two talks will not overlap
because I'm going to that talk so you
don't have to worry you can go to it too
and speaking of Google policy I want to
start out with a disclaimer the content
of my talk is not in any way the
official position of Google on copyright
or intellectual property or anything
else it has not been endorsed by the
global policy team not by the Google
legal team I'm very glad that Google is
the sort of organization that hosts open
forums like this but they should not be
held responsible for its content and
with that let's begin you do not hear a
lot these days about the history the
origins of copyright I think based on
talking to a lot of people we sort of
tend to feel that it's just always been
there or it's one of those things that
like building roads or constructing
sewers or something it's something that
governments just start doing at a
certain point it's it's natural and
uncontested that's not actually the case
with copyright in fact some people will
trace it back if their if their lawyer
or they've read some legal history will
trace it back as far as the US
Constitution where there is a clause of
empowering Congress to pass copyright
legislation but copyrights history
predates even that and it is kind of
surprising where it comes from it was
not created by artists and writers who
were suddenly rising up to demand
protection at all it was created by the
publishing industry which in the early
days the printing press was a very
different industry from what it is today
information distribution in general was
very different than news today
I won't have time to go into all the
details of that history I want to fit
this talk into an hour I want to have
time to talk about the implications of
copy arts history for how we think about
and deal with copyright today and I
especially want to leave time for
questions at the end so if you go to
that website or you go look at some
other resources on the history of
copyright you'll see some stuff that I'm
leaving out here I don't think any of it
is oh thank you screen saver I don't
think any of those details I leave out
are terribly important but you might
want to know them if you're doing a lot
of research into copyright so where did
it come from
well when the printing press first
arrived in England in the late 1470s
of mid 14 70s late 1400s there was no
such thing as copyright in fact not only
was there no copyright there was a
government and a society pretty much
completely unprepared for the
implications of the mass distribution of
printed material it was just a Wild West
out there as soon as the press arrived
people began running off copies of just
anything under the Sun historical works
fact fiction religious tracts political
tracts works by living authors and dead
authors they were not careful about
crediting they would engage in
plagiarism and reverse plagiarism
sometimes the printer would write
something print it up and release it
under the name of an author who had
nothing to do with it because that
author was more famous in that way the
work would get more attention all sorts
of things going on it was total chaos
from the government's point of view the
worst aspect of this chaos was the
political tracts all of a sudden anyone
with a printing press and a grievance
could start running off seditious
pamphlets by the thousands and
distribute them all over the kingdom if
you're a government especially in
England in the 15th century in 16th
century that's a disaster you can't just
have people printing anything they want
who knows what they might say they might
they might foment rebellion make trouble
so the government's reaction was very
interesting
they it shows us I think that the idea
of privatization of Social Services was
not invented in modern times I'm just
gonna hit a key here should have learned
how to turn off my screensaver ah there
you go sorry shh don't tell they they
the government sorry we'll just stay
there for now
and if the squeeze never goes out I
wouldn't worry about it um the
government's reaction was to privatize
censorship they created a guild called
the company of stationers the company's
charter gave it the sole right with a
couple of exceptions the sole right to
own and operate printing presses in
England the the company had the right to
seize and destroy presses operated by
non-members of the company and they had
the right to burn books printed without
the company's authorization in return
for this monopoly the company of
stationers was obligated to run the
works they printed by the crown's
censors first unnaturally after a
certain amount of time they got pretty
good at telling what the censor would
would like and they would just do
self-censorship they wouldn't even
bother they would say look that's never
gonna fly you can't print that this
arrangement lasted for about 150 years
and during that entire time there is
still no such thing as copyright the
stationers did among themselves practice
a certain kind of proto copyright they
would make arrangements where one person
one member of the company would print
one thing and no one else would print
that and they were actually formal
little agreements so this notion of
ownership of a work did begin to take
hold among the printing community but it
was ownership by the printer and it was
ownership of printing rights it had
nothing to do with the offer the works
were entered into the company of
stationers registry under the stationers
name not the office
so this worked pretty well for about 150
years until almost 1700 and then
disaster kick disaster for the company
of stationers at any rate although not
for lovers of free speech the government
of England changed hands this is the
revolution of 1688 the Glorious
Revolution is sometimes called I won't
go into all the details of that
revolution it's very complex and very
important in its own way independently
of copyright but among the effects to
simplify greatly and I hope historians
in the audience will forgive me
among its effects were that Parliament
changed hands and what in some senses
had been the opposition now came into
power and furthermore Parliament's power
relative to the crown was greatly
strengthened those now in power had no
love for state from censorship and no
luck for the company of stationers for
the most part and they decided to let
the company's charter lapse now if you
have any experience with government
regulated monopolies you know that the
story is never that simple you can't
just turn them off once you have them
because they lobby and that's what the
stationers did they went before
Parliament realizing that their their
livelihood their monopoly on printing
was about to end and they made a rather
new argument they said an author has a
natural right of ownership in their work
and furthermore this right is
transferable assignable by contract to
other parties like a form of property it
can be sold or contract it out or leased
Parliament accepted this argument and
the reasons why are perhaps a bit hard
to understand today you have to cast
yourself back into the mindset of
information technology in the 18th
century
the Parliament did not like censorship
though they probably sensed that it had
its uses but they didn't necessarily
want a return to the chaos of the period
between the arrival of the printing
press and the chartering of the company
of stationers and the stationers were
essentially saying to Parliament if you
do not protect our trade with this
monopoly right we will have an economic
disincentive to behave well we will not
be able to print things reliably to make
identical copies to avoid plagiarism
both of the normal and the reverse kind
and to protect the integrity of works if
it's just a complete free market because
consider what a print run means you have
to gather a lot of dead tree pulp that's
green tension is good you have to gather
a lot of dead tree pulp together you
have to arrange the plates for your
press which is quite labor-intensive if
there are illustrations you have to get
an engraver and and make those
illustrations in metal and then you
print off thousands of copies a great
expense you distribute them around which
may cost some money as well and then you
see if your work sells you haven't even
collected in revenue yet now what if
your competitors waiting in the wings
can just watch you invest in a hundred
works watch the three of them that
actually pay off and start selling and
then they run off copies of just those
works well they're not paying the cost
of investment in all the other 97 they
have much lower risk the stationers
argument was we need to be protected
from that situation we're caught in this
sort of game theoretical dilemma if you
give us a monopoly we will behave better
you also have to think of the technology
of printing it's often said that the
Internet is is sort of an extension or
an augmentation of the printing press
kind of the final realization of the
printing press has potential but there's
an important sense in which that's wrong
if you have a copy of a printed work and
a printing press especially in 18th
century printing press making a copy of
that work is terribly difficult
and if it has illustrations it's just
not possible
you can duplicate them to some degree of
approximation but you can't really make
a copy and as far as the words of the
text you're going to be very tempted to
abridge the chapters you think are
boring you're gonna have more
misspellings because you won't have time
to do it with the same care of the
original printer did with the printing
press you can only make more copies if
you possess the master with the internet
you can make copies from copies the
Internet is masterless in fact with the
internet making perfect copies is what
comes naturally and if you want them to
have any variation you have to put an
extra effort to do that it's the reverse
of the printing press they don't think
like we think today they were thinking
look there's a natural monopoly
physically inherent in printing because
whoever prints it first has sort of
created the work that's out there in the
public and they've got the original
plates and if we just make our laws
embody this monopoly without the odium
of censorship then we will have
essentially the same arrangement we had
during the entire 150 years of the
company of stationers heyday and
everything will be just as good as it
was then only without censorship and
Parliament didn't really object it was
actually a fairly reasonable argument
given the technology and given the
economics of the time but if you
remember just one thing from this talk
please let it be copyright was not
designed by the writers and artists
asking for means to earn a living for an
economic basis for creativity it was
designed by the publishing industry to
support a certain kind of distribution
mechanism one that is completely
obsolete today so let's fast forward a
bit
I've been going around for about a
decade talking to just about everyone I
meet about copyright I mean literally I
will talk to strangers the bus stop
taxi drivers free software developers
and IRC channels strangers at parties
just just everyone and I've compiled a
pretty good picture I think of how
people think about copyright especially
in the United States but also I've been
doing this in Europe a little what you
hear when you talk to people about
copyright does not look like that you
hear four or five points consistently
over and over they are one artists and
writers they need copyright to earn a
living
they depend on it it's very important to
them without copyright they're just
they're out in the cold cruel world
pretty much everybody will express that
sentiment at some point when talking
about copyright the second thing you
hear is copyright is largely about
protection from plagiarism over and over
I hear sentiments like if somebody
writes a book they should get credit for
it now modern copyright law is not
really about preventing plagiarism as
you probably already know and especially
given the internet it's very easy to
find out who really wrote a work first
there is a reason people think that
plagiarism is one of the primary
functions of copyright and that is that
every time the copyright lobby talks to
Congress or puts out a press release or
issues a cease and desist letter they
include a sentence about how artists
have to be protected through plagiarism
because they know that that resonates
emotionally with all of us and I can
give you some pretty glaring examples of
this in fact I will because it's just
too good to resist this is Hillary Rosen
the former head of the Recording
Industry Association of America talking
to a college audience it's from a few
years back late 90s maybe early 2000s so
this she's describing here what she says
as she goes around talking about the
importance of not copying things to
college students
she says analogies are really what work
best I asked them what have you done
last week and they might say they wrote
a paper on this or that so I tell them
oh you wrote a paper and you got an A
would it bother you if somebody could
just take that paper and get an A - so
this sense of personal investment does
ring true with people well she's right
it does ring true with people but her
analogy is completely inapplicable to
copyright because when people download
songs from the internet they don't
replace the artists name with their own
in fact they recommend the file to their
friends and they say hey check out this
band and they give the band's name
accurately what she should have asked
was what if somebody could show your
paper round and show everyone else that
you got an A would you have a problem
with that and of course the student sort
of said no we don't have a problem with
that this technique this tactic is once
you are excuse me once you are watching
out for it you will see it in just about
every article every press release every
mention by an industry lobbyist or
industry figure about copyright it's
it's quite amazing and this I think is
part of the reason why the standard
answer you get when you talk to people
in the street about copyright is artists
have to be protected from plagiarism the
third thing is that everyone makes it
clear that they want to be thought of as
the artists friend everyone is on their
side over and over you hear this
sentiment you know I might download
songs from the internet but when I go to
a concert of a band
I'll buy the CD because I want to
support the band it's a very very
emotionally powerful thing to tell
people that by obeying copyright they
are on the side of the artist that's
where everyone wants to be nobody wants
to be on the publisher side publishers
are big evil corporations and in fact
people who started become conscious that
publishers are making all the money from
copying but if you tell people copyright
is protecting the artists then they will
feel funny about violating copyright
laws and the industry has learned this
100% they know how it to talk the fourth
thing is that people are very ambivalent
about file-sharing
just about everyone I asked says either
that they do it or they know people will
do or they kind of smile funny and they
don't say whether they do it or not and
you know that they do it and when you
ask them how they feel about it you get
these strange kind of answers like I've
I've heard people say well I know it
might not be the most right thing to do
but really who is it hurting it's like
people know in their gut that it's
really not hurting the artist but they
still feel this residual guilt about it
because there's this incessant message
coming for the industry file-sharing is
that file-sharing hurts the artists I
don't think there's any evidence that
file sharing hurts the artist I
certainly never seen any it does hurt
the publishing industry somewhat if you
would like to see by the way some of
these these answers a couple of friends
Googlers also a ben collins-sussman and
brian fitzpatrick and i we went around
Chicago this summer with a video camera
and we interviewed people in the street
about their thoughts on copyright and if
you go to that website question
copyright org all one word no - for
those on video you can download that
video and watch it's really striking
people's reactions to the questions
about file-sharing there in this kind of
weird moral quandary because they want
to do it their friends do it they don't
feel like it's wrong and yet they feel
like it's wrong now here's one thing you
never hear when you talk to people about
copyright
nobody has ever in ten years said to me
copyright was invented by distributors
to subsidize and stabilize a certain
kind of distribution technology nope
that part of the history has been
completely wiped from our world
consciousness even books about copyright
when you get to the part of the
beginning of the book where it talks
about how cap rate begins if there are
books in English in the United States
they will talk about the constitutional
clause that that says Congress house
shall have the power to reserve to
inventors and authors exclusive right to
their discoveries etc that Clause
postdates the company of stationers and
the passing of the statute of Anne the
law that Parliament pass
granting the author's monopoly postdates
it by about 70 years 65 years so and it
was not a new idea when the authors of
the Constitution were put in there they
were essentially putting into American
law what was already law and habit and a
way of thinking in England this was not
an invention so the Constitution is not
the beginning of copyright the true
beginning has largely been forgotten the
implications of all this are pretty big
as you're probably aware there's a very
large debate going on about what should
the relationship between the internet
and copyright be I think that debate is
especially relevant to Google we are a
company that flourishes in an
environment where information is free to
flow unrestricted but the trouble is
that that debate is currently being had
on terms that are purely defensive for
those people who want to copy and share
things what what has been going on is
because because the background
assumption of this debate is copyright
is there to protect artists and help
them earn a living the the industry will
always say well if you pay to buy a copy
shouldn't you pay every time you see it
and then we come back with well look
there should be some some openings
carved out for fair use I mean okay yes
they should have the right to sell it
and you know nobody else you'd be able
to sell it unless the author gives them
that right but but let us let us have a
few things that are fair use on those
terms this debate is never going to go
in the right direction the right
direction being I think a realization on
our part that the internet the proper
use of the Internet is simply
fundamentally incompatible with
copyright law No
if you're worried about protection from
plagiarism in one second
which a lot of people are the experience
of the open source world is very
instructive I've been working in open
source for 15 years been talking to
people who've been in here for 20 or
more open source essentially happens
without copyright yes there are licenses
on the software but that's that's sort
of to help perpetuate freedoms that
wouldn't need to be perpetuated if there
were no such thing as copyright
essentially you can think of free
software as operating in one of the
first copyright free spaces we've had in
three hundred years and there simply is
not a problem with plagiarism in the
open source world I'm not saying it
never happens in May I can't remember
any cases off the top of my head and
when you do a search for for plagiarism
open source free software I spent a long
time doing that search the other night
and I couldn't find a single example
instead what I found were open source
plagiarism detection packages so it is
at least certain that you can save
plagiarism in the free software world
one of the first copyright free spaces
to exist on the Internet is no worse a
problem than it is in the mainstream
publishing world where plagiarism still
happens and you every now and then
you'll read an article about it if
you're still worried about plagiarism
imagine this let us suppose that there
was a company that crawls the web all
the time gathering data I'm not gonna
mention any names and suppose that this
company remember the time stamps of the
files that it saw and it remembered
their URLs and it computer to checksum
for each URL and it found out through
meta information such as tags or
something like that maybe even the
author of the information and it
recorded all these things in a database
remember it's not even saving the files
themselves I'm not talking about the
cache copy what if we just say that all
those check sums and URLs and author
names and stuff and maybe a little
description in a database and then at
the end of every day it's sorted that
database and then it took a checksum of
the sorted concatenated database and it
published that checksum in a little
classified ad in the back pages of the
Wall Street Journal every day you now
have
a plagiarism detection or a priority
database engine that cannot be corrupted
even by the people running it I don't
really think this is necessary I think
there might be some other interesting
applications integrative is such a
database but the problem of plagiarism
has been solved already copyright has
nothing to do with it in fact when you
let things float around freely on the
internet that makes it possible to
detect the original much more quickly
this is why I'm by the way it's so
ironic that the publishers Association
and the Authors Guild are suing google
book search which promises to be if we
mash snippets of text together in the
right way the first and best plagiarism
engine ever built you would think they
would be cheering us but unfortunately
they are suing us I think it'd be nice
if somebody pointed out to them that
this holds a lot of potential for
preventing and detecting plagiarism
another question that that was a serious
problem back in the days of the printing
press and an unregulated printing in
England was the integrity of the work I
mean you if you had two copies of a book
back in the day you couldn't even be
sure that they were identical even if
they had the same author's name on the
front somebody might have added whole
sections left out sections etc that is
also no longer a problem making perfect
copies is what the internet does
naturally you don't have to do extra
work to make a perfect copy of a copy
now the internet does allow you to
modify those copies very easily as well
but that's ok usually when people do
that they they say so there are not that
many cases of people corrupting or
changing someone else's work and then
going out of their way to make sure that
there's no trace of it and putting out
the new work as though it were the
original and where there are such cases
they're usually easily easily detectable
so then we get to the the final question
the one that that the copyright Lobby
wants you to ask which is but without
copyright
how will artists and writers make a
living
this is a great example of a question
that is best answered by being unasked
copyright is not how artists and writers
make a living today and it has never
been I mean you all know some musicians
write you know writers I'm I'm a writer
I've got two books published that are
under open copyright copyright isn't
isn't paying anyone's living there are a
few superstars Stephen King is certainly
making out very well more power to him
but it doesn't make any sense for
society to organize the way it shares
information around the production of a
few superstars while everyone else ends
up either in debt or breaking even the
ways that people make a living from
creativity meaning not just writing but
also music and performing arts in
general are through a variety of means
that have been true for centuries for a
long time before copyright during
copyright and and from now on they will
continue to be true
their patronage the day job
subscriptions subscriptions by the way
paid for a lot of writing back in the
early days of the printing press
including the writings of many writers
that the copyright Lobby likes to tout
as examples of copyright supporting
artists Samuel Johnson is a great
example he made very little money from
copyright many of his works were paid
for in advance by subscribers who paid
in anticipation of the work coming out
for musicians and other performance
performances the main means of income
there are also peace working commissions
a lot of writers who make a living
writing do so by commissions from
magazines and the magazine's revenue
itself is not heavily dependent on
copyright royalties it's dependent on
advertising and subscriptions and
traditional publishing still works
without copyright I mean my publisher
was willing to release my stuff under
open copyright because they would buy a
signing a contract with you they caused
a work to come into existence they get
control over the timing they get some
control over the marketing and it makes
sense to pay someone to produce a work
which you're then going to release for
free if you're going to be the first to
market with thousands of copies so
traditional publishing doesn't have to
go anywhere
there are also new methods of supporting
creativity that are possible now that we
have the Internet with the free flow of
information the easy attachment of
metadata and micro payments here's a
here's a very good example which this
idea has been floating around a lot I
think it's been independently reinvented
several times and now there's a group
called fundable org which has actually
implemented it suppose there's a writer
who wants to write her next novel and
she knows it'll cost her fifty thousand
dollars to to pay for rent and groceries
during the amount of time it'll take to
write that novel so she posts on her
blog alright I'm ready to write but it's
gonna cost $50,000 she goes to a
third-party intermediary organization or
maybe they find her because they're
taking a small commission from this deal
that organization goes around to known
fans of the author and anyone else
hopefully they don't spam an emailing
list and say okay make your pledges
pledge whatever amount you feel you can
pay we're not going to collect until we
have $50,000 worth of pledges or maybe
60,000 to to pay for the Commission so
some people pledge some don't it doesn't
matter if there's a good writer
eventually you're gonna reach the right
amount meaning it only takes a few
people well a few thousands of people
pledging small amounts of money to reach
that sum and now the writer writes to
work under contract with the
intermediary releases the work for free
to the world on the internet and the
pledges get called in and paid to the
writer there are some interesting
properties of this system the work
exists for free and is available to the
whole world
the writer got what she needed to
produce the work and nobody paid more
for the work than they were willing to
pay there's no need to restrict sharing
in order to pay for things maybe a
broader way to think of it as this if
there are people out there who want to
produce and there are people out there
who want to consume when did we stop
believing that the free market is going
to find a way to get those people
together
we don't need a monopoly right to make
that happen if we have a distribution
technology that doesn't require high
upfront centralized investments and we
don't anymore so let me conclude with a
little lobbying of my own this sentiment
this idea that copyright is really about
subsidizing a certain kind of
distribution technology and not about
subsidizing creativity has almost no
currency today and as long as it has no
currency the debate on copyright can
only go in one direction the first thing
I would ask you is that if you find
yourself in a flame war on slash dot
with somebody about copyright please
just say that sentence and then point
them to that website that meme can
spread very quickly because people want
to believe that they want file-sharing
they already are halfway to believing
that publishers are abusing the
copyright and cheating artists and in
fact they do literally cheat many times
I don't have time to show you some
stories share with you some stories
about that but there's a lot of evidence
to believe that publishers bookkeeping
is not accurate in many cases one step'
meme starts getting out this debate may
finally start to change if it doesn't
change we meaning the world and we
meaning Google are headed for disaster
because what's going on now is that
copyright terms are being extended to
infinite lengths copyright
interpretations are being strengthened
so that the the circle of what
constitutes fair use is getting ever
smaller and the very worst thing is that
copyright protection is being built into
our hardware
no that's not even the worst thing
that's the second worst thing the very
worst thing is that copyright
protections are being built into law
such that it is proposed in some
jurisdictions and I don't think this is
law anywhere yet uh-huh that software
and hardware be required to pay
attention to digital watermarks and
refuse to copy files that are marked a
certain way
now think about that we would actually
not be allowed to build a piece of
software or a piece of hardware that
could copy files that have a certain bit
string at the front what are we what are
what is Google gonna do when the Linux
kernel code is required by law not to
copy certain files
that's an amazing prospect what are we
going to do when we can't crawl the web
because we're not allowed to hold a file
in memory long enough to index it this
company as I said flourishes on the free
flow of information and the free are the
world's information the better off we
are
and the better off the world is please
don't feel guilty about copying you're
not doing anything wrong even if
increasingly you're doing something
illegal
please don't think that balance is the
right approach that there is some some
negotiation in which the rights of
creators and the publishing industry are
balanced against the good of the public
the public's good and the creator's good
are one and the same
it is the free flow of accurately
attributed works on the Internet such
that everyone has access to creative
output everyone can easily identify who
created what and can use essentially the
same techniques that they've been using
all along to compensate those creators
helping those people find each other
that's the business we should be in
excuse me take a drink
but
I'm as I watch the progression of ever
tighter ever more restrictive copyright
laws in a battle that I thought was
going to go the other way
because I thought the meaning of the
Internet was obvious I get worried and I
think our great-grandchildren are gonna
look back at us at our generation in
wonder and amazement and they're going
to ask how on earth excuse me could we
have built a gigantic worldwide copying
machine and then hesitated to use it to
its full potential how on earth could we
not have been able to tell the
difference between stealing a bicycle
and copying a song I don't know how
we're gonna explain ourselves to them
okay that's the end of the rant I would
love to take questions yes
so I'm gonna repeat the question for
people on the recording companies like
Disney are worried that if Mickey Mouse
or similar objects let's call them go
out of copyright that people will start
using those images for their own
purposes and that then that'll sort of
be those purposes will then have the the
aura of Disney associated with them and
that's kind of a form of plagiarism it
isn't it's something we should protect
that is legitimate worry I don't think
it's as great as as it might be because
right now when somebody uses someone
else's work we assume that there has
been some sort of contractual
relationship we we assume because of the
existence of copyright law that there
must be an endorsement or an agreement
between those two parties and if that
assumption were not there then when you
were to see someone using Mickey Mouse
you wouldn't think that Disney had
anything to do with it
now you're right that this would mean
that people can start using characters
from someone else's novel in their own
novel for example and that there would
be nothing the original creator can do
about this but the original novel
doesn't go away the original novel will
not be tainted by those uses and
although it may be slightly
discomforting especially to those of us
who grew up during the copyright regime
to think about that happening is it
worth preventing people from sharing
information is that is that very minor
benefit worth saying to people you just
can't copy that at all you can't use
that so that's my answer
position I mean so if I say I wrote a
song I just want to put it up on my
website and my position is just that my
preference is that like I don't want
Google to index this or I don't want
anybody else to copy this flower and
post it on their own servers so like do
you think that that position should be
supported by the law or not there's no
us or involved you know actually no no I
don't what I think should be supported
by the law is that your name cannot be
stripped and no one else can claim the
credit for it that is credit reputation
is a non-renewable resource
it cannot be replicated it can't be
copied to the degree that someone takes
credit for your stuff that's the degree
to which you lose credit is always
proportional but if they accurately
credit you well look if you don't want
people to copy the thing don't put it on
the web pass it around to your friends
so so no that doesn't that doesn't
bother me
you know when I put writing's on the web
I want people yeah I don't know I would
disi you that I don't well completely by
that but okay of course they thought of
it before before that kind of
conversation novelists contribute or
pledge some small amount of money why'd
it doesn't the tragedy of the Commons
happen everyone has seen someone else
will pay for this guy because
operationally different theoretical
environment in this case you don't
actually pledge the money until you
until there's a signed contract or that
is your money is it going to get called
out right you won't actually be getting
anything out of your bank account until
someone has promised and signed a
contract to deliver the work so if
you're sitting there and you've made
your pledge but your money hasn't
actually been called yet and you see
that nothing's happening
well maybe you add a little more or
maybe you don't but the point is that
the result of the transaction is
apparent before you're actually
obligated to give the money and so you
will basically you'll pay what it's
worth to you and if it's not worth
anything to you you won't pay you you
don't have to worry about what other
people are doing if the work never comes
to exist that's not a tragedy there will
be other works so I don't think the game
theoretical dynamics work out like the
tragedy in the comments
I'm curious information that you
interview people regarding this concept
yes if you actually talk to the artists
actually like that music business the
classical music business might talk with
a lot of artists artists if you talk to
a superstar I won't mention any names in
any way the classical music world you
know doesn't really have superstars
right they're making a fair amount of
money off copyright but even then some
of them are sympathetic although not all
among orchestral musicians and this is
really interesting for about 10-15 in a
lot of cases 20 years orchestral
musicians have made no money off
recording royalties in fact the the
orchestra that my family was associated
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra has
not even been making recordings for the
last few years because nobody can pay
the royalty rates that the musicians
union demands now there's something
there's an aspect of shooting yourself
in the foot here if you're not making
recordings at all you're certainly not
making any money and yet a lot of those
musicians feel very strongly about
copyright and I you know since there's
no economic interest there
I can only resort to psychological
explanations but it has nothing to do
with with their livelihood
they're very well-paid and they're not
making any money from copyright right
now so art artists artists cervix
baggage sorry
well so an important what he said was
that it sounds like it's a limited
sample I don't just talk to classical
musicians believing but one thing to
notice that when a band anyone other
than like the Rolling Stones are you two
or something when they release his CD
they don't make any money they just want
to get that CD out there and the terms
of their contract with your distributor
are such that they hardly make a dime
any band for the vast majority of bands
any band that puts Adsense on its web
page is going to make more money from
the Adsense than from their CD sales
except perhaps for direct CD sales of
CDs manufactured by them at their
concert which people often buy as a kind
of charity gesture next question
yes
oh the question is sort of about the
difference between trademark law and
copyright law trademarks are though
they're both called intellectual
property by the legal system they're
completely different trademarks are a
way of preventing confusion of a
preventing identity confusion you want
to know that when you're dealing with a
party they really are who would they say
they are and if anybody could claim to
be anybody
we'd have chaos so trademarks totally
fine no problem and if Mickey Mouse is
your logo in its trademark that no some
other person shouldn't be able to use it
to identify themselves but you can't say
that that the novel war and peace is the
logo of Tolstoy that's different
yes for different parts of IP are kind
of important when you're trying to
phrase an argument like this especially
Patton to see them play through the
history that we have especially since
there's this major industrial focus
around distribution and the regulations
right there
the copyright has kind of grown into
this massive beast
but if you try to kill it off and say
okay we live in a time where we don't
need it anymore cuz we have this nice
internet thing I don't think that the
arguments you presented a kind of deal
completely with the economic desires of
the creators apparently they're being
fed even into a limited degree by this
greedy distribution complex but once
that goes away aren't they going to
insist on perhaps a more and a strong
form of patenting so that they can keep
property over there not the expression
of ideas like a copyright but in the
utility of ideas because you're saying
before whether they're going to get
recognition if we do this watermarking
stuff correctly but how do you get value
out of what you do so that that question
I hate to say this I don't I don't mean
to beat you over the head with it but
well I guess I don't hate to say it that
question reveals the myth that it just
is not how creators make a living for
the most part we all want to think it is
but if you actually look at the numbers
it's not I realize the creator's don't
make a lot of money but there's you know
no they don't make any money right it's
not you know so when they move to making
this more money aren't they gonna start
working direct so there
we broker even these agreements with us
won't they want to protect their side of
the deal more and what that lead to kind
of and emasculation of things like that
and tea and control over the original
idea
well the comparison between patents and
copyrights is very complex part of the
motivation behind patents is to prevent
companies from keeping secrets
especially about medical research there
so a direct comparison between patents
and copyrights I think is it really
possible there are some aspects that are
similar but but no I mean the the one
the one right that is both sort of
spiritually and economically important
to creators to creators of what is
currently copyrightable material is the
attribution right they need to know that
their works are not being that the
credit for the works is not being stolen
and the integrity of the work is
important now the integrity problem is
essentially solved if you go to the
office website the thing you download is
their book there's no doubt about that
but the whole the thing I'm trying to
get it is that the Internet makes it
possible to have revenue streams that
don't depend on the creation of an
artificial property right so I hope that
answers the question why
that's a great that's a great question
and you may not like the answer at least
it will be honest the question was I'm a
video game developer it cost me you know
10 million dollars to develop this game
what what model in this this new world
I'm proposing is going to pay for that
any model we have whether it's single
Monopoly right whether its global
monopoly that is anybody can distribute
there's no monopoly but they all have to
pay royalties to the creator which we
never tried or the kind of free-for-all
model that I'm proposing any model is
going to emphasize and strengthen
certain kinds of creations and
de-emphasize or weaken the possibility
of making other kinds of creations for
example the big-budget special effects
film Hollywood movie that's kind of
harder to make if you don't have strong
copyright law but the question is are
those things so valuable to us that we
are willing to have a system that
prevents people from sharing with each
other and especially given that
technology advances inexorably and it is
now possible even as a lark in your
spare time to create a science fiction
thriller that 15 years ago what it
requires 50 million dollars to create I
don't think it's a good argument for
keeping copyright yeah yeah can't really
hear you sorry
can you hear me now you might if I take
that one just all right go ahead we'll
take one premiere Thanks thanks Carl I
see you're drawing a distinction between
kind of the blockbusters and the fine
artists and you're kind of dismissing
the artists that really make a lot of
money off of copyrights however would
the infrastructure for that
communication exist without C copper
without being funded by copperheads for
instance would an artist who wants to
record a CD and give it away even have a
CD or CD player available to them into
their audience that wasn't for the
infrastructure that is bought and paid
for through the industry I I think
that's a that requires such a degree of
speculation to know what would have
happened with the internet that I
couldn't even begin to answer it but I
mean the internet was started as more of
a military research project than
anything else and I I don't think that
there's any evidence now that the pace
of development or or aggregation of the
Internet is going to slow down based on
the presence or absence of copyright
base revenues I mean frankly the you
know you could say that the development
of the internet was mainly driven after
its post research project phase by
pornography so you know I think I think
most of these most of these works we're
talking about although they have used
the internet for distribution and of
distribution of copyright materials in
some cases I don't think they're really
important in making the infrastructure
of the internet exists but that's it's a
big what-if game and you know you can't
say for sure I certainly can't say for
sure anyway go ahead
I just wanted to say I think a lot every
talk about this before I think a lot
under description of how early
Englishman period was driven by a
monopoly of violence
it's trip and I think it's still true
today that a lot of blogging goes on in
DC is done by the distributors rather
than the creator
however US law is very much predicated
on the idea that copyright is an engine
driven by these sensible state
individual creators as written in the
Constitution so that's what courts are
looking at when they think about what
they are thinking about and if you
disagree with Congress about the idea
that the best way to drive creation is
massive expansion of copyright to
include seventy year terms
I think the other and just to summarize
what defin is saying is if the way
copyright is going to end if it ends is
although I'm not sure you're promoting
that I don't want to put words in your
mouth if that creators themselves are
going to start using these other
distribution models independently of
copyright law they're just going to
really stop voluntarily under new models
and I think that's true that's the
engine that's really going to make this
happen if it happens but I think there
needs to be a two pronged approach
because those laws are causing us great
problems and they're going to cause us
much greater problems very soon and the
trouble is that that DRM digital rights
management and/or digital restrictions
management is some of us like to call it
and and the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act unfortunately these things are
accurate expressions of democratic
sentiment those laws reflect more or
less the public's belief that copyright
is necessary for creative development to
happen and if we don't change that
assumption the laws are going to be a
very long time in changing and artists
are going to be a very long time in
becoming willing to experiment
whereas if artists start to get the idea
that maybe copyright wasn't designed to
help them in the first place they may
become a bit more willing there's one
other point I want to make as definitely
pointed out the legal basis of copyright
in the u.s. is in that constitutional
clause and that's that's where the
courts look at that and they and the
case law and and further laws that are
sort of based on it
but just because that Clause says to
promote the progress of science and the
useful arts doesn't mean that's what the
system was designed for when Congress
passes the Clean Water Act that doesn't
mean it's about cleaning the water okay
no I'm not saying that the authors of
the Constitution were being insincere
they really believed in copper
and given the technological and economic
new view in which they operated it was
perfectly reasonable thing they were
saying things have changed now not just
in a quality in a quantitative way but
in a very fundamental qualitative way
it's a different world
because that's not the nations from the
worldwide and not be right back
and the treaty's override US law so
treaties negotiated by federal
government over driving in the u.s.
interpretation of copyright so
how does that things generally get
created now for the most part somebody
goes to a foundation and gets a gram
that's how most of that stuff happens
it's not you know occasionally there's a
big blockbuster success like march of
the Penguins or something but if you
take a lot of the films the educational
and documentary film if you like you
will find that somebody impoverished
themselves and went out and wrote grant
applications and borrowed money from
their relatives to make it happen
and if you look at a lot of the books
you like if you look in the adult events
there's often a Foundation grant in
there the system really isn't paying for
that stuff okay we are we're half an
hour away from the Google policy talk
which again is over in Tech Talk 42 I'm
happy to stay here and continue taking
questions but those of you who have
somewhere to be at 3:00 this is your
chance to get up don't worry about it I
won't be offended and thank you very
much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
