for having me my name is Chris Brewer I
work with geo smart energy and I was
asked by a colleague of yours here Alex
Ken Berg to come and talk to you today
about geothermal heating and cooling so
alex is my neighbor and we we met in our
back yards and he said to me you know
what's going on in your backyard cuz
it's a mess I've got had a drilling rig
out there there was mud everywhere
you'll see that in a minute so I told
him a little bit about how geothermal
heating and cooling works and I guess he
was interested because he invited me to
come and talk to you guys so hopefully
you also will find this interesting
firstly a little about me I am the
creative services manager for geo smart
so I do all of the the brochures the
advertising marketing for geo smart and
I've been working there about three
years and I guess over that time they've
convinced me that geothermal is the way
to go and so I decided you know now's
the time to put it in my house so I'm
gonna show you a few photos about my
house and then I'm gonna tell you about
how geothermal works so my house it's
pretty typical
it's a 2,000 square foot house and I've
got 12 holes drilled each of those going
down 80 feet and I'm gonna be putting in
a 40 ton a heat pump and I don't have
time to show you the video but if you
want it to see it it's on YouTube I
think you guys know about that so anyway
let me show you a little bit about
what's going on in my house right now
so here we have some pipe being laid out
this is a high-density puffing like this
is proprietary for geo smart
we had pipe specifically a specific
compound made up for geothermal that
resist cracking overtime and has high
heat transfer properties so they're just
laying it out here getting ready to do
the drilling and then once before they
put it down the hole unless they
actually have to take two pieces and put
a u-bend on the end so they use what's
called fusion they have an iron
basically they heat up that two ends and
melt them together it's a it basically
has a really really strong bond it's
better than doing you know copper with
soldering so this is why Alex asked me
what's going on in my backyard it's a
bit of a mess so this mud pit was I was
basically for holding the slurry that
they use for the drilling process and
when it's done hopefully I will have a
nice lawn back there but as you can see
they've got a drilling rig and they're
they're drilling the second hole right
there so this is after all 12 holes are
drilled and the pipe is in it's not a
very good picture unfortunately this was
taken with my phone which was probably
in my pocket so the lens was all blurry
but you can just kind of see the I don't
know if you can see it there pipes
sticking out of the ground and I'll
explain to you in a second how they tie
those together so this picture was
actually taken this morning after the
holes have been drilled the pipes been
inserted I actually have to come back
with a backhoe and dig down 5 feet and
then they're gonna connect the ends of
all those pipes together this shows the
shows a little better you can see here
if we didn't have the lights on you'd
see a little bit better still two pipes
here are
one hole and then you'll just further
back there's another hole those one of
those pipes will connect to the next
hole over so what is geothermal how does
it work and then next I'll explain a
little bit about geo smart better thank
you
so firstly 46% of the energy created
from the Sun is actually stored in the
earth the rest of it is bounced off the
clouds the atmosphere etc the smog so
thanks to the renew this renewable
energy from the Sun the temperature five
to six feet under the ground remains
relatively constant year-round and that
is about ten degrees Celsius or 50
Fahrenheit
somewhere in around there and that that
varies a little bit from place to place
but it's pretty consistent so in and
when it's warmer outside so the ground
is warmer than the outside air in the
winter and cooler outside air in the
summer which no no if that if you can
see that graphic enlarge out of it
that's the basic principle so this
really stable temperature beneath your
feet it can be harnessed using a ground
loop system and a heat pump to provide
free and renewable source of energy
year-round to provide 100 percent
heating 100 percent cooling and partial
domestic hot water production so you can
see here this would be a horizontal loop
and the circle bit is the heat pump in
your house
that would be five five or six feet down
for a horizontal one right yeah so I'll
explain those two right here actually so
there's basically two types of loop
systems one would be called an open loop
the other would be called a closed loop
so out of these four pictures three of
them are actually closed loop and one is
open so the closed loops can be either
in horizontal so that's the one that we
just saw before where the you need a
little bit more land it's only about
five to six feet down but you can just
use a backhoe to dig a trench and then
you lay out the pipe backfill it and
then you're done the next one another
also a closed loop would be a vertical
loop so that's what I'm doing in my
backyard right now
so Abbott drill drill down and then just
the tops of those are connected together
and you'll see in a second it just kind
of looks like a wavy line the third type
of horizontal would be a pound loop or a
lake loop that basically works exactly
the same way as digging a trench in the
ground and putting it in horizontally
it's it's resting six to eight feet so
you need a pond that has at least eight
feet deep but it rests on the bottom of
the pond and it's the same temperature
you think well the pond freezes over but
it only freezes about this deep beneath
right beneath that it's obviously zero
or one degree down down at the bottom
it's it's four to ten degrees Celsius so
we can collect that same energy the same
way now you need a certain size pond of
course we'll talk about that in a second
now I will also say okay the other
option is the open loop this would
basically be if you have a well system
and the better would be to have two
wells you actually pull water from one
well goes into your heat pump and
and goes back into the other well they
sometimes call that pump and dump so out
of those two systems open and close the
closed loop is more there are a lot more
of those they're more common so the
length of the loop is determined by the
amount of energy that's required so here
you can see a school or you know a large
building this would be vertical loops
and we do this quite commonly for you
know warehouses whatever you'll you
could have 40 holes going down 400 feet
each or 50 feet each it really depends
on the land and and a lot of different
factors so but obviously the size of a
building is going to you know depend on
how much heating and cooling you need
also the building envelope the
insulation how much fresh air make up
the lighting these are all critical to
sizing the geothermal and I will tell
you now that just as an idea if you ever
thinking about this for your own house
you say well how much do I need how much
land do I need to do a horizontal for
instance so what you need to work out is
that you need approximately 600 feet of
loop horizontally per ton you say okay
well how much tonnage do I need for my
house two thousand square-foot house
usually is around a 4 ton house so you
need four for a 2000 square-foot house
you need six 12 18 24 hundred feet of
pipe we can say that approximately a
thousand square feet is needed of land
per ton so you need four thousand square
feet of land in your backyard let's say
for a 2,000 square foot house I don't
have that that's a fair bit of land I
have a 60 by 60 backyard so
if you have a backyard around that size
you can do it but not horizontally you
need to do it vertically now because the
temperature goes one degree warmer for
every 100 feet or something like that
that you go down you don't need quite as
much pipe length if you're going
vertically so for a vertical system
instead of 600 feet per ton you only
need to go 180 feet per ton
so therefore with my house I have 12
holes that are 80 feet deep each and
you're gonna say well hang on a second
12 times 80 that math doesn't work out
here and that's because when you're
doing these loops they actually have to
have their in series in parallel so you
need to have four parallel loops going
up and down and of course 10 times 80
doesn't work so I've got for each three
loops down anyway that's getting too
complicated maybe is a diagram maybe of
the heat pump inside the house basically
in the winter the heat pump extracts the
energy from the geothermal loop and
transfers it into the house using either
forced air or hydraulics hydraulics
would be in floor heating so the Earth
continues to deliver that energy for
free back into the loop throughout the
heating season ensuring that you have
you know you've got a renewable source
of energy available on demand and that's
basically because of the Sun heating up
the ground in the summer you reverse
that process now this diagram I don't
know if you can see that or not but it
maybe gets a little complicated
basically you've got heat exchange
happening in the ground you've got
another heat exchange happening in the
heat pump using refrigerant just like in
your refrigerator now if I if I want to
make when I'm talking to people and I
try and explain this layman's terms I
say okay heat pump is just like your
fridge on the back of your fridge you
have those pipes
you've seen them there you just pull it
when you're moving your fridge to clean
get all the dust bunnies behind there
you see these pipes on the back and
they're warm so the refrigerant is
pulling the heat out of your food and
dispersing that heat through those pipes
we're doing exactly the same thing but
those pipes are in the ground so that's
in the summertime we're sucking the heat
out of your house putting it into the
ground then in the winter time we just
reverse that pull the heat out of the
ground back into your house and the
hot-water part of that there's a device
that's doing a very similar thing it's
pulling heat out and it's actually
heating up
your domestic hot water and we'll take
that will heat up a storage tank now
instead of heat you know spending lots
of money on heating up a store your hot
water you're getting in the summertime
you're getting that hot water for free
like as you pull the heat out of your
house the wintertime as the unit is
running you're getting hot water so
typically each kilowatt of electricity
used to operate a Geo smart geothermal
heat pump system draws close to four
kilowatts of free renewable energy from
the ground a geothermal heat pump can
actually produce more energy than it
uses therefore geo smart efficiencies
routinely averaged between 400 to 500
percent over a winter season so when
you're looking at a gas furnace and it
says ninety-eight percent efficiency and
you're like oh that's pretty good with
geothermal you're getting up to five
hundred percent so the benefit
besides obviously well I'll run through
them so it's energy-efficient we're
looking at close delivering close to
five dollars of energy for every one
dollar of electrical energy that's input
quiet got no noisy outdoor condensing
unit in your backyard comfortable so the
very consistent heating and cooling
because it also dehumidifies your house
so if you go into some air conditioning
stores as you come in from the outside
here you kind of get that chill that's
because there's also humidity in the air
with the the geothermal heat pump
actually removes the moisture from the
air in your house so you get a little
bit of a dryer cool and we'll say with
their reliable the best best components
that we use in our units we're not just
you know putting in the cheapest systems
we can we want these systems to last so
the ground loops for instance says 55
year plus warranty we like to say they
have a lifetime warranty and we'll also
tell you that that lifetime warranty
like they're gonna last for hundreds of
years
as long as of course you don't have an
earthquake that's gonna rock your
backyard or something and eco-friendly
now we maybe don't push this enough
there's a lot of people out there right
now they're really looking for eco
solutions for their houses there's no
chimney
there's no venting when you go to when I
go to put this in my house my insurance
guy
my contractor guy they're like okay well
you're gonna have to you know fireproof
this and that and and I'm like why
there's there's no you know fossil fuels
coming in to my house all they have is
electricity running this heat pump no
emissions no harmful gas emissions cost
of
no description well here we go
so we don't have a typical furnace
boiler or and an air conditioner to main
maintain just one unit and a lot of
people when I'm explaining this to them
they're like you just have that one
thing that you put in and that replaces
your furnace or they're like so this go
beside your furnace you know and I'm
know this one unit replaces your furnace
and your air conditioner so we'll say
that this is a protection against your
rising fuel prices some utilities are
also offering rebates and incentives for
customers that install Geo and you can
save up to 75% on the reduction of your
your bills depending on what fuel source
and I'll show you that in a second in
this chart so we'll say people will also
ask the next question okay well how much
does it cost and what's the return on
investment we'll say that typically it's
around 7 to 10 years it pens on what
you're switching from if you've got a
brand new high-efficiency gas you know
your bills are already as low as they
can be that number is going to be a
little bit high longer obviously I'm
switching from oil which is probably the
most expensive way so mine might
actually be on the lower end of that and
the biggest seems to be that the bigger
the building you have the shorter your
turn on investment as well one warehouse
we did they switch from gas and they
paid off their 80,000 square foot
building in five years grants this is
something that everyone also also wants
to ask about supposedly they're coming
back in that's what the the government
has just proposed with their budget
hasn't been finally approved yet but I
tell you what they had before basically
with this eco energy retrofit Pope
program you could get 3,500 back in
grants from the government and before
this I don't know if this is what
they're gonna do they had a matching one
from the provincial government so you
could get $7,000 there were at one point
it was even as high as 12,000 so
definitely a good incentive this just
this chart shows a comparison different
heating methods for over the cost of
over the course of the year high fishin
sea propane all the way down to
geothermal and this is I don't know if
you can read that there or not that's a
based on Toronto with a heat loss of
60,000 BTUs think they say the size of
the house there but we're assuming it's
an average 2,000 square foot house so
over the course of a year heating and
cooling you're under 1,500 I think
that's even high probably under $1,000
heating cooling and your hot water more
benefits the eco friendly part and I
mentioned this already but we're
preserving conserving our natural
resources and therefore we're helping to
control our climate through lowering
emissions a typical installation has a
mission offset equivalent to planting an
acre of trees or taking two cars off the
road the refrigerant has no known ozone
layer depletion as long as there's no
leaks or anything and that's very rare
that there's any leaks and the
refrigerant is just in the heat pump
it's not in the ground
the underground loops there's no snow no
external venting no air pollution and of
course very energy-efficient with the
earth providing up to 80 percent of the
energy required to heat and cool your
building all right so who is using geo
within residential markets uh we're
saying that now there's I think it's
closer to 85,000 systems that have been
installed in Canada still a small
percentage of the overall HVAC you know
heating and cooling industry but growing
twenty five to thirty five percent of
those are actually in Ontario so we
definitely the big chunk and the market
will say is booming as the stakeholders
they're at you know putting more
marketing efforts into high energy costs
and that government support the CGC the
Canadian geothermal Coalition claims
that 150 to 200 percent geothermal
market growth in 2008 slowed down a
little bit last year because the grants
they took of them away but our openness
again of them pick up again this year
and a commercial market as the energy is
becoming the single largest business
expense and alternative energies
including Geo in and solar now offering
a broader and more effective solutions
also developers are you know seeing the
benefits in in marketing green
especially with the LEED building
certification and by reducing the energy
costs so that their occupants can see
you know less monthly less less cost on
their monthly bills here's a couple
examples of some geo installs the
University of Ontario Institute of
Technology in Oshawa it's actually
Canada's largest loop with eight
buildings 2,000 tons Pinewood met
Meadows in Bellwood Ontario
kimberley cabins in kimberly bc
challenger motor freight new - high
school Redeemer church in Ancaster
Manitoba Hydro Elliot Lake retirement
living Guelph hydro goes on and on
I'll tell you one that we did actually
the company that stores the the floor
for the Raptors the hardwood floor they
are loving the Geo system most
warehouses don't have air conditioning
in the summertime they barely have
heating in the winter so when they put
in this Geo system it allows them to
control their environment so that they
can store the the wood floors for the
Raptors which is nice obviously because
you don't want them warping or anything
so a little bit about Geo smart we're a
brand of geothermal heat pumps and
systems that we distribute our ultra
efficient geothermal heat pump equipment
and our green pe100 geothermal pipe our
geothermal accessories and tools to a
network of over 300 dealers across
Canada and the United States and we
provide nationwide tech support as well
as our manufacturers and CGC related
training all from our head office in
Cambridge Ontario so there's our
information should you want to get in
touch with us now I'm going to show you
some pictures of some other geo installs
and then while they're going on you can
ask questions and I will try and answer
them firstly I'll just show you these
are actually the heat pumps they're
around this size depending on you know
if it's a four ton unit or so this is
the P 100 pipe I can just keep talking
to the pictures unless someone has a
question you've got a question
good question we've new-build while so
one thing the retrofit grants that were
just for older buildings that you know
wretched taking out those fossil fuels
old low efficiency heating systems but
they didn't have any grants for
installing new and of course developers
they want to do the building for as
cheap as they can to get as big a margin
on the sale as possible now if they have
to spend more money to put in a geo
system their margin is going to come
down so there are more and more
companies that are seeing as more and
more people are realizing the the you
know the benefits of Geo especially the
long term benefits because it is more
expensive to put in up front but the
long-term benefits are there and so
developers are starting to see that here
you see a like loop being installed it's
it's probably the the installation costs
you know the drilling is like for me was
very expensive but it's probably
somewhere in about half and half
installation costs versus the equipment
costs yes it would it's a little and it
does there's there's actually some
communities that have done that already
in Canada and BC
here's a there's our building it's right
alongside the 401 in Cambridge yeah I
think a lot of inspectors don't
understand heat pumps they're still you
know just like the public there they're
still learning I just I just priced out
when I said I'm just putting it in my
house I priced out a high-efficiency gas
furnace and it cost $10,000 now it's
probably the upper end of gas furnace
but a Geo unit is gonna cost you exactly
the same so if you already have the loop
right there and it's working fine you
know I don't see why you would put in a
gas furnace yeah yeah pretty much yeah
yeah
so we basically the loop you know you
have two pipes coming in to your house
with a closed loop anyway that loop
contains 75% water and 25% ethanol which
is basically alcohol that's just an
antifreeze and that just circulates so
if you disconnect that and you take out
your heat pump put in a new heat pump
you just have to make sure that there's
no air pockets in your in your loop and
you're fine to go you can keep using the
same liquid that was even in there you
know
no shouldn't I mean I had different
scenarios for every case but whereas as
far as the septic beds go you can
actually use those to your advantage
because the septic tanks actually give
off a certain amount of heat so if you
put your loop around the septic tank and
in new builds or if you're putting in a
new septic tank they'll actually put
them underneath the septic tank and put
the septic right on top and that energy
the heat coming off of your septic is
actually gonna benefit you in the winter
you're gonna get more heat so I don't
know in specific you know if your fence
line was right up to your septic tank
then you may not have the room to get in
there you need to have obviously the
room to get around it but definitely a
possibility
how sorry how what how common Geo is in
this region no I don't I don't know
that's that sorry I will tell you that
we have an unusually high number of
geothermal heating and cooling
contractors in this area and that may
have something to do with the fact that
our office is based here so we're
constantly looking for new dealers to
sell our product and our competition is
also not too far from here as well so
there there's we are the largest
distributor of heat pumps in Canada but
there are a number of other ones that
are also you know Canada wide as well
yes no there is the impact of of a
worldwide do you thermal gonna have
impact on the ground temperatures no
because it's your as you're pulling that
heat out of the ground it's constantly
being renewed by the Sun
you you couldn't take enough heat out of
the ground to change that temperature
completely some scientists have have
argued about that and said oh you're you
this is bad for the environment you're
taking more heating or putting more heat
into the ground you're changing the
ground temperature completely but it
averages out you know so you know
because it's you know getting that
energy from the Sun constantly the Sun
is changing the temperature of the
ground more than you ever can with your
own house you know the heat from your
house now you're roaming into going into
the realm of technical things I I'm the
creative services guy so I don't I don't
know I can't get too technical on you
but tons refers to the number of BTUs
and I the life of me can not remember
how many BTUs per ton but it is an
industry kind of standard how many you
know maybe something like eighteen
thousand I may be way off number of BTUs
per ton so when you have someone come in
and do a heat loss calculation for your
house they will tell you how many BTUs
you are you know your house is needed to
heat your house basically so I don't
know if that answers your question but I
will tell you that the number of BTUs
needed for a geothermal heat pump versus
a gas furnace is somewhat different and
that has to do with the way the
engineers do the calculations when
they're doing gas furnaces oil furnaces
and they calculate the heat loss of your
building the heat loss of your building
is one number but then they say okay
well let's err on the side of giving you
more than you need so they give you up
to like I think forty percent more BTUs
then you need to heat your house
so you're actually paying for a little
bit bigger unit so and that's kind of a
standard accepted number that in the
heat HVAC industry you know you say okay
well I've got a 2,000 square foot house
and an HVAC guy will say well you need
this many BTUs approximately but with a
Geo we like to say well why are you
trying to throw so much more heat at
your house the number that you know
we're trying to look for that accurate
number to your house so of course you
don't want to you know size your house
for it to you know a four ton unit if
you're planning to add a an addition on
the back you know if you know you're
gonna be daya heading it in addition you
definitely have to take that into
consideration you can so so what I'm
doing in my house is I'll have one
standard water heater and that could be
rented or I could buy it and then I'm
gonna actually have another one almost
exactly the same that will not have any
power to that so basically the hot water
that's coming out of the geothermal unit
will go to the storage tank and will sit
there until your hot water tank is ready
to call for water so instead of coming
water coming from the cold you know five
degrees cold water tap mains it's coming
from a hot water tank and that's gonna
be hot I think they were saying it was
like a hundred degrees Fahrenheit what
is that in Celsius I don't even like 40
or 50 Celsius so it's it's it's hot
enough definitely so you're you're
reducing your hot water it all depends
of course on you how much you use your
hot water but you're definitely gonna
see a reduction in the price of the hot
water
sorry what can you rent the geothermal
heat pumps yes it is possible there is a
company that was started to deal with us
on doing some kind of a rental program I
haven't heard of anyone actually doing
it yet but I thought it was a great idea
because I mean if you you know that they
were basically going to come in do all
the work and you just pay the monthly
bill if you're not planning to stay in
that house for a long period of time
that's a great option but I would have
to get you the the number of them I
because I don't know I haven't heard
much it's in last year so you had a
question back there
solar heating as well it's possible we
haven't you know we don't haven't sort
of recommended people to do that but I
think some people have sort of tried to
hook in solar heating as with the geo
we'd like to tell you that you're
probably gonna waste a little more money
than you need to and the geo system on
its own is gonna be have a far better
pay back then then putting in the solar
as well because when are you getting the
most heat from your solar in the
summertime you don't need to heat your
house with the in the seventh type so
you know you and it's not the solar
heating is not as efficient in the
