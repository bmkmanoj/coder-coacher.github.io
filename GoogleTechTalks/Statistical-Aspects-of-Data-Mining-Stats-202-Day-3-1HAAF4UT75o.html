at Google today we're going to sort of
get through the as much of chapter two
as I can what we won't quite get through
all of it but we'll get through most of
it in case you're playing along you know
this is the homework it's two a week
from today by the end of the day you
should know everything if you want to
play along and do this homework after
the Tuesday due date I'll mail around
solutions if you want to check your
answers if you're doing that okay so we
started on chapter two last time so we
said sort of what is data and we were
imagining that the rows were different
what I call observations what your book
calls objects and the columns were what
your book calls attributes and what I
call variables and then we sort of
talked about the different types of
attributes and so the main distinction
was whether they were categorical or
numeric and some of you said you know
what the book calls quantitative and
qualitative doesn't seem that natural to
you and I agree but the main distinction
is categorical versus numeric your book
calls categorical qualitative and it
calls numeric quantitative and you can
argue whether that's natural or not
so categorical put over here and then
numeric put over here and so that's sort
of the first distinction right every
attribute is either categorical or
numeric or is your book calls a
qualitative or quantitative
and so that's distinction discussed on
page 26
after that the categorical ones break
down into nominal or ordinal the
distinction there being whether or not
there is order so it's either nominal or
ordinal and that depends whether or not
the categories have order that you care
about or they don't you don't care about
the order and then the quantitative or
numeric attributes break down into
interval or ratio so sort of thing here
interval versus ratio and the
distinction there being simply that for
ratios we have a true zero and we can
divide them forth whereas interval
really doesn't make sense to do the
division examples so ID numbers I color
ZIP codes things like that are nominal
now zip code you could argue or ID you
could argue if you care about the order
it could be ordinal but if you don't its
nominal height tall medium short that
would be ordinal things that are
interval our temperatures in Celsius or
Fahrenheit right you can't divide to
Celsius
temperatures and say it's twice as hot
calendar dates right you want to divide
the thirtieth by the fifteenth to say
this is twice as you know whatever twice
is far from the beginning of the month
that's an unnatural starting point GRE
score when it makes sense to divide
those where as a ratio that's sort of
everything else that's do marek things
like temperature in kelvins right that's
a measure of how much heat energy so you
could say this thing has twice as much
heat energy length something is twice as
long times something took twice as long
counts I have twice as many as you do
right those all make sense to divide and
then if it helps you you can think about
the mathematical observations that
mathematical operations that go along
with these things things that are
nominal are either equal or not equal
that's the only information you have
ordinal you know some sense of greater
than or less than interval addition is
okay subtraction is okay ratio division
and multiplication and then everything
includes everything else before it right
so if that helps you think about these
distinctions and you can do it that way
and then the final thing we talked about
is discrete versus continuous and the
truth of the matter is they're
everything that's categorical is
automatically discrete
whereas numeric can be either discrete
or continuous so I think I'll not write
that down I wrote that down last time so
that's what I said here right if it's
categorical it's always going to be
discrete because they're just in
categories where if it's quantitative it
can either be discrete or continuous
depending on the situation so this was
the example that I put up here and so we
can sort of run through these this is
the same as the homework problem in
terms of the instructions just the
examples are different and we can run
through these it shouldn't take that
long basically they want you to say so
this is that question two from the text
they want you to say whether or not it's
binary discrete or continuous
so again binary is just a special case
of discrete meaning has two levels and
then once you do that say whether it's
qualitative or quantitative and then
qualitative you should say nominal or
ordinal quantitative you should say
interval or ratio so this one's called
in-class exercise number three so let's
just run through these now stop me if
you have any disagreement so number of
telephones in my house that should be
discreet
you can't own half of a phone let's see
size of french fries
it's going to be categorical and thus
discreet let's see see I own a I own a
cellphone or I do not now that's
categorical but it's not discrete we
would say that is binary right you can
sort of save some memory by just
allocating that to be binary okay number
of local phone calls you made in a month
so you can't make half a phone call so
that's also discrete I'll let's see here
e length of your longest phone call
anything that you can measure you can
think of being continuous right you can
measure as accurately as you want I
could say 10 minutes I could say 10.1
minutes length of your foot that's
something I could measure that would
also be then continuous let's see efg
price of your textbook what did we say
this one was discrete right because you
know if Amazon is trying to store prices
of books they don't really need to
allocate a float for that right I mean
it's only going to have two decimals so
we'll say that one's discrete as long as
it's money that you're spending you
can't have any more than two decimals
let's see EFG H let's see your zip code
you know you can't live at a decimal zip
code right those are actually whole
numbers so the street each eye
temperature in Fahrenheit I can measure
that as accurately as I want depending
on how good my thermometer is each i JK
same thing with Celsius same thing with
Kelvin okay so that takes care of that
and then the next thing is to say
whether it's qualitative or quantitative
and then if it's qualitative say nominal
ordinal of its quantitative is the
interval ratio so a number of telephones
in your house well that's a number so
it's definitely quantitative and it
makes sense to divide right I can say I
have twice as many phones as you so
that's ratio size of french fries
well that's categorical so your book
calls that qualitative and is that
nominal or ordinal ordinal right because
you you can think of this like if you
pre muted the large and the extra-large
you've lost information right there's
some information in the order you know
that extra large and large are closer
than extra-large and medium there's some
order to these things ownership of a
cellphone that's just simply qualitative
and that is going to be let's
we said qualitative meaning it's
categorical and I'm just going to say
that's nominal because with two things
you can you can permute them but you
can't lose any information if it's
binary there can't really be any order
to the two things so anything that's
binary I'm just going to call nominal
let's see number of local phone calls
you made in a month that's some number
that's quantitative and I can divide
those things so that would be ratio
let's see moving along a length of your
longest phone call that's got to be a
number that's going to be quantitative
and again I could divide the lengths and
say I talk twice as long as you that's
ratio F length of your foot also
quantitative and I can say my foot is
twice as long as yours we agree where
the zero is right zero is where you have
no foot and then you start from there we
all agree where zero is price of your
textbook and G that's also quantitative
and I can say my textbook quite cost
twice as much as you yours so that's
ratio let's see
zip code discrete qualitative right it's
a categorical variable and we're going
to say probably nominal for that
although if for some reason you're
getting order information from the zip
code like you know the small numbers are
on the East Coast you could say that
this is ordinal and if you look at the
instructions in the book they're sort of
apologetic they say some cases may have
more than one interpretation so it
really depends right if you're using the
order information the zip code of the
ordinal if you're not it would be
nominal the way to test yourself is say
if someone were to take your data and do
a one-to-one mapping of all the zip
codes to different numbers would that
lose information for you if that
represents a loss of information to you
then it's ordinal if it doesn't its
nominal okay then for the temperatures
right so Fahrenheit and Celsius ativ
right in all cases I'm computing some
number so these are all quantitative the
only difference though is that with
these two guys
I can't divide right where's this one I
can so these two guys are interval
doesn't make sense to divide whereas the
last one is ratio okay
all right so that takes care of that
that's the only thing I didn't finish
off last time any questions on any of
those okay so we're done with that now
the question is you know when you're
doing some sort of algorithm does the
software care about any of this
well it doesn't care about too much of
it but the one distinction it does care
about is between categorical and numeric
okay the the interval the ratio the
nominal the ordinal not so important but
just at least getting the categorical
categorical separate from the numeric is
pretty important and in are the two
names given to these are qualitative or
categorical variables are usually called
factors and the quantitative or numeric
variables are usually called numeric
okay so to give you an example of that
you can take a look here if you go back
to that stats 202 log text file we had
last time remember the first column was
IP address right and so certainly we
should agree that IP address ought to be
coded as a categorical variable or what
what are calls a factor so let me just
make a note of this in are things that
are categorical that's synonymous with
factor and things that are numeric are
numeric right okay so that first column
in that data set should be not you know
should not be numeric I don't want to
add or subtract two IP addresses they
sort of look like numbers but they have
a lot of decimals in them so you can see
what are does with that right if you
look at the first column here so let me
um read in the data now let me sort of
show you something here while I'm
thinking of it one way I often set my
working directory is just by sort of
grabbing the path from here but this is
sort of a funny Windows R
incompatibility if I do set working
directory this this will give me an
error what's wrong with that yeah you
know so that all maybe save me some
questions if you wonder why doesn't work
it's because that's not consistent
okay so that'll set my working directory
to my desktop and then I can just read
in the data that we'd read in last time
I say header equals false because
there's no header row okay and so now I
can look at the first column
and that is the IP address that so
that's those first column and you see it
spits out all 1921 1922 rows at me and
then it says something curious at the
bottom it so 73 levels and it starts to
list them right IP address IP address
dot another IP address so what it's
saying is that there's 73 unique levels
and so levels in are when you have a
categorical variable that's a factor the
levels are equal to the categories and
in this case this one has 73 unique
categories in this data set so that's
one way I know that it's treating this
as a factor or as a categorical variable
another way I could do you know to
determine that is I could say is dot
factor that is not factor function will
tell me if something is a factor in this
case it's true and conversely is dot
numeric will go to false okay so it's
reading that it's factor question
this yeah so interestingly enough if you
sort the sorting behavior is different
if you sort on something that's a factor
it will sort them and sort of a it's
hard to show with this example it will
sort them in sort of an alphabetical
order right so see if you can see like
an example of that
so in this case that sort of follows in
numeric order but if you had like 223
that was it would sort at 223 for a
factor but for numeric obviously would
go to 320 so it sort of will do a
different bit of sorting there okay so
how does it know so what we're doing is
we're just sort of doing the default
behavior because I just read it in and
took whatever it gave me so what its
logic it uses is if everything is a
number it's numeric okay if if there's
these any sort of funny characters it
will force it into a factor okay and you
can override these in the read CSV if
you want and I'll actually so I'll show
you a little bit more about that here on
the slide too so the question was how do
you know or how does it decide whether
it's going to be a factor the other
thing I'll mention while I'm on this
slide is that of course you can't sort
of do you know the usual numeric
operations on these things so it's a
factor so if I try to add 10 to it it'll
complain and it'll give me all these na
s and a warning message that says plus
is not meaningful for factors okay and
later on if I get a chance I'll show you
that Excel actually has a different
behavior where it doesn't complain so
much which can kind of be bad and get
you in trouble okay so you know it's
sort of like you know getting your types
right when you're coding right you have
to differentiate between the float and
the integer here we're differentiating
between the factor and the numeric now
if you look at the next kalos are if you
like a column eight that is a you know
numeric column if you look at the data
let me see if I can show you a column
eight so if I say data column eight
that's a whole bunch of numbers so you
think well it should read that in as
numeric however it doesn't is numeric
column eight
oops don't put what yeah is numeric data
data column 8 there we go false and is
that factor would be true of course okay
so the problem there is is what what's
the problem with that thing why's the
dashes right and you see when it says
there's 27 levels and a list of
different numbers but it also saw this -
right that's the problem with that one
so it sees the - and so right away it
says this thing is going to be a factor
these aren't numbers because there's
something in that it's not a number now
if you look at the data set you can see
that the convention whoever produces
these logs is - whenever there's
something missing they code it with a -
right so if I say data text to columns
I'm just doing this so you can see it a
little bit better space right okay
see so whenever something is missing
like here is a URL that's missing and
they just put a single - there as a
placeholder so ours not used to that
right our does not know that that's the
character they're going to use for
missing so the way we sort of fix that
so let me get caught up to myself here
however the 8th column looks like it
should be numeric why is it not how do
we fix this well it's not because it has
that - there which means missing so what
we should have done when we read it in
in our is we should have told it that
that - means that something is missing
and the way I specify that in our here
is you see I say this last command n/a
dot strings which is an argument to the
read CSV and I can even actually give it
a whole list of things here that
whenever it encounters those it will
treat those as n/a once I do that is dot
factor data column 8 now is false and is
not numeric column 8 is true so now it's
numeric and now I can do something like
data comma 8 and I can add 10 to it
right and then the things that we're the
- just show up is n/a okay so our we'll
treat it as numeric if everything is a
number or one of the characters that
you've told it is the missing value
character otherwise it will just treat
it as a factor and you can override
these if you look at the read CSV
there's ways in there to sort of force
out the behavior you want if you sort of
what you're expecting so you see as dot
is string as a factor so there's there's
commands to do that but I'm just sort of
just showing you what the default
behavior is and to sort of show you how
hard differentiates between these okay
any questions anything I said so far
okay so then the last thing I just
wanted to mention is you know suppose
you're trying to create an attribute and
you know that it's not numeric right so
like here's some zip codes and one of
them starts oo 1 2 3
I don't even know if that's a real zip
code so you say how would you do this in
R if you just tried to say like zip
codes to be the following so zip codes
store as the following vector would I
have nine four five five zero zero one
two three four three six four three six
one four if I do that you can you can
guess sort of what the behavior is it's
going to take that oo one two three and
and cut off the two zeros because it
thinks these are numbers and it thinks
I'm just being silly to put the zero
there right okay so how can you sort of
override this behavior well you want to
force this thing to be a factor and you
sort of want to force these things to be
strings and not numbers so you could
quote them which would at least give you
the give you keep the zeroes there
whoops that's going to yeah escape
escape will get you out of that when you
mess that up okay there we go so now you
can see zip codes codes and at least cut
them around there
however strictly this is still really
isn't a factor so really what you want
to do to force it to make sure it
becomes a factor is as dot factor now
you can always sort of as dot factor
later on as long as you kept the two
zeros along so some of the algorithms
will do when you pass things in you can
say as dot factor at that time but if I
do that then that will make my zip codes
to be a factor and you can see when it
spits it out it got rid of the quotes
right here had the quotes it got rid of
the quotes but it kept the two zeros and
tells me there's three levels
corresponding to my three zip code so
that adds not factor combined with the
quotes will sort of give you the correct
behavior that you want and
case and you can sort of do help and
read more about these question do you
still need the quotes that's a good
question well then I guess I do
yeah I think I do yeah
so it's factor but it's one two three so
it's a list of well it's a vector of
strings
I'm loosely speaking and I didn't want
to say list because that's another
special data structure so it's a vector
of strings say that so not necessarily a
factor which there's a little bit of
ambiguity here and and sometimes you
know the types and are is it's a little
bit ambiguous and sometimes one will
force out another but to be sure
I think the AZ dot factor along with the
quotes will give you exactly the
behavior you want okay let's see where I
am here okay how would you create an
attribute answer we would use quotes and
use the S dot factor okay Excel not
quite as picky allows you to sort of mix
types a little bit more if you want to
sort of force out behavior in Excel the
right thing to do is sort of click on
the column right click and go to format
cells and then go to the numbers tab so
let me sort of demonstrate that for you
so here's this data set in Excel suppose
I didn't like the way it was treating
this column I'd sort of click on at once
that it gets highlight highlighted I
would right click and I would say format
cells and you can change the font change
the border changing alignment but you
under the number tab here it's sort of
defaulted to general but you can sort of
ask it to do different things with it
and it has a lot of predefined formats
and you can also actually do some custom
formats so if you wanted to specify that
this thing always had to be five digits
or something like that you could you
could use that and so I think then I
asked you here sort of the same question
how would we create an attribute for
these three ZIP codes in Excel so you
can see sort of what happens here in
Excel let me open up a new file new
ooh blank workbook okay so I say like
what did I say nine four five five zero
and then I try oh oh one two three it
cuts them off of course right so the
question is how do I do this in Excel so
that I can keep the two zeros so I would
just sort of right-click on the column
and say format cells go here to the
number tab and I could force it to be
text for example text okay and now I say
nine four five five zero zero one two
three four three six one four now you
see it's sort of mad at me right it puts
that little green arrow and a yellow
warning sign with exclamation point on
it and if I ask it it says here the
number in this cell is formatted as text
or preceded by an apostrophe right like
looks like you're trying to write a
letter right so you go here and you say
ignore this error right you know and you
can even ignore it I think for the whole
column if you do it right I forgot how
to do that then the funny thing though
right is it knows these are texts but if
you do something like this one equals
this plus ten it will still add 10 oh
it's at hand yeah it did right it still
adds 10 to it so it doesn't really like
even though I stored it as text it still
lets me add 10 to it which is kind of
funny right whereas an R you know it's
told me no don't add 10 to your factor
Excel you know if it can add 10 to it it
will right so if you want to use you
know honors the views of the language
but it's not as strongly typed as R as
right if you if you sort of believe it
that way so Excel can kind of get you
into trouble in that sense okay so let's
see here where are we at how do I do
this in Excel I right click on the
column then choose format cells' under
number tab and select text and that will
least keep my zeros around but it
doesn't guarantee that it won't sort of
let me do arithmetic operations on those
zip codes later even though I shouldn't
be doing that okay so I think that's all
I wanted to say about types of data I
mean we talked about all the different
types but the main distinction in the
software is between the categorical the
numeric and then beyond that we have
sort of different distinctions which
aren't so important to the software but
might be important when we do the
analysis such as whether or not you can
divide two things or whether or not it
makes sense to sort of subtract two
things any questions about the different
types of data question
if stronger about our what would you
suggest as best materials for a
programmer knowing at 20 different
languages to learn this brother aegis in
crime fist around I found a 100 pages
PDF origami but it's mostly teaching you
elementary statistics and posting in
bits and pieces
maddening bits and pieces not
environment so the question is for a for
a person with a strong background in
programming you know how what can I read
to help me understand are anyone know of
any good books on that you can write are
are - users at the obvious place and
they might be able to recommend some
good books when I when I learned it was
like the first like programming language
I learned so I came at it from the
complete opposite point of view right
for a programmer to learn it you know
I'm not I don't know of a good reference
off the top of my head it is built on
see if that gives you any better feeling
at all and oh yeah yeah so anyway um
yeah I don't know of a good reference
for that or we're in general there's
some I don't know right and you have to
think it's like open source written by
people that don't really know how to
code that well in some cases so you have
to be a little bit careful I mean the
people that built it did right but some
of the functions and things like that do
some sort of very strange behavior okay
any other questions about the types of
data in our Excel okay so the next thing
I wanted to talk about it just sort of
some basics with R and sort of how you
manipulate data and things that you do
there so the first thing is like you've
seen me use this C operator before right
this basically creates a vector if you
help if it helps you to remember I used
to think of C as being like column
vector even though it looks like a row
vector that's just sort of my mnemonic
device so I do a a store as 1 comma 10
comma 12 so that's a vector and it takes
the values 1 10 12 okay then what can I
do with that well I can do you know
arithmetic operations on it if you add a
scalar to a vector it just does the
component wise addition and you get 11
20 22 as you would expect let's see what
else can I do here the length function
will tell you how long something is so
you know that summer tells you like
three and again any of these functions
you know you can always ask for help
question mark lengths and then it'll
tell you sort of what it's doing I think
let me see this if you type this what
happens sometimes you can get to see now
sometimes you can get to see sort of
more about it by doing that but in this
case I don't have it available to me
let's see what else do I have up here so
I can create another vector called BB
now one thing this is sort of funny why
do I call these a a and B B as opposed
to a B because you don't have to go too
far to get to C which is already
reserved and you get yourself in trouble
because you overwrite C right C is that
operator that makes these vectors so so
now BB is a vector it's a I mean you can
get yourself in trouble the first time
you're trying to do this okay so now I'm
going to create an object that's called
a data frame data dot frame and when you
read data in it usually comes read in as
a data frame this is sort of you know
the data frame is kind of like a matrix
with row numbers and column headers it's
kind of the standard unit of data in R
and so I read this in a data dot frame
then I said attribute a equals a a so
whatever I type here is going to be the
name of column a and then whenever I
type here R is going to be the values
that it takes which is the values of my
vector a and then the other one I called
attribute B and gave it the values B B
so now if you look at my data set sort
of looks like a matrix but see it has
the row numbers and the column names
right and so this is my data set this is
similar to something you would have read
in it has the column names attribute a
at root B and the values of column a are
stored as every day and Columbia stove
attribute B and then what can you do
with this type of structure well yes ah
no no I would have to have done if you
know I would have had to do where did
the plus 10 go I would have had to do a
a store as a a plus 10 if I wanted to
overwrite it right okay and you could
you know also do CC if you wanted to
create a new one right okay yeah the a a
dozen
doesn't do that okay well let's see so
there's my data set you can index into
this I think I showed you this before so
for example if you want the first column
of it you say my data set or do my data
set go there it is my data set column
one that will give you the first the
first column right 110 12 let's see what
else you can ask for the first row now
if you ask for the first row it will
give you the first row along with the
column names right there's the first row
1 2 some funny behavior well so let me
finish these first three yeah
it's it's simply taking a static copy
right so if I change AAA my data set
will not change yes yes yep okay so
let's see
so that's okay so what it will usually
do in most things is it will take the
longer of the two and then the other
column would have a missing value okay
sometimes in other cases it will
complain there's a common error that the
lengths don't agree but sometimes it
will it also has some other funny
behavior if you do like a 1/4 entry
right well there is no fourth entry but
you could store something as a fourth
entry and it doesn't complain at all
that that's out of bounds it just makes
it bigger so that's sort of funny
behavior too right yeah no problem right
so you want to see what a a 6 is and I a
6 store is this an a a missing 5 right
so it just sort of like gets longer so
it has some funny behavior that you know
could be could be troublesome you might
expect them there and it doesn't here I
just Index this is the Row 3 Row 2 no
problem that's the value of 79 one thing
that's funny
this used to get me and oh hang on I'll
get to in a second if I wanted the first
two rows and all the columns that would
do the trick right because this is the
first two rows and all the columns I
want to get to the one that's sort of
funny are here okay this one this one
always bothers me if I ask for the first
and third row and all the columns right
so first in third row I get it now the
funny thing about this thing though is
that the row numbers on this thing are
still 1 and 3 right so this thing sort
of its second row is numbered Row 3 why
does that bother me because if I go back
to this thing and I asked to see the
third row of this thing okay there is
none but if I asked to see the second
row of this thing there is one but it's
called Row 3 right and so it can be sort
of confusing to you if you get yourself
in trouble I think the best thing to do
is to create a new data frame and assign
you know fill in the values you want but
the indexing can get a little bit
confusing you know other things don't
have this behavior so you have to be
careful with it okay
to call the road esra name it would
probably be so the columns I can put
dollar sign
what-o has name three yeah there is but
I don't know what row has named three
yeah mate work right I'm not gonna try
so anyway so you can yet to be sort of
careful there with the objects in our
arithmetic is easy right like if you
wanted to divide two vectors as well you
guys have corrupted my a a by now but
you know you could just do that division
and it will just do the component wise
division right because if you look at a
a and B be right 1 divided by 1 divided
by 2 is 0.5 10 divided by 6 is one point
six six right so doing arithmetic is no
problem at all you know Oh what is it
let's see what is it doing here so
repeating me that's funny yeah yeah yeah
so 10 divided by 6 12 / 79 five divided
by what by two yeah yeah very very
stupid behavior in these so these
should all be na yeah yep that sent
that's I ain't right
int that's a really big number
yeah okay different from na right okay
there's a negative M - yeah yeah yeah
that's a really small number okay um
let's see what else do we have here so
division is okay there's some you know
obvious summary statistics right here I
show you mean median there's no standard
deviation so I do the square root of the
variance there is an SD that's that's
like some just SD
let's confirm this I always do the
square root of variance now you're
telling me there's a standard deviation
so you're saying this is the same as SD
SD one less prentices oh there you go
all right same thing okay and then you
saw a mean and median up there and of
course any of these functions you can
always do question marking at the help
on it and notice you know the function
of the function no problem there of
course let's see so there's summary
statistics writing data right so I
showed you how to read that in how do
you write data right dot CSV that'll do
the trick I give it a couple arguments
here the first is the data set and the
second is the name of the file for the
output file right so I'm going to save
whatever's in my data set to this file
called my data set at CSV and it's going
to go on my desktop because that's where
I set my working directory so if I
looked around my desktop it wrote out
this file and if you look at it there it
is right that's my data set that I
created in R now it did create an extra
column for the road Ames if you want to
get rid of a column in Excel click once
on the left to highlight it click once
on the right and say delete and it's
gone now in Excel okay this is a stupid
thing about Excel right is that if you
want to have column names they have to
go in the first row there's no way to
change the a and the B to say attribute
a and attribute B so sometimes in Excel
we just sort of sacrifice the first row
to be the column names and that's sort
of life but you have to be careful
because you know it's sort of like you
have to be two based right not one base
not zero base but you're sort of like
two based so I think that's what I
wanted to say here coming yeah
the default behavior on write dot CSV I
think is over right but let's see write
dot CSV it can append also penned equals
false
so default would be over overwrite yeah
okay let's see here so this is an excel
how do we read data into Excel well you
could right-click and you could say open
with and then how do you delete a column
I just showed you that click on it and
say delete um arithmetic in Excel so
this is sort of cute you know when you
play with your spreadsheet here if you
want to add 10 you know add 10 to column
a right or I think I did column B in
this one I can type as soon as you type
equals in any cell in Excel that's sort
of like the magic sign for it to start
doing something and you see up here in
the little formula box the equals shows
up and I could say equals b2
right that's how I call this one column
B Row 2 equals b2 and this one even has
you know blue highlighting and
everything and I hit return and there it
is 2 right and so then this one would be
equal b3 and there it is right now if
you don't like that you can do something
even better right you can say equals and
you can click there and it writes in b2
for you and you say plus 10 and then if
you don't write doing it every time you
can do a couple things see how the
corner here is little like notched out
on the corner if you drag on that guy
it'll sort of do the autofill for you
right b3 plus 10 B 4 plus 10 and this
thing will give you some options if you
don't want it to do that autofill oh you
know if you just wanted to copy R things
like that and of course then since this
is a function of this you know if I
change this one that one will change
along with it right so if you wanted
sort of a static copy of it you could
get that by doing edit copy on this
thing copy and you could do what's
called edit paste special
so this paste special whenever it's
copying pasting in ways that you don't
want it to you can do paste special and
here I would paste just the values in
the number formats as opposed to
formulas and so now this is a static
copy so I can you know do whatever I
want to this one
but this one will stay static right okay
so let's see that's sort of earth
arithmetic in Excel I showed you that
there are some functions in Excel to
sort of do some basic stats not too much
the you know but if you go insert
function and then there's a if you go to
all you just get an alphabetical listing
of every function Excel has if you want
to browse and sort of see what it has
you can go to the statistical category
of course the statistical category is
just a subset of all as the name would
imply but you can do some basic
calculations here let me just get rid of
this stuff so if I wanted to do like the
mean in Excel it's not called mean
anymore
it's called average okay so we just go
here average average and you say average
and then it brings up this sort of
dialog box and you say it looks like it
wants to numbers but one is enough and
actually if you just sort of click on a
column a it'll fill in for you a colon a
it doesn't care that there's a word you
know at recruit a there it'll just
ignore that and it will compute the mean
is seven point six six six just like our
would insert function all I could do the
median also which will be the middle
number which would just be ten right and
then just like in our insert function
STD oops St stdev standard deviation
estimates the standard deviation based
on the sample and so you say give me the
standard deviation of column a and just
like we got an R five point eight five
nine four six five
okay so Excel has a lot of these you
know really basic stat summary measure
functions built-in and it's kind of nice
you know if you have a spreadsheet
because then you can go back and change
this data and it will update these
functions for you okay so let's see does
that cover what I was going to say
working with that in Excel use insert
function all just go to find alpha
listing of functions we had the average
I showed you the median I showed you the
standard deviation okay yeah that takes
care of all that so I think that you
know that gives you sort of an off
background to start playing with with
both of these and you know for for most
of the stuff we're going to be doing you
know initially this this will be enough
the real cool thing is to learn of
course are the plotting which we're
going to cover in chapter 3 but in terms
of manipulating data in our in Excel
I think that'll sort of give you a good
background to go on does anyone have any
questions about anything I said so far
today okay so the last thing to talk
about in um chapter 2 and is the
sampling which they talked about in page
47 so why do we care about sampling well
you know we when I tell you say data
mining is for large data sets I mean the
first thing you say you know is how
large is large well that sort of depends
right and the point is that in some
sense it's sort of the fact that it's
you know not ten observations starts to
create some challenges for you I mean
you know ten observations I can look at
okay a thousand has already you know
starts to be large because I can't look
it and as it gets larger and larger
there's there's fewer and fewer things
you can do so in that sense you know we
you know it doesn't matter how large is
large you know we're not going to look
at really large facets in here because
I'm going to be playing with our on my
PC you know but depending on what sort
of data sets you have you have other
ways of manipulating the data but
regardless you always want to somehow
have some way of sampling the data right
because some questions that can be
answered on the whole data set can be
answered a lot more efficiently by
taking a sample now in statistics we
often talk about sampling because you
know we have some large population and
we can't afford to get all the data from
it so we just take a sample right I want
to know what fraction of all Americans
going to vote for certain presidential
candidate well I can't afford to ask all
Americans but I can afford to ask a
sample and the sample if it's
representative and chosen correctly
might give me a close enough answer to
what I'm after
so in data mining we sort of play the
same game but the the context and data
mining is that we're doing the sampling
not because we can't get all the data
but often because we have so much data
that it's going to be slow inefficient
and unnecessary to do the calculation on
the whole data so for example if I have
what's that MapReduce well yeah right I
mean you could compute you know but if
you get the same answer either way right
i mean you doesn't matter right so
something if I want to compute a mean
for millions and millions of numbers and
I'm going to round it off to one decimal
anyway if I can take a random sample
I'll get the same answer right so that's
sort of the motivation now the mean is a
good example I mean from the sample the
mean of the whole data set as long as
you did the sample
early and inset the seed to 301 then you
have have no problem but something like
the max right not so good right the max
of the sample the max of the whole data
set those are going to be very
dissimilar so depending on what you're
interested Sam thing will sometimes give
you sort of the answer and a more
efficient matter also sometimes the Sam
thing it isn't so obvious like what
objects you should sample and I'll talk
about that a little bit to what I want
to say is sort of this I copied down
from the book and I think it's funny
because it's completely circular right
so it says um says using a sample will
work almost as well as the entire data
sets as using the entire data sets if
the sample is representative so what
does it mean to be representative a
sample is representative if it has
approximately the same property of
interest as original set of data right
so it's very circular but the point is
it depends what you're after right some
things are after like I mentioned the
mean or something like that
the sample will give you a good enough
answer as long as you did it sort of an
affair a fair manner but other things
you know that the sample may not
preserve that property something like
the maximum the sample maximum is can be
different from the population maximum
and so you're going to going to suffer
there so anyway I wanted to talk about
sort of some basic sampling so the first
thing sort of is the simple random
sample which you know is simply the the
names out of the Hat right I'm just
going to draw you know K names out of a
hat of N Things right so every item has
the same probability of inclusion and
every sample fixed size has the same
probability of selection right so this
is sort of the standard names out of the
Hat paradigm and in statistics some
people will say you know SRS right it's
just a simple random sample the most
basic thing you can get right simple
random sample and this is generally the
type of sound thing that you're used to
now the question is you know that what
are the things right if I imagine the
data as being the matrix then the things
are the rows or the objects or the
observations and I just sample those
randomly but if your data doesn't really
fit into that paradigm then it's hard to
know like what are the things and I'll
talk about that in a second and then the
only other thing to watch out for you
know it should you do it with
replacement or without and often that
doesn't make a difference but in some
cases it does and so it's important to
think about that and it's obvious what
that means right with replacement you
sort of throw the name back in a hat
so you can get it again where's the
tower replacement is sort of a sample of
unique items right you can't get the
same person twice and then of course the
more complex schemes the book talks a
little bit about stratified sampling
there's also cluster sampling Latin
hypercube sound there's a lot of
different sampling techniques that sort
of preserve the fairness but also sort
of increase the uniformity which
decreases the variance okay so you know
there's an interesting experiment
sometimes people do when they talk about
this which is like I let you flip a coin
five times and write down you know head
head tail whatever you get and then I
let you pretend that you flip a coin
five times right and it turns out that
people sort of when they pretend they
get a lot more uniform than when they
actually do it right because the
sampling can actually give you some
funny stuff right because anything is
possible so sometimes you want a little
more uniformity so so there's some other
schemes that sort of ensure that right
like you can imagine a sort of a coin
where you sort of ensure that you get
sort of 50% heads and 50% tails you know
so that you don't sort of get this extra
variability in there right question oh
the difference between these okay so I
should give you an example of when one
would make much more sense than the
other right so cash off the top of my
head um let me see if I can mention a
case where you could get yourself in
trouble so
I'm drawing a blank so I'm drawing a
blank on this one so for example if
you're polling people and you ask a
question you'd better not fold should be
done without well so so I yeah yeah
there's that and if you if you're going
to run up against the boundary right it
could be bad because then if you're sort
of the sample becomes you keep sampling
and keep sampling without replacement
like by the like at some point you know
who you're going to get is the guy that
you haven't got before right so okay
yeah I'm at a loss that sort of give you
good practical examples of where one is
more important than the other but there
are there are certainly cases where it
matters to some degree and maybe we can
yes so coin flip would be with
replacement right because the second
flip you don't say I know it's going to
be tails because we ran out of heads
right so was it case there right anyway
you should just sort of pay attention to
which makes more sense than the other
and if you develop a scheme you should
pay attention to which it's doing in
Excel you know I it's rare that you
really need to sample in Excel because
you get sort of only sixty five thousand
rows or a hundred thousand rows but if
you wanted to there is a rand function
excel that sort of acts as a random
number generator it's one of the worst
random number generators that exists you
know and you can play some games with it
and sort of see you know different weird
things it does but if you call this rand
function they'll spit out a random
number between zero and one and then you
could sort on this column and say like
take the first n and you know just to
also demonstrate that for you right so
suppose here's the log file so suppose I
say I want to take a random sample of
100 so one easy thing I could do is just
come over here and say insert function
all are a nd Rand and say ok and that
gives me this rant whoa why is it
negative
oh that column has stuff in it already
okay let's clear out some room here
okay so first time I got a negative
number between zero and one
yeah no it's not that bad right okay
let's try that again insert function r
md r and okay there we go point eight
seven seven okay and now i just double
click to fill it up now you see every
time you sort of do something with it it
changes which is funny right anyway
these are random numbers between zero
and one if you if it bothers you that
they're changing here I'll just I'll
paste a static copy of them at these
special values okay
there we go now they're changed again
but at least now learning I can't change
anymore okay so those are random numbers
between zero and one and it filled up
the whole column with them and then I
could do something like sort you know a
through Z or Z through a and it'll sort
right oh hang on it's not the right
behavior so all okay that's sort of
interesting what it did it assumed that
the first one was the was the row name
I'm sorry the column name there's no
column names in here so let me try and
do that a little bit better data sort
expand then I have to tell it no header
row right because it was thinking yeah
excel is pretty okay it was thinking
that the first one was a header row and
I'm going to sort it by column K right
column K okay there we go so now the
smallest one is for a second okay
excited cetera et cetera et cetera okay
so if I take say then the first hundred
of these that would be a random sample
of 100 now would that be with
replacement without replacement that
would be without right because there's
no way I could get the same row twice if
I wanted to with replacement you could
still sort of call Rand and then let ran
determine what role you take and then
you know you could take the same row
more than once but anyway that would be
a nice way to get a simple random sample
without replacement in excel um in okay
so here I showed you some screenshots
insert function Rand and then I sort by
that thing and that works okay in our
there's a you know there's a random
number generator in our you can use too
but there's also a function called
sample which is pretty nice
which I have a few minutes I can
demonstrate for you here so here's the
help on sample it takes some arguments
takes the X which is what you're trying
to sample the size which is how many you
want replace which defaults to fall so
if you want with replacement you have to
write that as true and you can actually
even give it probabilities which is nice
so let's see here the next one I say
here explain how to use our to draw
simple random sample of 10 observations
with replacement from the first
quantitative attribute in the data set
stats to a to log dot text so if you
look at this data set here the first
quantitative attribute is this one here
well you know we could pretend its
quantitative right we know it's not but
it looks quantitative so I could say
let's to some random sample of that one
it really should be categorical right we
know that we know that but if you didn't
mean to say it's quantitative okay so I
want to draw a simple random sample of
that let's see do I still have I don't
have that data in here do I
let's see stats 202 log text I don't
think that I do so let me read it in so
actually so here's the sorry so hang on
maybe I have it in there data
yeah I think it's in there right yeah
it's still there
okay so I have it in there so I want to
draw a simple random sample with that so
I'm going to claim that the the
following will work to do that I'm going
to say so I did it in two steps you
could have done it in one step here so
let me sort of to say what each thing is
doing here so first of all the function
of sample right I give it some arguments
the first thing I tell it is what I want
to sample so I say sample sequence 1
comma 1922 so 1 comma 1922 in the
sequence thing is exactly integers from
1 to 19 to 22 inclusive right ok and so
that's what oh that would be the same
thing right one : 19 20 to write the
sequence thing is nice could actually
let you go by twos or fours and things
like that it takes some other arguments
so that's the same thing so I put that
there
what else do I have here 10
that's how many I want and then replace
equals true so when I do this thing
basically I get a sample of 10 integers
between 1 and 1922 right every time
right ok and if you want to set the seed
there's a set dot seed argument but by
default I think it's setting something
off of the clock so that will give you a
sample of 10 integers so how do you use
that to draw a sample of 10 rows from
the data set well you simply go here and
you say my sample and I say ok let me
tell you this one so if I say data 7th
column that gives me that I could also
say data dollar sign v 7 because if you
look at the data it named the seventh
column v 7 right if you look at that so
those two things are equivalent so if I
say data v 7 and I say give me the rows
that are in Sam right what's Sam Sam is
the name I gave to that previous thing
right so let me just sort of showed up
here so Sam is what I called my my
sequence of 10 integers that I sampled
randomly from 1 to 1922 with replacement
and then I say my sample would be data
the seventh column and I want Sam right
so the seventh column is just one
dimensional so I just have to specify
these rows so that will work to give me
a sample of 10 observations from that
data set so let me just sort of show you
that so take my 10 observations and then
that's my sample right those are the 10
numbers I'm going to take those of the
10 rows I'm going to take and then I say
my sample store as 7th column those guys
so if you look at my sample there it is
right there's your sample now what's
interesting then of course is to say ok
so the mean of my sample right so I'm
pretending this thing is numeric even
though I know it's not really numeric I
just wanted to use this data set so the
mean in my sample is 281 point 6
however the mean of all of data dollar
sign column 8 right is oops
seven there you go two hundred ninety
nine point three nine three three so two
hundred eighty one is not the same as
two hundred ninety nine point three nine
eight three nine three three so of
course the answer is like well you
should have taken a bigger sample the
question is you know how big of a sample
you should take and so one thing I think
that I'll talk about let me sort of get
back to the slides here so that's how we
take a sample of 10 the next thing says
if you do the sampling repeatedly how
far is the mean of the sample from the
mean of the whole column on average
right so if you do that repeatedly and I
think you know we'll do this next time
we can see how far the sample mean
differs from the true mean and you'll
see I think it averages I'll sort of put
up a loop next time to do that but it
averages you're off by about like twenty
or thirty on average and then the next
thing we'll do next time so I'll show
you that and then we'll increase the
sample size from 10 to 100 see how that
changes and what you're going to see and
we'll do this next time is that it
scales by the square root of the sample
size so if you haven't seen that before
this is sort of a good demonstration of
that and there's a sort of simple math
you can work out to show you why that
happens basically the variance scales
linearly but then the standard deviation
which is really on the same scale the
original data is going to scale like the
square root of the sample size right so
as if you increase the sample size by a
factor of 10 you sort of decrease your
error by a factor of the square root of
10 so I'll demonstrate that to you last
time but since were just about out today
I think I'll leave it at that are there
any any questions before we take off for
the 4th of July no no questions ok so
yeah next time we'll finish up chapter 2
and then we'll get into chapter 3 where
we make some plots textbook is not a oh
wait what am I supposed to say I'm
supposed to tell you that they're taking
orders through edge library so if that
means anything to you if not I'll try
and send around an email explaining that
but it sounds like sounds like we can
order them and that sounds like we don't
have to pay so I'll send around an email
about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
