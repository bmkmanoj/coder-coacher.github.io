through building a directive in ionic 2
but I'm going to try something a little
bit different this time
I was originally going to just write a
tutorial on creating a directive for the
blog but I thought why not I have a go
at just recording me making it from
scratch so I don't really have any idea
how this thing is going to work yet I
just have a vague idea of what I want it
to do but I thought it might be
interesting to see
I guess the process of how I might go
about creating something in a real
scenario I guess when I usually create
tutorials about things I do them
beforehand I know how they work I know
they will work but this I don't even
know maybe I'll run into some blocking
issue that I just can't solve so we'll
see what happens and see if we get
something interesting out of it so the
basic idea is I want to make this
directive called
absolute drag and I want to be able to
attach that directive to any element and
then have the element be absolutely
positioned and have the ability to drag
and move that anywhere in its container
now we're dealing with something like a
drag event like a pan event like
scrolling there's there's a lot of
events they get fired off all at once so
this is going to have similar issues to
the paralax header directive I've made
previously and I've put that up here and
so the problem with doing stuff like
this is it because it updates so
frequently you could be firing off you
know 20 events a second to update its
position they can cause problems with
lag in the layout constantly sort of
performing these update operations can
cause some choppiness so in the case of
scrolling if you're trying to update the
position saying every time a scroll
event is fired it's going to cause some
jenkki nests and so that's what
ionic have put a lot of effort into
solving and more recently Adam Bradley's
talked about this Dom right event that
they padded this is specific to
specifically to the scroll event here in
the content area but basically what Dom
right allows us to do is perform our
updates in the most efficient way
possible so rather than us just updating
the position of saying on the screen
immediately as soon as we say let's do
this now it'll wait and it will organize
it so that it fits in with the flow of
how everything is rendering yeah so
that's going to make make it perform a
lot better especially on lower
performing devices like Android devices
I've run this parallax header directive
on Android device I think it was like a
four point one point one Android and it
performed fine I their baby like some
slightly noticeable choppiness but very
little amount and it is a very bad phone
in general so I was quite impressive
someone try use a similar concept for
this drag directive so to start off with
I already have a project up here I'm
just going to create the directive first
so we'll run ionic G directive and I'll
call absolute drag
and then I'm just going to add that into
the app module file here so I'll import
that and then just add it to the
declarations right okay so let's start
thinking about how we want to build this
thing so I'm gonna try and do a simple
implementation of a first I'll just try
and place a let's go with a button I
guess or anything really I will just add
it to the content area of a page and
we'll try and make it so that we can
drag it around and I'll probably do a
text tutorial of this as well on the
blog with some more
I guess thoughts afterwards perhaps
cleaning it up a bit but hopefully mmm
hopefully we can get something that
works pretty well in this video so let's
just clean up some stuff in here a bit
first
and then what I might do is jump into
where we're going to actually use it and
let's come up with a hypothetical
scenario of what we want that to look
like how we want to be able to use the
directive so I will just go with a
button for now so do an eye on button
and then we'll also attach the directive
which was absolute drug you can see the
selector here is absolute drag so if I
add that add that here or apply that
directive to this button and I will just
say drag me now since this is going to
be absolutely positioned then we may
want to supply some initial values for
it as I'm going to add in some options
so that you can specify here where on
the screen it should start and for the
sake of just keeping things simple for
now I'm just going to use some manual
pixel values to specify the left and the
top values so maybe we'll just use
something called start left put that at
20 and start right at top rather
so that's going to specify the distance
that it should be absolutely positioned
from the left and from the top of the
container so now that we have that vague
idea in mind let's let's try and build
the directive itself actually before I
even do that I might just serve the
application right now so we can see see
this director was being loaded in and
that's we haven't managed to break
anything already okay so we have our
drag me button there I'll open up the
console
and it looks like we had that the
console statement from the directive so
that implies that it's active it's
working and cool so we can just try to
make it work now so the first thing I'm
going to do is set up those initial left
and top values that we could supply into
this directive so what we want to do is
I'm gonna add an mg on an it here I show
us how to do it
after view and yet so the view is ready
for that so I'm gonna grab those
configuration values and then set the
absolute positioning of the element the
host element to whatever those values
were and so we're going to have to grab
both of these of course so we're going
to use the input property to do that so
we're just going to import input first
and then we'll grab it with Isis
supplying the name of the input so we're
using here so start left and we'll just
call that start left and start rights
and we'll call that start right and so
let's just check that we actually are
able to get those values so I'll just
log out this don't start left and this
don't start right to make sure that's
working jump back in the browser see
what happens so we've got one of them
the other ones undefined for some reason
what did I do
oh of course it's that top not start
right yeah we'll just go through ups
just go through and change those and
check again all right okay so we have
both those values now now we want to set
them on the host element that the
directive is attached to so what we can
do is we can grab a reference to the
element that the directive is attached
to with element ref and we're going to
use something called the renderer to
change some properties on that you can
just change the properties directly
without using renderer but the renderer
is a more sort of platform agnostic way
to make the changes so angular's kind of
designed to work in other environments
besides just JavaScript so you can do it
in a JavaScript way or you can kind of
do it any angular way which is more
adaptable so we're going to inject both
of those into the constructor now so
create a reference to the element as
element and all just create a reference
to the renderer as well it's going to
delete that console.log statement now I
don't really need that and now we're
just going to use the set element style
on the renderer to set these values so
we can do this dot renderer got a set
element style and then we supply the
element that we are styling which will
be the element which is the reference to
the host element which is the button and
then we need to grab that native element
and property we want to set first is
position and I want to set that to
absolute so let's save that and we'll
just check that that value is applying
that absolute positioning
okay so I've just got the the console up
here and we can see that we have
absolute being applied to the button
which is exactly what we want is that
school so now let's move on to doing the
other two values which is going to be
the left and the top for positioning the
absolute positioner so we'll do the same
thing again this don't render a dot set
element style they start element native
element and we'll set the left property
to whatever this is so we'll set it to
this dot start left I sure don't even
any dead pixels on to end of that let's
see if that works
I'm not sure save that and it'll just
ins that again there we go I know I
think I've had pixel set so add on px to
the end and hopefully that works yeah so
we can see now either that's being
positioned 20 pixels from the left and
so now we're going to do the same thing
for the top so we'll just copy and paste
that
change that to top change this to start
top and then we should be able to see
that being 100 pixels down from that
header there cool so so far so good
that's working we are able to grab those
initial options we've created here and
supply them to our directive and have
that position the button you could also
specify these dynamically surround these
in square brackets and create a binding
to some option in the home door ts file
you could change these or set these up
dynamically if you aren't sure on how
those sort of property bindings work
I'll link to a video separately that you
can watch about that okay so the next
thing we want to do is to be able to
drag the button now we can position it
now we need to drag it and then update
its position relative to that drag so
I'm just going to clean this off a bit
get release console statements first and
then what we're going to do is add the
host property to the directive here and
this is saying I've also done a bit of a
video on before if you want to check it
out so I'll link to that essentially
with the host weekend we can listen to
an event that is happening on the host
element and so the event we want to
listen for is pan this is just a event
that's available by default and again I
have another video that talks about some
gestures and different types of events
we can listen for if you want to look at
that but hopefully we should be able to
listen for a pan here and then have some
function in here handle that so we'll
just call it handle pan line up and
we'll also pass in the event to that
sort of specify handle pan here passing
the event
and then we'll just log that out here to
see if it is working so save that jump
back in I actually have no idea if this
is going to work or not but hopefully it
will all right so if I grab this and try
to drag it now cool it looks like we're
getting some stuff
so as we're sort of panning this we're
getting everything logged out to the
console here we're getting the pan event
data and we get a whole bunch of values
here so some of which of these we're
going to need use to update the position
so looking through these it looks like
perhaps the center property here might
be a good one to use to change the
position so we'll change the the left
value to this X here and then the top
value to Y so we'll give that a go and
we'll see what that looks like so we're
not really going to worry about doing
any kind of optimizations just now we
just want to see if we can get something
working so I'm going to grab that sort
of Center object so that'll be event
centered on X or Y so we'll just do that
again make sure we're getting the
correct value here cool so a bunch of X
values there that looks good so I'll do
that a bit slower so if I drag slowly
over to the right way
I can't drag slowly I do it a bit faster
yeah so we can see as I drag over to the
right values increase so that looks like
it's probably what we want to use okay
so now we're gonna do this same idea
again where we're setting the element
style so I'm just gonna grab the left
one here I show that both of those taste
that there and then we'll just instead
of using the start left and start chop
we'll use the center values so event dot
center dot X for the left and then event
don't Center dot Y for the top so save
that and we'll try and drag it around
and see what happens
as it looks like we can drag it some
stuff is happening there's definitely
some weirdness going on here
I guess the some kind of offset values
going on so it's a second ago it popped
up to the top left I'm not sure what's
causing that so that's a bit of weird
behavior going on with attempting to use
the center to set the position so maybe
we'll just try a different tactic
instead and what we'll try and use is
the Delta X and Delta Y the changes in
the pan so I'll keep track of how much
it's panned and then update the current
values based on that so what I'm going
to do is keep track of what the current
position is so I might just create two
or I'll create one object here called
current position and I'm just going to
set that to whatever the start left and
start top is so I'll give it a default
value of width x and y values of zero
and zero to start off with and in here
we'll just set that to our initial start
value so so that 2x as this dot star
left
and why is this don't stop right and
let's just take another look at that
event there to see what what values we
want to use I don't have to change that
to this stock current position - sorry
alright let's jump into the browser and
it's reason I keep saying start right is
that what I mean is stuff talk okay so
let's take a look at this event again
and see what else we can find
so I think the approach I'm gonna try to
take originally as grab these just
grabbed the Delta X and the Delta Y
values and add that on to whatever the
current position is so we'll come into
here and we'll just create say a new I
should call it a new left I should
really call it X and why I might change
it no I'll leave it as I say new new
left equals so in this current position
X plus whatever the Delta X was so we
can grab that through event don't don't
- X so DV u dot Delta X and we'll do the
same for the new right because this dot
current position Y Plus event Delta Y
and so then we're going to use those
values and here instead the set left -
new left and I did it again
new right that should be new top and we
set this one to new top and then we're
also going to want to update that
current position object as well so it
can be updated properly next time so set
the current position to new left
and newt all say that jump back into the
browser and hopefully we have some good
things happening all right I'm gonna try
drag it now and something is happening
with definitely not a good thing so I'm
just gonna keep a watch on the button
here and see what the values are
currently there so let's try to drag it
and see what's going on there it looks
like we are getting absolutely huge huge
values it's converted to scientific
notation it looks like so that is why we
can't see the e button because it is
getting set to some huge value so let's
try and figure out why why that isn't
doing exactly what we want it to do so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna look
out the left values and we'll see what
they look like and I'm also just going
to comment out this event
otherwise it's gonna span the screen all
right so I try to drag that again and
you can see we just have this ah I can
see what's happening where so we're
concatenated the the string instead of
using the sort of adding the numbers
together we're adding strings and
numbers together so I say here if that's
not sure actually what these numbers are
but so that's 20 and 11 and then it's
like plus 14 so it's adds 14 to the end
then add 16 to the end of that then 21
or 23 and so on so we get this quite
beautiful looking actually a little
cascade of numbers growing it's
definitely not what we want to do so I
might do is just add in a path int
turn it into an integer yeah I will see
if that's so it's that problem so we
definitely have something better going
on now but we still have the button just
flying off screen it looks like if I
just drag that a little bit
seems to be moving a lot more than I'm
actually dragging so and it's also see
if I can move it is uh it does move to
the left if I drag to the left I'm not
actually sure what's going on here this
it looks a little bit funky let's just
bring up that event again and take a
look and make sure we're not doing
anything too weird all right so I mean
having a little bit of a play around
here and it's a keeping track of the
current position not working so well so
I'm changing that I'm gonna get rid of
this current position idea here yeah
whatever that is oh and what I'm using
instead is just the the pointer point a
value for wherever the mouse is
currently on the screen now it seems to
be quite accurate
so I'm going to use that for now so if I
go into here again so if I just try to
drag this now we have a similar issue
before it's not dragging exactly where
we're actually touching but the it's a
lot smoother we don't have any
strangeness with it resetting back to
the top left I'm not sure why that was
happening but it seems quite reliable
this event and I think what is happening
here is that because we are using the x
and y value of the pointer that's going
to that the mouse pointer that's going
to be relative to the screen and now the
absolute positioning though is relative
to this container we're in and so this
header bar isn't really taken into
account so when I'm dragging it looks
like that's about the distance that the
button is below where I'm actually
clicking is the distance of the header
so I think that's what's causing this
issue so we've got to come up now we've
got to come up with some way to solve
that now Before we jump into coming up
with a solution for that let's check
that that is actually the problem easy
way to do that is going to be it is to
get rid of the
head up so get rid of that and we'll see
if it is a problem and yeah it looks
like that here's the problem so if I do
it now you can see it's dragging from
the top left of that button there and we
don't have that issue where it's
floating a little bit below the pointer
yeah so again the question now is how do
we fix that right now I I don't know
I'll have a bit of it think because we
want to when it's over in a way that's
it's an adaptable the works in all
situations we don't want to just say we
don't just want to so hard code in some
kind of offset value for the header
because then if we if we don't have a
header it's not gonna work or if we have
a different size header it might not
work or if we want to use this inside of
some small container on the page
somewhere it's not kind of work so we
want to come up with some solution that
is that works in most circumstances so
I'm just gonna bring the bring the
header back so we can have a play around
with that and what my current thinking
now is is so it's I mean there's
definitely room for improvement for this
directive but don't want this video to
drag out too long so my current thinking
is to just have this button be
positioned relative to the entire screen
not just the content area that it's in
this will make it less only gets less
adaptable in the sense that if you did
want to have some little small sub
container or something and then have it
be position:relative within that it's
not going to work as well but for now I
just want to get a working example and
then perhaps I can expand on it in the
future so let's take a look at the
structure of the page here okay so just
having a poke around in here looks like
what's causing the issue is the margin
top for the scroll content so this is
added automatically to account for
to account for the header so that the
scroll contents actually add a list to
the page here it's not going to the
scroll is going to start at the bottom
of the header it's not going to scroll
underneath that and so what we can do to
change that behavior is I mean we could
just get rid of that margin there
manually but there's also an attribute
we can use which I believe is fullscreen
so if I add a full screen here and save
that hopefully that should get rid of
that margin on the scroll content so
let's just this is check if that's gone
scroll content of course and now it's
padding instead of margin so if I rub
this now you can see we don't have that
issue anymore we can just drag it and it
drags from the top left corner of the
button rather than having that margin
which was pushing it down a little bit
so this mostly works now again tons of
room for improvement for this but we do
have the basic functionality there now
and one more important thing though that
I want to get into before I end the
video is about how bad this is this is
really an efficient in the way that's
updating that Dom it is updating it
every single time we get one of those
panda vents so as you can see the screen
was just flooded with events and we're
trying to update the Dom every single
time we get one of those and it's just
it looks like it works fine in the
browser but I bet if you were to run
that on an older Android device or maybe
even on the iPhone iPhone it might not
work so well you'll just see that it
will struggle so instead we want to make
use of the the Dom right
the Dom right event I was talking about
before which allows us to basically tell
a onic to handle it and they or the
framework will schedule that update so
that it's efficient so when when the
parallax example I could grab the the
Dom writer sort of provided through the
scroll event itself so we can easily do
that we don't have access to that
through the pan event here but what I
can do and what I can do is import the
Dom controller from the ionic library I
can then inject that into the
constructor so I'll just inject that as
a controller and then in this handle an
event before we perform this update here
we want to run that inside of inside of
the the Dom right of it or rather the
Dom right-hander so to do that we can
just run this Dom controller dot right
and then we just specify the code that
we want to run efficiently so I'm just
going to chuck this into here
save that and we jump back into the
browser again and hope that everything
still works I can get rid of that
console.log statement too okay so let's
try to drag it now and why are we
getting that issue back again did I
change that oh now I am just very
confused it looks like a scroll content
has me marching at the top again not
sure why that's come back um still have
the fullscreen attribute there yes I'm
not sure what happened there but yes
tried to turn it off and turn it on
again approach and it works now so
that's good so we have we have this
basic sort of functionality completed
now using the Dom right so that we're
not updating it very inefficiently and
everything seems to be working okay for
now there's still a lot more to test a
lot what it do ideally this I want this
to be a bit more adaptable I got to test
it on actual devices to make sure that
it works I'm not entirely sure that even
using this really is the best approach
either there might be a better way to
grab those x and y values but I just
sort of wanted to get the basic
prototype working and to show you how I
might go about doing that I feel well
most of my videos scripted per se but
usually I dunno what I'm doing
beforehand I would just jump into
creating slÃ¡inte with nothing but a
vague idea in my head which is exactly
what I did in this video so I feel like
in seeing a lot of people I guess people
I meet her credit tutorials and might
come across that when you just know
everything off the top of our heads and
can do absolutely everything without
ever having to Google anything or
research anything but I guess I just
kind of wanted to show you that
sometimes so for me as well it's a bit
of a messy process sometimes I try
different things and hopefully get
something that works eventually and now
that I do have this sort of basic
working prototype I can continue sort of
improving this and
with a better way to do it but I guess
there the concept is there it works in
general
so what I'll probably do is I'll follow
this up with another a written blog post
and I'll perhaps expand on this a little
bit clean it up a bit
and I'll give a more thorough sort of
walkthrough of how to build something
like this in that blog post so likely by
the time this is up that blog post will
already be out so I'll probably link to
that from the description of this video
and you can go check that out so
hopefully this video wasn't too choppy
and changee hopefully it photo right and
you learned something from it Sam
hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you in the next one
