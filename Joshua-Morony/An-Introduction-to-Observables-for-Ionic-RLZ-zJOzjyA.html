about observables observables one of the
sort of tricky things you'll come across
when you're starting to learn angular or
ionic and it's one of those things that
seem tricky at the start but it's really
quite simple at least at a basic level
to use observables observables
themselves are quite complex and you can
do so many things with them but at a
basic level of use that quite easy to
use so observables are the not part of
angular or ionic directly in their their
own separate library they're part of the
rxjs library which is part of this whole
bigger paradigm of programming I guess
called reactive X here it's about
reactive programming and so that's a
topic that I'm not going to cover in
this video and I don't really plan on
covering anytime soon it's not even
saying that I'm across by this one to
get the point across that observables
are kind of part of this whole bigger
idea but we can use observables sort of
independently in our ionic applications
or in angular applications so I think
this little animation that I have up on
the screen now is a really good visual
representation of what an observable is
and so an observable is similar to say
callbacks of promises in that it allows
you to program asynchronously that is to
do something and have your application
continue going on without having to
block and wait for a result so say
something like fetching data from a
server you don't want to block your
application have it wait until you get
that data back you want the application
to continue working doing other things
and then when that data comes back at do
something with it then so it is similar
to promises and especially promises in
that sense one of the big differences
about an observable though is that it
can
omit multiple values over time with the
promise you'll just have that promise
resolved at some point once the data
comes back and that's it
whether observable you can subscribe to
that and you can continue to get data
over time so you can kind of think of it
like a YouTube subscription to a channel
you must subscribe to my channel and
then every time I post the videos you'll
get notified about that you don't just
get notified about my next video so if
we take a look at this little animation
here this black line represents the
observable and this black line down the
bottom also represents an observable and
so what we can do with observables is we
can apply these operations on them ad
that will then return back a new
observable so in this case it's using a
D bounce which is a way to stop a
function from spiring so much so if you
have something like a search field where
it auto looks up suggestions for the
user as they're typing you don't want to
keep the server every time you use a hit
a key you might want to wait a second
before you actually launch that request
so in this example we have time flowing
from left to right and each one of these
little dots is the observable it's
emitting some data so if we just focus
on the top observable here time goes on
we get this purple circle continues with
blue on green one and another green one
so if we were subscribe to this
observable you'll get notified for time
each time that it emits this data our
subscriber could do something with that
but in this case which we don't want all
of these to be emitted we only want to
say receive data every two seconds or so
only the the last thing to execute in
that two seconds so we first run it
through this debounce
operation which returns us a new
observable that only emits the purple
and that last green one there so this
all might seem a little bit abstract at
the moment so I'm going to jump into
some examples and we'll take a look so
the first time you'll probably run into
an observable if you're using ionic is a
the HTTP service so that's supplied by
angular so if we import HTTP we can make
a HTTP request so we're just have to
inject that here and then we might do
things like this HTTP add dot get make a
get request and we'll send that to some
URL I'm not actually going to do that
here and then so this creates the
observable as so in order to get the
result from that we would then subscribe
to the observable and then when that
observable emits some data we could pass
it in through this handler here and we
could do something with it but as you
saw in that observable animation I just
showed you we can also kind of modify
that observable and so where you might
also see with HTTP requests as we often
have this map operation in here and so
what this does is that in itself will
return its own new observable which were
then subscribing to so this creates an
observable disk reads a new observable
from that and then we subscribe to that
and so what the map operator allows us
to do is to modify the data coming in in
some way so typically what we do since
we're usually getting a JSON response
from the server will take that response
and we'll just map it to the same thing
with calling the jason method in that
response which will convert it into a
JavaScript object that we can use more
easily but you could have any number of
operations in here you could map it and
then you could use that debounce
in here as well you could string
different operators there's one called
distinct don't kill change that you can
use so as value doesn't change the
operation won't execute there is tons
and tons available which is why I said
that observables are quite complex and
you can do a lot with them but at a
basic level they are quite easy to use
for most things you'll do it'll be some
simple formats like this where you're
just subscribing to the observable or
maybe map so
response so as well as using observable
with that angular provides like this
HTTP service we can also create our own
observables so as you can see up here
I've imported observable from Eric's
chairs library and what I can do to
create my own observable I could do I
just create a variable here called my
observable and then it will use the
observable dot create method and what
this does is it will allow us to create
and observe them will cast them into
this handler here and so we can use this
observer to trigger emitting data and
performing whatever things we need to do
would be observable and there's also
other methods besides emitting data like
indicating that the observable is
complete or that there was an error but
we're just going to focus on emitting
some simple data here so what I could do
is then say observer dot next and we'll
just omit some data we'll say hello and
now what I can do is I can subscribe to
that observable so if I were to do my
observable stop subscribe and we'll pass
in that data and I'll just log in out so
if we take a look at what's happening
through the browser now and so actually
got an error here cuz I'm importing HTTP
from the wrong place that should be from
the HTTP library I can pull that from
angular HTTP so if I read save that now
I say that one complain we can actually
need this anymore fat but it's checking
my work okay
layer is gone now and we can see if you
look in the console here it says hello
which is the data that are observables
admitting emitting and then we're
subscribing to ik here involving that
data out and so as I mentioned you can
emit multiple values over time with an
observer so if I were to create an
interval which will allow me to run some
function every however long I want I'll
just trigger that observer net next
method again I will just say hello again
and we'll run that every say one second
so the save us again now you can see we
have the the hello the initial hello
over in the console still but now every
second we're getting hello logged out to
the console again and so they'll just
keep going forever now one important
thing about observables is that they are
lazy and by lazy that means that they
don't execute until they are subscribed
to so if I were to just comment out this
section here you might think that well
we're not going to log out the data but
the stuff in here would still run so if
I were to say console dot log observer
setup you would think that this code
would run to set this all up it is log
out observer setup so we'd never get the
hello being output because we're no
longer subscribing to that I'm going to
worry in out to the console if I save
this and we take a look in the browser
now you'll see that nothing is being
logged out so not even this console log
statement here so observables won't
won't run until they actually subscribe
to so you might run into an issue with
this when say you're posting data with
HTTP sometimes when you're posting data
you're not interested in the response
you just want to send some data to a
server and that's it if you don't
subscribe to that observable then that
post will never even be run so if you
are sending a post request you need to
make sure to still subscribe to the
observable I'm just going to show you
one last thing here and that is subjects
as the subjects are kind of like a and
observable with an observer wrapped into
one so if you take a look at this you
can see we create the observable and
then we get this observer object which
we can use to trigger the next method to
emit the data I guess sometimes this
might be a little bit more complex
complex than what you need so a subject
kind of makes it a little bit easier to
do so what we can do is we can create a
subject in a similar way we can do
a credit variable so we'll create one
called
my subject and we'll make that equal new
subject and then we can subscribe to
that subject just like we do a normal
observable so I'll get my subject stop
subscribe
and again we'll pass in any data that's
being emitted and we'll knock that out
so now all I need to do to trigger that
observable to emit data is I think it's
called the subject I call the next
method on the subject and then just
passing the data that I want and that
should trigger this and or log out the
data and actually want to get out it
start a variable on the string so save
that and we'll take a look at what
happens now and you can see we're still
getting that hello value output to the
console and so we could do that same
thing we did before we set create a set
interval which runs every second to keep
triggering the next method on the
subject and that would keep logging our
data so this this may be more an easier
alternative to use if you're creating an
observable sort of setup and you just
need like a simple implementation like
this it may be easier as in using that
whole observable observer pattern so
this has just been a very high-level
basic introduction to observables as I
mentioned there is way more to
observables as so much you can do with
them and reactive programming in general
is this huge topic but the basics I've
covered here will be enough for you to
build ionic to applications
unless you're getting into some more
advanced stuff you probably won't need
to worry about creating your own
observables or anything like that mostly
you'll just have to use the HTTP service
to launch some requests or maybe you're
using an ionic native plug-in that
returns and observable you can subscribe
to but for the most part it will just be
you have some observable you'll
subscribe to it and you'll do something
with the data as that sending through
okay so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
