to build a production version of a
progressive web application in ionic and
then how to upload that to a server so
this is going to be really quick and
simple I've already covered in a written
blog post the the basics of creating a
progressive web app the difference
between creating a just normal ionic
application and then what exactly do we
need to do to that to make it a
progressive web app so I'll link to the
post for that and you can go give that a
read if you want but to really quickly
recap all you need to do the bare
minimum sort of level is to uncomment
the serviceworker in your index.html
file so you'll find that here this will
be commented out by default but when you
generate an ionic application this will
be there and that will register the
serviceworker which is in this file here
and again this is all there by default
you don't need to do that this cases
your content so that it will be
available offline and all you need to do
here is if you are adding other assets
apart from the build ionic files that
are here by default you also need to
make sure to cat occasionally is here
and then there's just a manifest of JSON
file where you just provide some
information so that in the case of say
if you're using stalls the progressive
web app on their device we have the logo
for the icon here the display format
what the applications name is so this is
just some metadata around the
application and that's basically all you
need to do to turn your normal high onic
application into a progressive web
application and as I mentioned in the
blog post there are a lot more things to
think about with progressive web
applications it's not just as simple as
doing this but at a sort of bare minimum
level this will turn your app into a PWA
you'll be able to access it offline and
if it's supported on the device the user
will be able to install your application
from the
web onto their device without having to
go through an apps or anything like that
now what I'm mostly interested in doing
for this video is now taking this
application and just quickly running
through what the steps are to get this
live on the web
so all you'll need to do is open up your
terminal here
and I'm just going to change into the
directory for this application and the
build process really isn't any different
than how you would normally serve your
application so when you run a onyx serve
I'll create a built version of your
application that gets put into this WW
folder and so you can see in here we
have like MAME jeaious which is the
bundled version of our application all
of our code gets minified and put into
this one file so rather than having a
bunch of different folders with our
pages and so on it's all just
concatenated into this giant file here
and everything is converted back into
es5 JavaScript but basically this is
what what is run through the browser
when you when you're actually serving
your application we don't want to just
create a normal build though we want to
create a production build so we want to
just generate this www folder but we
want to do it with them the production
settings so in order to do that all we
need to do is run the following command
which is NPM run and so running the
ionic build process but we want to
supply that with the prod flag which is
cover short for production so I'll run
that command now and so that's going to
build the application into this WWF
folder here you can see things flying in
and flying out right now okay so you can
see that it's finished generating now
we've got all the files we need in the
WWF older I'm just going to open this up
in my finder here so this is the
application and what we're interested in
for our PWA is just this WWF RM and so
this everything that is in this folder
here except for the hidden get file
there this is what we want to upload to
our server to make it available and so
you can see here we have an index.html
file and that's you know just like any
normal static website we'd put on the
web
we have an index.html file and that can
then load in whatever JavaScript we're
using and in the case of a single page
application which is what we get with
ionic that's going to handle a setting
up our entire application so this file
when you go to the URL on the web that's
going to be loading in our main J's file
a CSS and everything else we need so all
we need to do is upload what is in this
folder so I've got a slider duck here so
just like an FTP SFTP client for
interacting with a server and so what
I'm going to do is I've got it open to a
folder on my server on Josh Maroney comm
and I've created a specific folder for
this called bare-minimum PWA and so I'm
just going to upload the contents of my
WW folder into this folder on my server
and then I'll be able to access it so
obviously you'll need some kind of
server on the internet somewhere whether
that's with the shared host if you've
got your own virtual private server or
something like that
you just need someone to host the files
basically on on a server where you can
then access it through the web buyer a
URL so I'm going to upload these files
now and it's important that you upload
the gist the files and the folders not
the entire WWE folder
I'm just going to drag those over here
they'll start uploading ok so they
finished uploading now so now that
entire folder is up on my server so will
be available and through my Marini calm
web site and so to check that that
actually it will work so let's actually
go visit that URL ok so I've got a web
browser open now so now all I need to do
is go to josh Murney comm forward slash
bare minimum PWM and that's the folder I
created on my server so go to that and
you can see we have our onok application
displaying on the screen now and so this
is just a it's just using a default
starter template so it doesn't look
particularly and a fantastic or anything
but if we were to access this through a
mobile device we're going to get this so
we're going to get this application that
looks you know like a sort of normal
mobile application as you'd expect but
it's running through the web and the
cool thing about
progressive web application is if so if
I just go away from that for now if I
now switch off my internet connectivity
and I attempt to go to that address
again it will still work because I
visited at once and it's cached those
files and so I'm going to be able to
access them when I'm offline so I'm just
going to switch off my wife line now and
then we'll try again okay so my Wi-Fi is
off so let's try go to that same URL
again okay so I'm just loading up Google
Chrome now just to check that the
Internet doesn't work okay so we can see
we've tries to access Google calm says
there's no internet connection so now we
are going to try and access our
progressive web application okay so
let's load that up now and as you can
see we can still visit Miss this
application we're going directly to the
RL we're going to the web site but we
are offline completely right now except
we can still we can still see everything
and interact with the application and
that's that's one of the key elements of
a progressive web application that it is
available offline ok so I just wanted to
really quickly show you how you go about
actually taking your application turning
it into a progressive web app and then
getting that onto the web so people can
actually use it so I hope this was
somewhat helpful and I'll see you in the
next video
