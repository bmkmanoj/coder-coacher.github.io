how to conditionally apply classes
styles and attributes to elements in
your ionic 2 applications in a recent
video I did I which I'll link to from
this one I talked a little bit about
property binding event binding and
interpolation and in this video we're
going to use the concept of property
binding again to apply these conditional
styles and attributes to elements so the
use case here is if a lot of time when
you're creating applications you'll just
manually add some class to it or some
attribute that you want apply to that
element but sometimes in the application
you're going to want that to change or
depend on some other variable so what
I'm going to show you in this tutorial
is how to do that how we can tie some
dynamic data to that class or attribute
so I've already got an application set
up here this is just a blank application
and we're going to do something really
simple what it's going to work with a
button to apply different things to it
now you may have seen recently I put out
a blog post on CSS utility attributes in
ionic 2 so this would be helpful when
working with this kind of stuff these
attributes are things that onok provide
that can help style elements and it is
through attributes you can add on to
elements like the button here by adding
the I on button attribute it will apply
the ionic styling for buttons same with
the icon only if we're only using an
icon on the button this will style that
appropriately for that since the button
element has so many attributes we can
use I'm going to use that as an example
so if I come down to the bottom section
here I can see a whole bunch of
different things that I can use so we're
gonna try apply some of these attributes
dynamically in the application so we'll
jump over into the code now okay this is
the the code for the application I've
already generated and what I'm going to
do is come into here
and I'm just going to create the bun so
we'll give it the ionic styling and
let's also go with the outline attribute
so if I just finish off this button here
and we take a look at what happens you
can see that the button just has an
outline rather than being a solid button
so if I get rid of that outline and take
a look again we see that it's a full
solid button so the scenario we're going
to go through here is if we want to for
some reason conditionally apply that
outline attribute maybe in your
application you will display an outline
if the user hasn't clicked that button
yet but if they have clicked it you want
to display a full solid button so to do
that what we could do is set up some
variable in here now it doesn't matter
where this is it just needs to be some
value we can access somewhere so it
could be living in some object that
we're looping through in the template
whatever wherever the variable is as
long as we can access it in our template
we can use that to conditionally apply
that attribute so I'm just going to
create a member variable here called is
outline that's gonna be a boolean and
I'm going to set it to true so if I come
in here now and instead of just saying
outline if I use the property binding
syntax by using the square brackets
around outline and then set that to be
whatever our variable is here so I
search it is outline and save it and
since it's true we should just see the
outline and we do if I was to come in
here and change this to false
now the outline attribute is no longer
applied another example you might use is
disabled so if you want to disable the
button from being interacted with we can
add the disabled attribute but then to
conditionally control that we do the
same thing use the square brackets
around disabled and set that to some
value so we'll just use the is outline
again just so we don't have to recreate
another variable and of course we will
need to set that back to true to see
what it does and you can see now that we
have the outline styling back and it's
also great out it might be easier to see
actually if I get rid of this outline
attribute okay so you can see now it's
grayed out and disabled and we can't
interact with that anymore
so conditionally applying attributes is
one thing we can do but we can also
conditionally apply styles as well so
let's say if I wanted to change the
background color for this conditioning I
could say again in the square brackets
so we can bind to that property I could
do a style dot background color and note
here that usually I can CSS we do a
background color with a hyphen there but
when we're using these properties that
we use the camel case so no hyphens and
the first word is lowercase and the
second is capitalized so we can do style
background color equals and we'll call
this just create some variable called my
color so now if we come into here again
and define that will set my color as a
string which is we're just set it to
black and save that now if we come and
have a look in here we should see that
it's black I had a feeling that wasn't
going to work
the go mixing out my American and
English yet American English over there
so let's change that well how do you in
there save it again and let's see if it
works now okay now we can see it's black
and it's also slightly grayed out
actually because we still have the
disabled styling on so I might just
switch that off if I switch is outlined
to false which are using for the
disabled value and take another look and
we should have a darker black and we can
now interact with a button again if we
wanted to so you can use that syntax to
bind to any CSS property just as long as
you use this syntax rather than the
usual hyphens that CSS properties
usually use so as well as the Styles we
can also bind to I'm gonna get rid of
these for now we can also bind to a
class so if I wanted to conditionally
apply some class we can again use the
same syntax with the square brackets but
instead do class dot some some class and
then we'll set that to variable we have
defined somewhere and we'll just call
this a plac class now if I jump back
into here and create that
this class the apply the some class
class should be applied when the apply
class value is set to true so now if I
jump back in here and we'll just inspect
this and you can see here that some
class has been added to the button so we
could then come in here and define that
class and make it to whatever we want
and then we can conditionally control
whether or not that class is applied to
this button element now the final thing
I want to cover is how we can
conditionally apply multiple classes so
this works well if we just want to have
one class but if we want to apply
multiple classes conditionally we can
use ng class and what this does is allow
us to provide an object that defines
which classes we want to apply to this
button so again we use the square
brackets and we set the ng class equal
to we'll just create an object called
classes so if we jump in here now and we
create another variable we're gonna
create an object and that object is
going to define what classes we want to
include and what ones we don't want to
include so I'll just create some classes
here called risk 1 class 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so if
your class 1 I will set that property to
true set plus 2 to false and we set
class 3 to true
so if I save that it's make sure that's
so good this time I would jump back into
the browser and once that's finished
loading we're going to inspect that
button again and what we hope to see
this time is that the two of those
classes were applied and one of them
isn't so if we take a look we can see we
have class 1 and class 3 being applied
to this button now and if I look in this
object that's exactly what we wanted so
then we could change that make those two
false and will activate class 2 and take
another look and hopefully that change
applies as well just inspect this again
and yes and see we just have class two
now and the other two classes are gone
so this isn't a very practical example
but hopefully it shows you how you can
apply these sorts of things
conditionally and in a realistic
scenario this can come in really handy
maybe you want to highlight particular
things based on some user action or a
really good example is disabling the
button when they click on it I could set
up a click handle on this button here
and then I'll have a function the
handles whatever happens on that button
click and at that time I'll set the
disabled attribute to be true and so
that way once they click on it they're
not going to be able to click on it
again if that's what you need to happen
in your application so for submitting a
form payment information something like
that so this stuff can come in really
handy and the syntax to to make use of
it is pretty simple okay so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
