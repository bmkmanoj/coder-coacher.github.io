use the grid system in ironing - so the
grid is a component that ionic provides
that allows you to create complex
layouts in your applications so when
we're using just basic lists and other
basic components a little the time you
just want that component to take up hope
you will just have a scrolling list or
something like that but sometimes you
want to create more complex layouts
maybe for say some kind of time
replication you might have laps that
that the person has run the time maybe
splits for each lap that they have
completed you will show the time below
that so we can create these really
complex layouts and we need a way to do
that if you've worked with CSS
frameworks before things like Twitter
bootstrap or foundation framework this
concept will be very similar to you it
just uses basic rows and columns to
create these layouts and it uses flexbox
and in CSS to achieve this you don't
really need to know the intimate details
of how flexbox works you can just get by
with just using this grid in its basic
form but if you do have more advanced
knowledge of how flexbox works you'll be
able to fine tune the details of your
layout more easily so to start off with
I'm just going to show you what it looks
like a really basic version and so the
concept is basically that you have this
ion grid component and that's just going
to contain everything for us and then
inside of the grid you have rows and
columns so we'll have rows on the
outside and then inside of these rows we
will have the columns
and so I can put multiple columns inside
of a row I can have multiple rows I
could then even put another row inside
of a column and then put a column inside
of that and then another row you can get
really specific and create really
intricate layouts but most of the time
it's probably going to be pretty basic
so just as an example if I drop a image
in here I'll just use a placeholder
image and I'll just drop another column
in here as well and so now we'll have a
single row we have two images side by
side so we have two columns so if we
jump into the browser to take a look at
that I'm already serving the application
here you can see we have the two boxes
sitting side by side so there are much
more advanced ways that we can control
the layout how wide the columns are and
so on I'll get back to that in a minute
first want to do a bit of an exercise of
just thinking in rows and columns I
guess showing you how you might break
down a typical layout so I've got a
screenshot of my Twitter profile from
the Twitter mobile application here and
what I'm gonna do is just run through
how I might break this down into a grid
layout into rows and columns so I'm
gonna get to the rows in red color here
and so first I'll just break everything
into the rows and then I'll break them
down into the columns so we might have a
row at the top here to contain that
header image and we could have another
row here to contain all of this
information another row
this is a probably good example here so
I could do a right here and have
everything start with CSS in here so
obviously the my name here my twitter
handle sits above the rest of the
content so I could just work with this
single row and you CSS in different ways
to position this our want it or I could
split this up into two separate rows so
there is no specific rules for exactly
how you're going to have to break up
your content into rows and columns it
could be really simple it really complex
but once you get a sense of it and how
everything works you should be able to
decide what's going to work this for you
and so you might have another row here
and here and again this could all just
be one row as well we could just
position this with CSS or we can split
it up into two rows now we'll have
another row for the segment the tweets
media and light segment here and this is
just compiled and it provides a
component a segment component to do this
so you can just have the single row and
then just drop that component in there
and then we'll have another road for the
tweet here so now I'm going to go
through and split those rows up into
columns so how to switch colors here
we'll use a a blue instead and so if I
start up here I might break these up
into I might create a column there one
here and for each of these buttons in a
bit far
so each button can add its own column
and again maybe we don't want to do that
instead perhaps you want this whole
section here it could just be one column
and then you just place these buttons
side by side with CSS again it's up to
you how you want to do it this is all
just one column here so we still have a
column that's just gonna be a single
column that makes up the entire width of
the screen here now we could split this
row up into two columns here and this
one as well
and this one again it's just a single
column for the whole row and then for
the tweet this could be a column here
and we split that up into the left and
right here and we could get more
complicated here and I'm going to do it
just to show you an example of what you
can do most likely I would just style
all this with CSS and not worry about
complicating the rows and columns more
than I have already done but if you
wanted to you could split this up even
further so I could create another row
inside of this column that's going to
split up the top and the bottom here and
then inside of that again I could create
another column inside of that row now
this is definitely saying I wouldn't do
but let's pretend that we had some
content here that we wanted to sit
side-by-side I could split that up into
another two columns here and then again
if I would get even more complicated I
could then split that column up into
another two rows and to get really
ridiculous I could then split that row
up into another two columns so you can
see how you can really drill down a lot
of missing here to create some really
really complex layouts but a lot of the
time it's going to be simple and a lot
of the time it probably should be as
simple as possible this this layout
would be a bit of a mess in in the HTML
so generally you try to keep it as
simple as possible
use just basic CSS positioning to
control the layout where you can if you
need to create a really complex layout
like this you can do it with the grid if
that process didn't make a whole lot of
sense to you don't worry too much just
play around with columns and rows a bit
and you'll eventually just get how they
work it can be a little bit confusing at
first I think okay now that we've
covered the basics of how it works I
want to show you how you can control the
columns and rows in a bit more depth so
right now I just have and two columns
set up with no width specified so
they're just going to take up an equal
amount of space but if I wanted to get
more specific here and let's say I only
want this column to take up 25% of the
width and I want this one to take up the
remaining 75 I can just specify 25 and
75 if I save that and take a look at
what happens you can see that this image
now has been sort of shoved over into
this smaller portion and the other image
has the rest of the row and it might be
easier to see what's happening if I
inspect this now so you can see if I
hover over this first column it's only
taken up a really small portion of the
screen but the second column takes up a
large portion so it's 25% there 75% so
then I could also throw in another row
here and maybe on this one we want we
say 80% for the first one and 20 for the
second so save that and take a look and
now you can see that that's taking 80%
of the screen and that's taking up 20
they can't use whatever percentages you
want in generally to supply width - and
then the percentage that you want but
there are specific widths that you can
use and so if you come into the
documentation and check out the grid
section
you'll find a list of all the widths
that you can use and so any of these
basically so if you wanted to use 85 you
can't do that by default with the grid
system here as well as supplying a width
you can also supply an offset so by
default here this column that's taking
up 75% of the width is sitting right
next to the one that takes up 25% so
let's say if I wanted to change this to
so they're they're both 25 we'll see
what that looks like it looks like so
again that they're sitting side-by-side
here if I inspect that we can see the
same width now they sit side-by-side so
let's say I don't want that I actually
want this I want this second column to
sit on the other side of the screen and
so what I could do is supply an offset
value so if I say offset 50 that's going
to push that across 50 percent of the
screen so now it sits on the other side
and so you can apply that to any column
and basically it's just going to just
push it across to the right whatever
values you specify so if I come in here
now and just inspect these again you can
see that first one I'm still taking up
25% and so is this one
but we'll also have that big margin on
there now to push that column across so
let's take a look at another example
we're gonna see what happens I'm just
gonna get rid of this second row and
we're gonna get rid of the offset as
well so if I put in four of these
columns then that's going to equal 100%
so it's going to take out the entire
width of the page here but if I was to
add another one then of course that's
going to be too big it's gonna occupy
more than the width that we currently
have so we'll see what happens when we
do that
so we still only see before because the
fifth one is off the page now and so I'm
gonna do a bunch of these actually so
I'm gonna show you something that you
can do which is a pretty common use case
so I have a bunch of these these
pictures now but I can only see four of
them the rest have gone off screen
ideally what I want to happen is for
these to keep flowing downwards as it
gets to the end of the screen I want it
to drop to the next line and display in
this big grid a gallery like format and
to do that
it's quite simple we need to do is come
on to this iron row here and supply the
wrap attribute so right it's right eye
on row wrap save that and take a look
you can see that those columns are now
wrapping down on to the next row even
though we have this single row is now
expanded to fit these all under the page
so I can just keep pacing as many of
these as I like and it's just going to
keep flowing down the page now another
really interesting thing you can do with
the grid system is supply the responsive
attribute which is actually a good way
to create different layouts for us a
phone versus a tablet versus a big
desktop screen or something like that so
what you can do is come over to this
iron row again and supply responsive and
then we can supply one of three values
here we can do LG for large MD for
medium or SM for small so if I set this
to responsive large and save that it's
going to set that responsive breakpoint
at a large setting so this iPhone 5 now
falls within or below that range and so
the the columns break the rows break
into different rows here rather than
filling up the entire width of the
screen so if I was to get rid of this
emulator and we'll try and make it big
enough there we go so around I'm not
sure the exact point is actually so
that's
as it's at 10:24 it's a 1,024 pixels
those columns will start flowing
underneath each other instead of flowing
across the screen and so then I could
also change that to say small and that's
going to decrease where that breakpoint
is so now if I try a shrinking the
screen I'm going to be able to do a lot
further until we hit that breakpoint and
so that's around what's that one
that's 567 is the point where that
breakpoint is hit and then the columns
will start flowing beneath each other
the the Flex Direction gets changed so
this is another cool thing that you can
do with the grid to perhaps create some
different layouts based on whether the
user is on a phone or a tablet okay so I
hope this is a decent introduction into
how to use the grid rows and columns in
ionic 2 it can be hard to wrap your head
around and probably requires a bit of
playing around and getting used to and
especially if you start looking into how
flexbox works and things like that
hopefully this did a good enough job at
explaining the basics so you can start
using them in your own applications ok
so I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
