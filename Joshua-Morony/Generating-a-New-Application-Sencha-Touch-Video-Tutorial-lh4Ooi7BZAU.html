Sencha touch video tutorial i thought
itself was like really simple to begin
with and just create a new Sencha touch
up a lot of you probably already know
how to do this but I thought I'd start
with the basics I'm going to assume that
you already have Sencha touch installed
and ready to go if not you can just look
out a simple tutorial but to start off
with the command prompt and create our
first application so to run the center
touch command you're going to have to
change your directory into your Sencha
touch installation first so to do that
I'm going to change my directory if
you're not familiar with the command
prompt you can you see these just change
it to different directory and so now I
want to go to C Drive and so now to
generate the app all I have to do is run
this command generate and then we want
to put what we want to call that
application so and then following that
we want to put the directory where we
want that to actually be created so
usually I would just do this which means
we want to in store one folder from area
now so in htdocs' folder and again I'm
just going to put it inside the follicle
example app so now I want to hit enter
for that should start running through
the process for generating the
application
it takes a little while but not too long
I just work here well finishes
okay so that's finished generating yeah
so now we'll be able to see it inside of
the htdocs folder but a lot of this need
to worry about too much now I'm gonna
jump into the browser now so to get
installed so now that will load up the
application automatically generated I'll
include a link to that in the
description of this video and your
chrome installation so you can see right
now we've got a pretty basic looking
application here just welcome to Sencha
touch 2 we can switch between the two
tabs they've got here they video I think
probably watching
so now we can take a look at that
okay so I'm using a sublime text to
really good text editor really cheap to
thing is about seventy dollars so highly
recommend you get back if you don't
already have a favorite but of course
you can this use anything notepad
notepad plus plus applications in it's
probably also worth mentioning you can
download something called censure
architect which cuz I think $399 I could
be wrong that basically it's an IDE for
a century touch which can help you
design the main the main view and so
what that does is we can see main
project so that's one item we've got you
notice we you can see here we're
extending the tab this is a tab now lots
of different create and so we have the
two tabs new one called welcome and the
other one called get started and so we
can change these
and change that so if I say that and go
back and reload this application and you
can see the changes have been made there
so there's a few more interesting things
to talk about here and I'll probably
leave that mainly for another video to
go through it in depth but a lot of
these files in here you don't really
need to worry about it see how many
different files and folders are sitting
in it but really the main ones you'll be
editing this is file index type HTML
file is an important one but one you
won't be editing very much at all and
the rest will sort of begin this app
folder so your controllers models fuse
stores these are the things you're gonna
be creating and editing the most so like
I said I'll save that for another video
tutorial hopefully this can help you get
your first application set up if you
weren't having trouble with that and I
will see you next time
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
