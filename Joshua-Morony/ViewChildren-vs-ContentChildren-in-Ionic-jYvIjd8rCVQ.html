some ways that you can grab elements in
your ionic to applications using
something called new child but also how
to use new children and content children
so at a basic level of the concept is
pretty simple the idea of new child and
content child is to grab some element
similar to the way you would with say
document dot get element by ID in
JavaScript but this is the more angular
way to do it and there are advantages to
doing it this way
so I vary a article recently that talked
about this concept and why you might
want to use something like to be your
child and I also covered more the
differences between a view child and a
content child and when you should use
and when you should use each of those I
think it's a bit of a fuzzy concept I
think it's a bit hard to get across and
I'm not sure if I did it perfectly in
that article so I thought it might have
been a good thing to do a video on our I
can talk about it a little bit so in
this video I'm just going to quickly
show you how to grab cyant using view
child and then I'm going to get into
discussing the difference between new
children and content children are
because they sound very similar they do
similar things there is a very specific
distinction between what one is when
compared to the other so I already have
an application up here I've generated
one already and what we're going to do
is just grab site with view child on our
home page here I'm just going to open up
the code for this and of course we have
our home page which is generated by
default and if I go into the template
for that we can see which serve a few
things in here and I which is going to
be enough to grab something using view
child so let's say I want to get a
reference to this ion content here
there's two ways I could do that I could
add add a local template variable here
and use that to grab it which is very
similar to say adding an ID to an
element and using getting element
my ID so I could cool this or anything I
want we'll just call it my content and
then if I always come into here I can
now grab that with for your child so
view child is part of the angular
libraries I have to import that and then
you can just set it up above your
constructor here as a member variable so
all I need to do is write view child and
then supply the the name of that
template variable I created which was my
content and then we just give this a
name so we'll call it content area and
then I'll be able to access this
throughout the class as this stock
content area and so I would log that out
and we'll just take a look at it so
let's jump into the browser here and
we'll see what we get logged out and you
can see we now have a reference to that
content area and now another way that we
can grab a reference to that is by
supplying a view child with the class
that we're trying to grab so the content
area that's an ionic component and it's
created with the content class so if I
was to jump into the the ionic code
itself
I'll let me bring that up okay so I've
got the ionic code base here if we go
into source and then components we'll be
able to find the content component and
we soak up the time script file and
you'll see we just scroll down okay so
you'll see that we have the component
defined here we have a class of content
and then the selectors iron content so
that's a tag we're using to use that if
this class here so if we want to grab
any instances of those or in this case
just one because we're using view child
does not view children I can supply
content to this so if I import that
class from
the ioniq library and then I supply that
here that's also going to return that
content area forming so we'll save that
and check that it works okay and so we
still have that content area popping up
and now you can also do something and
like the children to get to grab
multiple instances of something and say
if we common so the situation is going
to be to have a list so it was create a
little funny list here and then we might
have a bunch of Aion items so just
duplicate that a few times so go for
iron items there and we might want to
grab all of those and do something with
them in here so to do that I can do
something called view children and
basically just do the exact same thing
and so those are the class for the iron
items is just item as we use that and
make sure we import it from the ionic
library as well and we'll just call this
items and we'll log it out here
so now you can see we have this query
list that it returns which is which
contains most of the multiple items that
we're trying to select so if we're
looking the results array here you'll
see we have our four items and so this
query list is useful because it has
things like this changes property here
which is an observable that we can
listen to to see if you know are we
getting more items being added to the
page there's a musical stuff you can do
there and you can even do something a
little bit cool where let's say if I
just wanted to grab the add the element
rest for these particular items I want
to get a reference to the native element
itself I can even say add some an extra
property here and say I want to read the
element rep and we just have to make
sure to import that from the angular
library as well so if I save that now
and try again okay so now for your home
is a query list now we just have the
element ref instead of the entire
instead of all the information that was
being returned before so if we wanted to
now I could go and grab the native
elements of those which I couldn't do
before anyway this is just a bit of a
neater way to do it so I don't really
want to get too far into that sort of
stuff I just want to illustrate there
are some it's more powerful things you
can do with mu child of view children
and I guess it'll straight that type of
functionality you might be missing out
on if you were to just say do something
like get element by ID so now I want to
jump into it's the main thing that I
wanted to do in this video and I'm just
going to just change it back for now and
that's compare this two content child
and content children so let's say I want
to grab those same things and let's try
to do it with content child and content
children instead that will change
progress of these and we'll see what
happens
okay so that's returning undefined now
and in our query list here we have zero
results so even though we do have some
items in here they're not showing up we
have content children and so the
difference between view child and a
content child is that and I think the
easiest way I can to talk about it is
that a view child is used to grab
anything that you manually add to the
template yourself so all of this I can
grab a few child cuz I put it there so I
can grab it with you child content
children is used for content projection
so say when you create your own custom
component and you're using content
projection with ng content any Content
that gets added through that to the
component could be grabbed with content
children and I'm going to show you an
example of this to illustrate that
because I think just saying it probably
isn't that clear so what I'm going to do
is create a new custom component now so
I'll just run ionic G component and
we'll call it call it content child test
okay so we have our component that's
popping in here now we'll just add that
to the app module it's going to rename
this to content child test instead of
content child test component and we'll
jump in here and we'll import that
and then we just need to edit through
the declarations array
okay so we should be able to use that
component in the application now so
let's look at this component right now
there is not content projection set up
it just outputs the value of whatever
text is so we're going to change this
and replace it with ng content and I'm
not going going to talk too much about
what content projection is how it works
because I have another video that
discusses that in more details I'll link
to that in not familiar with what this
is already
I recommend going to take a look at that
and if you're not interested in doing
custom components just yet then you
probably don't need to worry about
content children anyway so view child
will probably work in most circumstances
for you okay so now with that set up
anything whenever so when we use this
component and I'm just going to actually
get rid of that so we don't need it
anymore so when we use this component as
a selector of content child test
anything we add inside of those tags
that we add is going to be projected
into the component using contact
projection so it will appear where these
ng content tags are so what I can do now
is go into a safe here and we'll add
another element here we're going to use
this component so it's called content
child test so I can do content child
test
and I'm just going to get rid of these
for now so we don't need those and then
we can add whatever we want inside of
here actually might bring that list back
in shove that in that'll be a good
example okay so now I have my eye on
what's inside of the content child test
so this is going to be projected into
this content child test component so I
just save this for now and we'll jump
into the browser again and see what
we're working with I need to reserve
that okay so we still have our list
there because it's being added through
the content projection if I was to
remove this content for injection and
take a look again that list should
disappear as yes and that's gone so
we'll put that back and now let's say
we're in first of all lips where you can
see already actually this query list I
should know that's using content
children right now let me just change
this back to view child and view
children
so I was just talking about how content
children is used to grab things that are
using content projection but we have
this view child here now and that list
is inside of this some content child
test component so we're using that for
content projection now but in home dr.
sweets to use and view child and we can
still grab the items and we can still
grab the content now of course we can
grab the content because that's outside
of it anyway but I guess the items are
interesting because it's inside of that
as we can use of content projection but
we can still grab it with view child and
that's because as I said before this is
something that we're adding directly to
the component itself even though it's
inside of this thing that we're using
content projection with I've still added
these directly to this component so when
I'm in the home component when I'm
trying to grab it from the home
component I just use new child confuse
your child the difference is if I were
to try and grab it from within the
context of the component itself all
that's been added directly to this
template then your content so that I own
list is getting added here through
content projection but if I were to try
and grab it with view child that it
would work so we'll try to do that I
will use your children and also going to
have to import item from ionics angular
so that we can use that to grab it okay
so let's add that here so we'll do view
view children use item and we'll set
that up as items and now these will be
available after the after view mix last
cyclicals runs so it flies to logout
this store items now it'll take a look
what happens and I'm actually also going
to get rid of these so that we don't get
confused will the console Salem
okay so we still get a query list but
it's empty there's no results there in
the array so it's not grabbing any items
and that makes sense because if we look
at what we're grabbing using view
children to grab something from the
template that there's nothing here but
what is happening is that this content
and we're adding here in a different
component will be projected here so that
means that we can use content children
to graph that so all I have to do is
import content children and change that
to content children and we try the same
thing again and hopefully we can see
those items that are being projected
okay so if we look at this now we're
still getting a zero results then it's
not going to let us grab those iron
items because they're inside of the ion
list there if we could go to the harm
list or we could just grab the reference
to the list instead let me just check
the class name for that is actually list
it looks like it
yeah so we should be able to just import
list here and we'll grab that instead
and we'll just log out this dot list and
we'll see if that works we use content
children there so we have one result
being returned there which would be the
single list that we have and just to
double check to illustrate a point again
that that is a Content child and not a
view child we use view children instead
to try and grab it and we'll see if that
works and it doesn't we don't get any
results coming in now
so that's the the basic difference
between what a view child is and what a
Content child is there's a lot more you
can do with these as i've mentioned
briefly before with their read property
there's other properties you can use as
well to do more complicated operations
but I mostly wanted to highlight the
difference between what a view child and
a content child was because it's a
concept that I struggled with for a long
time and I guess the bottom line is a
few child is learning you can grab that
you have added to a template directly
and a Content child is used to grab
something that is projected into a
component okay so I hope you enjoyed
this video
actually it clarifies that concept a
little bit for you and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
