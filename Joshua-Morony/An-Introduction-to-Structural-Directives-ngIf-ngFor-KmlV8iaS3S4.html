how structural directives work in ionic
2 so this is an angular concept it's
nothing specific to are linked to we're
just going to be using an ionic
application as an example here so a
structural directive is a way to modify
the Dom that's the the document object
model there the structure of your web
page they allow us to modify that by
removing or adding certain Dom elements
and so all structural directives they
have this weird star syntax in front of
them I'm going to talk a little bit
about that as well
but you'll see different kinds of
structural directors we have the ng-if
that we're using as a first example here
in g4 and we have this ng switch case as
well
always perform slightly different things
but the end result is that way either
removing or adding some content to the
Dom as a result of that directive and so
the first example we're going to look at
is ng F and that handles either
displaying a certain element or not
displaying that element but the
important difference is that with ng if
if that condition that we're looking for
is not met then the rather than the
element itself is actually removed from
the document it's not just hidden so the
difference here is that we could just
say hide it with CSS or something like
that and still have it be there we just
can't see it but the difference is that
by removing completely there's some
performance benefits because angular no
longer has to perform change detection
on that it's not consuming more
resources because it's just completely
gone it may not always be the best thing
to do depending on what the goals of
your application are but in general it's
going to be a better idea to remove an
element completely with ng if rather
than just
hiding it if a certain condition if a
certain condition is met okay so the
first example here we're using the ng-if
and we're linking it to this brag
variable that i've got defined in home
dog TS here so right now I've just got
that's a boolean and I've got that set
to false and so the idea is that with ng
if we're saying if this condition is met
then show this whatever is inside of the
container there and so in this case it's
set to false so it's not going to
display anything but I want to talk a
little bit about specifically this star
syntax now why we use that and the short
of it is that it's just to make writing
these structural directives eat easier
so the code I have underneath this this
is exactly the same thing as this this
will display that h2 tag the div if the
brag variable is set to true just in the
same way as this will so these two are
exactly the same except this one is
using sort of this shortcut syntax of
using the star to create this for us and
so what you can see here is that this
star syntax is creating a template and
this is a html5 tag and in a is in a
normal application what happens with
these template tags is by default they
are hidden when they're added to the Dom
but what angular does it treat sees is a
bit of a special case and where it goes
and it will just remove any templates at
finds and it replaces it with its own
script tag which is then going to use to
perform whatever things it needs to do
so in the case of a ng if it's going to
either hide or just display something in
the case of an energy 4 it's going to
then loop over a bunch of data and start
displaying it so we need to create these
template tags but it's a bit of work to
create a template tag assign this ng-if
directive to it and put everything we
need inside of that template instead we
just use this star ng-if syntax which
we'll just handle creating the template
automatically for us so if we take a
look at what's happening in the browser
now
you see that it's just completely blank
right now because that boolean was set
to false so this condition isn't being
met so it's not being displayed but if I
go in here and I change this now to true
and we take another look you can see
that both of the h2 tags are being
rendered out now so as I mentioned these
two are exactly do exactly the same
thing when that brag variable is set to
true it's going to render out I'm
awesome and that's why we see both of
those being output to the screen right
now okay so now let's move on to the ng4
directive and this is it's a similar
approach where we're creating these
template tags by using this special star
syntax but instead of just hiding or
showing an element based on some
condition this one we are able to loop
over an array of data so in here I've
just got an array defined with three
names in there we have Jennifer well
lead and Michael and what this allows us
to do is loop over those and inject each
of them as their own element into the
bill so this is going to inject h2 for
each of the names we have and then it's
going to use this interpolation here to
add that specific name to to the h2 tag
so if I were to save this now we should
see the three names rendered out here
and so you can see all those there and
then as a final example we have this
ng-switch which just checks a certain
variable and then it tests it for
different values so what I have set up
now is I'm looking at this who is
awesome variable and right now better
sent to Jennifer and so again it's going
to create these template tags for us
automatically we don't have to worry
about that we just have to use this star
syntax and so what's going to happen is
it's going to test for each of these
values so it's saying in the case that
the value equals Jennifer and also make
a note that we've added these quotations
here
this is a string value we're testing for
it's going to test if the value equals
Jennifer and if it does it'll render out
that Jennifer is awesome h2 tag and it's
going to get rid of these other two and
the same for Y later Michael whichever
one matches it will display that one and
hide the rest so if I save that now
because it is set to Jennifer that's
what we should see in the up here and we
do so that was just a really quick
example of how do you structural
directives in in ionic two and in
angular applications mainly wanted to
just go over that concept of templates
and what this star syntax is doing of
course there is some much more
complicated things you can do with
structural directives hopefully that
gives you a basic idea of what's going
on behind the scenes rather than just
wondering why we put this random star in
front of things okay so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
