to create simple animations using CSS
transitions I'm going to be doing this
in the context of an ionic application
and there are different ways that you
can go about animating things but this
is just a kind of really simple way to
add some kind of cool effects to your
application and basically the idea is
that you can change a CSS property from
one thing to another and we can animate
that transition so say in an ionic
application for example you might have
something that has a certain style at
some point then when psy happens in the
application has when you click some
button that style might change so rather
than just instantly applying that style
change where you can set a property so
that it transitions slowly so you could
have something that is say it's going to
go from being it could go from having
full opacity to being invisible so
rather than that just kind of flashing
out of existence we could have it so
that it slowly fades away and there's a
lot of properties that you can do this
with obviously hope acity is one of them
and it's a great here so this is a list
of all of the properties we can use you
can't animate every single property but
there are a lot that we can use and they
can add some really nice little effects
to the application and so what I'm going
to do is just go through a really quick
example of how you can use a transition
to animate one of these properties so
i've already generated an application
and we're going to jump into that now
and so what I'm going to do is just come
into the home page here and I'm going to
create a button and then when we click
on that button we're going to change its
style in some way and we're going to
animate that so I'm going to create that
button in here now we'll just create a
normal button we'll give it a primary
theme and we're just going to click
event binding to that and we're just
going to call a function called change
style
and I will just say click me on that
button and we're also going to set up
some default styles for that button so
we'll do that in here
so as I mentioned before we could
animate the opacity so if I step is to
just opacity one of course nothing
really is going to happen because that
just means that it says fully opaque and
we're going to be able to see that but
let's just take a look at what we have
in the browser now of course we have an
error I've got some syntax error in here
and mr. closing bracket okay so we have
a button here just click me and click it
and it calls a function that doesn't
exist so now we're going to implement
this function and we're going to make
that change this button style so that
we're actually able to grab this button
easily I'm going to add a template
variable to this and risk all in my
button that's going to allow us to grab
a reference to that in here so we can
use view child to do that and I'll just
set up a member variable here for that
by using the new child decorator there
now we just need to supply the name of
the variable we created which was my
button and then we'll just name my
button as well so that's going to allow
us to reference that as this dot button
I just got my button throughout this
class okay so now we're going to define
that function that we added here so
change style and inside of this is where
we're going to modify the style of that
button and to do that we're going to use
something called renderer and that's
going to allow us to modify that style
I've talked a little more in depth about
what the renderer is exactly in other
videos so I'll probably just link to one
of those if you're interested in
learning what that's all about
so now in this change style function we
can use the red arrow by calling this
actually we need to import the renderer
from angular library and then we can
just do this dot renderer dot set
elements
dial and then we just need to supply the
element itself so wait changing my
button so we need to do this but my
button and we need to supply the native
element from that which is the actual
Dom element then we just say the style
that we want to change which is going to
be opacity and we're going to set that
to we set it to zero because we want it
to disappear so hopefully when we click
this now that's going to just make the
bun disappear instantly so if I click on
this now oops I've got some kind of
error okay so let's just check if I'm
not doing anything silly here we'll
check if this stopped my button is
actually being grabbed correctly
are we actually so the buttons getting
grabbed correctly but we actually need
to grab this element reference which
contains the negative element so we can
do that with this little a kind of
additional functionality of this view
child here but what we can do is import
element ref and then we can say we want
to read that property so by doing that
that should instead return us that
element reference correctly hopefully
I've got the syntax for that correct yes
and now you can see we're just getting
the element reference there and then we
have direct access to that native
element and so as I click that you would
have also seen on the actual app here
that the button did disappear and I'll
do that again obviously it's working but
that's not super awesome effect I guess
it just kind of disappears and that's it
so what we can do is set that transition
property I was talking about so if I can
write them to this button here and I
specify the transition property I can
define how I want that transition to
animate so I could animate that over say
2 seconds by writing 2's and then you
can also supply the
type of animation you want to use so I
could use a lynnium which is just kind
of a straightforward animation there's
lots of different types like ease-in
ease-out ease in out that kind of they
kind of do things like it'll be the
animation we faster at the beginning and
then slow down towards the end or will
be slow at the beginning but then speed
up towards the end so let's just see
what that looks like so if I click on
this now that didn't actually look like
it applied I might not have that CSS
applying correctly to that button let me
just check
so I'll just refresh that there and then
we'll take a look at this and see if
we've got our opacity one defined on
here somewhere
hey so we've got the opacity is defined
here we are getting our Styles apply but
it looks like our transition property is
actually being overwritten somewhere
else
so perhaps ionic by default and they do
actually they've got the OT transition
property already set to 100 milliseconds
so they already have that animation fine
for us so if we if we overwrite their
transition with our own of two seconds
that's just going to make that
transition time longer so I'm just going
to add important to this property so
that it will overwrite I on its own
transition property then and we'll give
that a refresh and we'll have a go again
so if I click that now you can see that
it slowly fades out over two seconds
rather than using the default 100
milliseconds that ioniq had defined if I
only didn't have that own styling
already set up then it would have just
instantly gone okay so that's one
transition we can do but we can do more
than just the opacity so let's go back
to that list of animated properties we
have in here and we could do that with
any of these so let's say we want to
animate the padding so let's say we
start off with a padding of 10 pixels on
the button here and I'm just going to I
usually do this to make my CSS rules
more specific because some
you do run into that situation where
ionic styling overrides your own and so
by making us more specific by putting it
them inside of these ios and android
tags it just decreases the likelihood
that ours are going to get overwritten
so we've got ten pixels by default now
so we take a look at this that's what it
looks like with ten pixels of padding
now we've still got that transition of
two seconds set so if we change this
padding that's going to animate that
over two seconds so if I was to come in
here now and instead change the padding
to let's say 50 pixels if I click on
this now you can see that it slowly
grows out to 50 pixels of padding so
let's just take a look at that that
transition property here as I mentioned
you can set this to other things besides
linear so if I click on this you can see
that sort of straight line it's just a
linear animation but we can also use
different types so this one's ease out
and you can kind of see as I switch
between these if you watch the circle at
the top you can see how it affects the
animation so this one in particular I
think is really easy to see what's going
on this next animation it kind of does
this weird quick then it goes back and
then it finishes off so that was called
where the animation listed here is out
back but it's kind of a man you manually
define cubic Bezier animation so you can
even do really complicated looking
animations like this so let's see what
that looks like if we just replace our
own transition with this cubic
transition here we can take a look at
what that would look like so if we click
on this now it does this sort of weird
thing where it grows and then it shrinks
and it goes back again as a bit of a
weird animation I think to do it on
padding's I'm going to go back to
opacity so the vector 1 and we'll make
it a bit quicker to because 2 seconds is
quite long and then I'll just modify
this back to opacity again so if I click
this now as that will animate
on that new transition we have set up
and just for fun let's try one more one
more animation let's go with one that's
going to affect the position so we can
modify it say they put like the right
and there should be a top property in
here somewhere there it is so we can
also affect the position of the element
and we can animate that so if I was to
go into here again and let's change that
to give it a position of we use a
relative position and so we're going to
start this out we say we started out 50
pixels from where it usually would be
and this is relative to its normal
position so this is going to be 50
pixels from the top from its normal
position and then in here if we change
this to zero that's going to bring it
back to its normal position
so give this another go and we'll see
what that looks like so you can see now
that click Me button is it's down a bit
further than it was before and I click
this now this kind of pops back in to
where it should have been and you can
see that sort of that cubic Bezier
animation taking effect there it kind of
goes up and then it Springs down a
little bit and then it settles and I
think that the effects a bit more easily
seen with this sort of position
animation rather than opacity or the
weird having animation we did so you can
animate any of these with that same sort
of CSS transition property and it's just
it's an easy way to make it feel a
little bit more interactive and polished
without having to get into doing really
complex animation
okay so I hope you enjoyed this video
and I'll see you in the next one
