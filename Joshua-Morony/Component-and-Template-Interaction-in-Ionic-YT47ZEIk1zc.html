binding event binding and interpolation
and these are basically more complicated
ways of saying that we're going to
discuss how the template in our
components talks to the typescript file
of the class so I'm going to try and
touch on the really basic concepts that
we have to work with and we're also
going to work through a bit of an
example as well so to start off with
I've already generated a blank
application here which just has a simple
Avatar list that we're using I just
copied out the example from the
documentation as we're gonna use this to
take a look at some of the concepts so
let's jump into the code to see what
we're working with so I open up sublime
here and I've already got released open
so we just have the blank ionic 2
application generated we have the home
page which again is automatically
generated so this is what's responsible
for rendering out what we're seeing in
the browser right now this blank
application with a list and just one
single list item this is just one
particular page in our application and
we can have multiple different pages we
have the home page here we could have
some of the shop page and about page and
each page that we have is a component
and so components in ionic 2 which is
the same as in angular 2 are all they
all look like this they all have this
typescript file with a component
decorator which defines the selector the
template and they have the template
itself and also a style a styling file
which is a sass file that we have here
I'm not gonna talk about the styling
component in this video I actually did a
video recently where I talked through
some methods for styling your
application so I'll link to that from
this video but we're just going to focus
on the transcript file the class
definition here and the template file
the HTML file and so right now this HTML
file isn't really making use of this
this sets up the component for us so we
can actually use it in our application
but the template here is Jeff
doing its own thing it's just displaying
some basic data using some basic ionic 2
components so to make this a little bit
more interesting what we're going to do
is make this list dynamic we're going to
define some data in our typescript file
that this is then going to use and loop
over so we can display multiple
different items so let's create that in
here now we're going to create a an
array called think of an example let's
go with employees so for a create an
employee's a member variable here and so
this is this is a member variable or a
class member what this is and why we
define it above the constructor here is
a variable that belongs to this entire
class so when we're creating our
component using this class that is going
to belong to the class as a whole rather
than say an individual function so if I
had a function in here let's call it
some function and I define a variable in
the normal way which is to say let
something equal something or we could do
var which bar something equals something
which were usually we don't use anymore
because with the new es6 syntax in ionic
2 and angular 2 let is the better option
generally because it uses block scoping
so this it limits the scope of the
variable to wherever you define it
essentially so we don't run into
problems with variables crashing into
each other so the difference between
this variable that we create here and a
member variable that we create above the
constructor is that this is only
accessible from this one function our as
this is accessible from anywhere in this
entire class and it's also available in
our template file as well we can
reference that variable in here which
I'm going to get to soon but I just
wanted to make an important
clarification there and if we want to
change this value assign it anywhere
within our class here we can access it
this which refers to the scope of the
class we do this stop employees equals
whatever so we can access this from any
function in this entire class and then
we can also access that value in the
template as well and we can even set the
value in here using the template using
two-way data two-way data-binding and
again I'm going to get to in just a
little bit so let's take a step back for
a minute we'll delete all this and what
we're going to do is just create an
array with a little bit of data in it to
define a couple of employees
okay so I've defined an array on this
star employees now sorry for the
uncreated data I'm using but I've just
got two people here Josh Bob and Jane
and they have a picture define that
we're going to use for the Avatar their
name and their title and so we're going
to make use of this data in the template
so what I can do is jump over here now
and I can use an ng for directive and so
what I'm going to do is loop over the I
on item here using ng form and this star
syntax that you see used for stuff like
this
the the structural directive that allows
us to stamp out multiple different
elements for a set of data so it's
basically a shortcut for creating a
template so what this will do is loop
over this element here this iron item
and it's gonna create an iron item for
every thing in the set of data that
we're looping over and it's going to
stamp out the new information inside of
that so when this is actually output
into the Dom what you actually see when
you're looking at it through the browser
it's not going to contain this ng 4 or
any of the things are writing here it's
going to generate the templates using
angular so we're gonna do ng 4 I'm going
to let employee of employees so we're
looping over employees and we want to
reference an individual employee in her
data down here and then we can use those
values in here so just for now I'm gonna
set this to be the name and to do this
I'm going to use the concept of
interpolation what this does essentially
is this is where we can use any
variables we have defined in our class
here and it's going to calculate
whatever value that is and then
turn it into a string and render it out
here so if I do employee dot name that's
going to go and grab the name for an
individual employee which is Josh and
it's going to put that out as a string
here so you can use any any variable as
any member variables we have defining
here we can just reference directly in
an interpolation with the curly braces
you know I'm gonna do the same with that
title underneath and save that and see
if it works
and of course it doesn't work there's
nothing ever works the first time let's
see what's going on three e's four
employees
let's try two okay there we go now we
have a list we have the three people
that we set up in our array are now
displaying in the list and let's just
get rid of the padding on the content
too because that looks a bit silly okay
cool that's a bit better so we have our
data being rendered out using
interpolation now and just before we
move on from that you can also use
interpolation to do other calculations
like simple mathematics for example I
could be three plus five inside of curly
braces and then it's going to display
eight in here so most of the time you're
just going to be using this to render
out some data but perhaps you might run
into a circumstance where I want to make
use of that and essentially run some
code inside of your template so one
thing I've skipped over doing on purpose
is adding in the image here and because
I'm using the same link I'm just gonna
delete this for now
so you can see the image it's gone now
so what we want to do is I use the image
that we have defined in our data here we
want to put that in here and so you
could do use interpolation again here
you could do your curly braces and had
an employee named named Sophie pitcher
save that and we have our picture back
now the is the proper way to do this
would be to use a property binding here
and that's what I mentioned at the start
of this video and what that does is
allows us to find a variable we have to
a property on the Dom so to do that we
can use square brackets here and this is
what allows us to find the property to
the Dom element so the dumb property
here which is source and if we just
write employee don't picture how do we
use that variable and add it to the
source property here so if I save that
we should still see our picture being
added and we can so this isn't just for
source of course you can use this to buy
into many different properties or any
property really and the reason we use
the square brackets here is because this
is what will actually turn this value
into a string it'll first figure out
what that string should be and use that
rather than using employee dot picture
directly so if I us to get rid of these
square brackets here and save it it's
going to break our image so if I look
over in the console here I can see it's
trying to literally grab employee dot
picture as the picture which of course
isn't what we want we want to convert
that variable which is in here or rather
it's a it's an object in array in this
case but essentially we want to grab
that and then turn that into a string
and then use that rather than literally
using employee
got picture so I hope change that back
and then you can use that in other
circumstances as well so her common one
for example to use is hidden so there is
a hidden attribute we can use so if I
say hidden equals true and take it a
look what happens you can see that the
image no longer gets shown anymore it's
being hidden so I might want to instead
of setting that to you the true or false
I might want to base that on some value
I have in my typescript file here so if
I was to add another property to the
object here let's say show picture I
would set this to true for me
I'll set it to false for Bob and I'll
set it to true for Jane so now we have
different different values for different
people here so now if I come in here and
add those square brackets to find one of
these properties to this attribute here
this property if I change that now to
employee got show picture save that and
take a look what happens you can see now
that it's not showing for me and Jane
but it is showing for Bob now I've
actually kind of got that a bit
backwards that's confusing a better name
for that variable would be a hide
picture because we're deciding whether
or not to hide it not to show it it
doesn't really matter but just for to
make it a little bit less confusing and
change that to hide picture and now we
want to hide it for me and Jane but not
for Bob and of course that's what
happens it shows for Bob but not for me
and Jane so that is property binding
we've already covered interpolation as
well so the main thing we have left to
discuss is event binding and what event
binding does is allow us to bind onto
events from the Dom and then create
handlers for those in our cloud script
file here so if I wanted to add say a
click event to this item here and then
perform some action when that happens I
can use event binding to do that so
before we add a click handler here we're
going to convert this into a button with
the eye on item styling now the reason
we do this is because on mobile buttons
and anchor tags don't have the tap delay
so by converting this to a button we get
rid of that tap delay you can also add
the tap aboard a directive to get rid of
that tap delay as well but it's better
for accessibility reasons to use buttons
and anchor tags in general when things
need to be tapped with that
interactively so we'll save that and
make sure nothing has broken everything
still seems fine so what I want to
happen now is I want to call a function
when that is tapped or clicked so I'm
going to create that function in here
and I'm just gonna call that handle
click and when that happens I'm just
going to log out to the console and say
I've been clicked so to trigger that
function in our template we can use a an
event an event binding so I'll add to
the bomb here these two parenthesis and
then we use the name of the event that
we want to bind to so in this place in
this case it's just quick and we set
that to be whatever the name of our
function is so handle click
and so whenever this button is clicked
now that's going to call this function
and run the code inside of there so if I
switch back into the browser try
clicking on something you can see how
renders out i've been clicked into the
console whenever any of these are
clicked as well as that you can also
pass in some data to that function so
file on a plus passing the employee
value so i know who's being clicked on I
can just write employee here because I'm
using the ng for directive here I'm
setting up that a reference to employee
I can pass that into the clip function
as well and you can do that anywhere
inside of here so if I save that again
and jump back into here actually first
we want to make sure we are handling
that here and we log out the employee
object okay so now if I click on myself
here I still says I've been clicked and
then it outputs the object as well so
this is useful for things like say a
master-detail pattern where you want to
detect when somebody clicks on a
specific item and then you want to
display more details for that item in a
new page so this will delay to easily
pass this object into a new page and
then display that data and as well as
the click event you can also buy into
essentially any Dom event that is
available so this is a really simple
syntax to handle attaching listeners to
events now the final concept I want to
cover is two-way data-binding
and so to way data binding does is allow
you to set up a variable where if you
change it in the template it's going to
be changed in the typescript file
automatically in your class here and if
you change it in the class it's going to
automatically be updated to be reflected
in the template as well okay so to show
you how to a data binding works I'm
actually gonna get rid of this example
completely here and we're gonna grab an
input from the ionic to documentation so
I've got the inputs up here what it's
going to grab grab this one we really
only just need the one field
so we'll just use username for now so if
I save that and jump into here again you
can see what if I use a name field here
I can type in there and nothing much is
happening right now
so what I can do though is set up to a
data binding on this using ng model and
so first we're gonna create a variable
in here that's going to we're going to
use the two-way data binding on so we're
just gonna call this user name and then
we can set that up using ng model using
this syntax here with the parentheses
inside the square brackets and set that
equal to the variable we just created
the the member variable here so now that
is attached to that so if I always set
this to will set it to Shasha Amarone I
save that now and jump back into here
I'm so actually gonna have to get rid of
this value here which is setting rally
to blank
once again rid of that and take a look
you can see that the user name is now
being displayed here so this obviously
allows us to use this variable here but
we could do the same thing using
interpolation but the important thing to
know is that not only is this grabbing
the value from the typescript file and
putting it in here if we make a change
to this in the template it's also going
to be reflected against this this member
variable here so if I create a button
now for example I'm gonna add another I
click handle it here again and we're
gonna call a function called submit
using and we're not gonna pass any data
into that we're just going to also have
the I on button styling and we're just
going to call this save
and we're going to create a function
here
it is just going to log out some
information for now so if I save that
jump into here if I hit that Save button
that's going to trigger that function so
what we're going to do now is take a
look at what's happening with this
username variable so if I log that out
as well
so there should be still user name some
referencing a member variable so if I
click on save now we can see that it
logs out Joshua Maroney how it should
expect because that's what we set the
variable to be but now if I change this
to just Josh and do it again you can see
that it's also updated this variable
here and it's now displaying Josh and so
another example of what you can do with
this let's say if I had another field
here called we say employee name and we
use interpolation to render out that
user name we save this and jump over
here again as I edit this you can see
that it's automatically being updated
and in that h2 field as well so this
two-way data-binding essentially allows
you to keep a variable in sync between
the template and the class definition
okay so that's all we're going to cover
in this video I just wanted to touch on
the basics for now I'll probably do some
more advanced concepts in the future but
hopefully that clears up how these three
basic but really important things work
in ionic 2 and angular 2 and that's
property binding event binding and
interpolation and also two-way
data-binding so I hope you enjoyed the
video and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
