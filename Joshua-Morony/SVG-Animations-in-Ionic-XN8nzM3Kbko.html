through adding an SVG animation to an
ionic application now if you're not
really familiar with what an SVG is I'm
not going to spend too much time in this
video talking about it I'll link to a
blog post I did recently that explains
it in a little bit more depth of SVG
stands for a scalable vector graphic and
two vector images are images that are
sort of defined mathematically and they
can be shrunk and expanded to any degree
now you could blow it up to a sort of
billboard size and it's not going to
lose any quality and when you compare
that to say a raster image which is one
kind of like a normal image I guess
that's defined by the pixels as you
expand that and you've probably had
experience with that before you expand
it to a larger size and it starts to
become blurry because the information
for what that should look like just
isn't there at that size whereas with
vector graphics that information is
defined so I guess that describes what a
vector graphic is an SVG is just a
particular format for that we can use it
on we can use it with the web it is
defined in XML so it has this kind of
like a normal Dom structure like any
other element on your page and we can do
some cool things with that including
animating it with CSS or even JavaScript
if we want to that's what we're going to
do is build a simple SVG we're going to
add it into an ionic application and
then what it's going to attach a simple
CSS keyframe animation to that so as
you'll see in a moment with the SVG
format you can even just kind of code it
yourself straight in the XML to create
the graphic but for more complicated
images that's probably going to be quite
hard so you may want to use a program
like illustrator that I've got up here
that can where you can define some kind
of vector graphic and then you can
export it as an SVG adobe illustrator is
it is a paid software and I do believe
there are some free options out there as
well so hopefully a quick Google search
will turn up some free options you can
use to create and
graphics to now but I'm just starting
from this point is to I guess take it
right from the beginning I'm not going
to be designing anything too fancy in
here I just want to get a couple of
shapes and then going to get that into
ionic and start animating those so I
might have start off with just throwing
a circle make it I get think get rid of
the border color so I'm just going to
create a couple random shapes here and
we'll create a square as well and I'm
just going to separate these into
different layers when you're sporting
SVG code from illustrator it works a
little nicer if we have the different
elements on different layers like this
so we'll create a square as well and
we'll just make that one blue made the
circle blue let's create that square
first this it's more of a rectangle so
we change that one to blue and I might
just put that on top of the circle a bit
there
let's create where is it exit on one two
three yes a hexagon and we'll meet that
one green and that will do we can
pretend this is some kind of fancy
abstract logo someone to scale all that
up of it and it doesn't really matter I
can kind of stretch this to any size I
want and it's not going to matter I'm
not going to lose any quality there
because it's these are vector shapes and
I can expand them or shrink them as much
as I want and I said I was going to move
everything onto its own layer as well as
I'm going to stick to that let's create
a layer for the hexagon there and we'll
just move the hexagon to that layer
let's get it back where it was okay
there we go so we have the SVG we want
to use now we want this in our eye on a
couple occasion and we want to animate
it so now that it's defined I can go
into file and go to export now this is
going to allow me to export it as an SVG
so if I change the format down here to
SVG and click export there's going to
give me the option to save that as an
SVG file so just be like kind of like a
normal image rather than like shakes got
PNG it's going to be shaped
SVG and then you can just include that
in an image tag a ball you can also do
is you can see the code directly for
this as well so this is that XML code
that I was talking about that is used to
define an SVG and this is basically
everything we need to display the shapes
we've added here so all I need to do is
copy that
into ionic and it's going to display
that for us so it's exactly what I'm
going to do I'm going to copy that
and jump into the ionic application here
and we're just going to dump that onto
the home page so add it inside of this
content area so it's probably going to
be a bit neater to you know supplies
it's an image tag rather than pasting
the code directly here but I think it
helps illustrate the pointers what an
SVG is so I'm just going to just expand
these things out of it and you'll see
this just has a structure like a normal
sort of HTML document we have a title we
have a style definition here and then we
have the shapes for the SVG itself and
actually quite simple you can see we
have a circle a rectangle and a polygon
and it's defined you know what those
should look like so this is a pretty
simple example so you could basically
just write this out by hand if you
wanted to if you start doing some more
complicated shapes with curves and
things like that this will get quite a
bit more complicated and not really
realistic to write yourself and one
important thing to remember is that the
more simple your shapes are there
smaller SVG is going to be the less it's
going to take to load it in if you have
a free look at this you can see the
points on these shapes there's only has
six points obviously this has this has
nine points it looks like they're so the
more the more complex of shapes are the
more complicated your SVG is going to be
and harder is it's going to be bigger
it's gonna be harder to animate so where
possible is could keep the shapes as
simple as you can
so with CSS animations of course we
could just animate in this SVG and it's
entirely if we wanted to say fade it in
from being having zero opacity to full
opacity but because of the way in SVG is
defined we also have the
kind of elements of the SVG itself which
we can animate individually and so we
have these classes attached to each of
these shapes here the circle has a class
of class 1 rectangle has a class of
class 2 and you can see up here that
it's defining you know what color they
should be the the fuel color of the
shape but we could attach other
properties to this as well and then we
can animate those properties
so let's first have a look at what we
have right now so if I jump into the
browser where I've got this running you
can see that the SVG here I'm taking it
before words of the screen let's say
rather than having that SVG just display
immediately
I want to progressively load in the
different shades of recursively show
them as I want to say that the so cool
to show first and then the I want the
rectangle to fade in and then hexagon
and as I mentioned before to do that we
can just use a simple CSS animation so
if we come back into the home page now
open up the CSS file we're just going to
hook onto those classes that have
already been defined here so I'm just
going to define a really simple keyframe
animation here and again I'm not going
to talk about how keyframe animations
work in this video again I'll link to
something up here if it is new to you
not sure how this works so I'm just
going to create a keyframe animation
called fade in and then at the hundred
percent mark when that animation has
completed and going to set the style to
opacity one so whatever has this
animation I was keyframe attached to it
at the end of its animation it should
have an opacity of one about what we're
going to do to the various classes here
we have class 1 class 2 and class 3 if I
say add add some properties to the class
1 which is the circle I'm going to set
that opacity to zero so if we take a
look now hopefully we'll see the circle
disappear and we do so we've already
modified just part of this SVG is you
know this entire now the SVG is as these
three shapes but with just with a simple
CSS we've modified what that actually
looks like which of course assignment
you wouldn't really really be able to do
just a normal image so that in itself is
pretty cool now we can then animate that
circle in if we wanted to so if I add
the animation property here and supplied
you fade in animation and we'll make
that run over say one second and we'll
give it an I will give them easing as
well so let's just take a look at what
that looks like now so refresh the
application that should be fading and
now think dumb I've actually popper
they'll actually keyframe some keep not
keyframe so let's try that again and you
saw that if you were quick your to
seeing that pop into existence there
that fades in and then it quickly just
disappears again so if we would so if we
were to change this to three seconds we
grab to see that effect there for a
little bit longer if we refresh but you
can see that fade in there and then it
pops out of existence again because we
haven't set the animation fuel mode what
this means basically is that if we set
it to forward we're saying that once the
animation has completed we want it to
keep the properties that its animated to
my default it goes back to what it was
originally and so if I save then now we
take a look closely at animates in but
then stays there these are the circle
animates in and then it pops away again
I've done something wrong there that's
supposed to be forwards not forward I'm
not doing so great on the plurals today
we save that again and try once more if
now it fades in and it stays there and
so now we're going to do a similar thing
with the rest of the shapes so for now
we'll just copy that exact same thing
and we'll apply it to class 2 and class
3 as well and if you wanted to you could
also give these some more useful class
names rather than the default that
illustrate it gives them so now
everything's going to fade in now but
rather than having them all fade in at
once I could add a delay here and so if
we give that a delay of 0.2 seconds in
this a delay of 0.4 seconds everything's
going to kind of stay
in a little bit and you can see sort of
one slowly loads in after the other so
obviously that's just a really simple
example you can animate a whole range of
other CSS properties as well not just
opacity so if I wanted to say animate
the fill color as well I could maybe
we'll define another keyframe animation
here called fade in and change so we'll
do the same thing again we use 100% at
100% we set opacity to one have also
changed the fuel color and it's
important to note that with SVG's with
these shapes here we're using fuel not
background color so let's say for this
one I want the color to actually change
to say C thirty thirty seventy which is
a kind of gray color as I will save that
and we'll give say what's class three is
the hexagon so maybe we'll give this the
fade in and change animation and we'll
just refresh that and you can see here
kind of you know slowly fades into that
dark gray color as it's fading in as
well I could get rid of that capacity
steam in there just to see that color
effect a bit better for a fresh nut
again you see the green slowly slowly
fade into gray okay so this is a pretty
straightforward and boring example it's
not a particularly fun looking animation
hopefully it does show you the potential
of what can be done with SVG's and just
simple with CSS animations but it's
certainly not limited to that is
obviously there are a lot of things that
you can animate with CSS but since we
have just this normal Dom type structure
here we could grab references to any any
of these things and manipulate them in
any way we like with just plain
JavaScript as well you can also create
animations that way and you can use
JavaScript animation libraries to help
you do that and you can create some
really cool
affects and in a blog post I wrote
recently I I mentioned a book by Sarah
Dresner who wrote this book called SVG
animations I believe it was called and
it's a really great examples in there so
if you are interested in doing these
really complex SVG animations I'd
recommend checking that out she's got a
bunch of links to demos an example
within there and yeah you'll find some
much more impressive examples than my
little disappearing Shakespeare so I
hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
