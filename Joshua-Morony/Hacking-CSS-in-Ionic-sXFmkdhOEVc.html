you how to go about theming an ionic to
application there's a lot of different
ways to do this and this isn't going to
be a super in-depth video but I'm just
going to go through a few quick examples
of the different ways you can theme your
application and typically how I would go
about doing it so I've got an
application here that I've created in
another tutorial and I'll link to that
if you want to build it but it is
essentially just an app that displays
some youtubers and it has some functions
that we can run on the data that it's
displaying so we can run this filter
function filters out some youtubers we
can hit this button which modifies the
data if you want to know why it's doing
that so particularly you can go take a
look at the tutorial you can learn quite
a lot about filtering mapping and
reducing data in that tutorial so when
I'm going to worry about what's
happening in this application we're just
going to apply a few styles to it and
make it look a little bit nicer there's
already a little bit of styling here
already we've got the the color
attribute set on the header here so if I
was to open up that page so you've got
the danger color here but apart from
that we haven't really defined any
custom styles or other sass variables or
anything like that so I'm gonna talk
about doing those things in this
tutorial so one way that we can style
our ionic to applications is to use
inbuilt CSS utility attributes that
ionic suppliers for us so like that
color equals danger attribute there but
we also have some other things as well
one is this item left attribute here as
we can apply that to the ion avatar to
display it on the left but there's a
bunch more that we can use as well so to
get us started let's say that I want to
not display
lines on this list here I just want them
to be floating in space there so what I
can do I could of course create a CSS
style to get rid of that bottom border
then but I can also just add the no
lines attribute straight on to the list
that's the content add it here so if I
add that to the list and I save it it's
going to get rid of those lines so those
utility attributes that I own it does
supply I can come in really handy for
things like that saves you a bit of work
there are quite a few of them and it may
be difficult to actually know what's
available so I'm going to put out a
tutorial soon hopefully that lists some
of the common ones and what they do but
it can be quite confusing to figure out
what's available we might not know it's
available so a lot of the time you may
just end up creating your own custom CSS
style for it I which we're going to
cover how to do as well but before we
get to that I'm going to cover another
way to style your application and that's
using sass variables now if you don't
know what sass is it stands for
syntactically awesome style sheets and
it's a pre compiler for CSS essentially
so we can create variables in CSS and we
can do more fancy things rather than
just what CSS allows us to do by default
so we can create nested rules we can
create variables that we can reuse
throughout the application a good
example is like that danger color we're
using for example rather than manually
defining whatever this red color is
wherever you want to use it we can just
create this danger color that we can
then reuse and the benefit of that is if
we ever want to change what the danger
color is then all we have to do is
change it in one spot and that's going
to be reflected everywhere in the
application so I'll use that as an
example if I jump into the code here and
go to the variables dot s CSS file so
this is where we can define some of
these variables and ionic already has
some setup by default here
and they've got a color map set up so
usually the variables will just be like
this so dollar sign but we've got two
maps it up here that defines a whole
bunch of colors that we can use and so
you can see we've got dangerous set to
this color here and then we use that
like this in our template file so if I
was to change this to let's just go with
black and save that if we go back at the
application that's going to apply to
that head and out so wherever we've used
that danger variable that's going to
apply in our application red is cool of
those I'm going to switch back to that
for now so as well as these color
variables here we can also define some
other variables as well we could define
our own and we can also hook into the
ones that ionic is has already defined
and is using so we can add something
here that's actually going to affect the
application so you could use a
background color for example is one so I
could write background color and we'll
make that black again it's because it's
obvious so if I save that go back to the
application
now see the the background is black now
so I'm gonna get rid of that there's
some other ones as well and we're gonna
go have a look at a few of them so if
you go to the ionic documentation and go
to the theming section there's a page
called overriding ionic variables and
this defines all of the variables that
are available and as you can see there
is lots and lots here so we can change
any of these that we want to we can
overwrite them and that's going to
affect the way that things display in
the application and you'll notice that
some of these variables actually relate
to other variables so the card iOS
padding here is such a nine pixels but
if we take a look at let's find one here
so the checkbox iOS icon border color on
I uses this variable
that variable changes that's going to
affect this as well so this is a good
way if you're changing variables in
ionic rather than manually of writing
styles there's a better chance that it's
going to be reflected in other places in
the application where it makes sense for
that change to occur also so just to
show an example let's modify one of
these and since we're using an item
let's use one of the item variable so
there should be a padding for the
material design
I mean jump back up here in case I
missed it okay so we have an item MD
padding tops of the MDS material design
that's the Android styling and that's
set to 13 pixels so if I want to change
that I can just grab this variable and
put it in a variable so a CSS file and
instead of 13 pixels I'm going to set
that to 50 this is gonna look silly but
we're going to see the effect that has
on the application so as you can see now
we've got that padding at the top and
it's pushed the content down and we're
on a Galaxy s5 here so that is getting
that material design styling but if I
were to switch that to an iPhone and
fresh that the styling doesn't apply
here so the variables can also be a good
way to get platform-specific styles as
well and we'll do just one more example
we're gonna style this avatar here so
it's jump back into the documentation I
will search for an avatar attribute okay
here we go we've got the item MD avatar
size and that's set to 40 pixels so if I
grab that and we're gonna change it from
40 pixels to 70 pixels I'll save that
jump back into the app again and we can
see nothing's happened here because
we're on the iPhone and
was a material design specific variable
so now if I jump back into the galaxy
and refresh it you can see we've got a
padding back and the avatar is bigger
now as well so both of those styles are
pretty bad so I'm actually just gonna
get rid of those now save that and go
back to original application so the next
thing we're going to do is look at
creating our own custom CSS rules so to
do that each component has its own home
dot a CSS file rather will be called
whatever the component is called but we
have this s CSS file which is a sass
file and we can define some custom
styles in there for that specific
component because this includes the
selector for that component so if we
look in here so rather than the touch
script file you can see the selector is
page home so if we define some styles
inside of page home these styles are
only going to affect that component and
it has actually just started raining
outside so I hope that you can't hear
that too much okay so it can also define
some Styles in the app folder here as
well in the app dot CSS file and their
styles that are going to a to be
applying app wide rather than just to a
specific component okay so one really
cool thing that sense allows us to do is
nest selectors and rules like this and
we have our page home selector here and
then inside of that I could define
another selector and so that's only
gonna target paragraphs an inside page
home now but then I could even go one
deeper than that I could also say say
this is a div and then inside of that I
could say I want a paragraph tag so now
it's this rule is only going to apply it
to paragraphs or the inside of divs that
inside of the page home component so
we're going to use that style of
defining CSS rules now to define some
styles for our application so what I
want to try and do is make these
individual items pop out a little bit
more have their own little container and
their space to float around them so to
do that let's take a look at our HTML
here so we have an eye on item for each
of these youtubers that we're rendering
out here so I want to hook into that and
create some kind of padding around it
some kind of container so what we can do
is jump into our home to a CSS file and
we can target eye on item so that's
going to target every eye on item that
is inside of our homepage so if we have
other items that were on another page we
wouldn't have to worry about this CSS
affecting those so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to add a bit of padding to
them 20 pixels of padding and let's just
give it a one pixel border so I'll save
that and see what that looks like
and as you can see nothing has really
changed here so this brings up another
important concept in with CSS and that's
specifically which apart from being
really hard to say is really important
so what it means is that essentially the
most specific CS our CSS we're always
going to apply so if I open up one of
these in the inspector now and let's
just we'll go to our eye on item in
which we're attempting style and so we
can see a list of all the styles that
are being applied here so we have one
that's being applied to the item MD
class these are all being applied by eye
on it and we have a whole bunch of
things in here so the problem with us
trying to define our own CSS rule is
that if our selector is less specific
than what I on ik is doing then it's not
going to apply it so to get around that
you can add important here if we save
that refresh it it we can see that the
border is there but it's best to avoid
using that wherever possible I think the
better approach is to just create a more
specific rule and the way I usually get
around this is to add the i/os and
material design classes so what this
does is the only target CSS rules for
either iOS or material design so what
I'm saying here is that I want these
rules to apply to both iOS and material
design but if I wanted to just create
rules that would only apply to iOS I
could create a separate iOS I selected
down here and define my rules inside of
there so I don't specifically want to
create different rules for iOS and
Android here but what this does is makes
these rules more specific so if I save
these now and take a look we can see
that the padding is being applied but
the border still isn't being applied so
if we inspect this item in our debugger
here I will take a look at why that's
not happening and so if I click on home
item I can see all the styles that are
being applied to this and I can see that
it's getting a boarder with zero
property here so if I get rid of that we
can see the lines come back and that's
because this style is coming from that
no lines attribute that we had it before
so that no lines attribute is overriding
the borders that we're trying to add so
what we need to do in this case is
either get rid of any liens or perhaps
the easiest solution in this case is
just to add importance it's fine to use
that if you need to it's just better
best to avoid it where possible because
you don't want to just have tons of
important statements over your entire
CSS file and then it's going to break
the order of things the natural order of
things so avoid it where possible but if
you need to like in this case if it
makes sense feel free to use it another
cool thing we can do with our sass
variables is we can use them in here
directly as well and so what I'm going
to do is make use of the colors we
already have defined so what I can do in
here let's say if I want to add a
background color
I can be background-color of course I
could just do a black again so we'll see
if check with that actually works first
and it does but let's say I want to use
one of our predefined colors so what I
can do is usually you would just access
the color like this but since we are
defining in a map here what we have to
do is use a map get so we can do map yet
and in supply the map that we're getting
it from which is colors and then the
name of the color we want so we'll go
for the primary color so save that and
now we can see we have this really ugly
blue color being applied instead so we
can use any of those colors that are
defined so I'll change its danger
take a look what that looks like and now
it's all red so the cool thing about
this is that if I wish I have a bunch of
different things I was styling here and
I wanted to give them all that red color
I can use this to define it and that way
if I ever want to change that in the
future all I have to do is change this
one value here and then the whole
application is going to update to
reflect that rather than me having to go
through and individually changing
everything
so all those changes are pretty ugly so
I'm gonna delete those for now I'll keep
the padding actually but let's try and
get something that actually looks kind
of decent okay so I've got rid of those
styles now we're back to just the
padding on a white background and what
we're going to do now is just generate a
a box shadow a bit of a background to
make it look like the items are popping
off from the screen a little bit and so
to generate pop shadows I usually just
use this box shadow generator on CSS
Medicom allows you to play around with
the shadow to trying it's like you like
and then you can just copy and paste and
CSS into your CSS so let's try and
create something that might look decent
here I'll set that to zero and maybe
blew on it and a little bit less spread
okay so we'll copy that we'll see how
that looks
we'll just add it to that I on item
styling again save it and take a look
because you can see there's a very very
faint pop shadow there that we can see
it looks it looks pretty decent actually
I think but let's just see what it would
look like if we were to put a bit of a
margin on this as well and we'll save
that first and take a look okay so now
that the boxes are a bit more obvious
now they pop out from the screens they
still have their own space now we have
this problem where it's kind of pushing
off to off the side of the screen here
now if you don't want that to happen
what we can do so just gonna set a width
of let's say 90% will say 96% on these
and then we'll add a margin to the left
and right of 2% so we'll change this to
leave that at 10 pixels and then 2% the
left on the right so the first value is
the top and bottom margin the second is
the left and right I'll save that and
let's see if it looks any good okay so
now we have the boxes centered quite
well now the shadow looks a bit ugly
though I think so maybe if we just turn
it down a little bit we'll change the
opacity value here the alpha value which
is it 75 percent now 0.75 if we change
that to strike 30% see what that looks
like it's a little bit more subtle now
maybe we can even drop it down just
slightly more as well
okay that's cool I like that so now it's
a little bit more subtle looks a little
bit better now and it looks a little bit
more interesting than when it was just
on a flat white background and I want to
go through this one one more quick
example here because I've only got one
style defined so I want to just drive
home the point about nesting here and
remember that you can also add in
classes if you want I prefer to nest
rules like this attack them that way but
you could also if you like define a
class on things so you could do it class
equals my cool item and then you could
target that in here with the dot
selector so dot my cool item instead I
would sure allow you to target classes
or as this allows you to target elements
and you can also target attributes using
rackets like this so you could have my
attribute and you can target IDs using
the the hash so if you had we'll just
call it my my thing and I can come up
with I would add read the brackets after
those so if I was to jump in here and I
could then instead of using class I
could do ID it was my thing and you can
target that instead this is a bunch of
ways you can target stuff with CSS
selectors so do whatever makes the most
sense to you and what makes sense for
your application but in general I prefer
to just target the elements were nesting
like this mainly because I think it
looks neat and I don't have to write in
classes manually myself so as a last
example we're just gonna add some slight
styling to this I on Avatar so to do
that we could either put it here an
avatar which is going to correctly
select that because it's an iron
habitats inside of a home page component
here but we could also if we want to be
more specific we can also define
more styles we can nest it again inside
of the iron item so the item has its own
styles and then we have some more
elements nested inside that that we all
want to apply styling to so if I was to
set this to how to set the opacity to
0.5 save that and now that element has a
lesser opacity than the rest of the
elements so this in this case that
doesn't make a difference if we put this
in here or in outside here in the page
home selector it's probably better to do
it in here it's making it more specific
that way if you did just want to target
just this avatar let's say you had more
avatars somewhere else that way it's
going to just target this one again it
depends on what you're actually trying
to achieve but in general the nesting is
good it makes the rules more specific
but maybe you don't want to go too
overboard as well so the end result here
is an amazing we haven't done some crazy
CSS and made this awesome application
but I just wanted to step through some
different ways to style an application
with you give you a bit of a live coding
demo I wasn't really sure what I was
going to end up coding here but I wanted
to kind of show you the way I would
usually go about styling an application
and messing around playing with things
trying a few different approaches in
general I rely on using these s CSS
files to define custom styles how will
overwrite these colors here and use
those throughout the applications
sometimes I use a couple of shared
variables by usually I find it's more
difficult to hunt down which variables
affect what so in a lot of cases I do
end up just using the CSS and I think
it's perfectly fine way to do it and
another important thing is just to
remember to make use of this debugger
here that's a really good way to figure
out what's going on if you're creating
some style it's not being applied you
can easily just jump in here see what's
going on
click on different elements see what
styles are being applied toggle them on
and off and see if you can make what you
want to happen happen you can even come
in here directly and add styles and see
if it does what you want and you'll also
notice that ionic adds all these
additional elements in here it's not
just what is defined in your template
because these components are made up of
a template that's going to display in
here so in here we have a div with a
class of item in ER so that might have
some Styles applied to it that you want
to target specifically and so you could
come into your CSS here and then target
that if for whatever reason that thing
was doing something you didn't want it
to so it's very important to be
comfortable with this debugger and be
able to see what's being applied it's
gonna make your job a lot easier if you
are comfortable with using this so have
a play around with it whenever you're
working on your applications if you're
not already comfortable with that ok so
I'm gonna end the video there before I
ramble on for too long but I hope this
was useful to you I hope you learned a
little bit about CSS and how to apply
that to ionic 2 inverses thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one
