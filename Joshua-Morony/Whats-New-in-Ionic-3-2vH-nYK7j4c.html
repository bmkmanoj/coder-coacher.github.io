what's new in ionic 3 and I've said this
many times recently and I'll repeat it
again just in case anybody doesn't know
and that's that ionic 3 is not a totally
new framework it's just an update to
ionic 2 people are familiar with the
arnoquon dynamic to transition they know
that was a huge change is a totally new
framework so it's important to know this
isn't the same thing this is just
different versioning system and the
ionic 3 update just implies a major
update not a total framework change so
in this video we're going to talk about
what some of those changes are and for
the most part a lot of the changes are
behind the scenes you won't notice a
whole lot of it which is using angular
for behind the scenes now and there's
some advantage everyone is there in
terms of the amount of code that
components required to compile and
things like that so the application is
going to be the bundles rails are going
to be smaller your application should be
faster but for the most part you do
everything the same as you did before
but there are a couple of changes that
you will notice in your applications
though and I'm going to talk through I
guess the two most important things I
think about ironing 3 in this video so
I'm going to start by generating a new
application you still do that the same
as you did before right now you still
need to use the v2 flag to get a ionic 3
project now so v2 flag just makes the
ionic command-line interface you use the
latest version of the framework right
now that's going to be removed shortly
when the version 3 the command-line
interface comes out so in future you'll
just run ionic start let's call this I
don't I own ik update I guess and I'll
use the blank template so future that's
all you have to do very soon they're
going to remove this flag but for now to
generate on the latest framework you
still need to include the v2 flag so
I'll let that generate now and then
we'll jump into the code
actually why that's all installing I'll
jump over into the documentation here
for ionic page and this is really the
best new thing and that you're going to
notice in your applications and ionic
page is just a new decorator that you
include at the top of your components so
we have page components at least there's
no difference between a page component
in ionic is just a normal component it's
just the ones that we are using as our
sort of full screen new eyes as opposed
to a component that might be there
things like the progress bar component
that I've made before like little things
that you can embed inside components as
you will see in the example here all
there is is an ionic page above the
component that's really all you need to
do but there are also configurations you
can supply to that for deep linking and
deep linking is like that has existed in
ionic in the past but sort of built into
this ionic page now and I think it's
going to be really easy for people to
use and and it makes it so that you're
able to link to specific sections of
your application through the URL now so
you can see here this ionic page has a
segment of some path and so if you go to
some paths in the URL that's going to
load to that page directly rather than
to just start of the application and the
onic team have made efforts to stress
that this isn't routing in the
traditional sense it's not like angular
where there's a full routing system
where the application I guess it's
behaving more like a website like a web
app where it has a more traditional
style of page structure I guess with
ionic it's more like a native mobile app
so we have that sort of push pop
navigation system it's not a typical
sort of page structure that a website
would have so this deep linking system
is kind of ionics version of routing
that makes sense in that kind of
environment
so we'll get into an example of using
that just really quickly in a minute I'm
not going to go into a deep dive about
deep linking or anything in this video
I'm just going to quickly cover the
changes and to give you across what you
can expect to see
in anionic three application okay so
that has finished generating now so
we'll just get into that what did I call
it
ionic update so I'll serve that and
we'll open up the code and take a look
okay so our application is in the
browser now as contain little changes
here and I'll jump into the code and
you'll also see that really isn't any
changes to the structure or the code
either in here now if we jump into a
page here the home page that
automatically generates right now this
may change but at least right now you
can see that the ionic page decorator
isn't included here and everything is
done exactly the same as it was before
and that's still an option you don't
have to use ionic page so if you want
you didn't want to use say deep linking
you don't have to worry about including
it but there is another advantage to
using ionic page and that's that it
enables lazy loading which if you're
unfamiliar with the concept of lazy
loading basically it's lazy loading
basically is loading things as you need
them not right away
so on a website you're going to be
loading an image when the user is
actually scrolling to the image if you
had an image that was way down the
bottom of the page and the users at the
top of the page they may never even get
to the bottom of the page so we don't
necessarily need to load it and so it's
a similar concept here where if we lazy
load our pages it's not going to load
everything at the start of the
application so that's going to improve
your startup times so it's likely that
by default in the future the home page
here the the root page will also include
ionic page but right now it doesn't
however if you generate a page with the
ionic generators it will include ionic
page so we're going to use an example
now I'm going to jump in here and dust
on ionic G page and notice call it
second so that jumps in there and you
can see in this page we have a module
file and actually is an error in these
right now this should say ionic page
module not
module but that'll probably be fixed
before you see this video anyway and so
I probably don't really have time to go
into a module is in this video I do have
another video that explains what an ng
module is so I'll link to that but I'll
just briefly explain if you see in your
app folder here this is the root module
that is used we've been using for a long
time now basically it just sets up the
various components and providers in the
application and allows this just going
to bundle these things together and then
provide it to the application so so
typically we can use modules to sort of
bundle this functionality together we
could make some module we could make
some module say for a specific set of
functionality we're doing and we could
import all of our components and
everything that it needs into this
module and then just import the one
module into our root module here rather
than having to import everything we want
to use everywhere we want to use it you
can see here that we import the ionic
module and that provides all of the
ionic components throughout the entire
application rather than us having to
import ionic components in every single
page that we want to use them so in
order for lazy loading to work we need
to supply our pages as a module so all
we do is set up a module that is just
including our page and that's it so this
module file will be automatically
generated for you so you don't really
need to worry about it except for right
now you do need to make sure that says
page module but you can basically just
ignore this file to pretend that it
doesn't exist and then in your main
transcript file here you just need to
include that ionic page decorator and if
you're using the generators that's also
going to be included by default so again
you don't need to worry about doing
anything and you don't even need to
worry about including anything in the
module file here typically when when
we've been using pages in the past like
we are with homepage still here we need
to import it and then add it to
declarations and entry components now
you don't need to do any of that at all
you don't need to add anything through
the output module or PS file so right
now you can just start using the page as
soon as you generate it
and so if I jump into every component
file here you can see we've set up the
route pages home page which is the
default and of course we have the import
there our importing home page and using
it as the root page there now the weird
thing with lazy loading now with that
new ionic page we don't need to import
the page in here either instead what we
can do is just reference it directly
just by supplying a string that matches
the the class name so class here is
called second so all I need to do is say
root page equals second in as a string
and then that's all we need to do so if
I save that and jump back into the
browser we should see I need to service
again actually but we should see that
the root page will change from our home
page to the new second page that we
generated and you can see here that that
page has been successfully set up now as
the root page the second page but you
know we haven't imported it into our
module file we haven't imported in here
all we do is just reference its name and
that's all we need to do so we get the
benefit of lazy loading but I think this
is also a really nice way to work with
new pages it saves a lot of work and
setting things up so I'm going to change
that back to home page for now and if
you wanted to you can go and modify our
home page to do the same thing you just
need to include a whole module PS file
make sure you add the ionic page there
and then just make sure you're
referencing
referencing it as a string and not
importing it and using it that way but
we're not going to worry about that in
this video so the important thing to
note though is that you do have to
reference it as a string everywhere now
so even in things like when you're using
the nav controller if we were to push
that second page we again just refer to
it as a string so I'm going to do that
here I'm going to push a new page I'm
going to add a button into our home page
here and it's going to call that open
second page
and so that's going to trigger a
function in here and then we're just
going to have this push that second page
so all we need to do is get this nav
controller push and usually again we'd
import the second page up here and then
we'd supplied as a second but instead
now we just apply it as a string and we
don't need to worry about importing it
so now if I go into the application
again I should be able to click that
button and it's going to push that page
for us okay so if I click this button
now we have the second page pop up so
that's basically how pages work now and
by using a method you're going to have
lazy loading included and you probably
gonna have an easier time setting up
pages and pushing them like this as well
and so one more thing I do want to cover
quickly is a little bit on the deep
linking so if you notice now when I
click this let me just go back here and
if we look at the URL now there's
nothing they're just like you know
they're just like normal that's just the
home page of our application but as we
navigate through the application usually
that just stays the same but now if we
click this having included that ionic
page decorator now we had this we had
this URL at the top which includes our
page here and so this is the deep
linking that I was talking about so it
helps to refresh this page now usually
when we restart the application it would
go back to the home page but since I
included that in the URL it loads
directly to the second page and then if
I were to get rid of that it had load
the root page again and so that's quite
a bit of configuration you can do with
this and I'm not going to get into all
of that in this video but I also want to
point out that you can send data from
one page to the next so if you've got
that sort of master detail pattern set
up you might want to pass and data
through the next page and then you may
also want to have people be able to
access that page directly by deep
linking so we can use this property here
called segment
the segment which you can add to the the
ionic page decorated here and that's
going to specify what that path is going
to be in the URL but you can also supply
some dynamic data to that so let's say
if I wanted to pass in will use the
example of an ID so if i've set in the
ionic page decorator here i set segment
and we'll just use ii as we already work
but then we'll add a colon and then the
data we're going to try to pass in so
we'll use ID so now if i were to jump
back into where we're pushing that page
so we'll go back to the home file and as
usual we can push some data with the
page push if we want to grab that with
nav params in the the second page and
then we can just apply that ID as i'll
just give this an ID of at for and right
now this is limited to strings you can't
extend an entire object through the URL
using deep linking right now so if i
save that and we will come into here and
we'll just log that value out as well so
good console dot log this don't know
pram stop get ID so save that and we'll
jump back into the browser
so we're back on the home page here and
if i click the click me link you can see
we get our four log down here which
you'd expect because we're grabbing that
through the nav brands but if you look
in the URL at the top you can also see
that it says forward slash four and so
if i were to reflect a refresh the page
now using that URL it should load back
up on that same page and we should still
be able to grab that for there and you
can see that we can so you don't need to
use deep linking in your application if
you don't want to if you're just
building a normal i OS or android app
then maybe don't really need deep
linking
if you're building Saint progressive
where that sign is going to be hosted on
the web you could potentially benefit
from that URL structure and being able
to link to specific pages so that's most
of what you're not going to notice I
guess is a new in high oleic 3 there's
certainly more to both of those concepts
that I've talked about but I just wanted
to briefly cover those give you a sort
of high-level overview of what they are
and how they work so that they don't
seem so foreign when you come across
them in your application so I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
