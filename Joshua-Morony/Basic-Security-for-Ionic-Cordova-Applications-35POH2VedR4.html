some basic security ideas for ionic and
Cordova applications
I just recently wrote a blog post on
this which is going to be released today
actually so by the time this video is up
it would already be up so I'll link to
that but I want to cover couple the same
points in this video but sort of talk
about them a little bit and maybe expand
expand upon those just a little bit so I
think ionic and Cordova are great in the
sense that they allow developers to
create applications with with web tech
which means a lot more people can create
apps it's a lot easier to start
developing an application and
technologies you're familiar with like
HTML CSS and JavaScript without having
to learn si Objective C or Java and
learning how to get the SDK set up and
all those sorts of things so it's great
that allows sort of newer developers to
build mobile applications at but at the
same time there's also a lot of security
concerns when it comes to mobile
applications and some newer developers
might not understand what those are so I
just wanted to talk through a few points
of things that I feel are important
things to know to some basic things that
will help make sure your applications
more secure of course security in itself
is a huge topic and making an
application truly secure is a very hard
task but we can at least make sure we're
not making these sort of common mistakes
and now I'm no security expert my self
so I'm definitely not an authority on
this subject I took a basic computer
security course in university but apart
from that everything is just things I've
needed to learn as I've been building
applications so
I'm only gonna stick to the basics here
so I remember taking a topic on business
law in university and started the course
where they said to us was that you know
we're not here to teach you the law
we're just here to teach you enough so
that you know when you need to go seek
help and so I think of security and the
same sort of sense for developers that
you don't need to know everything there
is to know about security before making
an application if you're creating an
application that involves some kind of
authentication process you don't need to
understand every single thing there is
to know about authentication before you
can build it but what you do need to
know is you need to know enough so that
you know when to ask for help so if you
are building a login system and you
don't really understand how you should
store the user's password and you know
that that's you know important thing
then you'll know that I need to go get
help to design this now I shouldn't just
do this thing myself and of course some
applications don't really have those
security concerns if you're just
creating some kind of calculator app for
example it's not you know going to
really have to worry about people
hacking in and messing with people's
calculators so much so the first point I
wanna make on ionic and Cordova
application specifically is that you
should treat the code like it's a public
website and high onic application is a
website it's a website that runs inside
of the Cordova shell and it's made to
look like a like a mobile app but it is
still a website it has an index.html
file it runs JavaScript CSS HTML code so
it is a website I think the issue comes
from that since we are packaging it with
Cordova that people assume that nobody
is going to be able to look at their
code it's it's packaged up into this
application that submitted through app
stores so people think they can
put things in there in the codebase and
not have to worry about people poking
around in there but that's not the case
though it's actually quite easy for
people to inspect your application and
look at the code that is running the
application so that patient CSS and
JavaScript code and so it is it's
possible to say minify that code and
obfuscate it using uglify or something
like that to make it harder for people
to read but in the end they can still
read it and they can still
reverse-engineer if they really wanted
to so if you think of sites like
Facebook or any web site on the Internet
you can just go right click and go to
inspect element and look at all of their
their client-side code now this isn't a
security concern people don't worry
about hiding their code from people or
running it through uglify most of the
time it doesn't matter if people can
view this code we just need to make sure
that we're not storing any kind of
sensitive data or code on on the
client-side so when you're building
mobile apps with the ionic just sort of
ask yourself as you're doing sine would
would this be safe to do on a public
website and if the answers yes then it's
probably fine to do in the application
as well if the answer's no anything you
probably shouldn't do it so following on
from the the last point if we can't do
secure things in our application code
how do we do them you can do that by
moving any sort of sensitive operations
to a server as I say if you had some
kind of secret keys for an API or you
had some kind of commercially sensitive
logic that you're running maybe you've
got some patented code that it does some
special operation that you don't want
people to be able to access you can just
move that to some secured server and
then you can interact with that through
an API so rather than running that code
directly on the device just make a
request to the server the server a
handle is doing whatever it needs to do
and then it can send the result back
to the client you should pretty much
always communicate over HTTP now most
people will be familiar with HTTP and
HTTPS HTTP is sort of the standard
hypertext Transfer Protocol and the S
stands for secure or over secure socket
layer and so by using urls that include
HTTP we're able to securely communicate
the huddle between the client and the
recipient or the sender and the
recipient so when you send some data
using this format the only people that
can decrypt the data that is being sent
is the person who who receives it the
problem with HTTP is that when you're
sending the data it can be intercepted
just like it could be intercepted with
HTTPS but when you're not securing that
with that encryption people can then
read what is being sent and they can
even modify it before it reaches its
target so in general it's just better to
use HTTPS but especially when you're
sending sensitive data so if you're
sending login information is a good
example you definitely want to do that
over HTTPS if you were to send it to
your server over just plain HTTP people
could intercept that on its way to the
server and they could just view the
login details that someone's just
entered into your form so yes you should
always use HTTPS you should also not
store at least think about how you're
storing data in local storage especially
a sensitive data so a local storage in
itself is not insecure and it's fine to
store things in local storage but if you
want to store sensitive information in
there there is the possibility that it
could be stolen so in order to steal
data from local storage it's not just
something that's sort of publicly
accessible that people can easily steal
but if an attacker has say physical
access to the device or they manage to
exploit some other kind of vulnerability
like using cross-site scripting they may
be able to steal values that are in
local
storage and to say if you were storing
some kind of secret spy messages in
local storage that's something you might
want to try to eliminate the possibility
of so it's kind of I guess up to you to
decide what kind of information you want
to store in local storage but under no
circumstances should you ever store
login credentials in local storage and
you should never store user's password
anywhere except as a hashed version on
your on your server it just creates an
unnecessary vulnerability and it is
irresponsible in a way to do that many
people do use the same passwords on
multiple different sites so if your site
is kind of the weak link in the chain
they can have that password stolen and
then be exploited in other ways of
course it'll be good if people did use
different passwords for everything but
that's not the case that we do need to
take a lot of care when dealing with a
user's password now people often want to
create some kind of functionality where
they can remember a user and log them
back into the application automatically
and a lot of people sort of jump to the
conclusion that they can store that
password in local storage and then
access it later and use that to
reauthorize the user rather than the
user having to enter in their password
again so of course this sort of opens up
this unnecessary sort of vulnerability
and and I guess people then sort of go
to the next assumption that well why
don't we just encrypt it then and then
if the data gets stolen from local
storage and it's not going to matter so
much the problem is that there is
difference between encryption and
hashing and you never want to encrypt a
user's password yet I only ever want to
hash it now the difference between
encryption and hashing is that
encryption is a two-way process you can
encrypt something and then you can
decrypt it later and so that's the kind
of idea people are trying to use here
where they will encrypt it store it and
local storage decrypt it and use it for
authentication later but the problem
with that is that it is decrypted so if
you can decrypt something and so could
an attacker and then they can get the
users original password
with hashing it says one-way process so
once you have al you there's no way to
turn it back into the original value
theoretically and at least that depends
on the strength of the hashing algorithm
that's being used but that's the idea so
the only thing that should ever be done
is storing a hashed version of the
password on the server and then when a
user logs in you hash their password
attempt and compare that compare that to
the hashed version in in on the server
in the database or wherever that hashed
version is being stored if you do want
to create some kind of remember me
functionality where the user doesn't
have to log in every time they open your
application you should use some kind of
token like a like a JSON web token which
will allow you to identify the user and
log them in automatically
but it doesn't involve having to store
the password in the application so the
next point is that you should consider
using an authentication service if
you're not very familiar with
authentication you should be able to at
least tell from what we've been talking
about that it's a hard it's a hard topic
it's hard thing to do not only because
of the concern concerns all of which you
know we may not even know about it's
also very hard to implement in itself
you have to handle the registration
process the login process forgotten
passwords sending emails with the
Forgotten password links and stuff like
that so it's a big process and there's a
lot of services out there that do it for
you where you can use the various social
login providers like Facebook Twitter
github which provide a sort of basic
authentication that you can use if you
just need to authenticate a user
Abbadon there's also back-end as the
service solutions available like
firebase that handle the login for you
and sort of handle the entire back-end
of your application as well and ionic
earth is also a good solution for this
ionic OAuth is the authentication
service provided by ionic and
so this allows you to authenticate a
user if you want you can even integrate
it into your own server
a lot of the time when we we create a
server up at home with doing some kind
of special logic on the server or
something where you know we need to hit
our server at some point but then by
using some external authentication
service then we're not no longer going
through our own server so we can't do
those things as with ionic earth we can
just integrate it directly into our own
server so that ionic can handle the
authentication side of things for us but
we can still do things on our own server
as well and the last point I want to
make is to beef up your content security
policy so I've pasted an example here
that I typically use for development by
default so it's good for development
because it's very permissive but it's
very bad for production so this is the a
little tag that we put in the index dot
HTML file which which specifies what
kind of code or resources can be
included in the page and what can be
executed how it can be executed stuff
like that so it's a it's a security
policy for the content of the
application but the problem with the
policy I have here is that it is very
permissive and it'll allow it'll allow
things like the execution of JavaScript
code like eval it all out in line
execution of JavaScript so it will allow
the attaching of say an on click handler
to a button it can load images from any
domain rather than just perhaps my
specific domain so in general this
content security policy makes it easier
for attackers to exploit any
vulnerabilities so if they someone did
somehow manage to inject some code into
my application then this content
security policy would allow that to run
whereas if I had this a more strict
content security policy as a sort of
backup even if someone did manage to say
exploit some specific vulnerability and
injected in some JavaScript code into
the application
through you know an on-click event or
something like that this content
security policy would block that from
running so it's a good idea to make your
content security policy as strict as
possible yeah but that's going to depend
on what exactly your application does
you probably do a little bit of research
to figure out the best content security
policy for your application but it's
definitely something worth spending a
little bit of time on okay so I hope you
got a little bit out of this video this
is only sort of scratching the surface
of security concerns when it comes to
mobile applications but hopefully it's
at least a decent introduction to some
of the concepts and perhaps some things
that you can go and implement in your
own applications as well okay so I hope
you enjoyed this quick little
presentation and I'll see you in the
next video tutorial
