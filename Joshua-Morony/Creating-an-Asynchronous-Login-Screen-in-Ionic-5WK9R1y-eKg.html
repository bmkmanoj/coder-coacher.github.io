build an asynchronous login screen with
ionic 2 so quite often when you're
building a mobile application you have a
login screen and you'll have your main
page and usually what you want to do is
if somebody has already logged into your
application before and you have some way
of checking that authentication you
don't want to send them to the login
screen again when they open your app say
for the second time you want to send
them straight into the main application
so we're going to walk through how you
can set up process where you can do that
so as always we're going to start off by
generating a new ionic to your
application so we're going to run ionic
start and let's call this one async
login I will just use the blank template
and make sure to supply the v2 flag to
generate an ionic 2 application so we'll
let that run okay so that's finished
generating now I know we're just going
to switch into that project and we're
going to generate a login page so by
default the blank template that were
using only has a home page which we're
going to use for our the main part of
our application and so we also want to
generate a login page that we're going
to send users to the first time they
open the application but not on
subsequent visits so we're not going to
be coding that particular logic in this
tutorial we're just going to walk
through how to actually do the process
of checking something as seeing if
they're allowed to access the main
application and then switch into that
view perhaps in a different tutorial
cover how you might actually go about
storing whether or not a user should be
authenticated so we're going to generate
that login page by running ionic G page
login
and once that is generated we're also
going to generate a provider and this
provider is going to be what we're going
to use to check for authentication so
it's just going to be a fake login check
basically we're going to create a set
timeout it's going to wait for 3 seconds
and then tell us whether or not the user
should be authenticated and real well to
know you would of course check on some
server that's actually checking their
credentials so we're just going to run
ioniq G provider forth
so now we have everything that we need
setup we're going to open up the project
and get to work I've got the project
open now and the first thing we're going
to look at is the the route component
for the application which is in the app
folder here so app dot component es so
you can see here it's setting up the
home page as the root page so that means
when we start the application that's
what's going to get loaded first so what
we want to do is add some kind of check
in here that will say whether we should
go to the home page first or whether we
should go to the login page but before
we get to that we're going to do a few
other things first since we've generated
this new page here as you can see on the
Left we've got the login page we
generated and we also have the auth
provider so to be able to use those
we're going to have to set them up in
the app module ts file so we have to
import both of those here so I'm going
to import the login page first
and also the author Ivana that we
generated now that I want to meet dots
just there the login page is going to
need to be added to the declarations
array and also to the entry components
array and the author provider that we
created needs to be added to providers
and so now that setup and we can use
that wherever we need to in the
application so let's just serve our
application now or run ionic serve and
see what we have so far this is what our
application looks like right now so it's
just that homepage and it was
automatically generated and that's
what's being loaded the login page
hasn't been added at all here
so what we want to do now is work on
that root component and add in that
check to see whether we should go to the
home page or to the login page so I'm
actually going to jump into the provider
first and we're going to set this up to
create a fake login check for us so
we're going to add a function here
called login and that's going to return
a promise
and we're just going to use a set
timeout yeah
and that timeouts going to resolve with
truth to indicate that the user is
logged in and that's going to happen
after that say three seconds so we put
3,000 milliseconds there so this is a an
asynchronous function here when logging
is called it creates this promise it's
going to do that check which in this
case is just all it does is return true
result it makes the promise resolve with
the true usually here is where you would
instead hit your server with a HTTP
request or something like that it would
do the check on the server to see if the
users authenticated then return that
value but all interested in is creating
that process that allows us to switch
pages so we just want something that
will wait for a few seconds to simulate
doing something and then give us our
answer so now that we have that we can
jump back into our route component and
we're going to need to import the login
page in here as well
and we're also going to import that
fourth provider so even though we've set
these up it should be providers fourth
even though we've set these up already
in the module file we still need to
import them where we want to use them so
we've got a root page set to homepage
which is fine for now we'll leave that
as is but we're going to add that check
in here for whether or not the user is
authenticated so we're going to inject
our earth provider will just call it
forth and then we're going to run this
fourth dot login which is that function
we just created here and then once that
promise resolves which we can handle
with then we can get the result from
that which we'll just call is logged in
and then depending on what that value is
we want to either go to the parent page
or to the login page
so we'll say if is logged in we want to
go to the home page so we set the root
page home page otherwise we'll go to the
login page
and we don't want this to be homepage by
default we don't want it to be anything
just yet so we're just going to give
that a type of any so we're going to
sign any type of data to it and we're
going to wait and see what happens with
this login call before we set anything
they used to be that this didn't work
this way if you didn't set the root page
immediately and instead relied on some
asynchronous function like this the root
page wouldn't be set in time and it
would cause issues so what happens here
as we're going through this function
here the app's loading in it makes is
called the login function which is
asynchronous because we're relying on a
promise here so it doesn't just stop
here wait to find out what the answer to
this is and then set the root page and
then continue instead it makes that it
makes a call to this function that gets
scheduled for later and basically when
when this time to perform that check it
will happen otherwise the application
will just keep running through whatever
code there is but it seems now that
ionic does allow you to do it in this
way you can just change this root page
variable and it will change to whatever
page you want so this is okay to do now
but we don't want to set that home page
initially otherwise it's going to
display the home page first and then
it's going to switch instead we just
want to display a blank page wait and
then display either the home page or the
login page now this is going to look
it's not gonna look the best we'll take
a look at what it looks like so I'll
save that and we'll jump back into the
browser now we have a error looks like
go forgotten something
in this um fourth provider should have
returned new promise I'll save that
hopefully that fixes that problem
okay that seems to be working now I'll
just refresh that again so you can see
what actually happened so I'll refresh
the page and it's kind of just white for
a little while it's completely blank and
then the home page pops in that's
because we have this returning true if
we were to return false instead to
indicate the user is not logged in it
should take us to the login page instead
and it does the problem with that is it
doesn't look very good it looks like a
apps just taking a really long time to
load that call to the server took what
the simulated call to the server took
three seconds and the point is that it
doesn't look very good
it looks like the app slow and that's
not going to be a good user experience
so we want indicate to the user that
something is happening here and to do
that we're going to make use of ionics
loading overlay so if I jump into the
documentation here go into components
and you'll find this loading component
so what this does I think I can show you
on the example here so it just pops up
an overlay that indicates of science
loading science happening and this
blocks user interaction which means they
have to wait they can't interact with
the app while it's happening which in
this case is what we want so I'm just
going to import the loading controller
into the root component here and I'm
also going to set that up and inject it
into the constructor
and I'm also going to take the example
function they have their present loading
which handles creating the loading
overlay instead of just creating a local
reference to it here with let I want to
control when that loading overlays
hidden through the constructor here so
instead we're going to create another
variable for a loader and instead we're
going to set this loader equals the
loading overlay that we're creating and
then we'll so call the stat loaded up
present there and this will allow us to
control when to hide it so we don't want
to automatically hide it after three
seconds there so we'll get rid of that
and instead in this function here when
this promise resolves then we want to
hide the overlay so we save this don't
loader that's the dismiss and when
that's triggered the loading overlay
will disappear so let's save that now
and we'll see what it looks like
of course nothing happens because I
didn't actually make it cool to present
loading yet let me just do that before
we call the promise so we'll do this you
want to pop that up right away I'll call
this dot present loading save that and
now let's try it again
okay so we have the loading overlay pop
up right away sirs please wait and then
we go to the login page and we'll change
that to something like authenticating
which more accurately represents what is
happening now we'll change that back to
true to indicate a successful login take
a look at what happens
so the authenticating overlay pops up
and then we go straight to the logged in
view and refresh it again so you can see
from the start what happens overlay pops
up right away logged in view so that's a
pretty nice transition from
authentication to the logged in view or
to the login view as opposed to just
displaying a blank page where the user
doesn't know what's happening if you
would like alternatively you could you
could add some styling to your app maybe
so it's not a white page you might want
to have a picture in the background so
it's kind of like a splash screen or you
could even if you like and in here set
that root page by default to be the
login page so then that's going to
display that in the background
whilst it's authenticating and then go
to the appropriate page so if I save
that and take a look
you can see the login page is already in
the background there whilst it's
authenticating and if it's logged in it
switches to the main page but if the
user wasn't authenticated then it would
just stay on that login page so that's
another way you could do it if you
prefer if you think ad that looks better
okay so that's it for this tutorial I
hope that you enjoyed this one and
that's a reasonably clear and
straightforward process for
authenticating users and automatically
logging them into your application thank
you for watching and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
