video to show you guys the ionic creator
it's a lot easier to see there's new
videos it's very visual it's a app made
by the awning team which is basically a
drag-and-drop editor for creating ionic
applications to create an account you
can just come to created on ik dot IO
company's page and click sign up but
since I'm already a member and it's
going to log in now so when you first
come into the ionic crater you'll see a
page like this very empty at the moment
so over here I'll be able to manage all
the pages that I have set up in my
application and there's a few options
here by default so I can rename that to
my app and I can even specify a routing
URL as well which will affect the code
when you export the application I'm just
going to leave that blank for now and
there's a few more options here
scrolling header margin that sort of
stuff
with a cool stuff it is the components
over here so I can drag and drop any of
these onto my application here if I want
a button bar across the top I can put
that in there I can then come in and
change what the values these are are
it's called an button one button two
because I'm really uncreated um and you
can also even link these to another page
which I'll do in a little bit um you've
got all this sort of typical components
you'd expect from an ionic application
down here we can create forms by
dropping in a form component there and
then I can also throw some inputs and
stuff like that in there the Anna credit
is doesn't a bit buggy at the moment it
is still in beta so it's definitely not
perfect but it is pretty cool
dropped an input in there I can set that
to be say an email input supplied
placeholder so I push the example
example comm you don't really need to
fill in all this stuff but it is a great
tool for getting quick sort of mock-ups
of your applications maybe to show to
clients um as wireframes and of course
there's other elements we can put in it
too let's grab a list if I can find that
here it is so I've created a list there
and then I can put items into that list
if I want to add more onto there I can
again edit the content of each of these
items and I can even do some cool stuff
like throwing in an item thumbnail here
so then that gives us a little display
picture next to it and we can even
change that image by specifying
something here so I could just link to
something to placeholder for now 100 and
that'll throw that image in there and
again you can change the content we can
put an item divider down below that
again doing some more cool stuff then I
could grab one of these HTML elements
here and just shove that in there I can
add in some custom hey shell so you can
do quite a lot with this you make some
pretty complex you eyes and as well as
that you can also create from as some
defaults that they supply as well so if
I click the add page up here there's not
many but they do supply a few basic
templates you can use like the log in
modal side menu tabs
I have tried using tabs before and it
does seem a bit glitchy and hard to use
but I'm just going to create something
like a login screen here and so now I'm
going to show you how we can go about
linking pages together so if I click on
that login button now I can then link
that to the other page I created at
least I think I can
my login okay I couldn't actually add
that cuz I didn't put the routing girl
in the other page here so I gave it a
routing euro of main and I can jump back
into our login screen and now I can link
that to my main page so now I've got
that set up I can switch this over to a
test up in the top right corner and then
we can actually see what the application
does when you interact with it
so I should be able to type some stuff
in here and then click that login button
it'll take me to my other screen that I
created and I can interact with it I
made it scroll a ball so I can move it
around if I linked these buttons to
anything that would then go to whatever
page I linked it to hit back will take
you back to the login screen so you can
set up these sort of basic UI is going
to linking together I found that the
code that it does create that you do
export in the end isn't probably the
best amount of me that usable but
certainly the UI portions of it a big
time-saver if I want to then say export
this now I can go up and hit this button
it gives me three different options to
export this so the easiest is probably
using the ionic command-line interface
you can just like you the start a normal
application you can just specify the ID
of your app in the ionic crater and that
will just download that straight into
your project or into a new project you
can download it as a zip file or you can
even just grab the raw HTML out of here
as well so it's not a I guess that's all
kind of in one file when you download it
you probably want to split this out into
separate files when you're creating an
actual application and the routing as
well might not be exactly how you want
it so what I found it's best to just
take these templates and right here I've
got my
login page I can just grab all that HTML
that's created there and paste that into
my own templates file and use that
rather than having to manually create my
own templates so I think that's really
handy I think this could be really
awesome
once it's had a bit more work done on it
it's a bit buggy right now but I think
there's a lot of potential to be a
really cool tool for our NIC developers
to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
