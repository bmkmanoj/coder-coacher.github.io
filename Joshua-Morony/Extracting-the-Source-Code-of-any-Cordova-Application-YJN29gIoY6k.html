to view the source code of any Cordova
application on the App Store now if
you're not already familiar Cordova is
what we use in ionic applications and
other front-end frameworks for mobile
apps to kind of wrap it in this native
shell that allows us to submit it to app
stores and also access native API s now
because it is being wrapped in this sort
of native shell and being submitted to
an app store people tend to think that
their code is protected that people
won't be able to see the source code for
their application this isn't the case so
it's actually quite easy to fall for
anyone to view the source code of your
application and so in this video I'm
going to show you how to do that
so you can see how easy it is and
hopefully reshape the way that you might
think about building these applications
and I released a video recently where I
talked about some of these security
concerns and I made the point that when
building Cordova applications you should
treat your code as if you are building
just a normal website so you should
never submit any kind of sensitive
information to the App Store that should
never be contained within your app
itself so of course like a view the
source code for any websites like
Facebook or Gmail or whatever I can just
you inspect element in the browser and
take a look at their front-end code now
you're not going to find any sensitive
information in there any sensitive
information is going to be installed on
the server or something like that and so
it's the same thing with ionic
applications or any Cordova applications
if you have some sensitive information
or API keys or things like that
you shouldn't embed them into your
application you should instead store
them on a server for example and then
you could interface with that through
your application so just as an example
what I've done is I've downloaded an app
called untap and this is a pretty
popular app and it's basically like a
social network for beer drinking but it
was made with ionic so I thought it'd be
a good example to do
I can't remember if it's arnoquon ionic
- but doesn't really matter the point is
that we'll be able to extract the source
code and I hope the people who made
untap don't mind me poking around in
their application of it so basically
what we can do is obviously I'm on a Mac
here I've got iTunes installed and
before I started this video I downloaded
I'm tapped through iTunes so now I'll be
able to go to my iTunes folder and I'll
be able to see that IPA file which is
the the natively built file we get from
Cordova I'll be able to see that on my
computer and I'll be able to do some
stuff with that so if I navigate now
this may be slightly different on your
computer hopefully it's not too
different but you could probably Google
where you can find the IPA file but in
my case I can go to my music folder and
then there's a folder called iTunes and
inside of here we have we have another
folder called iTunes media so go into
that and then inside of here we have a
folder called mobile applications and so
again I'll change to that and this is
where we will find the untapped IPA so
go untapped 3.0 put five - I PA so
that's the the native shell that's mean
you know the app has been built with
Cordova and that's the resulting file
that ends up getting submitted to the
App Store so if we open up my browser
here and we'll take a look at it and so
it's just this one file right so that's
probably why people you know assume that
you can't really do anything with this
nobody's going to be able to view your
source code but what you can quite
easily do is I'll just make a copy of
this and I'll just rename it from DNA to
dot zip and to say use zip and that's
changing the file format so now I'm
going to be able to extract everything
that's in there
so if I double click this now it's going
to extract everything and now if I click
on that I can see a few things in here
have some just meta metadata files and
then we have the payload of the
application which is the application
itself
now you still can't see too much with
this it's just this weird file that we
can't immediately or obviously do
anything with but if you right-click on
this and go to show package contents now
we can see everything that is contained
inside the application so you can see or
the app icons here all the different
splash screens and more importantly we
have dww folder which is the I guess the
compiled source code for the application
so if we click on to that we can see
various assets in here this is just to
add the default sort of ionic icon there
that's probably not even being used we
have some images that will be being used
throughout the application and if we
come into the J's file and all the J's
file sorry add the build file this is
where the main code for the application
is so we have the JavaScript file and
the CSS file so I'm just going to open
this up now and it's going to take few
seconds because it is going to be a
massive file as you'll notice this isn't
like the AC original source code of the
application if you if you use ionic
obviously you have your your pages
folder you've got individual pages set
up a type script and everything's all
nice and organized that code isn't
included in the IPA package what we have
is the final compiled code so we don't
actually use typescript in the end that
typescript the typescript files get
converted into es5 javascript everything
is kind of minified so you get something
that looks like this so it's not like
someone's just going to be able to kind
of just copy and paste your application
and steal all your hard work although
technically this would run that way but
it's all just if anyone wanted to make
changes to this it would be very very
hard to do but this is still the source
code of the application so
if I had stored rather the untapped
people had stored say some secret API
keys that people aren't supposed to know
about in here I could probably search
through this file and find those and
then use that to hack into whatever it
is that they're using or perhaps you
know maybe have some kind of secret
business logic some kind of algorithm
that you're using that you've you know
you've worked on for a year and it's
your painted technology and if that was
contained in your application then
people could reverse-engineer that it's
very hard obviously to work with this
but it's possible and there are tools
that help reverse engineer things like
this so again if you want something to
be secure if you don't want people
poking around with it just make sure
that you basically is offload that work
to the server and then interact that
interact with that through an API if
it's sitting on a server somewhere
assuming the server is secure nobody's
going to be able to look at that you can
try and so I guess encrypt and uglify
your code as much as you want but in the
end if someone's I guess dedicated
enough it is possible for them to
reverse engineer that and look at it in
the way that I'm looking at it now so I
just wanted to do this video to assure
you how trivial it is to poke around in
the source code of an application like
this even if it's just from the iOS App
Store directly it's not too hard to do
and that's not a it's not a concern it's
not a thing that I consider to be bad
about building with Cordova it's just
something you need to know and make sure
that you structure your applications in
a way that that's not going to be an
issue ok so thanks for watching this
video and I'll see you on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
