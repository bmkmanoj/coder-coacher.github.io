implement a side menu in ionic 2 I'm
also going to talk about how to
highlight a specific menu item based on
page the user is currently on to do this
we're going to use the default side menu
template that ionic 2 provides so we're
going to talk through how that works how
the menu works in general and then we're
going to get into implementing this
active highlighting feature so to start
off with we're just going to generate a
new ionic 2 application using the ionic
start command and we're going to call
this one ionic 2 side menu highlights
and as I mentioned we're going to use
the side menu template that ionic 2
provides through the command line
interface and make sure also to supply
the V 2 flag too so that we generate a V
2 project and we'll just let that
generate now okay so that's finished
generating now so I'm going to change
into that project
and I'm just going to serve it now so we
can take a look at what we have to work
with so far okay so this is the app
that's automatically generated for us we
just have a page here and then we have a
side menu already set up so you can
click on this menu toggle button here
and you can see we've got page 1 and
page 2 setup so that's all automatically
generated for us and so what we're going
to do is of course explain how this menu
works and how you could modify that but
also we're going to make it so that when
I click on page 2 page 2 is going to
remain highlighted you can see when I
click it there it turns gray so we want
to make it so it stays gray for as long
as they're in page 2 and when they go to
page 1 that's going to be highlighted
instead so I'm going to open up the
project and sublime nil and we'll get to
work okay so I've got the project opened
now we're going to start off by looking
at the inside the app folder this is
where the side menu gets set up in the
root component of the application and
the the template for that here so as you
can see we've got a bunch of code here
generated already that's making that
menu work for us so we'll start off
explaining
the template here so we've got the ion
nav down here which if you're familiar
with the normal structure of an ionic 2
project you'll see this in in every
application you build so this sets up
the route page which links in here you
can see we set up the route page as page
1 so that's going to be the first page
of the user sees but then we also have
this ion menu component set up which we
don't usually have and so how this works
is basically we're just using the ion
menu component using iron menu tag and
then we set up this content property on
that component and so if you look down
here you can see we've set up a
reference to content here so this menu
is referencing this ion nav because
that's where the main content for
application is and that's what we're
attaching this menu to
and then inside of the iron menu here
this is the the content for our menu and
so you can see we creating a two buttons
now using this ng four here so this is
looping over an array of pages that we
have defined in the app component es
file and for each of those pages it's
creating a button and it's going to
trigger this open page function so if I
jump back into the app component es file
now you can see that this is where those
are that page array pages array is
defined so we've got two objects in this
array page 1 and page 2 so we've got the
title of the page and then the component
of that page is using so that's page 1
and page 2 setup as the components here
so that's just like how we assign page 1
as a root page here we need a reference
to that component if we want to set it
as the as the page that we're currently
viewing and that's what this open page
function does so using the set root
function and we are just grabbing that
component property from the page in that
array so when someone clicks on one of
these buttons that are getting generated
from that pages array it's going to pass
in a reference to the the current page
to this open page function and that that
page is going to get passed through to
here and then we call set root and we
grab the component of that page which
will either be page 1 or page 2 I just
want to point out one more weird thing
here and that's this our pages member
variable we've got set up we have this
weird type defined so that's the type
just like any is a type here but this is
just defining it as specifically as an
array that contains objects that are
made up of a title which is a string and
a component which can be anything so
this is just a really specific type
definition you could easily just have
this as any as well that's not really
important of course there are benefits
to having specific types like this as
well but we're not going to get into
that in this tutorial so now we've gone
through the basics of how and
new works and how we could extend that
you could just easily import page 3 page
4 here add them to that pages array and
they'll get added to the menu what we
want to do now is implement that active
menu highlighting feature and it's going
to be pretty straightforward so what
we're going to do is create another
member variable up here and we're going
to call it active page and we'll just
give that a type of any and what we're
going to do is when we change a page
we're going to set that give page on
this variable we're going to be able to
check against that later so in the open
page function what I want to do now is
also set this start active page to equal
the page that is being passed in so now
when the user changes the page this
active page member variable is going to
get set but we also need to deal with
the case of when they are first in the
application before they've changed the
page we also need to make sure that
active page is set so I'm going to come
in here as well and set the active page
to be the first page in that pages array
and so that's the same one we're setting
up as the root page here is page one so
that's why I'm using that first element
there if we add page two as a root page
then you should put the second element
as the active page instead so now we
have a value variable that stores what
the current active page is so now we
need a way for this menu for the menu
items to make use of that and so what
we're going to do is create a
conditional style that we apply so I'll
create that first so if I jump into the
app dot CSS file I'm just going to
create a class called active highlight
and then we're just going to assign a
background color of whatever the light
color is that is defined in the
variables here in the colors map so
we're going to come in here and just say
map
yet and we're going to get one of the
values from the colors map and we want
that to be the light value so that's
just going to grab this color and if you
prefer you can just as easily set a
color directly here rather than using
that colors map so now we have a class
that we can apply to one of the menu the
buttons in the menu to change their
background color now which will indicate
that they are the active page so now
we're going to have to apply that
conditionally to this button depending
on whether or not that the specific page
is the active one and we're going to do
that by using the following syntax we
can use the property binding syntax here
to conditionally apply that class so
we're going to do class dot active
highlight and I do have a tutorial
another video tutorial on this and I
also have a blog post which I'll link so
if you want to find out more about how
these conditional classes and styles
work you can check that out
so we're going to do for this is assign
that to we're going to use a function
called check active and we'll pass in a
reference to the page there and so what
this is going to do if this evaluates to
be true then that class is going to be
applied if it evaluates to false then
that class won't be applied and so we're
going to pass in a reference to that
specific page to this check active
function and then we're going to figure
out whether or not that page is active
so if I come back into here now I'll
just save that as well so in here we're
going to define that check active
function and we pass in that reference
to the page just like we did with the
open page function and now all I need to
do is check if that page matches up to
the current active page
so I can just return page equals this
don't active page so that's going to
check if the pages passed in matches
this if it does that's going to return
return true if it doesn't it's going to
return false and so that should have the
effect of applying this class
conditionally only if it is the active
page so I'll save that and we'll jump in
to the browser now and see if we haven't
broken everything okay so we have the
uploaded now open up the menu and you
can see very faintly but you can see
that the page one button here has a
light grey background so if I click on
page two now and take a look at it now
h2 has a light grey background and so
it's working basically so whatever page
is currently active is going to have
that light gray background I don't know
how well that's going to show up in the
video so what I might do is instead of
using the light color I'll use the
danger color which is going to be a lot
more obvious
so just repeat that example there open
it up you can see page 1 it's
highlighted I click page 2 that becomes
highlighted click page 1 again it goes
back to that and so that's working okay
so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial if
you didn't already know how to use the
side menu hopefully this helped explain
that and also hopefully found the
information around how to conditionally
apply a class like this to be useful as
well so thanks for watching and I'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
