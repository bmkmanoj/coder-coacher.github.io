how to suffer a really simple
implementation of Google Maps in an
ionic 2 application I have some more
advanced tutorials on some more advanced
setups and configurations for Google
Maps so I'll link to those in the
description if you want to check those
out but this is just going to be a
bare-bones example of getting set up
with Google Maps before I get into it I
want to talk about the difference
between the Google Maps JavaScript SDK
and the native SDKs so what we're
looking at on screen now is the
documentation for the JavaScript SDK and
so that's Maps running through
JavaScript and to run through the
browser but there's also native SDKs
available so that it uses the native
code on the device as well so we can
either use this JavaScript SDK directly
in an ionic 2 application or you can use
a plug-in a Cordova plug-in to use the
native SDK and so if you take a look at
this part of the documentation of ionic
native you can see there's an entry for
Google Maps so you can use this google
apps ionic native service here in
conjunction with the Cordova plug-in to
make implementing that a bit easier so
if you want to use the native SDK you
just have to install this plug-in and
supply your API keys for both Android
and iOS and then there's some
documentation and here about how to
actually create a map now usually I
would advise to use ionic native for
things it makes things a lot easier in
general this is one case where I would
recommend not using the native SDK for
Google Maps now some people may have a
different opinion on this and you may
want to use this in certain
circumstances but in general I think
it's better to use the JavaScript SDK
and instead of the native SDK the
problem with the native SDK is that it
can't run in a browser environment so
when we using the JavaScript SDK ionic 2
application is running through a browser
so
web-based code and so it makes sense is
the JavaScript SDK because that is also
web-based and it integrates nicely with
it
the native SDK isn't web-based it can't
run through a browser so to get it to
work it's basically a little hack the
Cordova plugin will create a native view
behind the webview and it just kind of
makes the browser transparent in the
locations where the native map sets so
you're kind of looking through the
browser into a native element I have a
another tutorial the sort of a little
diagram of this to explain it a bit
better but in the end it's kind of this
hack and it does work but it can make
things really complicated if you wanna
have multiple maps or you want things
just to work the way you'd expect them
to they often don't
when using the native SDK and you end up
implementing a lot of workarounds just
to get things working so I would advise
against using this in by default this is
certain if it's a certain reason that
you want to the native SDK does look a
bit nicer than the JavaScript SDK there
may be specific functionality that you
want to implement that's fine
the mate it may make sense for your
application but just as a default I
would say go with the JavaScript SDK so
to get this set up in application we
have to reference the JavaScript SDK and
they have a example down here just for
setting it up in a normal sort of HTML
environment and you see there's a script
here and so we're going to do is grab
this all we need is this first bit there
is an option for a key here and if you
want to use this sort of in a production
environment and advise generating keys
for Google Maps basically it's a way for
them to track how much you're using how
many times you're seeing their api's and
if you go over certain threshold you're
going to have to pay for that those
thresholds are very high so as far as
development goes you don't need to worry
about hitting those limits but if you
are going to be submitting this to the
App Store it's good to have that in
place in case you do end up
limits and the callback here is just a
function that's going to get called when
the maps are finished loading and so
what I'm going to worry about doing that
in this case like I said I do have a
more advanced example available that
make use of this callback function to do
something when the map finishes loading
but for now we're just going to do
really basic implementation so I'm going
to grab that script there and I'm going
to jump into sublime I've already
generated a application here it's just
based on the blank template so if you
want to code along this generate that
now and then come into the source folder
here and we're just going to add that to
index dot HTML so just put that
underneath the eye on apps there and I
should fill out script tag as well
okay so that's going to load in that
JavaScript SDK into our application now
so before we go any further let's just
serve application so we can see what's
happening is we're coding okay so we
just have our blank application running
now and you can see in the console over
here it's warning us that we haven't got
any API API keys set for Google Maps so
again if you're going to be using this
in a production environment you should
generate those okay so what we're going
to do now is set up the map itself so to
start off with we're going to have to
add a little bit to our template so
we're just going to modify the home
template here and I'm going to get rid
of the padding and we just need to set
up a container that is going to be used
to inject the map into so we'll just
create a div and we're going to create a
local variable called maps that we're
going to reference in our typescript
file which is going to allow us to grab
a reference to that element now we're
also going to need to style this
container later so I'm going to give an
ID so that we can grab that from our CSS
file so that's all we need to do in here
now it's going to jump into the tar
script file and we're going to grab a
reference to that using the view child
so this will allow you to grab a
reference for things in your templates
so you can do the at symbol and view
child and then we can supply that local
variable we created which was mapped and
then we're going to assign this to a
member variable called map element and
then we're going to need to use that
element add to initialize a new map so
what I'm going to do is create an IR
viewdidload hook here now this is going
to trigger as soon as the viewers re and
when that happens we're going to call a
function called init map and we're just
going to define that under here which is
going to contain a code for setting up
the map in a real application and
probably better to separate this out
into its own
right there just for simplicity's sake
I'm just going to do it all in here so
first we need to create a latitude and
longitude that we want to display so
we're going to create a variable for
that and I've just got a some values
here that will center on Adelaide which
is my home town so I'm just going to use
those but you can use whatever values
your life you can even use see the
geolocation service to grab the users
current coordinates so you can Center it
on the users current location and again
that's something that I have covered in
those other tutorials I mentioned so we
need to do new Google Maps lat/long and
then we dis apply the latitude and
longitude values and we're also going to
define some map options which is just
going to tell the SDK how we want to
configure this map so we're going to set
the center of the map to that a latitude
and longitude we just created we're
going to set the zoom level to 15 I'm
also going to set the type of map we
want so if we do a map type ID we can
say that either say satellite or a road
map so if we want to just use a normal
Road map we can do Google Maps dot map
type ID dot Road map and now we can
create the map itself so I'm going to
add another member variable here to hold
a reference to that and then we're going
to define it on this dot map I'm going
to make that equal new Google Maps dot
map and then we need to supply the
element that we want to create it on
which is this dot map element which we
grabbed a reference job here and we want
the actual element itself which we can
access through native element and then
we just need to supply the map options
as well so save that and we'll see what
happens and we are we should get an
error so you can see here it's saying
cannot find name Google
so included.this a JavaScript SDK we're
loading it in and we're trying to access
this Google object that it makes
available but typescript doesn't know
about that to touch if there's things
we've just written this Google thing and
it has no idea what it is and it things
we've made some kind of mistake
it's warning us about that to fix that
we need to add the the types for Google
so a quick workaround that you can do is
you can just say declare bar Google to
solve any sort of type issues like that
but it's the more proper way to do it
would be to install the actual types
themselves so if I bring up as the
terminal here and I'll just exit out of
that now if I run npm install type
Google Maps save so this will install
the types for Google Maps so that type
trip knows what is google object is so
I'll run that and we'll serve it again
okay so I was running with that issue
now we've got the application loaded and
it's not complaining about Google
anymore but the obvious problem now is
that we don't have any kind of map and
we should the reason we can't see
anything is just because the we don't
have the right styling setup here so if
I just try and find the map you can see
that it's currently it's got a width of
375 but it's got a height of 0 as of
course we're not going to be able to see
it so let's quickly give that a height
in here you can see the map starting to
show that so what we need to do is give
that style in our home a CSS file we're
going to hook into that map ID we
created earlier and to set height to
100% and width 200 percent
so now you can see that the map is under
some height now and we can see
everything so as I mentioned it's
centered around Adelaide and so I can do
the Google map see stuff now
zoom out scroll around I can even switch
between map and satellite and so now you
can just do whatever you need to do with
that map so you can you can add markers
to it you can go to locations everything
that you expect Google Maps to be able
to do you can do it through ionic - I'm
not going to get into that now I'm going
to end the tutorial there but if you
come into the Java SDK documentation
here you go to find examples on how to
do just about everything so you can use
this to figure out what you need to do
and I also have a few tutorials as I
mentioned I cover things like markers
marker clustering and a few more things
as you can check out my tutorials as
well which are specific to ionic 2 but
again it doesn't matter it's just the
JavaScript SDK so there's no difference
between doing this and a normal webpage
or doing it in a mounting - okay so I
hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
