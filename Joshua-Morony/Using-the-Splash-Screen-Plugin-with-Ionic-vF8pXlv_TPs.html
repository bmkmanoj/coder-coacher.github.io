to use the splash screen plugin to kind
of take a little bit more control of
your splash screen in your applications
so if you're not already aware a splash
screen is the image that displays for a
few seconds when you first launch an
application from your phone so generally
that's just perhaps your company's logo
or something like that and the idea I
think behind the splash screens is that
it kind of makes the loading process
seem a bit smoother because when you tap
a application something launches right
away and then that gives your
application time to actually load in the
background and then the splash screen
will disappear and so all this happens
by default we just have our splash
screens defined to be whatever we want
and it has some default ones that it's
using here but we just rip sort of
replaced these with our own splash
screens and then for the most part it
just all happens automatically our
graphic will get displayed and then
disappears and an application will begin
now usually that's you know what you'd
want to do but you can kind of configure
this splash screen a little bit as well
if you want so by default these are the
kind of configurations we have for the
splash screen and so this has a splash
screen delay of three seconds as
specifies the time it will take for the
splash screen to fade away and so these
are just all the default options and
some of these apply differently between
iOS and Android but if we want to
configure this a little bit now we can
change these properties and we can also
use the splash screen plugin and so this
is a plugin provided by Cordova but of
course we also have our eye on ik native
implementation of it that we can use and
so as well as having all of the
different preferences that we can set in
the config file for the plug-in itself
we can also use this plug-in to show and
hide the splash screen
whenever we want so if the splash screen
is currently displaying and we call this
code from the application then it will
hide the splash screen and if the splash
screen is currently not showing and we
call show then it will show the splash
screen so usually you're probably not
going to want to use this but there may
be circumstances where it makes sense to
do that
so I'm going to walk through one
particular example where you might want
to manually hide the splash screen
yourself rather than letting it order
hide when the application is ready and
so to do that I'm just going to use this
this application that I've been working
on for a tutorial recently it's not
really relevant to this tutorial I will
just be using it as an example so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to set the
splash screen to never hide by default
so there's a preference we can set in
the config file
I believe it's Auto hide splash screen
and as a default by default this is
going to be set to true so as soon as
the application is ready and it can hide
the splash screen it will get rid of it
but what we can do is instead switch
this to false so if I add this to the
config file here and let me just check
that that's not already defined
somewhere cool so now I'm just going to
change that to false so now when I run
the application the splash screen should
never get hidden which is obviously
going to be a problem for using the
applications we're not going to be ever
able to get into the application
but let's just see what that looks like
and I'm going to use the emulator for
this on the computer rather than a
device obviously it's a bit easier to
show on video if I use the emulator but
generally I just use my phone connected
to the computer when I can so we'll just
wait for that to finish compiling there
and then that's going to restart the
application and we'll be able to see the
splash screen as a Google succeeded
there it should restart that any second
now
okay so it's gone out of that
application it's going to launch it
again for us and hopefully we should see
the splash screen there we do so and
it's still okay so I wasn't expecting
that to happen because I forgot that the
ionic applications by default and
they're generated actually have service
splash screen plugin installed by
default and my default miss code is also
included in the platform really cool
here and that's going to hide that
splash screen which is actually the
functionality we were going to discuss
but so we'll just comment that out now
and we'll go on with what we were going
to do originally yeah essentially we're
able to as I mentioned before we can
make a call to that splash screen
plug-in to hide the splash screen so
we'll save that and we'll try run the
application again and hopefully this
time we have it displaying the splash
screen indefinitely so I'll just run
emulate again and we'll wait for it to
refresh okay so it is launching again
now hopefully this stays here and it
does so we just have this splash screen
kind of indefinitely displaying now
we've got a little spinner animation
going and at this point what we're not
gonna be able to do anything with the
application as as you just saw we
commented out this code here which hid
the splash screen and so this code
triggers when the application first
loaded so this is the root component so
this is pretty much going to be the
first thing that runs in the application
but a reason why you might not want to
hide the splash screen here and kind of
have this set up where the splash screen
just displays indefinitely until you
call this code is perhaps you want to
you want to set something up first or no
load some SDK in from the web it could
be anything really just something where
you don't want the splash screen to
disappear until we are ready for the
user to see something so just as an
example for that in in this tutorial
here it's just a as you might be able to
here some from what we saw before your
sister as a simple sort of drawing
application and so this sort of thing
probably isn't necessary for this but
let's say in our component here this is
the component that implements the
functionality for the drawing stuff and
so in this sort of ng after view and yet
hook here we do some setup or which
happens pretty much instantaneously but
let's say for example maybe we were
doing something in here like loading in
some graphics library from some URL or
something and we wanted that setup
process to complete before we hide the
splash screen and so that's where we can
do something like this so we could
import that our splash screen plugin in
here and remember that if if this plugin
isn't set up by default I only accept
something by default now but if in the
future if you're watching this and it is
no longer a default just remember that
you actually need to install the plug-in
first and you also need to add it into
the providers here but for us it's
already set up so all we need to do is
import that here and then add it to the
constructor
and then we can make that call to that
to that hide function so if I just copy
this code here and we're just going to
dump it in the mg after viewing it and
we'll need to call this dot splash
screen drive since we're not inside the
constructor anymore and so first or run
or whatever code is in here and then it
will run this and so if we were doing
that example where it was loading in say
some graphics libraries like some SDK
you would also need to make sure that
you make this call inside of some kind
of call back function for that
so that it runs after the library is
loaded in rather than straight after the
call is made now I have another video on
asynchronous behaviour in ionic
applications so if you didn't really
understand what I was just talking about
there it might be worth giving that a
watch to as I'll link to that so if we
load the application again now emulate
it again we should have the splash
screen disappearing and it's mostly
going to look exactly like it did
originally with the difference being
that at that point when the splash
screen hides we know we've done whatever
it was that we wanted to do and this
probably isn't it's not always going to
be the greatest idea if you've got flame
it's going to take a long time to load
in you don't necessarily want to have
the user
waiting on the splash screen for a long
period of time probably would be better
to remove the splash screen and have
some kind of loading process in your app
itself to give some kind of feedback to
the user so that they know your app
isn't just frogs in so let's take a look
at this now and see if it does work
actually it does so it doesn't appear to
actually be disappearing right now so
we'll just open up the Safari as fire
browser so we can get into the debugging
tools here the remote debugging and so
if we jump into ellipsis will refresh
this so we can see if anything happens
from the beginning
and yes I thought this isn't saying that
the splash screen plugin isn't installed
and so what that likely means is that
we're trying to call this too early so
in this code here we're running that
inside of that platform got ready to
then function which ensures that the
platform is ready and we're going to
have all those plugins available before
we attempt to make any calls in this
case it's it's running too quickly
before that happens which actually means
that this would have run up would have
run after this anyway so it's a bit of a
silly example really but I just for the
sake of completing it here we'll also
import a platform which we're already
doing actually which is handy and then
we'll just also use this platform to
read up then cool so just add this stock
platform already got then and we'll make
sure that we're only running this code
after the platform is ready so save that
again and we will try to run it again
and I suspect this time everything will
run fine okay so to build has succeeded
again so we'll just wait on that to
deploy to the simulator here and so
everything is restarting now and we have
the splash screen and then it disappears
and then we can use a lovely drawing
application so as I said it's a bit of a
silly example because this code is
running so quickly that this splash
screen is getting a call before the
platform is even ready no better example
would have been actually having some
kind of SDK load in and then calling the
hide function after you know that has
finished loading but at least it does
highlight the fact that you can hide the
splash screen at any point in time by
calling that hide function and if you
wanted to show the splash screen you
could also do that as well and so this
it might come in useful in in
circumstances where maybe you
doing some setup is going to take a
couple seconds or something like that
that's really fine to display the splash
screen but as I mentioned be careful
using it if you are going to load in
something you know like some kind of
library that's going to take a while you
don't want the user to be stuck on the
splash screen for a long time and you
obviously also have to make sure that
you do at some point call that function
if whatever you're doing was to fail if
you were waiting on some success
callback to hide the splash screen that
may never happen perhaps you're near the
user's offline the call fails for
whatever reason this code never gets run
then that it's going to be stuck on the
splash screen indefinitely
so it can be a useful sort of technique
to use but make sure that it makes sense
for usability purposes as well okay so
we made a few mistakes along the way in
this one but I think it was a good
opportunity to try a few little
debugging steps and sort things out yeah
hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
