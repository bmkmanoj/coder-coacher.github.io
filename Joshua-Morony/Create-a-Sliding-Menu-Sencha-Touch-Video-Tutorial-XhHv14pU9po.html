Sencha touch video tutorial and in this
video i'm going to look at how to create
a sliding menu in Sencha touch this is a
pretty popular thing to do these days
I'm not real Facebook were the first
people to do it but they've certainly
made it very popular and I tend to use a
lot in my applications sort of save the
screen reader screen real estate by not
having the some extra tab bars firmly
down the bottom and you can sort of pop
out the menu whenever you'd like to go
to different views or whatever you want
to do and so I find it really useful
thing to do so I'm going to show you how
to create exactly what you're seeing on
the screen here from scratch so I've
started with developing either
generating a new century touch
application completely let's get rid of
that now open up the command prompt so
probably know how to generate an
application by now if you don't check
out the unit first video tutorial I made
that will show you how to generate a new
Sencha touch application so we're now
going to go into the touch directory
generate a new app it's going to call
this lodging menu I'll probably put this
code up alright I will put this code up
on github afterwards as well so I will
have a link to that in the description
of the video or on the blog post so you
can sort of have a look at that
side-by-side and copy of bits and pieces
from it if you need to so just let this
finish doing its thing and then I'll
come back okay so that's finished
generating now I'm just going to open
that up in my text editor okay so this
is the default application that Sencha
touch generates
showing you all this before but let me
just type that up again this type of
look where we're starting from
okay so just add the default application
this is exactly how it appears as soon
as you generate the application so now
I'm going to open up that application
here again and what we're going to do to
start off let's just open up the main
queue and just clear out a few things in
here so I'm going to want to change this
to so I need these but I will put in
this will require the ext top menu class
because we'll be using this this comes
to Center touched by a default which
makes it a lot easier to implement menu
than it used to be we don't want that
let's clear out some of these items as
well scared of that completely and also
want to make this just a card layout but
now as well okay so what I'm going to do
is first create that toolbars at the top
of the application that actually holds
the button that we click to toggle the
menu in and out so to do that I'm going
to create a toolbar by using X type
toolbar when you use this command dot I
have to make it stick to the top of the
viewport and just give it a title of
slightly menu and now we want to add
that the button that will click to show
many
next time button and now just add some
text in it also em for men you wear
changes later for the actual icon in and
a handle a function so this will handle
toggling the menu from being visible and
non-visible handle the function and once
a if and the menu is hidden so we're
looking for the left menu and you can
stick the menu to the left the right at
the top or the bottom
for this example go with the left
so everything if it Edward we want to
show in the menu when that buttons tab
shame in your left otherwise and we want
to hide
okay so we're also going to have to put
a initial lines listener on here as well
so basically we just want to create this
menu once the once the view is
initialized so we're using this set menu
function and we're going to be calling
this stock create menu and this is a
function that we're going to create in a
second again we want to be on the left
side okay so now we'll create that
create menu function menu function and
now we're going to define the the items
that we want the menu to hold so all
they are basically the two that I showed
before is just a just two buttons you
can put anything you like in there but
funds in to work pretty well for just
for a normal for menu so when doing text
type button we want to button one now
and let's throw another one in there as
well place this one actually and I guess
we'll just call that one button too
and now we actually want to create a
menu so-called ext don't create want to
create a menu and we want to pass in the
following options here just throw this
on padding:0 publish into here I will
anyway the ninetieth menu you can
control how wide we want that to be so
I'm just going to go with 200 that seems
to work pretty well
the scrollable config will say basically
whether we want the user to be able to
drag the menu up or down so if you do
have more items in the menu that will
actually fit in the screen comfortably
you can just send scrollable so them
they can scroll that a menu up and down
to show more of the items and of course
you want to set the items to you the
items that we just created so at this
point hopefully we should have something
going on in the our application so let's
give it a refresh so there's no errors
okay so we have our button there M on it
to toggle the menu in and out and looks
like I do have an error somewhere in
here let me see if I can find that so I
can't read property is hidden under find
menus the left is hidden would have done
wrong here okay I managed to actually
find it was going wrong there it's
difficult trying to record a video and
tebow at the same time there's so much
pressure but I did have a couple at
typos here everyone listeners and I
wrote initialized a set of initialized a
lot of you probably saw that and got
really annoyed by it so I apologize for
the minor disruption there so save that
and hopefully now we can see our
sliding when you actually work and they
slide in and out but what we want to do
now is sort of make it look just a
little bit nicer so what I'm going to do
is jump back in here again and open up
the resources that's an access CSS
folder so this is a where we can make
changes to the style sheet of our
application
what this SCSS file allows us to do is
to create some rules in here which gives
us a little bit more power than just
plain CSS normally does and then from
that he's a normal cs5 it's generated so
to make sure everything goes as we would
like it to we have to actually run Metro
campuses running to actually generate
the CSS file so what you wanted to hear
just go into the directory of your
application you created go to the
resources folder and just run the
compass which command and make sure that
comes up and then the second should say
it's pulling for changes okay so now
anytime we make a change to the file
it's going to see that it changes we
made and it's automatically going to
regenerate that CSS file and just to
show you this is a CSS file so you can
see it's been minimized minimum this
version if it's close that so now I'm
going to add in a couple of styles in
here and also I'm going to include the
list icon so Sencha touch only has a few
icons included by default so what we can
do is say include icon at least and that
gives us that this three bar icon that
is typically used for other sliding
menus and as well as they're also going
to create your style from our menu
buttons a classic with menu button
background
none border:none Wyatt and a margin of 0
pixels and I'm also going to align the
label which is within that button align
them to the left using text-align:left
on that glance so now just to show I'll
bring this up before my saver so now I
want to save this this is going to
detect the change so go ahead and do
that now and then it should regenerate
the CSS application so which they
overwrite at from CSS so now the new
file is ready to go before we do that we
want to actually add those classes to to
our buttons so I'm going to change this
now so it has the list icon so you use
icon class list and as well as that I'm
going to set the UI to flame and you see
what that doesn't a second but
essentially buttons usually have this
sort of background around them setting
into UI plane means that rather than
sort of looking like a button they can
be pushed and indented it's just a
simple flat icon and when you click on
it there's a glow effect to indicate
that it's actually being tapped got that
on there now just come down to the
buttons here a run icon class just for
an opening user here that has the little
person icon and then we want to set the
class of the button to the class we just
created which is menu button
I've do the same for the other one as
well
okay now if we jump back into here again
and refresh you can see there we've got
them playing UI now instead of a default
one and we've got the list icon and we
can open that up and we can see our
buttons in there so obviously you
probably want to start with this a bit
more you can make the buttons of however
you like have a simple of complex you
want just finding some more rules to
than a CSS file and then we can also
hook up some handle function for these
buttons too which is quite simple to do
so that when we click it perhaps it
closes this menu and launches a new view
whenever the users clicked on as that's
pretty much it for this tutorial I'll
put this code on github a link it below
so you can take a look and I hope you
enjoyed it as always if you have any
questions feel free to leave a comment
and I'll try and get back to you and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
