ionic 3 have you been following the
ionic news recently you may have seen
mentioned somewhere - ionic 3 and of
course a lot of people are going to
wonder what that means why is there a
non ionic 3 when ionic 2 was only just
released if you were around for the
ionic to release if you originally use
ionic 1 you know that that was a huge
jump from ionic 1 2 ion ik 2 there's a
lot of changes and it was essentially
just an entirely new framework ionic 2
is certainly a lot better a lot more
powerful than ionic 1 but it was a huge
step for people to make that transition
from ionic 1 to high awning 2 so
naturally when talk of ionic 3 starts
coming out sort of soon after the
official release of ionic 2 came out
people naturally are worried about that
and like what does this mean
I think comments like does this mean
that you know I don't like to sailed and
now we're moving on to ionic 3 already
they're not you know bothering to update
ionic 2 anymore and that's not the case
at all it's just a matter I guess of the
terminology that's being used here and
it's a different version existing being
used now as opposed to with the original
version of my own ink so the transition
from ionic 2 to an ik 3 will be nothing
like the transition from ionic 1 to
ionic 2 the transition from Harnack to
tonic 3 will be more like just a
transition between these and more normal
updates and ionic 1 would be more like a
1.3 to 1.4 sort of upgrade rather than
you know transitioning to this new
framework now the reason there's being
this change is that ionic like angular
is now using something called semantic
versioning or Semba for their versioning
and it doesn't really mean a whole lot
in terms of what you know functionality
is going to be made available it's just
a more consistent way for people to
version
their software libraries so I guess
versioning is kind of this you know sort
of undefined thing people in the past I
guess I've sort of gone with whatever
felt right for their company how they
wanted to name their updates whether
they call that one point ten point two
or they go to one point eleven or you
know one point fifty semver adjusted
more standardized way to do versioning
and all it is basically is you have your
three sort of points a three dots so you
have something like one point one point
zero or two point three point five and
the first number stands for a major
change the second number is a minor
change and the third is just like a
patch so when we see sort of little
updates to the ioniq there's like little
bug fixes and stuff like that it'll come
through as a patch so in its version two
you might expect to see sign like two
point three point zero and then if they
were to apply a patch you get two point
three point one or if there was some
kind of minor update it's bigger than a
patch but it's not really that big of an
update you would see a transition to
something like two point four rather
than two point three and then when
there's a bigger sort of update that's
when you get that first number changing
to something like ionic three so we've
moved to your 3.0 3.1 and so on so this
update so right now it's ionic is that
version 2.3 right now and this this
upgrade that ionic three update will
probably come sometime in the next few
weeks so that's one weird transition
from say 2.3 to 3.0 because this is
going to be a major update but it's not
a new framework it's not a totally
different thing that we're going to be
working this but with a sort of major
update like that that may imply there
will be some kind of breaking changes
maybe some API will be changed whereas
with a smaller update with a patch or a
minor update you're likely not going to
have any kind of breaking changes having
said that though there really isn't many
breaking changes
in ionic 3 there are some huge updates
behind-the-scenes things to make ionic
work faster and for the package sizes to
be smaller but in terms of things you
will need to do to update your
applications it's actually pretty small
and so I've got the upgrade guide up on
the screen here and this will probably
change somewhat over the next 4 weeks
perhaps because this isn't finalized but
when it is released and you have some
update notes like this and as of right
now all you need to do to update an
existing application is to just change
the dependencies to where you see on the
screen here and you can do this now if
you want the the beta so high on ik 3 is
out so if you want to give it a shot now
you can of course it's not stable yet
though so you need to update to those
dependencies and import the browser
module here into your act of module TS
file same with a HTTP module and you can
also make use of our native 3 point X as
that's all you need to do to update an
existing ionic 2 application to ionic 3
and if you're generating a new harmonic
3 application or just a new ionic
application this will all be done for
you anyway so you can just keep going
about doing things the way that you have
been and I guess that's another
important note there that I guess the
branding for the framework as angular
has done is that they want it to be
called just ionic it's not a on 1 ionic
2 ionic 3 it's just ionic and then the
version numbers don't really matter so
much
ionic 3 will soon enough transition to
ionic 4 then 5 and 6 and again it's not
going to be a new framework every time
it's just going to be major updates and
like this one of course it's not so easy
I guess to just change it to just ionic
because people are so used to searching
for ionic 2 now a lot of content out
there is labeled as ionic 2 and makes it
easier to search for you know I only to
content compared to I think one and so
there's a bit of a guess teething
process there but just keep in mind that
this is version number doesn't matter
so much anymore so I'm not going to
spend much time talking about what's
going to be new in ironing 3 I mainly
just want to get this point across that
you know it's not this totally different
framework when compared to ionic 2 but I
will just go through this document
quickly one of the big changes in ionic
3 is the option to lazy load modules and
I probably will do this I guess do a
more in-depth blog post perhaps on this
when the one Hynek 3 is stable and it's
released
but essentially what you'll be able to
do now is lazy load pages rather we can
create modules for each page and we can
lazy load those so what that means lazy
loading in general means to load
something when you need it not right
away so we often do that with images and
a webpage rather than loading all the
images right away so if we've got 100
images on a page instead we load those
images as the users about to scroll to
them so if they never scroll to the
bottom of the page we don't need to
blowed the image down there and so it's
the same idea with lazy loading pages in
ionic rather than loading everything up
front we can just load what we need
first and then load in what we need as
we do so that's going to do a lot to
help with the startup time of your
applications if you've got a
particularly big applications loading
lots of things that's going to help with
getting your application to start up
faster and finally the only breaking
changes so far at least with ionic 3 is
some minor changes to the grid where
they've removed the old style of the
grid system where you would use width
and a number to specify columns now you
should use the newer version which is
essentially the same thing you just use
coal instead of width and some changes
to typography here some changes to
slides but these are all pretty minor
changes which would be quite easy to
update in any existing application
anyway and of course the big thing with
ionic 3 is that it will now be using
angular for behind the scenes so it's
the latest version of this right now
angular
so you're going to get a weird mind to
do support angular for offers in terms
of performance and new features and so
on and that's going to be built right
into your applications when you're using
ionic 3 so I hope this video was able to
clear up some misconceptions about what
ionic 3 is I can understand that people
would be worried when they see something
like this come out when they've just
spent you know this time investing into
learning what ionic 2 is and it seems
like you know I know there's this new
framework coming out now and we're just
going to have to forget everything we
learn again it's not the case so yeah if
you see people on the forums or wherever
confused about this let them know maybe
you can point in for this video
hopefully now you can be excited about
the launch of ionic 3 for other than
worrying about it ok so I hope you
enjoyed the video and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
