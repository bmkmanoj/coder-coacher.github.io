little bit different I'm gonna talk
about the the phaser framework I'm gonna
show you this little game I've been
building here with the phaser framework
and I'm gonna walk through what a phaser
project looks like so the phase of
framework is a it's a html5 game
development of frameworks so it allows
you to build games with web tech so the
kinds of games you're going to build
with phaser might not necessarily be the
sort of big 3d action games you will see
on mobile app store but it's a good
framework for building the simple sort
of flappy bird style games that aren't
too resource intensive obviously with
mobile web apps you don't have access to
as much power as you do with a native
app and if you follow my two trolls on
a2 and stuff like that generally for
those business sort of mobile apps
that's not really an issue we don't run
into too many performance issues as long
as we design the application well with
the game it's a bit different because we
are doing more resource intensive things
but again if you design the game well
it's a simple enough game you can quite
easily make a great-looking games with
web tech so this is just an example of
the game I'm working on right now it's a
bit of a I guess strange concept I'm
trying you I got some levels up you can
switch between here or just add on the
first one and so the basic idea is that
you pre record your moves for the level
so I have to jump beforehand and then it
will run and I can see if I complete the
level or not so there's a I've got a
long way to go before I finish this game
but I just wanted to show you an example
of what a face game that look like yeah
but what I really want to do in this
tutorial is go through a phase of
project so that's what we're going to do
now
okay so I've just got one of my
tutorials that I've
now level akut fazer games with es6 this
is a little post I did that describes
how you can create a phaser project
using an ESX style so the phase of
framework is it's just a a JavaScript
library you can include and you can just
use that how you'd use a normal
JavaScript library you can just inject
with the script tag in your project and
start building things but it's working
in an ionic to sort of background I like
the sort of es6 type script style of
structure and so it's nice to be able to
use that in phaser as well so I'll be
using this as an example for this
tutorial I have a boilerplate set up
here that you can use based it on I set
up by a boilerplate that somebody else
created I hope that I have their name in
here somewhere
yeah so this is the this is the original
phaser template they created they have
done the most of most of the work here
setting up all of the compile process
I've just modified that to include a
sort of basic structure for how I like
to structure phaser projects so we're
going to create a project based off of
this and then I'm gonna walk through the
different parts of a phaser project so
if you look in this tutorials you can
see that we can just run this command
here I had to clone that boilerplate and
create a new project so I'm going to do
that now and we'll just change it to
I'll just call it phaser example and
we'll let that download okay so now
that's done we'll change into that new
project and then we just need to install
the dependencies of NPM so we've got an
NPM install and then I'll handle that
for us okay so that's done installing
now it's now projects up and ready to go
to view the project through the browser
you need to start a web server just like
you do for ionic to applications how we
run an ionic serve for this project
you'll just need to run NPM start and
that all start up the server for us
and then you can see here we've got the
the euros which we can use to access the
game and so I'm not gonna worry about
that I'm actually going to be building
anything in this tutorial I'm just gonna
walk through the files and folders in
the project so I'll open that up in
sublime now and we'll walk through it
okay so this is the project we just
generated and you can see where the
folders we have over on the left here
this is a similar sort of idea in
structure to an ironing to project where
we have our source folder where we do
the majority of the coding and then the
build process that we have built into
this will then create a build in the
build folder and that's what we're
actually running through the browser but
most of the coding is will happen in the
source folder here and we also do have
this static folder for static assets so
this is going to be things like sprites
for the player so you might have a
little sprite of a running person or
something like that that you want to use
as the character and we can also have
well so we've got like our index index
file in here as well and you can see
this is where we include the phaser
library so just like with mobile web
apps like with ionic in the end it's
just a normal web page and that's what
we have here we just got a standard sort
of HTML for a normal web page and then
we're including the phaser library and
the game jeaious file which will be the
rebuilt minimized version of our game
and so if we look in the source folder
as I mentioned this is where we'll be
doing most of our coding for the
application so we have the index dot JS
file here which is kind of like the set
up for the game and this is what will
create the game in the in the page and
it adds our States to the game I'm not
going to cover exactly what states are
in too much depth here I do have a
tutorial on that which I'll link to but
it's essentially a way to separate parts
of the game so you might have a state
for the game title screen you might have
a main state which is where
game actually is or you might even have
multiple Maine states or say levels you
might have a level one state a level two
state level three state and so on
depending how you want to structure your
game so again if you are watching this
having come from my ionic tutorials you
can kind of consider it like a
individual component like a page
everything is sort of separated into its
own little area and so this just sets
the game up the size of the game so this
is just setting it to the width and
height of the screen generally when I
create games like to try and make them
scalable to screen sizes and device
types so then the most important thing
we have are our states in here and we've
got various different states that we can
use as we're a blade to boot and the
preload state states which go through
loading in our assets for us if we're
using any images or audio or things like
that we got a game title example screen
here the main thing we want to take a
look at is this main state and that's
where a lot of the game itself is going
to be developed so as I mentioned you
may have different sort of main States
this might not be the only main state
for your game you might have different
states for different levels but this is
the sort of style that you'll be using
to create the the actual game parts of
your game so we have these like life
cycle events here we have a create
method and it's the sign that's called
when the state is first started so it's
what handle setting up the environment
you'll do things here like adding the
sprites to the game adding audio
whatever you need to set up in that
state will happen in here and then the
update method is kind of the most
important part of the whole process
because it runs it's like was constantly
so this update method is going to be
consistently called throughout the
running of your game and it's what used
to check the current state of the game
what's happening so this is where you'll
check for things like collisions between
certain sprites
then you could handle what happens when
that collision occurs maybe the player
dies maybe they're gonna power up they
get some points for something like that
and then you can sort of just fill out
this main state with more functions
things to help your game run and use in
this update method you can also sort of
separate out some things into their own
objects to clean things up a bit so you
might want to separate out your player
object into its own object here which
will handle a lot of the logic for that
player and then import that in here to
use so to give it a little bit more
context in this file I'm going to switch
to a tutorial that I recently released
I'll link to this tutorial as well so
this is a more fleshed-out version of an
actual game in phaser and so the game is
essentially just a helicopter style game
where you control a helicopter that goes
up and down and you try to dodge some
obstacles so you can see we're importing
a couple of things here I've got a walls
moving walls objects set up here that
controls the obstacles and a helicopter
object which sets up the helicopter and
the various methods that that uses I'm
not going to discuss this in detail
recommend going to take a look at the
tutorial if you're interested in how
this works but you can see here we just
import those and then we're setting them
up in this create method here as I
mentioned this is sort of the thing that
runs initially to set up this state we
create the helicopter we create the
walls and we add our controls and timers
so this is setting up the the controls
for the game so these can control the
helicopter and these timers are events
that run to trigger certain things so in
this case every two seconds we're
spawning a new obstacle into the game
and the update method it's actually
quite simple all we're doing here is
checking for an overlap between the
helicopter sprite and
so if the player runs into a wall it's
going to trigger this game over function
and that's going to restart the game and
then we're just checking two more things
here we check at the helicopters out of
bounds and in that case we also
triggered the game over method and we
also check if the helicopter is
currently rising that means that the
user is holding down on the screen or
clicking in which case we want to lift
the helicopter up and so records
increase vertical velocity method which
we have in here to do that so this is
update method is sort of where most of
the logic for the game happens so you
could have a ton of things in here like
maybe if you use a has collected the
powerup you might have some power up
setting active and you check if that's
currently active in here and if it is
you might change some things so maybe if
they've got some invincibility powerup
you check for that here and if they if
they're currently invincible then you
don't kill them when the helicopter goes
out of bounds what I do like about
phaser though is that obviously we had
to work with web tech which is a lot of
fun I like working in JavaScript but
it's also quite easy to create a decent
game with not all that much code once
you get used to how to use a various
methods in phaser like adding sprites
and checking for collisions and things
like that you could knock out a simple
game like this in in a couple of hours
or something like that and obviously the
code here is it's quite simple this is
really all the code for the game and of
course right now it's not using any
particular sprites or background images
or audio but these are things that are
quite easy to add into the game to make
it look a lot prettier so obviously the
most of the tutorials and stuff I do
right now are sort of mobile app based I
do a lot of ionic stuff so if you are
the kind of person who is more
interested in that content I hope that
you is found this at least a little bit
interesting if you are interested in
creating games I think it's a really fun
thing to do just to let off
a little bit steamed do something a
little bit creative rather than
constantly working with complex logic
and creating mobile apps that can be fun
too but I think this is a nice little
relief from that so if your insert I
recommend checking out see if you can
build a game in phaser and I'll probably
release some more more videos and
tutorials in the future as well
I occasionally blog about phase I hope
to do it a bit more so if you are
interested in this content let me know
so I know to make some more videos and
things like that because I do know that
most of you are here before the ionic
stuff so yeah let me know okay so I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see
you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
