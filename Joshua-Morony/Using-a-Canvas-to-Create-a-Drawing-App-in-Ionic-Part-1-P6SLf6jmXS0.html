how to build a drawing application in
ionic using a canvas and like a few
videos I've done in the past this is
going to be a live style video I don't
have a particular idea about how I'm
going to build this this have a general
idea of what I want to build and that's
just a simple drawing application where
you can change some colors maybe use a
few different brush types and draw some
things on the screen and so obviously as
part of this tutorial we're going to be
talking about how to use the canvas
element in ionic which is just a normal
HTML 5 element you can use it anywhere
and basically it just provides a space
on the screen you can draw stuff on with
a JavaScript API and so I'm not super
familiar with the canvas element I've
used it a lot in the past but as I've
got the documentation for that or rather
make some tutorials lit up here we can
refer to if we get stuck on things but
basically we'll be doing things like
drawing lines and shapes and that kind
of stuff and we got the ionic
documentation here as well if we need it
so to start off with what I might do is
just generate a new custom component for
the drawing space that we're creating so
this will allow us to create this sort
of custom component that we can then
input anywhere but we wanted to use this
drawing space rather than hard coding it
into so the home page or something like
that which is a lot less modular and we
won't bow to reuse it as easy in the
future and so the basic idea is that I'm
thinking is that we'll have a big square
the drawing space is basically going to
take up the entire width and height of
the page and then we'll have probably in
navbar at the top of our toolbar at the
top and at the bottom as well to control
brush size and and color now what
usually happens in these videos is I
drastically underestimate the amount of
time it's going to take me to do things
so the goal for this video we're trying
to get to the point where we can draw on
the screen just a simple black line
perhaps
and then I'll do another video where we
would do some things like adding colors
and brush sizes so have that as a goal
and we'll see how far we can get so as I
mentioned we're going to build a custom
component so let's do that to start off
with so just run ioniq G component and
we will call this just canvas draw I
reckon we'll work well and now we're
going to serve that again and you can
see here that we get an error about the
ionic module here and I guess annex kind
of it this in-between stage at the
moment with the new lazy loading
features in ionic 3 it's not entirely
clear what the preferred option is at
the moment of how we should go about
that so basically we have the option of
lazy loading things or not and to keep
things simple in this tutorial I'm going
to not lazy load anything so I'm just
going to delete this page this module
file rather if you wanted to use lazy
loading you just need to change ionic
module to ionic Page module it's just a
bit of a typo there but we're just going
to delete that completely and in order
to use in order to use and this
component through our application we're
going to need to add it to the module
file in app folder here so I'm just
going to import that here and I've ready
forgotten what it was called a canvas
draw so import canvas draw from the
components folder
and then we just need to set it up as a
declaration here so now we'll go to
users component throughout the
application you can see in here this has
a selector of canvass drawer so if we
were to come into the home page where
you could just put I'm just going to
give it a pulp of this we just put
canvass drawer and that's going to
insert our custom component there and so
right now this is just just has some
text in the template you can see there
it has an interpolation of text and then
in here has text at the hello world so
all the app is going to do now is
display hello world and rather than
getting rid of everything I actually add
the iron content back in and I'm going
to set that to no bounce so that's the
the content area doesn't scroll up and
down it's kind of fixed then okay so if
you look at me browse and I see we have
hello world in the corner there which
means our custom components working it's
being set up correctly so now we just
need to make that be a wonderful canvas
that we can draw on and create
magnificent paintings so to start off
with let's first try to include the
canvas element there so if I come into
the component here we're going to get
rid of that so I'm not going to need
that anymore to come into the time
script file for the canvas drawer
component we can also get rid of this
text member variable we're not using
Matt or this get rid of this comment
here and now we have a pretty good blank
template to work from so let's jump back
into the template then and add the
canvas component and all the canvas is
is a template rather a tag that it's
just canvas and you give it a width and
a height and that is it and so I'm not
going to give it a width and a height
now because I want to set that
dynamically depending on the height and
the width of the screen we're working
with so what I'm going to do is use the
platform API from ionic to detect for
the width of the hiders and then use
that to set those attributes dynamically
in here so to start off with all I'm
going to do is give this a template
variable of I will just call it my
canvas and that's going to allow us to
easily grab that in here and so to grab
a reference to that I'm going to have to
use a view child from the angular
library and then we can set up the view
child here and we'll just call it or we
go to reference my canvas because that's
the name we set up here and then we just
get got to give it a name and we'll call
it what is called a canvas and then so
out there throughout this file here
we'll be able to reference this canvas
and to gain access to that and so we'll
just check that that works we'll add an
NG after view in it hook here which will
run after the Veals initialize and after
we have access to that and we'll just
log out this dot canvas to make sure
that we've done everything correctly so
far okay so you can see over in the
console here we have an element
reference and we can see the native
element of canvas and then we have
access to everything we need there and
if we find it in here find the element
itself you can see it's strangely
considered that size by default but that
is what also that's like a component
this is the canvas we want so I guess
the default for that is 300 by 150 for
some reason that's not something I was
aware of but obviously that's not what
we want we're going to change that so
this canvas fills up the entire screen
so to do that we're going to use this
users reference we've set up here and
we're going to actually create separate
reference to I'm going to create one
called canvas element and so when we're
working with this we're going to be
working with the native element directly
which is an actual Dom element and not
the element reference which is this kind
of angular thing which is providing us
access to
that element so this is what we want to
work with here native element and you
can see this is just all the normal Dom
properties for canvas so I'm going to
create a separate remember variable
there I'm going to set that to add a
native element and we're going to be
referencing that a lot search is going
to make it a little bit easier to do and
also going to import a platform from
from ionic angular here which is the
normal iron it library and we're going
to set that up in a constructor and then
we're going to use that to figure out
the width and the height of the screen
and so I remember correctly that should
be available through this dot platform
dot Wix so let's check that work I'm not
100% sure that is the function okay yeah
so we have 1366 0 which is exactly what
we want so we're going to use that width
and height to set the width and height
attributes on the canvas now and do that
we're going to use how we're going to
use cycle the renderer which I'm not
going to talk about in this video I've
talked about a few times in the past but
essentially it's just a platform
agnostic way to make changes to an
element style what attributes or
something like that using angular rather
than new pew lighting that Dom element
add directly which you could also do so
just call that renderer and set that up
there and so what we can do now is use
this render and set element attribute
and we're going to supply it with the
native element the actual Dom element of
the canvas there so we'll do this canvas
element and I mean to supply the name of
the attribute we want to set trigger
width and then we're going to set it to
the width of platform either we get from
platform and then we're just going to do
the same thing
for the height so with any luck
hopefully that works and we have a
canvas taking up the full space of the
screen now so I've got an error here
saying that we can't assign a number to
a property that requires a string here
so it's a bit of a workaround for that I
should be able to add on an empty empty
string there and that will convert this
to a string I believe okay so that seems
you've got rid of of that error so
hopefully now if we find the canvas
again in here we have a full with canvas
and we do so that takes up the entire
width and height of the screen now which
is cool and this actually is a canvas
draw sort of container element here for
the canvas doesn't take up the full
height of the screen which is probably
going to cause problems for us so we
will fix that right now and we'll just
add a height 100% and with 100% here and
I've just got that canvas element show
again now it's still not taking the
whole screen it also needs to be I think
the display property is set to inline
probably if we bring this up here and
we'll make sure that that's selected and
just find the display property play in
mynheer so we need to set that to block
as well acts otherwise it's trying to
render that element like it would text
but we don't want it to do that so now
we have it take care of the full width
and height make up the container element
taking the full width and height as well
so that should be good now okay so now
we want to move on to the to the more
interesting stuff we want to actually
draw something on the screen and to do
that we're going to have to respond to
the user touching the screen and there's
actually a bit of scroll going on here
I'll do with that later than it looks
like the content is probably slightly
larger than the screen itself so I'll
deal with that line as we want to get
you want to respond to a user input and
draw wherever they are holding down and
dragging the mouse in this case but when
they're on an actual device where
they're dragging their finger so what
we're going to have to do is listen to
some events and so if we come to the
canvas here we're going to add some
listeners to this directly and so the
events were interested in a touch start
and will use a function called will just
say a handle handle start and we'll pass
through the event for that we also want
a touch move so this is the touch start
as when I first started teaching the
screen touch move is when they're
actually moving their Mouse or finger
and so you use hand or move for that and
then potentially also touch and I'm not
sure whether we will use that or not yet
but I'll include it for now and so I'll
just call the handle end and then we
should be able to come into touch script
file again and set up those functions
so I'm handles start now we'll just log
these events out for now and just copy
and paste that to make it a bit easier
so hand will start hand or move and
handle end so let's go back into the
browser now and hopefully as we drag
around on this space will see some
console.log fingers popping up to be
event going touch and drag and cool so
we have a whole bunch of touch events
showing up now which is exactly what we
want so now we just need to use those
events to draw something so we're going
to focus on just the touch move event
for now and we just want to draw a line
wherever the user is dragging and so
we're going to have to use some
properties here to do that we want to
know that sort of position on the screen
do that we can use probably the tuchas
property here I would imagine would be
the best bet
you can see here we have a page X and a
page y value that we can use to say see
where on the screen they're tapped I'm
not sure if it's actually the page X or
the screen X again
now we'll go with page X person we'll
see what happens so basically what we
want to do is keep track of where the
user is dragging and then draw a line
between those two points so that means
we as well as are using the current page
X and page why we're also going to need
to know the last page X and page y so
wherever the last women triggered from
and wherever the next event triggers
from we want to draw a line between
those two points so we're going to set
up another member variable here called
going to call them last X and that will
be a number and a last Y that will also
be a number so in this handle move event
here we're going to grab the page X and
the page Y and we're going to detect if
it's the whether or not it's the first
our last row is actually we can handle
that in the handle start so we use a
handle start event to get the X and the
y first so we'll just do this dot last X
equals what was it event dot touches and
that was the first touch there and then
the page x value and we'll just do the
same for the Y value as well
and then once this handle move function
has finished we're going to update those
values to be even new the new value from
the latest event but first we're going
to draw that line and now in order to do
anything with the with the canvas we
need to call this function called get
context and then we interact with the
context of the canvas which allows us to
draw things on to it so to get a
reference of that I'm just going to do
in credit new variable R is called CTX
making sure and that's going to be this
dot canvas element don't get context 2d
and now with that we can use the various
the JavaScript API that is provided so
we can do things like creating lines and
striking those lines or filling shapes
creating shapes any of the methods that
are available we can use through that
and so we're just going to use the the
line two method and then we're going to
stroke that line to create the effect of
the user drawing a line on the screen so
what we can do is I cool I'll do context
dot begin path which is going to start
the path for us we're going to move that
to a certain spot on the screen so we're
going to move that to wherever the last
wherever the last X and the last why
were so these are the coordinates this
last X this dot last Y and then we're
going to create a line from that point
to the new point which is the current
X&amp;amp;Y
as I'm actually just create a separate a
separate variable so that here will
create a current X and current Y since
we're going to use this twice anyway
and then we just modify these down here
to use those instead to tidy things up a
bit so we're going to line two
current X current line and then we're
going to close that path and then we can
supply a stroke style which i think is
just the UM we can just provide the
color to that so I'll just do black
can't remember hundred percent if that
is how that works but we'll look it up
in a second if it doesn't work and we
can set the line width for that line so
we'll just set it to say five one and
then finally we destruct that line so
the stroke just basically traces over
the line essentially so if you had a
long horizontal line the stroke is just
going to kind of draw over that with the
black color with the line width of fire
so nothing will actually actually see
anything until you stroke that line this
is all just defining where we want to
draw so with that hopefully we have the
ability to draw a line on the screen as
as I mention it's been a while since
like we use this so I'm not 100% sure if
it's going to work so we'll see what
happens here we'll start moving and we
get errors and I will do a stroke style
does not exist so let's bring up that
tutorial here we can find a stroke style
reference in here okay I've just got the
a w3schools page up here and yeah I'm
using that that should be um I just
defined as a string that's not a
function call so just change that to
stroke style equals black and I'm pretty
sure though the rest of I'm pretty sure
that's how you use line width that could
be wrong about that too
we'll see okay let's try a drag again
and we have more errors and language I
bet that is the same thing should I look
it up yes
okay yes that's again just a simple
assignment on a function call now let's
give it a go again okay fingers crossed
and there we go we do have a line
drawing on the screen now which is
awesome we also have all these events
logging out which is annoying I'm going
to get rid of those for now and let's
make that a bit chunkier just for fun
okay so we have our line drawing around
the screen now as you can see it's kind
of the square type shape so what I might
do actually is I think there is line
drawing you can set it enough has to be
before this see if there's a line join
property you can set two ink around I
think that's how you use it
probably wrong again but we will see and
yes a rather than being a sort of square
end to the line that's going to be
circular so more like a brush you're
using Photoshop or whatever let's try
that again and yes now we have a sort of
more circular line join see that's
pretty much works now let's also see if
we can get rid of that annoying slight
scroll on the see as I go up and down
here it's kind of falling a little bit
and I'm assuming that's because the
canvas is probably breaking out of the
bounds of the content area let me just
scroll that down so let's find the
canvas area I might be able to cheat
here rather than searching around for
what is actually causing this just for
the sake of brevity I should be able to
set this to overflow:hidden now on the
scroll content and I think that'll stop
yeah that stops the scroll I'm just
going to do that for now
probably a better idea to find what is
actually so causing it to break out of
the box a bit there but yeah we're just
going to set a scroll content sorry
nothing and he able to set that on the
home page
and we'll set that to overflow:hidden
and I will just refresh that to make
sure that that is applying correctly
cool so now that the screen doesn't pop
around is withdrawing so we've got to
the point where we were aiming to get in
this video we have a canvas component
created and we can draw a simple line on
that which responds to a touchmove event
so in the next video we take this a bit
further and still allow you to customize
the drawing a bit so the ability to
change the brush the brush size and to
change some colors as well and that's
probably about as far as we'll get and
maybe even I'll potentially do more
videos in the future we'll be doing
things like adding shapes and stuff like
that
so again we'll see where we get to in
the next video I hope you enjoy this one
and I'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
