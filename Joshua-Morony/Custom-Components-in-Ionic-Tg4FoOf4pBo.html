how to use custom components in ionic 2
and more specifically how to build them
just recently I released a tutorial on
building a simple progress bar component
in ionic 2 and that's the article I have
on screen now so maybe after this
tutorial if you want go take a look at
this one and see if you can build that
but I just wanted to I just thought more
generally about components and cover
very basically how they work now before
I get into generating our own custom
component and talking through how to do
that I just want to point out that
basically the entire structure of ionic
2 applications and of angular
applications are made of components
within components within components so
if we take a look at even the ionic
library here the source code for that if
I come into the source folder go to
components you'll see all of the things
that use in ionic 2 all the different
components like the lists and the
segments and all that kind of stuff
they're all made up of components so if
I go to one of these I'll just go to the
item component here so if I open the top
script file for this and we just scroll
down a little bit you'll see that this
is a component and if we jump into our
own application here for you open up the
app folder and take a look at the route
component you can see we that's a
component there all of our pages that we
generate those are components and of
course if we want to generate our own
custom components we are going to use
the component decorator as well so an
ionic 2 application is just this tree of
components now when you're first working
with ionic 2 the only components you're
really going to be creating yourself are
these pages and it's not a whole lot
going on on here we'll just define any
functions you need to use
hook them up to templates and that's it
all the is the complicated component so
you're going to be using you're going to
be importing from the ionic 2 library
where they've already been built for you
so when you do start creating your own
custom components that are a couple of
concepts that don't really apply it to
creating pages like this so of course
I've really got a example application
generated here so feel free to do the
same if you follow me along and what I'm
gonna do is just create a custom
component here called my component okay
so you would have seen it flying to the
left over here and we have this
component generated now so this is just
a simple default component that'll just
render out some text so we can set this
text property to whatever we want and
that's going to display that if we look
at the template for this component it's
just a an interpolation of the text
member variable and so if we use this
component in our application it's just
going to render out hello world wherever
we put it and so basically to use a
component we use its selector here we
add that to our template like this
just like a normal HTML tag and then
that's going to add it's going to inject
the template for that component wherever
you put it and it's going to hook up
whatever functionality you have in the
typescript file here and of course any
Styles you have defined here it's going
to apply that as well so just to show
you it working if I jump into a home
file we're going to add that but before
we can use the component we need to set
it up in the module file so I'll have to
import that here you know it's probably
a pretty poor naming choice because
components by default when being
generated with the ionic command-line
interface I get component appended to
the end so now it's called my component
component which is a bit silly but we'll
just go with it
so important that from the components
folder and then we're also going to have
to add that to the declarations right
here okay so now we've got that set up
we should be able to use
anywhere in our application that we want
so if I jump into home to HTML now I'm
just going to get rid of its default
content here and instead we're just
going to use our my component component
and so this is the same idea as like
here using my own content or my own
header or I own navbar they're all just
custom components I'll save that and
we're going to serve it just to make
sure that it's all working ok so I've
got the application up now and you can
see that HelloWorld is being written
about the screen here so if I jump into
the component again and changes to say
hello everybody
save it and that should be reflected
there okay so that's simple enough if
you just want to render out some static
HTML you can configure in here manually
you can just place this component
wherever you want and that's just going
to just drop that wherever you need it
but a lot of the time when you're
creating a custom component it's because
you're trying to create some kind of
specific functionality so we're going to
need to do a few things that are a
little bit more complex than just
dropping a component in place so the two
most important concepts to understand
when creating custom components is input
and output now input is what the
component has passed into it so the user
can specify something that the component
can take in and do something with and
output is things that have data that's
flowing back out of that component that
people can then grab from the component
so they can listen for on that component
so to use input and output you need to
import them from the angular library and
we're also going to import something
called event emitter and the event
emitter is going to be used with that
output to generate an event that we can
listen to on the component so we can use
that the @ symbol just like we do with
the decorator here and supply input and
then we're going to name the the input
property that are going to use so we're
just going to call this my text
and then we're going to assign that
input to a member variable in this
component here so what it's going to
call that text to use so this means now
that we can supply an input called my
text and it's going to assign it to text
to use so if I come back into the home
page now I can supply that input value
here so if I now do my text equals
something that's going to input that
value into our component and assign it
to text two years so I can make use of
that now so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna hook into the ng after view init
hook here which is going to wait for
everything to load and then do this and
then I'm just going to set this dot text
to the text to use remember variable so
this should overwrite that hello
everybody with whatever we supply in
here so if we take a look now you can
see that it says something now which is
exactly what we want you can also use a
property binding here so if you wanted
to make this dynamic you could surround
my text in square brackets and instead
use a variable here so maybe we have
something called my home text and then
in our home dot ts file we can define my
home text as well saying this is the
home page so now whatever this variable
is here is going to be attached to this
my text input which is then going to be
passed into our opponent so if I take a
look at that now you can see that it
says this is the home page okay so
that's how we can get some data into our
components and now we're going to talk
about how we can get some data out of
components and we can do that by just
like we can add that listeners for
clicks by doing this we can create our
own custom event here that we can listen
to and so when that thing happens in our
component we're going to be able to do
something about it
that data and do something with it so
instead of click we might do something
like all this cool that something
happened and when we detect that
something happened event we are going to
trigger a function called at do
something and so then we could define
this do something in our homepage here
and we will just log out we did it
okay so we're listening for that event
now but we still need to create that
event we need to make that happen on
this component at some point and so you
could trigger that event at any time for
any reason that you want in your
component but for the sake of the
example we're just going to set up an
interval that is going to trigger the
event every 10 seconds we'll make it
every three seconds so first we need to
set up our output now so we do the same
thing as we did for the input but this
time we use output and we will call that
something happened let me just check
that's what I called it yep so something
happened so we're gonna add our output
here and now just like we did with the
input instead we use output and then
we're going to create a variable that is
going to be used to generate this event
so that's called something happened
which is the same as when we used here
so we do something happened and then
we're going to do something a little bit
different now we're going to create a
new event emitter which is the thing
that we imported here and so this is
gonna allow us to generate that event
that we're listening to so we're going
to come into this energy after viewing
it function now and we're going to set
up that interval and so an interval will
take it so timeout it's going to run
some code every say three seconds or
four seconds or however long we specify
so I'm going to do let interval equal
set interval and then going to supply
the function I want to use and that's
going to run every three seconds so in
here
I'm going to do is use that event
emitter that we've set up here something
happened something this sort something
happened don't omit and then we can also
pass some data back through that event
so I'm just going to use just a simple
strength here and to say it's time so I
saved that and we jump back into the
browser now see if things are working as
we expect okay so the first we do that
just popped up there and hopefully
that's going to keep happening every
three seconds and it looks like that's
exactly what is happening so that
interval is running every three seconds
it's calling the emit method on
something happened output which is an
event emitter and because it's an output
we can listen to that on the component
here and we trigger a function when that
event happens which in this case is do
something which if we jump into
typescript file is just a function that
logs out we did it now if we wanted to
we could also pass data through that
event right now what we're doing is
passing its time through there but we're
not actually making use of that so if I
instead come into our HTML file here I'm
gonna pass through that event and then
in our top script file we're also gonna
pass that through and we're just going
to log out that the data from the event
instead so now if we jump back into the
browser you can see that it's time is
being passed through enough and that's
the value that is being passed in here
so you can pass this is obviously pretty
useless right now but you could pass him
whatever kind of data you wanted when
Singh Kham some kind of complex thing
happens in your component you can pass
the data for that back through here and
you can listen to it and do something
with it it's a more complicated example
of that is the the content component in
ionic 2 they have an ion scroll event
for example so you listen to it with
scroll and that's a custom event they've
set up and whenever the component that
the content area is scrolled it's going
to emit the data related to that scroll
which includes things like how far it's
been scrawled the velocity of the scroll
or those kinds of complicated things so
this is a really really simple example I
just wanted to cover the concepts of
input and output as essentially they're
the fundamental ideas behind creating
your own custom components so if you
want to do a little bit more of a
practical example go take a look at this
build a simple progress by a component
in ionic to tutorial I also have a
couple more tutorial tutorials out about
components
I even released a much more complex one
on creating photo tilt component so if
you want to take a look at that I'll
link that as well
but if you're new to creating custom
components into your hope that clarified
the concepts a bit I hope you enjoyed
the tutorial and I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
