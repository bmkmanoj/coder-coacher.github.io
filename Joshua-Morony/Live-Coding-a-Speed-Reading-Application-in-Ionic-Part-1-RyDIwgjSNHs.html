speed reading app in ionic and we're
going to do it in the style of a few
videos that I've done recently where I
just kind of coded life I don't have any
plan or idea of how i'm going to create
the app i just have a general idea of
the app itself and then I walk through
creating it so I came across this gif on
reddit this yesterday and I've seen
these before and I used tools like this
before and I really like the concept I
guess the whole concept would like speed
reading is not some focal izing all of
the words and kind of reading them in
your head as you go through a book I
think the idea is kind of like you don't
want to read the book like you would out
loud you want your eyes to just kind of
scan the words and so they have these
tools which just flash these words at
you and it makes it seem like it's
easier to read faster because you're not
spending that time I guess subvocalize
English words so I've never really spent
too much time and seeing how effective
these things are but I think it's cool
but I find it a bit hard to use though
it's almost a bit stressful i guess if
you use these kind of tools and they fly
through these words if you want to go
back if you miss something that's quite
difficult and I've never looked around
to see if there's any better tools out
there but I thought is making
interesting app to build and what I
wanted to build for something that I
could input some text into an old flash
words up on the screen like this and
then be able to control that easily so
my idea was that you could hold your
finger on the screen to make it fly
three words like this but then if you
release the screen it would stop and
then perhaps even some more advanced
controls like so I'm panning to the left
or right to speed up or slow down or
even reverse the direction of the word
so if you wanted to go back and read
something you could so I don't know how
far into that functionality will get
into this video so happens
and we'll try to be playing cool so I've
ready generated an application which I
have open here call it read speeders to
be a little bit of clever something like
that's probably releases anyway what I'm
going to do probably is create a
component a custom component to handle
that speed reading component I think for
now we'll probably just do a tap and
release functionality when holding down
will make the I will make the would
start cycling and letting go will make
them stop but before we do that we're
going to need a way to get some data
into the application so I'm going to
make any data provided first it's going
to suck in some data to the application
our colors you some static data for now
but we'll load it through HTTP requests
so potentially you could just point that
to anything you want and load that text
in so I'm going to come into the
commandment here and generate a new
provider cooled guess we'll call this
one text data and then we're set to make
sure we are including that in the module
file here and add it to the providers
array so let's jump into that now we
already have the HTTP service being
injected and actually since we're using
HTTP in ionic three now also need to
include the HTTP module so we can import
that in our route module file and that
gets imported from the HTTP library in
angular so we'll just add that to the
import section and then we should be
good to go okay so what I'm going to do
here is see well I guess to start off
with it's probably easier just to have
the data directly in this provided here
so we're going to set up a variable
called we'll just call it text and
actually been making more specific
bullets speed reading text and then
we'll just grab some data
somewhere and check it in here okay so
I've just got a a lorem ipsum up here
where we can generate a whole bunch of
words since we are trying to cut a speed
reading app probably makes sense to add
things that we can actually read so i'll
just use their explanation here as an
example and i have to make sure that
there's no double quotes in there so it
doesn't mess up our string and there is
so dis done escape those again we'll
just make it all one line as it's
definitely not the way i want to do it
in the end but for now just for getting
things done quickly we will do it this
way so i'll paste that in there save
that and we will jump into the browser
and we've got a couple errors here
actually in here so why I did it this
dock here that is need that doesn't need
to be defined like that i should
actually give this a type 2 we just give
it a type of string so that should solve
that problem out and then in here is the
M on the from so that should sort those
out module pass failed awesome what did
I do unexpected token it was that I
would still got the from area here maybe
just reserved that to make sure we get
rid of that error looks better look so
it's working now cool so we should be
able to access this data now so if we
wanted to make it grab the speed reading
text directly from from the provider
here but we don't want to just grab
everything what we're going to have to
do is we want to cycle through each one
of these
words so what we actually want to do is
break up this string into an array of
each word that is in the string so
basically want to break it on every
space there is and so ever on what to be
the first element in the array that is
and lorem ipsum and so we'll get this
giant array that we can then cycle
through to display each individual word
so I'm going to create a function here
which will call recorder school to get
speed reading text and rather than
returning that directly we're going to
we're going to break that text up on
each space so to do that we're going to
see is the split function so if we just
return this dot speed reading speed
reading text split and we want to split
that on a space that should break this
up into an array of words so I'll save
that and then we're just going to try
and use that right away in our home page
just to make sure that that works
properly so we're going to import that
text data provided here and then we'll
inject it into the constructor as well
text service actually and then we'll add
an iron viewdidload function here and
we're going to log out the result of a
call to that function so let's stop text
service and what did I cool it get speed
reading text
so hopefully if we load the application
now we should get a giant array of all
the words in that file and it looks like
that's working we have array here which
is has 385 words in there and you can
see all of the individual words and so
now we want to do is display those cycle
through the array at the desired words
per minute and display them on screen so
i think what i would do now is generate
that custom component i talked about and
that we're going to use to handle
displaying these words so we'll create a
new component with our nakji component
and we will call that speed reader so we
had the component generated here and now
i'm just going to inject that or a
rather important here and add it to the
declarations arranged so that we can use
it in the application I'm just going to
change this actually no they generate
like that now so we just need to import
speed reader from
components /p Drita forward slash speed
reader and then we'll just add it here
and I'll just reserve that up vocational
I'm sorry just realize that I'm the
generators phase components actually
include the lazy loading set up by
default so I'm not actually going to use
that in this application with the new
lazy loading with ionic page generally
the X the idea now is to load all of
your components this is a single module
I think is the better idea but we're not
using lazy loading on our home page here
so I don't want to get into that in this
video so I'm just going to remove this
module file and we'll just load the
component as we have in the past so with
that file gone we should be able to load
up our vacation now and sorry there's
some awkward pauses in this video I've
been sick for about the past a week and
I'm trying to not include my coughing
and sneezing in this video so sorry
about it okay so let's jump into trying
to build this component now so basically
what we want to do is pull in those data
into this component and it probably
makes the most sense to include that as
an input so ideally what we want to be
able to do in sour phone file here is
add the speed-reader component so we
just call it speed reader and then we
want to supply as an input the text that
we're pulling in from that data provider
so we'll just call this text to read and
we want to set that equal to some
variable in here which we might just do
now actually so we'll call that we'll
just call that text and will close that
off
so we want to pass in that text into the
speed reader component so add them here
and so rather than logging out this text
now we will just say I will create a
variable in here remember variable
called text I'll just give that a type
of any I I should specify the type as an
array for that and then order set this
to a desktop text equals this text
service get speed reading text so that's
going to load in that text put it onto
this variable and then in our template
that's going to pass in that text as the
text to read input which will be able to
use in a speed reader component so if I
jump in here now what did I already
forgot what i called that already text
to read so if i add an input here or
first important input from the angular
library and i'll add the text to read
input and we'll just call this text so
we have access that as this don't text
throughout this file so then if i add
the ng after view and niche hook here we
should be able to grab whatever that
input was and log it out so i'll just
log that out here will log out this stop
text and I'm gonna make sure I'm not
blowing out anything else cool so jump
back into the browser hopefully those
errors go away I mean how are they
getting on the screen I'm not looking
about any where of course the the
default template for the speed reader or
further any component actually they just
include this text which of course I
ended up calling my variable so could
actually use that so if i get rid of
that that texture disappear as I wanted
to log that out here it doesn't actually
look like on I can get that at that
point I thought that you could access
inputs after energy after viewing it
perhaps I am mistaken
this might be a change in angular for I
guess I haven't used a two months after
check that that is still a que should
not here I'm just realize the problem
isn't ng after view on that I think
that's fine it's just unloading it in in
here on the Iron viewdidload i think is
a bit of a timing issue there today what
I might do is just scoot that out into a
different function that I'm going to
trigger when the user wants to actually
start reading so fully at a button I
think cool to add a button that will
call a function called um start reading
and we're going to add that to the I'm
sorry we're add that to the component
it's so so just jump into here and so
will actually were they really want to
login aking else out yet so I'll just I
was correct the button only for now so
we use an eye on button and will trigger
the function start reading and now it's
just going to be norcs like with a
button will changes to some like tap
input later or something like that now
we'll just call that function and i will
add a start reading function and at that
point we're going to log out the text so
we get rid of this don't need that now
and so when we click this on the home
view loaded should have run and we
should be able to see that text when we
click it so we'll jump back into the
browser again I didn't have any text to
that phone to save start reading and now
if I click on this we get our array of
words which is awesome so i think i
might do now is will have i guess just
like a word which or just a word rather
not world it should just be a string and
we'll change that based on whatever we
want to display so i'll just set it as
use a blank string to start off with and
then in the start reading function
we'll set that to the words that were
using so I start off with we would set
it to the first word so we do this stop
word equals desktop text 0 so we click
start reading we should get the first
word added into this variable and then
we could display that in here so I'll
just add it at the top here for now and
we'll check that that actually works so
it gets what then it's obviously what
we're going to do now is cycle through
all those words and change what that
word is so we'll keep that first bit
there because we do want to set that
straight away and then I guess we'll
just use a good old-fashioned sense into
all and we're going to increment what
word way up to and change that every say
and we start with just one second bursts
out of food so we'll create the function
that we want to run and then run that
every one second which is a thousand
milliseconds and so we're going to keep
track of war word we're up to currently
so I'll just keep an index up here now
just going to a number and start that at
zero I guess we started at one rather
because we're hurry displaying the first
one here and then every one second we
want to increment that so we're going to
start index boss left and then we'll
just set this dot word to equal this
text and then the index that we're up to
and that's actually I'm going to have to
go before the increment because
otherwise I'd wing from it before
displaying that word so I think that
should work and so we jump back in here
again and as referencing this wrong it
should be distal index not just index
and we click start reading again it's
working which is awesome
and an extremely slow speed though it's
obviously we're going to want to speed
that up so I think what I do initially
is I've just said it at a faster speed
of something like 300 words per minute
and then after we will try to get some
more fancy inputs going with touch
events and things like that if we want
300 words per minutes we're going to
have to display one word let's get the
calculator out side by 60 it's all the
way around a 350 / 300 go into this
player word every point two seconds
which is 200 milliseconds so save that
and we'll take a look again and this is
going to break when it gets the end of
the array by the way so a quick start
reading and that should be unless my
maths is wrong here that should be 300
words a minute that the words are
flashing on screener and just had a
curiosity I wanna see what it looks like
if we set that to sign even smaller
let's say well that would be 600 words
per minute we could even go to 1200
words per minute which would be 50 which
is really way faster than we have to
actually read so I'm just curious to see
if it's displaying all the words
correctly it'd be impossible for me to
actually tell if it's skipping words are
not in there but it looks good it looks
like um all the words being displayed
there's just yeah no way I can actually
tell for sure so went until this breaks
I would didn't break look at that and so
we didn't have a check for when it
reaches the end of the array here so
expect me out to air out but it didn't
so basically what we want to do is when
it does get to the end of the array we
want Matt to stop the interval right now
I am assuming it's just getting
undefined values and attempting to
display that just confirm that I
mother's log this out actually let's see
if that is happening so rather than
keeping that interval going we want to
know we want to stop that
at that point so we'll just wait for all
these to finish yes so what is getting a
bunch of undefined values and that's
what's getting all about that the
interval is still going so what we'll do
is we're just going to also keep a
reference to our interval I'll just got
that text interval and then when we
create this would create this dot txt
interval equal sevenfold keep a
reference to that and I forget the
syntax for destroying an interval let me
look that up clearinterval so we should
be able to just do in here we'll just do
it if this dot index is greater than
rather less than the links of the urine
we will increment it otherwise we will
clear that interval
so save that and just double check that
that work should really make the text
shorter so that it runs through quicker
but it's going to leave it as it is for
now and click start reading and whoops
broken something I said once our array
of words here not just the current word
so he won't be still text links instead
so save it again and we'll give it
another shot it's abated I was just
running for the length of the first word
as in if the string was five characters
long that would run five times so looks
like that is working now so we will just
wait again ok cool so that's working
yeah we're actually going one over there
got a bit of an edge condition I guess
this should be if it's less than this
text links take one and then that will
not have that last time defined value
there which is though isn't really a
huge issue but will change that anyway
ok so we've got the basic idea there now
we've got the the text being pulled in
split up into an array of words and then
cycling through those and this is
usually the case with these types of
videos I overestimate our quick i'm
going to be and the videos end up
dragging a lot longer than i thought so
i'll probably do our salute this one
into two parts again so this is really
good place to leave this at the moment
because it does work it's very ugly but
it does work and then i'll record
another video of being able to set the
words to a minute getting rid of this
button and making it display a bit nicer
and basically it's using those touch
controls i talked about where you would
be able to hold onto the screen to cycle
through the words and let go to stop as
those sorts of things
if I did that in this video I think it's
going to drag up too long so I'll leave
it for them and i'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
