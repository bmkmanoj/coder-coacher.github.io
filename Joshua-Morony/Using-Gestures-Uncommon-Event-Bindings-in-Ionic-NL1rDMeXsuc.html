how to use some event bindings other
than the default click event which you
may be used to using in ionic 2
applications so I've got a little
application set up here now to weather
just for the button I'm going to event
binding that runs a function when click
so if I click this it says we did it now
we'll just quickly take a look at the
code for that I have the template here
now we have the click event setup here
and that's going to trigger the do
something function in the home page
class here and all its doing is logging
out that a statement now for the most
part this is all you'll really ever have
to use for most of the time I use a
quick event on your buttons to launch a
page or do whatever most of the time you
just need a simple click event for
mobile applications because you'll just
have the user tapping on the screen
various parts of the application to
trigger certain events but there are
other events we can use as well there
are some inbuilt gestures that we can
make use of the typical sort of gestures
that you might use on a mobile
application aside from simple caps like
pressing and swiping in those kinds of
things and the way we can use those is
actually really easy all you have to do
is replace this click weird where
whatever event you want to use so we
have a tap press pants white rotate
pinch we can make use of all of those so
I'm just going to show you a few right
now that I can actually show you on the
computer obviously I can't do things
like pinching but if I change this to
let's go with press instead save that
and jump back in here so if I click this
now if I just click it quickly nothing
happens but if I click and hold for just
a second and we did it logs out again
because that's how the
press gesture works we could use a pan
which is kind of like a dragging gesture
passing the way you'd sort of pan a
picture left to right or something like
that and it's a bit silly to put a pan
event on a button but we can do it if we
want to so if I try that now you can see
as I sort of drag to the left there I'm
getting a whole bunch of council
statements being logged out and say I'm
so dragged back to the right again and I
can even go up and down as well and I'll
just use one more example we'll try the
the swipe gesture save that again and
now to trigger that event I'm going to
have to do a quick little swipe ad to
the right or to the left and you can see
it
logging out there if I did this with a
slow pan as I just did before it doesn't
do anything so those are some common
things you'll probably want to use in a
mobile application but they aren't the
only events we can use I've also got a
Dom event Wikipedia page up here and so
we can essentially we can hook into any
kind of Dom event we have the HTML
events here there's a few examples here
of things we can use so we can use these
any of these sort of native events that
are available through the Dom we can
listen to them in our event bindings now
some things aren't going to be relevant
to our button of course we're not going
to now we're probably not going to
listen to this in a load event on a
button you might use the load event to
listen for when an image loads but we
can do we can use some of these on the
button as well we can even use something
like say key down if I was to change
this to key down and again this is a
pretty silly example because you
probably not going to want to use this
on a button but we can so if I jump back
into the app again now and if I first
have to focus
I give focus that button by clicking on
it I would fight hit any key on my
keyboard now maybe you can hear me
typing you can see it's getting louder
every time
something and then we could even get
more specific than that so if we want to
listen for a specific key I could do
keydown got a space and if we jump back
in here again if I first focus that and
now start typing no statements are being
logged out to the console but if I hit
the spacebar it does get logged out so
we're listening they're listening for a
specific key so again you probably not
going to want to listen for key presses
on a button but you could easily use
that in a text field for example so I
just want to give a really quick example
of how you can use those event bindings
for more than just a simple click event
obviously the gestures can come in quite
useful for mobile applications
specifically with things like pinching
and panning and things like that
but also the ability to listen to these
dominant is also very useful okay so I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I'll
see you in the next one
