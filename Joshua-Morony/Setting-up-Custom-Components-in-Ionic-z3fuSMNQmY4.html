at how to include custom components and
directives in an ionic application so of
course we have a lot of components that
I on ik provides for us by default but
at some point we may want to include our
own custom components that we create or
perhaps we want to include components
that others have created into our
application but there's a few things we
need to be aware of when we are doing
that it's not as easy as just importing
the component having it available so
what we're going to do is just run
through an example of we're going to
generate our own components and
directives and then we're going to talk
about some ways that you can set those
up in an application so I'm just going
to expand the source folder now and
right now we don't have any custom
components or directives and define in
here that's what we're going to do is
generate some using the command line
interface for ionic and then we're going
to look at how to set those up properly
so if I want to create my own custom
component I can just run around ionic G
component and then the name of the
component so we'll just call this test a
test one and then once that has finished
running you would have seen over here we
have a components folder now and we have
that test one component in here and I
could do the same for a directive as
well I just need to run ionic G
directive and we do test two and it's
going to generate the directive for us
and it will add it to a directives
folder and again we can see the
directive in this folder now so since
this component here has a selector of
test one that means that we're going to
be able to use it in an application like
at least I could just add the test one
tag and that's going to inject that
component now but before that works
we'll need to actually set it up and so
the most obvious way to do that used to
add it to our main module file as you
can see this is where we declare other
things in the application we declare our
components like a home page here we set
up our providers and any other modules
that we're importing into the
application and so we can also
set that component up as a declaration
here so all I need to do is import that
I can import test one component from
components test one test one so that's
going to set that up as a declaration
here and that's going to make that
available in the application so if I add
test one component as a declaration I
will now be able to use that in this
home page template and I can do the same
with the directive I could import it set
it up as a declaration and we'd be able
to use the directive but there are some
issues with this and one issue that you
likely quickly run into is if you're
using a lazy loaded page so by default
this home page isn't lazy loaded right
now but if I generate a new page or
anionic ji page I'll just call this on
second you'll see that this is generated
as a lazy loaded page so we have a our
pages module here and we can see we have
the ionic page decorator setup so this
is going to be lazy loaded and so since
it's a lazy loaded module has its own
web browser since it's a lazy loaded
page it has its own module as you can
see here it's going to turn declarations
and imports defined in its own ng module
so this is just like our algorithm G
module we have here except this lazy
loaded page has its own module but the
problem with this is that if we add a
declaration in our main module here
we've set up tests one component we
aren't going to be able to access that
in our lazy loaded page so if we were to
attempt to write test one in a lazy
loaded page here even though it's being
imported and set up in our route module
it's not going to work so naturally
where you might go from there is to
think well since we added it to a route
module here all we need to do is then
also declare that same component in our
module for the lazy loaded page but you
cannot declare a component more than
once it can only belong in one
declarations field in a single ng module
so now we're in a bit of an awkward
situation where we can only import our
component into one page here we can
either have it available for the home
page or we could have it available when
our lazy
Paige here but we can't have it in books
and the reason for that is that
limitation that we can't declare it
twice and so the solution for this is to
create something called a shared module
and this is actually what Bionic does by
default for us it creates a single
shared components module and a single
shared directed module and the purpose
of this module is to declare all of our
components and then we can import that
module into wherever we want to use it
so rather than adding the component
directly as a declaration here I'd
remove that and I'd instead import the
components module and that would be
imported from components forward slash
components module and then we would add
that as an import and so that should say
important on imports at the top then so
we're no longer declaring that a single
component we've created a module that
embedded declares the component for us
and then we import that module into our
main module and the benefit of doing
this is that we can also import it into
a lazy loaded module here as one so we
do the same thing we did in port the
components module and add it as an
import and we're allowed to do this
we're allowed to import a module in
multiple places we can't declare
something in multiple places but we can
import other modules so the way this
works by default is that any component
that we generate with the command-line
interface is going to be added to this
single shared NG module so just to show
you that if I need enter an ionic G
component let's call this one another
now we can see that the another
component has dropped in there but we
can also see that this components don't
module file has been updated to also
include that new component that we
decided so now anywhere that we are
importing this components module we'll
also be able to access another component
now so we'll be able to access both of
these so now we can just import this
module wherever you want to use the
components we can import it as many
times as we need in as many different
pages as we need and we'll be able to
access all of our custom component
so this is the way that it works by
default and this is a kind of nice easy
convenient way to manage your components
this makes everything sort of available
everywhere but there are some downsides
to that in that you might not want to
import every single component into a
page you might just want to use one and
so the downside of this approach is that
we're including everything in one giant
module so there are other approaches you
could use as well rather than having a
single shared components module you
could have a separate module for every
component and directive so rather than
having a components to module dot TS we
might have a another module TS and test
one module TS which just declares a
single component and then you import
that and another more manageable and
maintainable way to do it is to create
multiple shared modules and you kind of
group related components and directives
into a single module so that you're only
are the importing a bunch of things
where you need to use them but that
approach can be a little bit harder to
figure out because you need to determine
which which modules to group together so
that you can best import them into your
application but I think this this
approach here is good for most
applications probably as long as you
don't have you know tons and tons of
components if you just have a few custom
components you want to import and make
available in your application I think
this is a good approach just to have
that single shared components module and
a single shared directives module and
then just import that wherever you need
okay so I hope you enjoyed this video
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
