video tutorial this time I'm gonna look
at how to create certificates and
provisioning profiles for your iOS
applications and specifically how to do
that on a Windows computer if you want
to install your applications onto your
device or was a speed them to the App
Store's you will need to create these
certificates before you do that so it
can be a little bit tricky someone's
going to step through how to do that
exactly so first you will have to be a
part of the iOS developer program it
cost $99 per year at the moment so
you'll need to get access to their
member Center before you can actually do
this
but once you've done that you can just
log in through the developer.apple.com
website I'll just leave that there for
now and jump into open SSL and this is
the other thing you're going to need to
do as well
and to do this from Windows computer if
you do have a Mac and you're running
Xcode there's a probably a much easier
way to do this you'll probably want to
Google how to go about creating the
certificates on a Mac but for Windows
you will need to download open SSL just
follow the instructions on this website
to get it up and running once you do
have that installed go ahead and run it
as an administrator it's important that
you run the program as an administrator
otherwise some of the commands won't
work so once you've got your command
from we're just going to change the
directory into the open SSL that we just
installed so for me that's open SSL win
64 may be different for you depending on
what version you had to install your
system and I'm just going to change it
to the bin directory in there so what we
need to do first is create a private key
so we can do that by running open SSL
which in RSA out and then the name of
the private key so obvious
this example key key and then we want to
put 2048 okay so once that's generated
that'll create the file inside of the
bin folder I'll just pull that up now so
you can take a look at that so you can
see here for that example key donkey
sitting in there now so what we want to
do after that is to use that key to
generate a certificate signing request
and to do that we're just going to run
another command and that is open SSL Ric
new key the key name that was created
and slipping my mind already
it's an example key it's okay I'm
probably gonna enter in something wrong
here as I'm talking it aloud as I'm
being recorded announce and then the
name of the certificate signing request
I'm just going to call it example CSR
and don't assert signing request and
then subjects and then you just enter in
some details about you here so we can
put in our email address so just make
that new at whatever calm and see any
cool was your name its output Josh
Maroney and C equals hey use that's the
country code so for me I'm from
Australia so I put a you there so we'll
run that hopefully it all works and
appear surf so I'll just check in here
again that that actually generated and
you can see it here now so now that has
generated I'm going to go into the Apple
developer portal and just go under the
certificates section
so click on certificates and now we want
to create a iOS development certificate
so we're going to push the plus button
here to add one choose iOS app
development if you do want to create a
production application actually submit
it through the App Store you follow the
same steps but you will choose a
distribution certificate instead of a
development one click continue and now
it's gonna ask us for that CSR file that
we've just created so I'm going to
upload that now okay now put that
uploaded I can just click generate wait
for it to load okay now that's ready I
can just download that and I'm gonna
save that into the same directory as the
others in that bin folder in OpenSSL we
don't have to save it in there but it
saves having to type out the exact path
as you're running a command so I find
it's a lot easier to just save it in
that folder straight away okay so I've
just saved that as iOS underscore
development in the same folder again
once you finish downloading that now
we're going to create and identify it
for our application so you can see I've
got a lot of junk in here right now but
we want to add a new one and so we'll
call this example I guess obviously call
it whatever your application is actually
called have a unique ID for it so I'll
call that comandante Josh Maroni dance
example now obviously you're going to
want to activate whatever services you
need here so just notice you can't
actually have an underscore for that you
can only use certain characters for the
name
so now that I've fixed that I should be
able to put continue I have a look over
everything make sure it's correct then
click Submit
okay now we've finished redress
registering that app ID after you
registered the app ID now we're going to
come into devices and these are the
devices of anyone including yourself
that you want to be able to use the
application if you try and store on a
phone that isn't listed here then it
won't work so you're just going to click
Add button here name the device and then
it's going to ask for the UDID
so that's the unique identifier for the
device to find that you can just plug
your phone in open up iTunes and then
under the device information section
you'll see a little section called
serial and I'll have a short serial
number that's not the number you need to
put in here
but if you click on that it'll change
into UD ID which is a thing getting 40
character long string so it's a bit of a
pain to type out but just put that in
here register the device and then you'll
be able to install it on that device
later finally we're going to come down
to provisioning profile so we want to
create a development provisioning
profile and as I mentioned before if you
are creating a distribution one
obviously created distribution one now
so I clicked on an ad select iOS app
development continue and now we're going
to choose that ID that we just created
so for example up here continue I choose
the certificate that you just created
and click continue and then select
everyone that you want to be able to
install an application for so I'll just
select or give it a name I'll call it
example element
and once that's ready again download it
and save it in that same open SSL bin
directory
okay so I have that downloaded now it's
called example underscore development
mobile provision so now that's ready
we're going to jump back into open SSL
again and run a couple more commands to
create the p12 file so we're going to
run open SSL x.509 in and then the name
of the certificate which was iOS
underscore development dot C ah inform
the ER out and then whatever this file
is going to be called so I'll call it
example underscore m dot PE m and now
form PM I've made a mistake if somewhere
let me see if I can spot it
okay I just picked up with that era was
an extra - here which I shouldn't have
done I don't remember these commands of
my heart by the way I do have these up
unless they're just pull up whenever I
need to do this maybe eventually I will
be able to remember it all but obviously
that's not really important as long as
we can actually create it so let me just
check that created now and again I'll
pull this over and you can see it there
the example permission file we just
created and there's one final step we
need to do and that's to obviously
create the p12 file using the file we
just created so now we're going to run
OpenSSL pkcs12 export in key and we're
going to use the name of the key that we
developed at the start which was example
key key in and then the name of the
permission file we just created so
example underscore PMPM and then out
then the name of the p12 file so let's
call it just example p12 dot P 12 and
now it's gonna ask us for an export
password so I will just use like really
silly like test but now obviously make
this a stronger password confirm that
and make sure you obviously remember
that password keep track of it somewhere
but once you do that the p12 file should
be created over here and then you can
use that to build your application
actually get it on your device so I hope
this tutorial was helpful as always if
there's a you have any questions or
comments feel free to leave them in the
video or on the blog and I'll try and
get back to you
