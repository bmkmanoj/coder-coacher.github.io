little bit of time theming
this application that's on screen now so
this is an application that we've been
building over a few weeks now it's a
pouch DB and couchdb powered ionic 2
blog and so I've done about I think four
or five tutorials on this now and we're
just stepping through how to use CouchDB
how to use couchdb and use that to build
a sort of blogging application and so if
you jump further than here you can see
like you can see the documents in this
database here that we're using to power
the application but does not really want
I want to focus on in this tutorial if
you do want to see how to build this as
it is so far I'll link to the tutorials
for that I may or may not build on this
further in the future it does most basic
things now you can see a list of blog
posts you can go into a blog post and
see comments you can add a comment you
can add posts but what should be pretty
clear from looking at this now is that
it's pretty ugly it's just using
bare-bones default basic components no
styling whatsoever no thought really put
into you know how this looks
it's just the core functionality that
we've put in there so far so I thought I
would create this tutorial I wanted to
make this look nicer and I thought it
would work well has a bit of a video
another sort of live coding video where
I sort of just step through theming and
application as I you know would do it
sort of just on my own I don't have an
idea of what I want to do already so I'm
just going to go through on-screen try
out a few things and see if we can make
this look a little bit nicer than it is
right now so what I would do first when
in trying to make an application look
nicer give it a nice theme is to come up
with a nicer color scheme and make use
of ionics primary and secondary color
and so on and so good way I find to do
that I often use this site called flat
UI colors sometimes I'll just pick a
color in Photoshop or something like
that but I find these sort of it's just
a few colors here it's not very
overwhelming but there is nice
sort of base colors to use and they look
kind of modern and they're kind of you
know bright and nice to use so I often
use a color from here and another good
site that I found recently is this color
schemer and what this allows you to do
is put a color in here and it's going to
give you a palette of colors that are
similar to that color that you know work
well with it
so a good thing to do is maybe to pick a
color from here shove it in the color
schemer and we'll give you some nice
colors that you can use as the two the
primary secondary and light colors in
the theme folder key and the variables
dot scss and then we can use these you
know throughout the application and get
you know some nice colors going on so
what I'm going to do is where are we
we'll go for the red color here which is
kind of like to be a patchy couchdb logo
I could just use that color but we'll go
with this one and I'll just paste that
in here and then we'll build up a nice
sort of palette to use so I might use
I'll use that as the primary color so
we'll just put that there and we use
throw this pinkish color as the
secondary color so we'll just paste that
in here and we use this is the light
color and then this as the dark and
probably I'm probably not going to use
the danger color we use this one we're
not going to use it but if we do we'll
use that this is going to be this is
going to be a very red application
usually be nice to you have a sort of
color to contrast that with but I think
this will work well for the CouchDB
application so now that we have our
colors of make sure to save that and
then we're going to use those throughout
our pages so we'll go back into this now
and let me just resurface so we can see
changes as we do them okay so I've got
the application area served now you can
already see that the because we change
the primary color the plus icon here has
changed to red same with these icons as
well so what we're going to do is we're
going to make use of those now in a few
places throughout the application so
let's try first of all changing the note
bar so if I come into that home page
here and we'll just add the primary
color to the notes bar apparently I
forgot to come back to my time machine
today that's a really old way to do it
in ionic so you used to add it but it is
now color equals and then a name cool so
we can see the red now and I could've
also changed a white now too so that
it's actually a visible on that the
background with the primary color and I
might also try to use that same color as
the background color for the entire
application so if I come into the
variables file again here and we can set
a shared variable called background
color now I forget that this is a hyphen
or not let me just try this so just use
the primary color as a background color
see if that works
yeah so now the entire thing is red
which I think will work but we got to
make some changes first so what I might
do is remove these lines from the list
and perhaps they might even change this
to be some cards instead of a list so
right now we'll just go I on items and a
list but it might look nice to see the
blogpost perhaps you want to make these
kind of their own individual cards more
like Facebook feed like a blog style
thing so we'll just change this into I
can delete the list
and we'll just change these into ion
cards and we'll put the post title
inside of will add that inside of that I
own card header
and then inside of the iron card content
are we don't have anything to put in
there yet but let's just see what this
looks like I just write something save
that and take a look at it okay so now
we've got some some cards there which
need to be styled a bit more but this is
looking more kind of blog post di thing
so what we might do is just pull in a
bit of content from the post to have
where I just put hello and then maybe
even will style the backgrounds of these
to make them why let's just do that for
now so if I look into the database here
they go into one of the flog Pro so
you've got different fields here so we
can make use of this content I only want
to return just to start up a perhaps a
little snippet of the content so I'll
replace this with post content oops oh
now right now you can see the entire
content of the blog post which isn't
really a problem for these ones because
they just got some a small amount of
dummy data in there but for this one
that seemed quite long probably too long
for a little summary so there's a few
ways we could deal with this issue we
could have a set for summary field
perhaps and bring that in instead we
could run this through a pipe perhaps so
that we trim this content down to a
reasonable length or we could even just
use CSS directly in to set a max with a
rather max height on the post here I
think that's what I'm going to do so if
it's easier thing to do right away and
it makes sense in the context of this
video so I'm going to set these to a
specific height and I don't know what
that is yet so I'm going to inspect
element here and we're going to modify
that directly through the debugger so if
I click on one of these cards here we'll
click on the big one and two I can now
set some specific height on here so also
max I it so it can be smaller but we we
could say I don't want this to be any
bigger than say 200 pixels and so that's
probably a reasonable size might go down
a little bit more
150 pixels so that works pretty well I
think okay so now that we know that 150
pixels is a nice height we can go and
actually add that to our SPSS here so if
I create a selector here called
I on card because we just want to apply
this to all the cards on this page if I
set the max height 150 there and one
thing that I typically do when theming
is I'll surround all of my rules here
with an iOS and MD class and so this
will target things specifically on just
iOS and Android
now the reason I do this is because it
increases the specificity of the the
rules that we're creating here so I'm
CSS when you know when there's two rules
that are targeting the same thing the
one that's more specific for win so I
don't cause a lot of their own rules
which can sometimes beat your rules when
you're trying to see in something so I'm
making I was more specific with this
generic class most of the time as our
rules will win and you don't have to
worry about doing things like adding in
portion or something like that so save
that check that it all works okay so
yeah it looks like we've got a 150 pixel
tool summary there now
and so what I might do now just keep
styling this card so let's try a
background color of do f6 which is kind
of like a off-white type color it's
really two the two gray it will go with
something a little bit lighter than that
so you can also bring up the debugger
here click on that card you can see what
the background color there into click
that and then we can to mess around with
this slider here so we get something we
like and why not just straight-up
white that seems to work well so we'll
just use that instead and now I probably
want to bring a little bit more just
focus on the title of the post rather
than a summary here so I'm going to
create another rule nested in here for
the iron card
10 and let's try slightly full a smaller
font size
there's not that down just a little bit
and I reckon may even a little bit more
of a gray color one thing it's really
better just to set the color but I'm
going to cheat a little bit here and
just reduce the opacity of the text so
that it's not so visible so we've got a
0.5 opacity there that seems to work
well again it's probably better
technically to actually just have that
as that gray color then rather than
reducing the opacity but I'll leave it
at that for now another thing that might
work well here is a an image for each of
the blog posts so we could perhaps
either have an image right at the top or
we could have a little icon off to the
side so I think it will probably work
well on top of the card I think so we
can either put it inside of the card or
maybe we'll try we could do it outside
of the card if we move this loop loop
over a div for example but what I'll do
I'll try and put it inside of the header
first and we'll see if that works
so what I often do for just testing our
images is just use placeholder for the
play fold it and then you're going to
specify any size of image you want and
we'll pull in a placeholder image at
that size so we'll try a 600 by 300 and
we'll see what that looks like okay so
we've got our image getting pulled in
there of course we've set that sort of
max height on the card there so it's
pushing all the rest of the content down
so we'll worry about that later
but for now we'll just try and get this
image set up so that it's kind of
aligned with the court of the corner so
there's no padding or anything there so
to do that if I hover over the eye on
card header here you can see we have a
bunch of padding green stuff is padding
and margins will show up
orange so we want to remove that padding
then so if I just untick this you can
see that's basically what we want as so
all I'm going to do then is apply a
padding of zero to the eye on card
header so we'll come into this file
again here the CSS file or the style
file and as a rule for iron eye on card
header and we'll set the padding to zero
okay so we've got our image up there now
I think that's probably actually a
pretty good size for it we just have to
expand the card so that it um still
display that content as well so let's
bring up that card again and we set this
max out of 150 so let's try set that to
say 250 yeah that's a pretty good size I
think maybe 300 even yeah I think I
think that works pretty well so we'll
change that max ID to 300 okay so we got
the height set obviously now we have to
fix the padding for so this title here
because we remove the padding from the
card itself and now everything is
flowing to the edges as well as the
image so we'll just add some individual
padding for this content area we might
just create a container for it before
you do that though the the line here is
kind of annoying so what we can do on
the the header is we can just use no
border and that's going to remove that
little bottom border for us then yeah I
think I said that and what I actually
think it might be cool as well is if we
add a little bit of a drop shadow or a
box shadow rather to that navbar there
it can be quite hard to remember how to
use how to write the drop shadow to kind
of position at how you want so I often
use this thing called just to forget the
sightings pop shadow generator I'll just
bring that up now yeah so I usually just
come to this site here CSS
maduk come forward slash box-shadow and
then you can just kind of play around
with the shadow so we'll just create
something here that I think would look
good and I'll get a bit of a blur to
that juice the spread a little bit and
75 opacity is probably good okay so we
can just copy these and drop it into our
our CSS so add that to the navbar and if
you're wondering why there's multiple
values here this is just for different
browsers so this for Mozilla just for
the WebKit browsers and this is just a
four normal property I think this should
work on on both iOS and Android with
just this one just this one line here
but this negatives really increase the
browser compatibility if you wanted to
run this on things other than iOS and
Android it's been a while since I've
looked at where exactly these work but
that's why there's the multiple lines in
okay so now we have this shadow under
the navbar here which is probably a
little bit much now I think it's almost
good what I might do is just reduce that
vertical length of it so which one is
that negative three so that's just this
first value here the one so just change
that to negative three and we'll take
another look and yeah I think that looks
pretty good so we've kind of got this
more 3d kind of effect now it looks like
the navbar is kind of floating it off
the page a bit so I like that more now
we need back on track and get back to
what we were originally talking about
and that's adding the padding back to
these coasts here so as I mentioned or
at least I hope I mentioned I set it in
my head at least I'm going to add a
container around the content area so
actually I can't add a cotton round over
because the image is in the head a bit
as to where the title itself is so what
I will do is I have to add some specific
styling for this post title here and I'm
actually going to make the header I
thought I did that already
we'll give that a good heading to we'll
see how that looks
now maybe yeah use h1 see how that looks
yeah we'll go with the heading term
we'll just change the font size manually
a bit I think
so what we are going to do is we're
going to add some padding to that or a
margin rather to that h2 and then we're
also going to add some padding to the
card content which there is kind of
rethink on some padding there already
we'll see how it looks once we've done
this one so we'll create so that's
inside of our card and so we can do like
the h2 in here or you can do it out here
doesn't really matter because there's no
h2s on the page I will just do up here
and we will give it a margin of 20
pixels I should probably do this in the
debugger to make it easier yeah it's
good I like that distance and then
probably make this a bit bigger maybe
just change the font weight to fold yeah
that'd work so we'll give this a bold
font way and then we just want to move
this as well the the summary area which
is the iron card content and so that's
pretty well positioned already I think I
just want to give it a bit more of a
left merge and I think so we'll do the
less in the right margin and maybe we'll
try a 25 pixels for that one so what is
the margin margin left
we're just do 15 pixels each side just
to start off with the still that looks
like and yeah I think I think that's
pretty good
as you know I've changed my mind I want
it to be catered to ten I want that to
be aligned with the title here that's
wrong as well it's five yeah I think
that looks better than is aligned and I
think the last thing I might ride is for
now is changing the border radius on
this card here nice huge fan of the
rounded corners so and you can see here
see that orange around the sides that's
the margin that I was talking about
before that shows up as orange in the
debugger here and so we've got a border
radius of two pixels right now so I'm
just going to uncheck that and yeah I
think the no border radius so if you
focus on the corners here you can see
that's slightly rounded and then not
rounded when I uncheck that so I think
we'll just take that off and I think
there's only a iOS only thing but we
will apply that to everything and so if
I want to add some styles to code I
might just move this off there said
border radius to zero and I'll just
refresh that to make sure that worked
properly as you may notice when you
change styles your application doesn't
necessarily do a full refresh it is kind
of a hot replace for the style which can
if you are sort of debugging in here as
well you might make a manual change here
that's kind of overriding thing you did
so sometimes it helps just to do a full
refresh of the page to check that the
Styles you have in here are doing all
the work not things that you've manually
changed in the debugger so I originally
planned to do basically the whole
application in this video is I think the
video is going a bit long now my sin on
the computer is starting to complain so
I might have to cut this off here but I
probably will do another video where I
go through styling the rest of this
content and the post content the
comments area and stuff like that and so
you know what we've done so far
certainly is an amazing we've just
really just fiddled around with a few
things
so I think it looks like not a lot nicer
now not obviously a little bit more like
what a blog application would look like
and I might just check and it sort of
looks like in the s5 on an Android
device and yeah pretty much the same
holo difference here it's good to check
on on both to see what they look like
because there are a few style
differences between iOS and Android so
you might be saying it looks nice on the
iPhone but it could look awful on the
Android so yeah always good to check but
I see I'm going to leave that video
there for now hope you enjoyed this hope
it was useful and I will see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
