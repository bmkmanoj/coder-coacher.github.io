how to use a semantic style approach to
CSS in ionic 2 it's not really specific
to ionic - but I'll be using this a
application I created with ionic - this
is a tutorial I posted last week so I'll
link to that in the description so you
can check it out if you want but I'm
going to talk through how I usually
approach CSS styling in ionic 2 and
specifically how I created this
interface here so what I mean when I say
semantic style.css if it's jump into the
code for this application here this is
the s CSS file I have for that
particular page we were just looking at
and what you'll notice if you take a
look at the Styles I have here is that I
don't really use any classes or IDs I'm
mainly just using the names of the
actual elements themselves so I have a
selector here for iron avatar and that
it's just the element name itself it's
not a class the only classes I'm
actually using here are the alternate
and playing classes which I set up
somewhere in here so I've got a ng class
up here which is we either apply the
alternate or the playing class depending
on some condition but apart from that
everything else not nothing in here as a
class or a ID that I'm targeting now I'm
not going to talk about whether this is
a better approach I'm not sure if this
is considered to be best practice but
it's something that I prefer to do I
find it easier to work with there's less
code to write in here and it feels
easier to maintain to me so this is the
style of style of styling that I prefer
but the problem with using this sort of
approach is how to then
apply the styles you want to specific
things like if I want to target
something specific in this template how
do I get that one specific thing that I
want to grab without using a class or an
ID or something like that so using a
class or an ID isn't necessarily a bad
thing it is like I'm using some here
it's not something that has to be
avoided at all costs but usually you can
grab references to things the things you
want without having to resort to using a
hard-coded class in your template so I'm
just going to walk through that CSS I
have here and then just talk about a
couple extra strategies you could use to
grab references to there are two
specific things and so one of the
coolest things we have in when using i2
since it uses sass is we can use this
selector nesting so you'll see here the
first this is all contained in sort of
one giant CSS selector we have iOS and
MD we can select these classes here to
apply style specifically to iOS or
Android so anything that's surrounded in
one of these two tags is only going to
be applied to that specific platform
since I want this to apply to both
Android and iOS I just use both here
now the reason I'm even including that
is because of something called specific
in CSS so what that means is basically
the most specific CSS rule is the one
that is going to get applied since ionic
has a lot of its own styling I usually
just put wrap everything in these
classes here to make my rules more
specific so most the time if I'm trying
to apply some styling and ionic is also
trying to apply some styling my rules
will win and then I also have it wrapped
inside of this page home selector and so
the home page has a selector of Page
home so that means that all of this is
going to be wrapped in an element in the
Dom although we can't see here
we called Paige home and that's going to
contain everything so any styles that I
add inside of that are only going to
apply to this specific component which
is a really nice way to separate code
out into components so we we don't have
to worry about styles we're writing here
conflicting with some styles we wrote
for a different page and that's
especially useful if we're taking this
semantic approach to styling because
we're not adding those specific classes
we're just targeting these generic
elements which will probably be in other
pages as well so if we look down this
list most of what you'll see is I'm just
using element selectors directly rather
than using a class or an ID selector
which would have a dot at the start for
a class or a hash for a for an ID so I'm
just targeting the element specifically
and then if you take a look at the last
select I have here that I on footer I've
then nested some rules inside of that I
on footer selector so what I'm saying
here is I only want to grab the columns
that are inside iron footer now this
doesn't really matter in this case
because I don't have any columns up here
anyway but let's say if I had some
columns down here and some columns up
here I only want to target the columns
that are down here that's one way that I
can just specifically get those columns
is by nesting it inside of its parent
element which is our own footer so this
can be a really good way to grab those
specific references because we can we
can create as many levels of nesting
here as we want we could have why only
want to select a paragraph element that
is inside of an iron column that is
inside of an ion footer and then you
could go even further than that and nest
something inside of there as well now I
like not to get too crazy with the
nesting like usually one of two or three
levels most of nesting is what I prefer
to stick to but you can nest as much as
you want if I am getting down into some
really specific things where I'd have to
an element that's nested five different
times I will that's when I would
probably resort to just using a class
because it makes sense this is perhaps I
have some really specific element that's
just in this one place and I just need
to start that one thing I will just add
a class to it so there's no hard and
fast rules here just do what makes sense
to you
so aside from nesting there are some
other things we can do to grab
references to specific things and one
thing I am doing here is creating an
attribute selector so I've wrapped I on
item here in some square brackets and
that's the syntax you use if you want to
select an element by an attribute that
it has so if we look in here again
you'll see that I am using a button this
is a musing button for the ion list
because it is clickable so rather than
using an eye on item as the actual
element instead supply the eye on item
as an attribute and so I can use that
attribute to grab a reference to this
element which I'm then styling and so
the reason I might want to grab this
attribute specifically it's because if
you look down here I've got some buttons
down here as well and so if I tried to
take this semantic approach I might just
say okay well I want to style the button
it's not a right button and add the
styling but the problem with that is
it's also going to apply to these as
well so a more a better way for me to
describe what I want to do is grab a
reference to the iron item instead
because that is what I'm styling if I
wanted to just target these buttons down
here specifically and not this button
perhaps I would instead or since it's in
the footer and I want to start all
buttons in the footer I would just nest
this inside of my own footer instead
and now that Starling would only apply
two buttons in the footer and a better
way to do this would actually mean to
remove that button inside of this
selector here just to neaten things up a
bit and you can even get more specific
than that with attributes so if we take
the columns down here for example they
have an attribute but they also have a
value for the attribute so they have a
width of 33 and so let's say I want to
specifically grab only I on columns I
have a width of 33 what I can do is I
can create another rule here and we'll
put it inside of iron footer just
because that's where it is and sort of
organizes things nicely and it's going
to make sure that you know we're not
targeting columns with the width of 33
that are outside of the footer so I
could come in here and I could add a
rule of attribute selector here that
grabs width and then supply a value as
well so we want elements with an
attribute of widths that also have a
value of 33 so if I just set that to
display:none
and we'll see if that applies correctly
so you see it just this is disappeared
there so that means this rule has
successfully grabbed any columns with a
width of 33 or rather anything with an
attribute of width that is set to 33 so
then if I wanted to be even more
specific it doesn't matter in this case
because these columns are the only
things that have that width attribute
but if I had other things with a width
attribute as well I could instead supply
the element here as well so now it's
saying I want to grab on columns with
specifically iron columns with a width
of 33 so I saved it again and make sure
it still applies it does
so just delete that for now save it and
see if it comes back okay cool
so another useful thing that I'm not
using here is let's say I want to apply
some specific styling only to the first
item in the list so maybe I have
something at the top here that I want to
display and some reason I want to move
just that first item down but I don't
want to apply any margin to the rest of
them now in this case I would probably
just apply that margin to the list
itself to push the whole list down but
let's say for some reason we want to
apply some styling specifically to this
just this first item and so what we can
do to achieve that so we have were using
these buttons here and like before we
grabbed a reference to this eye on item
attribute so we're going to use that as
the selector again so let's say I want
to add that margin to the first element
in the list I could do iron item first
of type and so this is a pseudo selector
it's a call to pseudo selector I guess
because it doesn't really something that
exists in the document but we're
describing me the type of element that
we want to grab here and there's lots of
these this is just one example but you
can have things like last of type and
first child and trial to grab any number
of children you also have your standard
sort of hover and active pseudo
selectors so if I just apply a margin
top of 100 pixels here and save that we
should see that now we have this big gap
above the first item but if I wasn't
specifically grabbing a reference to the
first one using a pseudo selector and
save that now the margin applies to
every single item and we have big gaps
between everything which is probably not
what we want so good resource to check
for these sort of pseudo selectors and
all kinds of selectors you can use is
this CSS selectors reference on
w3schools they have a list of all the
types of selectors here that you can use
there's obviously a lot of different
ones you can see the ones I was talking
about before we have the last of type
and LA last child but each of these has
a as a description of what the selector
does so you'll be able to see how you
can grab references to different things
based on what you want to do so there's
a ton of different ways you can grab
references to your elements without
having to use classes or IDs and when
you take this approach I think the end
result is a lot neater we don't have to
mess up our template code here with a
bunch of custom classes and ID's that
we're hooking into so it's it's faster
to write it's faster to code with looks
cleaner and I find it just to be yet
more organized in general but again I
just want to reiterate that it's not bad
to use classes they're there for a
reason and I'm using them here and you
should use them too it's just I
generally try to avoid using a class
where I don't need to okay so I hope
this tutorial gave you it's a little bit
of an insight into how I go about
styling applications and maybe how you
might apply some of that to your own
styling as well especially when we're
using assess with ionic 2 we can do a
lot of really powerful stuff with our
styling even some things I haven't
mentioned here like these custom sass
variables I've set up for the card
height here perhaps over to another
video on that at some point but it takes
some time too if you're not familiar
with the different parts this yes CSS
selectors take some time to get familiar
with them try using some of them in your
applications and and see how it might
make
the code for your applications a little
bit simpler in a little bit cleaner okay
so I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and
I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
