use get with your ionic 2 projects so if
you haven't used get before
essentially it's a version control
revision control tool that you can use
basically for any kind of codes you have
but of course we can use it in our ion
ik2 projects so it allows you to backup
your code you can push it to some
repository somewhere so if you ever lose
that you can easily get it back it
provides revision control so if you were
to make some changes to your project
which ruined it starts breaking
something you don't know what's going
wrong you can always roll back to a
previous version then you can go back
forward again to the latest version so
it makes things a lot easier to manage
and it also allows you to share your
code with other people have them work on
it on their own computers push that code
back to a single repository where you
can both work on this simultaneously
without sort of getting in each other's
way too much this tutorial isn't going
to go in-depth into how to use git and
all its features because there is a lot
of things you can do with kit this is
going to mainly just focus on how to use
it specifically with ionic 2 and what
you need to do to get it working so
we're gonna go through two main things
we're gonna look at how to set up get on
our own project and push that to a
repository somewhere and we're also
going to look at then how we could pull
someone else's code down to our computer
and start working on that so to start
off with I'm just going to create a
fresh new project and then we're gonna
set it up in that so I'm just gonna call
this one
ionic to get she's a blank template it
doesn't really matter because we're not
going to be coding in it so just
generate that
okay the application is finished
generating now so I'm just going to
change into the project we just created
ventures I need to get and now we're
gonna set up get from the command line
here so you'll need git installed to be
able to use the git command so if you
haven't done that yet just Google how to
do it and it should run you through
those steps once you have got it
installed to initialize a new git
repository with this project you'll need
to run git init so we'll run that and
now we have a git repository set up
locally on our machine so if I run git
status now it should tell me some
information about what's going on so
currently I don't have any tracked
flowers I just have an empty I get
initialized so if I want to now add the
files of this project to that I can run
the get head command which you can
supply a file to I've in this case we
want to add everything in our project so
we can just use a dot there and that
will add all the files in the project
and I only hasn't set up so that it
doesn't include flowers we don't need so
if you're using a two project you'll
have a node modules folder which is
going to contain lots and lots of
flowers which take up a lot of space so
we don't want to push all those to the
repository we only want the files we are
actually working with so that will just
automatically ignore all those so you
don't have to worry about them getting
pushed up once we've added some files to
our git repository we need to commit
them so this will allow us to then push
that later so everything that's changed
we want to commit it which right now is
everything because we've just pushed an
entirely new project so we run git
commit and then - and to provide a
message for that specific commit and in
this case we'll just write initial
commit because it's the first thing
we're pushing we're just uploading
everything at once and you'll probably
see that used a lot in other
repositories
so that's committed everything now so
what we can do is now push that code
somewhere so a lot of people use github
and a lot of people use bitbucket is
bitbucket to do that just because it is
free or as github isn't for private
repositories so this is a really good
option if you want to use that but
you're welcome to use github if you want
it's essentially the exact same process
so before we can actually push our code
to this repository and you don't need to
push it any way necessary you can just
work with get locally but most the time
you want to set this up on either github
or bitbucket as I'm going to create a
new repository and bitbucket of course I
already have an account created here so
you have to do that if you haven't
already and then once you're logged in
you'll be able to create a new
repository through this repositories
menu I'm already on the screen now
because I didn't want to put all of my
repositories on video
so I'm just jumping straight into this
screen as I just give it a name that
would give the repository a name or just
call the same as a project I don't -
again I said to a private repository if
you want or if you want to make it
public to everybody uncheck that and
then anybody will be able to see your
code through bitbucket I have it set to
get and then click create repository
okay so this is our repository on
bitbucket now and so beyond to the
source this is all the source files for
the project and of course right now
there's there's nothing here so what we
want to do is get our local git
repository connected to this so we can
push to it and pull from it and if we
wanted to work with other people we
could do that as well so down here they
have a getting started with command line
a little tutorial so we have an existing
project we've already initialized that
git repository so just click on that
option and then it just gives you some
information on how to get that set up on
bitbucket so all you need to do is
change for that project directory which
we've already done and then run these
two
commands so we want to add this URL as
the remote repository and then we want
to push up all of our code to here
so let's first just run that go that
command rather and then this second one
as well okay so that's going through the
process of uploading all those files now
this might take a little bit okay so
that's finished uploading now so if we
jump back into our remote repository on
bitbucket
if i refresh this source you can see
that the ionic project is there now you
can see the source file and everything
is as it should be if I open up that
project now you can see here that we
have a bunch of files here that aren't
stored on bit bucket and so this is what
I was talking about before where there's
a kid ignore file here which says which
tells getting what we do and don't want
to upload or rather specifically what we
don't want to upload to the remote
repository and so what we really need in
this case is the source file and the
resources folder and all these files
here and so this is going to cause
problems later for people if they want
to use this code if they just pull that
down to their machine and start trying
to use it right away it's not going to
work there's something else we need to
do first so we're gonna go over how to
do that in just a bit but first I want
to show you a couple more things here so
we have our code here if I open up the
command line down and run git status
it's going to tell me what's going on in
our git repository so says we're on the
master branch and everything's up to
date there's nothing to commit so
everything is everything we've done is
pushed and it's all fine so now we might
want to make some changes and
upload those as well so if I just come
in to just change one of the pages here
so I'll just add some function literally
yeah so it made some change to my
project now and I want to push that up
to our remote repository and it's good
workflow to sort of push things as you
go each sort of feature that you create
you should commit that and push it so
that way it makes it really easy to
unwind things you've done rather than
doing one big mega commit that contains
everything so if I come in here now and
say get status again we see we've got a
modified file now now we've changed the
home got TS file so we can now add that
change to our local repository running
the git add command again and you can if
you like specifically provide the path
to that file to commit just that file or
usually you'll just want to add
everything in this case so we'll get at
all which the dot represents now that's
added everything again we can run get
status to see what's going on we can see
that we have some changes to be
committed now and so we're going to do
that by running the git commit commands
again and again providing a message to
that so we'll say that we added some
function and now that is ready to be
pushed back to the remote repository so
we can run the git push command and now
that's going through the same process
that happened before the initial commit
it's pushing all those changes up to the
remote repository and so if I open this
up again now go into the source folder
find that change we made we should be
able to see I should be able to see it
there give it a refresh okay I had to
refresh that again but now you can see
that some function has been added to
this file when it's now in the remote
repository so basically that's the
process that you'll follow
when working with git you make some
change run git add git commit git push
and then just repeat that for each new
feature that you're adding to the
application there are some more advanced
features you can use with git by
creating new branches if you want to
work on a new feature without affecting
the main code you kind of just work in
your own little sub branch of that the
main code and so that way if you know
you're breaking things things are going
wrong or doesn't really matter because
you're in your own separate branch you
can do that and I would recommend is
googling how to do that it's a bit more
complicated than I want to get into in
this tutorial but you don't need to do
those things if you want if you're just
working by yourself working up the
master branch is usually fine if you're
working with other people maybe you want
to start looking into using some
branches so the next thing that we're
gonna do is show how to pull some code
from bitbucket add locally to your
computer so maybe someone else has
created a project that you want to grab
and work on on your computer so what
we're going to do is just delete that
project we created so it's gone from the
computer now and we're gonna pull it in
from bitbucket again again so again
that's great if as a backup sort of
solution if you lost that folder on your
computer somehow get deleted your hard
drive got white it's not an issue
because you can just go grab it from a
bit bucket or github or wherever it's
stored but you can also grab other
people's code as well if they want to
share that with you so let's jump into
bitbucket here and what we're gonna do
is clone this so if you click on this
clone section here it'll give you a URL
and a command here this is a git clone
so we can grab a remote repository and
download it by running git clone and
then supplying the link at the URL to
that repository so we're on this command
this had to jump back into the video
folder because I trashed the other
folder before going back out of it so
I'm in that same folder I originally
created in created the project in but if
I look at what's in there now that
project is deleted so what we're gonna
do is now pull it from bitbucket I'm
going to paste that clone command dad is
copied from bitbucket and if I run that
that's going to start pulling down all
of that code okay so that's finished
downloading that now so if I check in
the folder again I can see the project's
backing up but we're missing a bunch of
stuff that was there before we only have
that those two folders that were
uploaded to bitbucket as well as the few
other files as well so now let's say I
want to work on this if I run or first
change into that project and then run
ionic serve I want to see the
application running and working and then
being able to work on it however as you
can see here I got a bunch of errors and
that's because we need to grab those
other files and folders like the node
modules folder we need to install of
those node dependencies and to do that
all we have to do is just run NPM
install and that's going to set up
everything that we need essentially this
is the same process that happens when
you generate a new application and you
iron it to application using the command
line so this is going to go through and
install everything we need one thing to
keep in mind is that this is only going
to install dependencies that are listed
in the package.json file so if you are
working with someone else who has
installed some dependency that the
project needs but it hasn't included in
the package.json file it's not going to
get installed with this so there could
be problems after running npm install if
the all the dependencies aren't listed
in package jason so if that's the case
you probably get some hair is about some
missing things and you can usually just
run the command yourself to install
those things or talk to your friend that
you're working with but it's decided to
keep in mind
so since this is just a simple blank
project we shouldn't have any issues
here so now that npm install is finished
running if i come back here let me
refresh that so now we have the node
modules file folder with everything we
need in here and as you can see there's
a lot of stuff so you definitely don't
want to be uploading this to bitbucket
so now if i run i onyx serve everything
should hopefully work we should see the
blank application listed showing in the
browser and it's and so there's only
really one more thing that you really
need to know if you are working with
someone else if you're working on the
same project at the same time this
chances are there's a chance that you
are going to make some changes and push
them they're gonna make some changes and
push them and your you want to have the
same code that they have essentially so
if you want to pull in some changes that
somebody else has made to a repository
you've already downloaded you can just
run these commands so if you run git
fetch that will pull in all the
information you need from the repository
and once that has finished running you
can run the git rebase command and what
this does essentially is technically
speaking I think it rewinds your changes
so it gets rid of any changes you've
done it pulls in their code applies any
changes that they've made and then it
replays your changes on top of that so
you have all of their changes plus all
of your changes added to it so you can
see how get for this that sort of
environment working with more than one
person is super useful because you don't
have to worry about manually updating
your code based on what someone else is
doing it handles everything for you
automatically there are some cases of
course where you might be editing the
same thing and get can't handle that
merging those two things automatically
and in that case you'll get a conflict
and you might need to do some manual
editing to tell git what is the correct
code
again it's a little bit more complicated
than I wanted to get into for this
tutorial so just google that there's
plenty of resources available for how to
self merge conflicts with git so I hope
this tutorial was useful for you if you
have never used git before hopefully you
can see the benefits of using it even if
you are just working by yourself it's
definitely worth checking it out and
definitely if you are trying to work in
a team environment as I mentioned there
are there's a ton more things you can do
with get like rolling back code to
certain commits so just Google a guide
to getting started with gear it should
run through some common commands the
ones I've shown you already basically
all you'll need to do basic stuff
if you want to do the more complicated
stuff then I definitely want to look at
a few different tutorials thanks for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one
