you can safely update elements in your
application using element ref and
something called renderer so I've just
got an example application up on the
screen now all this is is just a blank
default ionic application but I've also
generated a component and it's just the
the default component that gets
generated so I just created plaint
called test here and it's just got the
default this text equals hello world and
it's just a simple template and so what
we're going to do is make some kind of
modification to that using element ref
and so first I want to show you the
wrong way to do that and then I'll show
you the proper way to do it I don't want
to get too much into what element ref is
exactly but basically it's a a reference
that angular provides to a specific Dom
element so we can get that through the
component so if we have a component like
this here and get a reference to the
actual element for that component by
using element rest so if I import
element ref and then I can add it to the
constructor here I'll inject that as
element and so now I'm going to be able
to access the actual Dom element for
this component through element rest now
this isn't the only way to do that you
could also get an element reference
through a view child for example and all
just focus on this for now so to
demonstrate what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add the the ng after view in it
hook into here so this will run after
the viewers initialized so we can just
run some whatever code we want in here
this is kind of like ions you did load
and so if I just log out that element
that we are setting up as an element
referee can see what we have to work
with so I'll add that console that log
statement there and then we'll jump back
into the browser and see what happens
and so you can see the element ref is
being logged out here and then inside of
the element referee have the native
element and that is the actual
Dom element reference and so if you're
looking here you'll see things that
these are angular specific things
anymore this is just the actual
properties on the Dom element itself so
we have things like the offset topped
client width and client height and we
can also access all the styles through
here so see if we open the Styles
property there we have all the different
styles that apply to this Dom element
now since we have access to those Styles
now we could easily modify them using
our code in here so what I might want to
do and it's component for example is I
might want to change say the background
color to something else so what I could
do and I'm placing emphasis on the hood
because this isn't what you should do
but I'm going to show you anyway we
could say do this element native element
dot style and then we could access the
background color property and we could
set that to equal I will make it black
which is zero zero zero so we'll save
that and we'll let the application
refresh here and we can't actually see
the color here yet because this isn't a
block level element so actually going to
have to jump in here and add another
style using the same method again and
we'll just set the display to block and
then we should be able to see that
background color there okay so now we
can see you have a black background on
our element here and so clearly that
works we can interact with these
directly with that Dom element there we
can modify whatever properties we want
but this isn't the correct way to do it
using element refs greatly like this and
the reason for that is that we're
working with this in a way that is
specific to the browser and to the whole
the whole point of angular but a big
thing in angular is the fact that it is
or it can be platform agnostic so what
that means is that it doesn't have to
run on the web through a browser you
could have an angular application that
works in an entirely different
environment but if we start doing stuff
like this where we are specifically
using browser things if we use a syntax
and terminology that is specific to the
browser
and that is going to reduce that
adaptability and that's why it's best to
avoid doing things like using document
dot get element by ID which works but
it's not really the angular way to do it
so instead what we can do is use
something called renderer and it's
basically the exact same idea it doesn't
really complicate things at all but it's
going to perform that change in a way
that is platform agnostic meaning it's
not going to matter if it's running on a
browser or some other platform so in
order to use the renderer all you need
to do is import that from angular core
and then we also just inject that into
the constructor as well and then the
difference down here is that well first
we're going to comment out this stuff
and instead of directly accessing this
style property on the element reference
we'll instead do this renderer and we'll
call a method on the renderer there's
many of these but one in particular is
set element style and then we just need
to supply that with the native element
so we can do this element native element
that's the thing that we want to modify
and then we just say the style that we
want to change here and in this case we
want to do background color and we want
to set that to black and we want to do
the same with the display property so
I'll just copy that
we'll change this to display and is to
block and so now if I save that we
should hopefully see the same result
okay you can see that we have the same
black box that we had before except now
we're no longer accessing those
properties directly as the browser would
expect us to interact with them but
instead we're using this generic
renderer dot set element style and there
are other methods available besides set
element style I've just got the
documentation up for the renderer here
and you'll see on here we have the
element style somewhere in here there it
is as that expects a render element the
style name you want to modify and value
we also have things like set element
class you can
VOC methods on that Dom element you can
change its text with set text and
there's some other stuff you can do here
as well so basically you use the
rendering in place of directly
manipulating the Dom properties you
would instead use the renderer to do
that for you and it's going to make your
application more and more adaptable and
more angular ok so I hope you enjoyed
this video and I'll see you in the next
one
