to use expected conditions with
protractor in order to help time your
enter when tests so I have a really
simple application in ionic setup on
screen now and all it does is switch
between two pages so I can click this
switch to test button and that's going
to push a new page on to the navigation
stack I can then push the back button
and it takes me back to the home page so
I'm not really particularly interested
in the functionality here what I'm
interested in showing you is how to
handle page transitions in an end-to-end
test I'll assume that you have a
reasonable understanding of what an e to
e test is for this tutorial if you don't
I'll link to some other resources you
can take a look at but basically the
issue we're going to attempt to solve in
this video is the issue around timing
when triggering page transitions or
anything really so if I click on this
button there's a period of time where
the page isn't ready the test page isn't
ready for me to click the back button
yet so in my 10 to end tests I could say
click this button click that button but
if the timing isn't right
and it's going to cause some problems so
I've set up an end-to-end test for this
application here is just a really simple
end-to-end test and basically what I'm
trying to do is see if we can switch
through the test page and then switch
back to the home page again and to do
that I first just get the the root URL
here I then trigger a click on the test
button and then I trigger a click on the
back button and then I'm checking if the
URL contains home which would indicate
that we are on the home page and so will
this get test button function here does
is trigger this helper function in the
page object which is going to give us a
reference to that button we're trying to
click and the same thing goes with the
back button and you'll also see some
other helper functions here which we'll
get to in just a moment so that test
looks reasonable it's the is the
behavior that we're trying to test but
I'm going to try to run that end-to-end
test now and we'll see what happens
okay so the end-to-end test finished
Iran and finish there and if we look at
the reason that it failed we can see
here that it says we have an unknown
error the error saying that the backbone
which we are attempting to click is not
clickable at the point that we're trying
to click it on this is a different
element would receive that click and
it's saying that this element is the
thing that is actually being clicked
when we try to do that and so it's this
click block element of course we haven't
actually put anything like that in this
application here of what happens when we
are dealing with page transitions and
things like that
Bionic throws up this click block that's
going to block any interaction with the
page for a brief period now when we're
you're manually clicking ourselves or an
application this isn't really an issue
because we're never clicking around fast
enough to hit that
but in our end-to-end test since we're
immediately triggering that next click
the page isn't ready yet and it's
hitting that click book and so what we
need to do is we need to wait long
enough for that click block to disappear
and one way we can do that in a very
common way is to just use browser driver
sleep and then we can just tell the
browser to wait for a certain period of
time so we might say well 200
milliseconds is probably enough time for
that
page transition to occur so in both of
these cases I could say well click and
we'll wait 200 milliseconds we'll click
again and then we'll wait another 200
milliseconds so if I save that and
attempt to run the test again I assume
that this will probably work with that
okay so but another error again it looks
like that the same error we're running
into the same thing again so I guess 200
milliseconds isn't enough there so let's
just go really high and say one second
we'll wait an entire second before we
try to run that next step
so we'll run those again and now it
works and so of course that does work
but it's not it's not all that accurate
we had to kind of guess around with how
long we need to wait
and in the end we just went with one
second which is probably two longer way
of at least and it ensures that the page
will be ready the downside of that is
that it's going to make our tests take
longer to run and so we have lots of
tests on the waiting you know for one
second
unnecessarily in a lot of them that's
going to really increase the amount of
time we need to wait and there's no
guarantee that the thing you're testing
will be ready and so a better thing we
can do rather than manually telling the
browser to way is to use expected
conditions so this is saying that
protractor provides and you can see in
the help here for protractor we can look
through the expected conditions class
here and you'll see a variety of
functions in here we have an expected
condition that says element to be
clickable text to be present in element
title contains title is URL contains URL
is presence of staleness offers an
invisibility of visibility of there's
all these different conditions we can
test for and the basic idea is that the
browser will wait until that thing that
we're testing for has happened and so in
our case here what we want to do is we
want to wait for that click book to be
gone before we attempt to click on that
back button and so to do that properly
we can use an expected condition and so
if we jump into the page object I have
you so you have reset the function to do
this and in order to use that expecting
to expect the condition what I need to
do is first grab the grab the element
that we're trying to create this form
and then we create the expected
condition here using protractor expected
conditions and then we use the the
function we want from that class I just
showed you in this case it's stableness
off and if we look in in this file here
for stylus all of it says waits for the
element with the ID of whatever we
specified there to no longer be present
in the Dom and that's what we want we
want the the click book to be gone from
the Dom so we're checking for the
staleness of click click block element
and then we're telling the browser to
wait for that expected condition
and I have a similar thing set up here
which we're not going to use in this
video but in this case it's we're
waiting for the ion fact Rock to
disappear so you could use that say if
you're waiting for a loading overlay to
disappear before you ran a certain bit
of your test so if we jump back into our
end-to-end test now and after we trigger
that we're going to trigger that wait
for click lock so we just call up paged
or wait for click lock and that's going
to wait for that expected condition for
us so it's going to trigger the click
it's going to wait for the click lock to
disappear from the Dom and then it will
trigger the back button click so we'll
save that and we will run the NPM rather
the e3 test again okay so it's running
we still have an error here but this
time it says the expected this URL to
contain home so at the time that we are
triggering this expect statement here
the page hasn't had time to switch back
to the home page so it's able to
successfully click the back button but
it's immediately checking the URL and
that is still on the test page so if we
come into a application here if I click
that and I click the back button you can
see there's a brief delay before that
actually changes back to the home pages
URL so what we're going to do now is
we're going to use a different kind of
expected condition and that's going to
be the URL contains and so I think we
already have a look at that in here yeah
so this is just another type of expected
condition and allows us to wait for the
URL to contain a certain string so we're
going to add that in here so we'll do
browser don't wait and it's going to
wait for whatever expected condition we
supply and in here so we're going to do
protractor don't expected conditions dot
URL contains home so now the browser is
going to wait until the oil contains
home and then it will run the expect
statement so this will ensure that this
doesn't this won't run premature
but in the case where the chest is
broken this test will actually timeout
because it will never reach that home
URL so let's just run those tests again
now and we'll see if it works this time
so and you can see that it is passing
now so this is a much more efficient way
to run your e to e test you could just
as easily do browser don't drive it up
sleep it's really quick and easy fix you
don't have to worry about seeing what
you need to be waiting for and creating
that expected condition but downside of
doing it that way is that you don't know
for sure that the application is the
state that you want to be in when you're
triggering the next step in your test
and you could also just be waiting
longer than you need to trigger
something and it's going to make it test
run really slow okay so I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
