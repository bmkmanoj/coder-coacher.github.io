using the validate doc update function
in a couch TV database to control what
can and cannot be written to the
database so we've captured EB had one
particular structure is to have a shared
database that everybody uses you can
have different setups where perhaps you
have each user having their own database
so you're not going to really have to
worry about any kind of access control
because if you have your own database
generally you can just do whatever you
want with it but in a shared sort of
environment you might want to create
some restrictions on what people can
actually update certain documents with
and one way we can do that is with some
functionality that is built directly
into couch TV and that's a the validate
update function and essentially what
this function does is it's something
that we can add to design documents and
that's something I've covered in the
past as I'll link to a tutorial that
covers that as well as some other
getting started with couch TV type stuff
because I'm not going to focus on that
here and so what the validate update
function does is for every document
update you send a CouchDB it's going to
run these functions and it's going to
compare the old document to the new
document and then you can add whatever
kind of function you want as it does
like with those two documents to
determine whether or not you want to
accept that update so I've got a this is
from another tutorial I did there Corder
it was a logging couchdb sort of
application called couch blog and that
was just a simple very simple kind of
basic to do type a situation where we
just created an application that allowed
people to post a blog post and then have
comments attached to that blog post and
we pulled that data into an ionic
application and it was all very basic
but it's going to be useful for this
example because we've got some data
there that we can work with and we
already have a couple design documents
set up as well as I mentioned I'm not
going to cover design documents in this
video but if we look at this one here we
have a year
host design document and in that all we
have is just a view here called by date
published which just I create the view
data that's going to display a list of
post by the date they'll publish but as
well as having a views defined in this
design document this is also where we
can add our validate update function and
so I'm going to mess around with this
view now and we're going to add a value
update function and then we're going to
see if we can update certain things
break the rules and see what happens now
as you can see with the view I have
defined here this is also just a
function that takes in a document and
then we do save that document to
determine which documents get emitted
into that view and so it's a similar
concept with the validate update
function where we'll have this function
defined here just as a string and then
we do something with that but in the
case of validate doc update rather than
just handing a single document we're
going to have that whole document the
new document and also sign called user
context so what I think I'll do is just
jump straight into giving that a go to
see how to help explain it along the way
I don't want to sort of spend too much
time explaining before we actually take
a look at something so what I'm going to
do to start off with is just because
it's a bit awkward to try and write a
function just as a string like this I'm
going to jump into your text editor
we're going to design the function there
and then we'll put it into a design
document afterwards okay so our validate
update function is going to look like
this so to give you context the will
have a validate update property in this
design document here and that's going to
be a function like this is so that
function is going to look like this and
function I'm going to have the old dock
new dock and user context as parameters
and so as I mentioned the old document
is the document that is already in the
database the new document is the new
document that the user is attempting to
write and the user context contains
information about all the current users
context so if you've got some kind of
login system going it might contain
roles related to that user
where's
an admin or well user type they are so
you could use those to determine whether
or not a user should be allowed to write
to a particular document but we're
mostly going to be focusing just old doc
and you doc for now so it's going to
start off with something really simple
and that is just rejecting everything
out right so if we don't want to allow
any users to make any updates whatsoever
to this database we can just throw I
will throw a forbidden message here so I
would say throw forbidden you can't do
that so if we throw an arrow like this
that's going to project that update it's
not going to do it so if I take this now
and when I'm actually putting these into
CouchDB I generally just highlight these
go edit line join lines and just so we
can get in one simple long string there
so if I edit this document now we're
going to add another field here and
that's going to be the validate update
field and that's just going to be the
function we described it so I'm going to
paste that up there and I'm going to
save that and I'll hit save document as
well okay so now we have this validate
update function this should get
triggered every time we try to write
some document and if we have you saw
before I had multiple design documents
that had the posts and the comments and
so if you have multiple design documents
you have multiple validate update
functions but every validator update
function will run for every document so
even if I was updating site related to
comments this validate update function
will still run so now we've got that
error to find there let's try and jump
back in I'll just say edit one of these
posts so I'll change some great content
to some bad content and I'll hit save on
that and click save document and
immediately I get this error the pops up
there's error forbidden you can't do
that and that's the exact error message
that we defined so whatever we try to do
now is never
going to let us update anything so what
we're going to do now is get rid of that
validate dog update function so that we
can actually do stuff again but delete
that save it and now if I go back to
that same post again I think it was this
one we'll try the update again some
great content we'll change that to some
some bad content hit save save the
document and now it works because we
we're not throwing that error anymore
and so the basic concept here is then
well we have to do is just add whatever
kind of logic we want into this function
and then if we don't want the update to
happen just throw an error so now it's a
traffic light a little bit more
realistic let's say that we want to
allow the content to be updated but we
don't want the author field to ever
change
so what we can do for that that's first
of all just get rid of this error here
where I can do now is I can say walk in
I want to look at the old document and
compare that to the new document so
we'll have to do is say if old daughter
does not equal new author we're going to
throw an error so say throw and again
we'll say forbidden author cannot be
changed so now the the new document
update if the author's been changed it's
not going to allow that update there's a
couple of things you need to watch out
for here because what if say the old
document doesn't exist you can be
writing a new document but this function
is still going to run it runs for every
single document update that's coming to
the database so before we make this this
check here checking if the authors match
we should also check that well if old
doc is actually being passed in so in
the case of just a new document being
created now this won't run which is what
we want to happen but there's even more
things to worry about so let's say that
you have different types of documents in
your database so I don't actually recall
which with this we have an author for a
poster
and we have an author for comments too
so that's not going to matter in this
case but let's say if you had a
different type of document that didn't
have an author and you try to run this
function now it's checking this author
field if it doesn't exist on all
documents if you're trying to write
something that doesn't have an author
then this is going to fail it's going to
mess things up so generally what you
would want to do with this validate doc
update function is have some kind of
check to the type of the document so you
might say if if new type equals post
yeah we want to run these checks or if
the new type equals a comment then we
want to run these checks and as I
mentioned before just because we're
adding is validate dot update function
to our post design document it doesn't
mean that it's only going to apply to
post this will run for every single
document so let's test this a ballad
update function now so we'll do the same
thing again what it's going to join
everything onto one line here and we're
going to dump that back into the post
design document again so we're add
validate doc update property back here
save that and now let's go try a change
and things so first of all let's go back
to that same one again so we had some
bad content again try to change that
back to some great content now hopefully
that should allow us to do that to save
it and the changes there that work now
let's say we want to edit your so field
now now rule says you can't edit the
author field whatever the author field
is originally it has to be that
afterwards as well so if I change this
to Josh Maroney to say Joshua Maroney
it's different now so I'm going to click
save save document and I get the error
pop-up says also cannot be changed so
that's running a dog update valid a dog
update function here it's running this
check and that's failing so strong the
error
and just a double-check that there isn't
any issue we've seen new documents I'm
going to try this to create a an
entirely new document here okay a new
document and we're just going to paste
the same thing we're just going to edit
the get rid of that revision field and
we'll change this to some blog post too
so if I save that now hopefully that
should allow us to save it and it
doesn't near so what's the problem here
okay so I've got an error saying that
the new doc is is null and I think what
I've actually done is I've got the
validate doc update function backwards
and yeah the parameters of equities and
this should be new code new dog so
change that and I probably should put a
put up a little notice earlier on so you
don't they're making that mistake if you
didn't happen to watch to the M so if I
save that we'll do the same thing again
now that the parameters are right so
what was happening there was when we're
checking to see if the old doc exists
here since we're passing that in wrong
were actually referring to which I think
the new document was there and so of
course that was there because we're
creating a new document but then it was
checking for the old document which is
actually the new document and causing
some problems so it's important to have
that around the right way here so I'll
update that again now so we'll come back
to the design document will change me
one could really just do this manually
here change up to new don't change that
to old doc and save that and now let's
try that again so we'll just steal this
content again go create a new post to
some blog post to get rid of the
revision and I'll hit save
so that let us create that author there
and again just to double check try to
change that to Joshua click Save and we
get the error that the author can't be
changed so that's exactly what we want
to happen so you can create a whole
range of different checks in here and
you can even create functions within
this validate doc update function if you
want to make things a bit easier so
let's say if you were you might want to
check if a certain field has been filled
out in the document that it exists in
the document and so one sort of common a
patent implement here is to use this
type of helper function here that can
check if a certain field is present so
we can call require pass at the field
and if that field doesn't exist we can
pass it a message so let's say as well
as I check here we don't want waters to
change let's say on you know any kind of
document it must contain a I've
forgotten what fields are here at
content so it has to contain a content
so if the type is a post we say it has
to have a content field and so and we
could also pass in the Kalandar pass in
an error message for that we could also
do that so we could of course just check
this manually we could check if the post
document had the content property filled
out but if you start doing that for a
lot of different things it's going to be
quite big and messy in this function or
is this all you have to do is write
require this field and that's it if the
if the document does not contain that
field then it's going to throw the error
so let's try it we'll try this function
now check that that works again we'll
head back into our design document and
update that function with our new
function here hit save on that and what
we're going to do now is try and create
another new document except this time we
are going to try and not have a content
field so if I paste that again we'll
just changes to
to someone press three get rid of the
revision and we're also going to delete
the content property here so P save now
save document I've got another error
here because the thing to be doing that
a lot today let's just quickly jump back
in here it says that type wasn't defined
and again I forgot to reference the
document as I will just say new doctype
sequels post joiners lines copy that
head back into our design document once
more hopefully this is the last time
we'll have to do this so paste that
there save the document head back into
here again we'll grab this data again
create a new document again change that
get rid of the revision get rid of the
content and hit save and there we go so
now you get the proper error here which
is that the document must have a content
I shouldn't I say you should have a
content field so we say well whoops that
nailed an accident I meant to include
the content field there so we're adding
content here you go and we'll try to
save it again now and this time it works
so I think this the concept of the
validate doc update function is a little
bit confusing at first but once you
understand that it's just a function
that runs for every single document
update the new document gets passed into
this function and compared to the old
document and then basically you just do
whatever JavaScript you want in here you
can compare things in any way you want
you can do date comparisons or any kind
of logic and in the end of it throws an
error the document update will be
rejected and if it doesn't send the
document update will proceed okay so I
hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
