you how to make post requests to send
data to a server in ionic 2 as I've done
there tutorial in the past I'm using the
HTTP service the angular provides to
make a get request now get request is
going to allow you to fetch some data
from a server but a post request allows
you to send your own data in that
request so you could then do something
with that on the server so you may want
to add a post or a comment to something
perhaps now if you need to send that
comment along with the post request then
you need to handle that on the server it
needs to be added to the database or
something like that and then you also
get some kind of response back usually
sometimes you might not be trying to add
sign to a database you might just be
making a request for data similar to a
get but that request might involve
supplying some kind of data in the
request so perhaps if you're searching
for a location or something like that
you might need to supply an address in a
post request and then receive some data
back with an answer so it's slightly
more complicated to send a post request
but it's more or less the same thing so
I'm going to walk through how to do that
now there's some other tutorials I've
done which may help you understand this
one I definitely recommend checking out
the get request tutorial if you haven't
already that explains more of the basics
of the HTTP service I also have another
tutorial that explains observables which
the HTTP service returns so having a
basic understanding how observables work
will also be helpful and you don't need
to look at this tutorial I have some
tutorials on creating nodes serve as
basic node service to create some kind
of backend for your application as I'll
be using a node server as a back-end in
this example if you don't necessarily
have to understand what's going on there
I'm just using it for the sake of having
something to send a request to
if you want to have your back-end in PHP
MySQL Ruby on Rails whatever it doesn't
matter
the idea is that were just posting data
to some URL I'm just going to hit a
server and something's going to happen
so I have a project set up here where I
have the client in the server the client
is the ionic to application and the
server is the node back in that I was
just talking about so just quickly show
you what's going on here this is just a
super simple server I've just set up a
single route that we can hit which is
forward slash API forward slash test so
I'll be able to hit that URL in the post
request on localhost and this will add
this will handle that request so all
this does is I can send this I can send
this route from data that's not going to
do anything with it
besides logging out to the body here but
then all I do is just create this
response and send it back in JSON format
so that application can pull that data
back in so before we will be able to
user I will just need to start that
server up so I can just start that with
node and server jeaious okay so we see
that with me on port 8080 now I say
we'll be able to hit that in our post
request let's jump over into the ionic
application now as I already have a
request set up on the home page here
which is triggers in the island view did
load a lifecycle hook and so what we're
doing is we're just trying to send this
message here do you hear me to that wrap
so the oral there is a some local host
forward slash API for such tests but in
nagas in a real world example if you
weren't developing on a local server you
would just replace this URL with it with
whatever the euro of your actual server
is so this is pretty similar to a normal
sort of get request the main difference
that we have a body that we're sending
through here and so we're sending that
in JSON format so we just create a the
body object here and we stringify it to
send it along and then we also have
a headed parameter and so to use that
with import headers from the angular
HTTP library and then we can set
whatever headers we need on that request
so the only header we're setting here is
the content type we're setting that to
JSON but there's you can just continue
to append as many headers as you need to
satisfy whatever request you're making
decide from that it's exactly the same
as a get request we just launch the
request that will return us an
observable we're mapping the response
and we're subscribing to it so I'm going
to save this now and if we jump into the
browser we'll see if it's working okay
so we see that it's working there it
says loud and clear which is the
response that we set up on the server
which you can see just here and if we
reload this again and just keep an eye
on the network tab here you'll be able
to see it making a request to grab that
data so if you look down the bottom here
you can see it's hitting test if we open
that up we can see the response there we
can even open up the headers and take a
look at once and then you can see we've
got the content type that we set this
network address request is going through
as we'd expect it to and then we can do
whatever we need to do with whatever
response we get which in this case is
some text so there isn't much to do but
you could send through any kind of
response you wanted from the server
that's basically all there is to sending
a post request but there is one very
important difference now when comparing
it to say the get request since we are
relying on observable because this is
flowing I touched on it in the
observable video is observable are lazy
which means that they won't execute
until they're subscribed to and now this
isn't a problem with say you get
requests because if you're making a get
request chances are you want to get some
data so of course you're going to
subscribe to the observable to get that
data now with the post request maybe
you're not interested in what the the
result of that is or the responses if
you're just posting a comment it's
probably a good idea to listen to there
and check that everything was fine but
theoretically you could just send a post
request and let it fly off into the
ether and just hope that it gets added
to the database and you don't really
care about our response for the problem
with that is if you don't subscribe to
that response then your post requests
will never execute in the first place
so if I were to just say comment out
it's a subscribed section here and we'll
try run this again you can see that we
no longer get that message there and if
we open up the the console here we can
see when the post requests are made if I
just refresh this you'll see that
nothing ever hits the server here then
if we uncomment that and try again
you'll see a request go through to the
server and you saw them go through then
and if we go back into the browser we
can see that we have the loud and clear
message back so when you are creating
observables like this when you're making
a post request make sure to subscribe to
it otherwise it's never going to execute
okay so I hope you enjoyed this quick
video tutorial and I'll see you on the
next one
