to easily set up a unit testing and
end-to-end testing in your ionic
applications I've previously written
quite a few tutorials on how to do some
unit tests end to end test test-driven
development and all kinds of different
things and so I have a ton of tutorials
in my blog which you which you can take
a look at if you want to learn how to do
that kind of stuff
but I did have one one sort of initial
testing tutorial that walk through
setting up unit testing and another one
that went through setting up into end
testing and the problem is that it is
quite a process to get everything set up
there's tons of configuration required
to get comma and jazzing working
correctly especially in a type script
environment with ionic so that was quite
quite an annoying process to get set up
in a new application but just recently
the ionic team put together this they
put together this sort of example unit
testing application example with ionic
and this was based on an example with
that Rob Louie put together who you can
see here so he came up with this a much
more simple setup for unit testing in
ionic and so the ionic team put together
this repository here and then various
people have sort of committed some
changes to set other things up in there
as well so and it also like to give a
quick shout out to I'm not sure how to
pronounce it but the phone is um who
sort of originally came up with I feel
like was probably the first example of
unit testing in ionic and we've sort of
built off of that so a lot of people
have put in the effort here to create
this kind of one unified resource that
we can use for an ionic application and
now it's super easy to start testing in
your applications because we can just
copy this repository and everything is
set up and ready to go so as I mentioned
I'm not going to walk through how to do
a test or how to create end-to-end tests
in this video
I'm just going to show you how you can
use this repository here to get set up
really quickly and then if you want to
learn more about unit testing and
testing and all that feel free to read
through some of my tutorials definitely
don't use the my setup tutorial anymore
I need to update that to use this
instead so basically all we need to do
to get started is just to clone this
repository and into our new project so
if I click on the clone link here and
then if I come into my terminal here I'm
going to create a new project just by
running git clone and I'll use that the
URL of that git repository and then just
give you a project a name whatever you
want to call your the directory that
you're going to store that our project
in just write that so I'll just call
this ionic testing example which is
actually pretty much the same name
anyway but you can call it whatever you
want so just hit that and that's going
to clone that repository into that
folder for you and then once that has
finished we'll just change into the
repository and we just cloned and then
you just need to run npm install and
it's going to go through installing all
the dependencies which will include all
the normal ionic stuff that we're using
but also all the unit testing things so
it's going to install jasmine caramel
protractor everything we need to run
unit tests and end-to-end tests okay so
now that that's finished running all we
need to do to run the unit tests is to
run npm tests so run that command is
going to start the unit test for us and
there are a couple of unit tests in here
by default if we jump into the source
folder going to pages
I believe page one here has a spec here
and you can see there's an example
testing here that says it should create
a component I create the component and
it should also have an h3 tag in the
text so if we take a look at the output
for that test we can see that it's
executed for tests and they've all been
successful so those to them and I think
there was also another two unit test set
up in the
component here yes this is military here
again test its created and tested there
are two pages so that's how you're on
the unit test and of course you can add
your own extra unit test this is just an
example and then if you want to run the
end-to-end test we need to do is just I
will go back to serve that okay so you
can see in the background there I'm
serving that in the browser now and then
to run the end-to-end tests you just
have to open up another terminal go to
the same project and then just run npm
run e to e so that's going to launch
these tests in the browser and it's
going to run whatever and twin test we
have which i think is just one in the
example yeah so it's got on the app
component we've got a em how it is
testing that the initial page the root
page that's getting set has a title that
says page one and so when i run that
just then you can see it pop up run the
test and then it closes and so for that
you can decide whatever end-to-end tests
you want in in the e to e folder here as
long as they have the format of app dot
e to e spec TS you could call it login
page dot e to e spec TS as long as it's
in that format it's going to run all
those end to end tests for you so i just
wanted to show you how to quickly get up
and running with this example repository
here I definitely recommend just using
this repository over trying to install
all the dependencies yourself and if you
have any particular issues with this
repository it is still reasonably new
recommend just sending for requests to
this repository it would be great if we
could just have this as the one one main
example of how we can set up unit tests
end to end tests in an ionic application
so we don't have all these different
versions going around and I think
eventually ionic will set this up as a
start a template as well so hopefully we
can just you know run ionic start my app
unit tests or testing or whatever and
we'll get
it's template bindings well as I hope
this video was helpful and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
