what lazy loading is in ionic even if
you aren't familiar with lazy loading in
ionic you may have heard the term before
and generally it refers to loading
something as you need it so it's
commonly used with images if you were to
lazy load an image in a just a normal
webpage rather than loading all of the
images on the page at once you only load
them as the user needs them so you could
have say a hundred images in the on a
really long webpage and if you never
scroll to the bottom of that page
there's no need to load those images in
so the lazy loading is a way to cut down
on HTTP requests and loading in images
where they're not required but the
concept is not specific to images and in
fact in ionic a lazy loading is used to
load pages or modules as they're needed
rather than images and just as an aside
there is actually lazy loading for
images built into ionic as well with ion
image and the virtual scroll component
but we're going to be focusing on lazy
loading pages and components
so I've already already have some
content around how to lazy load and it's
documented in the ionic documentation as
well basically it's just a matter of
adding an ionic page decorated to a
component and setting up a module for
that component rather than just having a
single app module ts file so what I want
to do in this video to show you the
actual effect of lazy loading so it's
easy enough to do it but you might
wonder why or why are we doing it and
what is that even for us so I have two
applications up here this is the
application that I'm using for my elite
ionic course and so the normal version
with lazy loading it's called hang and
then I created an alternate version
without lazy loading which I have
installed here as well and that's called
hangs no lazy so we're going to take a
look at both of these and we'll bring up
the debugger the the Safari inspector
and see what's actually happening as the
application loads so let's first take a
look at the version without lazy loading
so I'm going to open up that now
and in order to see what's going on
we're going to bring up the East Safari
browser here go into the develop menu go
to my iPhone and choose this file here
okay so we're going to go into the
timeline the timelines tab here and this
is going to allow us to see how the
application is loading we're going to
see network requests and any JavaScript
events layout and rendering things that
are happening what we're most interested
in is the the network requests because
that's actually going to show us what's
loading into the application so that we
get that from the beginning we're going
to hit this refresh button here that's
going to reload the application and you
can see what happens as the application
loaded we had our initial network
request that loaded the the content for
the application and then all the rest of
this is just that little SVG animation
that was playing over the first couple
of seconds but we're mostly interested
in are these initial network requests
just here so you can see there's a few
different files that are being loaded in
but the main one we are concerned with
is main j/s and so this is the bundled
application code for ionic it's
everything that we that we've built in
ionic at all bundled into this one file
so you can see that file is about 806
kilobytes so if I click on we'll just
get these a at the time line recording
again so I'll just hit this record
button here if I click on the create
account now I will do that on my phone
now we can see some layout and rendering
happen we've got some JavaScript events
happening but there was no additional
network network requests there so if I
go back and actually log into the
application you can see now that we have
a network request firing off and that's
checking against the server as it's
authenticating okay so everything is
finished loading in now we actually have
and if you see here there's still one
network request still which is
continuing to go as because I'm using
CouchDB and it's got this continuous
live replication happening with the
database if we just sort of take a chunk
of this to see what sort of network
requests are happening
you can see this is mostly to the server
I have set up we've got some stuff with
pouch DB going the changes it's watching
for changes on the database but there's
no additional files being loaded in here
there's no additional images or or
JavaScript files being loaded in for the
application I did lie actually there is
one image being loaded in here which is
that little purple adorable avatar so
basically the point is here that once
the application is loaded initially
everything exploded we're not loading
any additional files as we go when we
look at the lazy loading example you'll
see that's not the case so let's take a
look at that one now okay so I've closed
down the application that was not using
lazy loading and now we're going to look
at the version that is using lazy
loading now part from the fact that one
is using lazy loading and one isn't they
are both the exact same application so
I'm going to open that up now and at
once again I'm going to not go into
Adobe Acrobat and I'm going to open up
Safari and we're going to go into that
develop menu again open up the debugger
for that and now that this is running
we're going to refresh it again so it's
looking pretty similar to the last one
but there is a difference here in the
way that our main bundle is loading and
so if we look at our main J's file here
now you can see that that is 732
kilobytes now which is a little bit
smaller than it was previously I think
it was around 830 or something like that
so we have that file being loaded in but
also have a separate file called four
main J's being loaded in as well so if I
click on that we'll actually be able to
see I will be obviously the code for
this particular chunk that is being
loaded in and you can see here this is
the login page module so it's loading in
the login page separately to the main
bundle and that's because we're lazy
loading that login page the login page
is needed now and so it's getting loaded
in so again let's get that timeline
recording and let's see what happens now
when I click on create account so if we
take a look at this network request here
I'm going to highlight that single one
there so we can see what happened you
can see that zero dot
jess is being loaded in and it has a
size of 30 kilobytes and if we take a
look at that one
we can see that that is the chunk for
the register page and so now that we're
on the register page that need to be
loaded in it was loaded in and then it
was displayed and let's also also take a
look at what happens when we log into
the application so again we have a
network request that are firing off
continuously because the pouch DB but if
we take a look at these ones in here
this time we can actually see that some
additional JavaScript files are being
loaded into the application you can see
we have a 1.9 yes and a 5.9 ojs so if we
take a look at at one main dot jeaious
we'll see that that is the notices page
module that's the chunk we are loading
in for the notices page and if we take a
look at five main J's will see that that
is the homepage so we are right now on
the home page which has tabs set up and
we're displaying the notices tab on that
page so both of those are being loaded
in and once more if we go back and to
start recording once more if we click on
the the chat tab we'll see a similar
sort of thing happen highlight that
section there we can see two main GS is
loaded in and if we click on that I'm
sure that it will be the chat page as
you can see as we go throughout this
application pages are being loaded in as
they are required they're not all being
loaded right at the beginning of the
application and so the effect of that on
an application like this isn't going to
be that large it doesn't have all that
many pages and components and in total
it has a finger and six pages to custom
components and a few providers and
things like that the structure of the
application is pretty simple I think
that's generally a good idea to keep the
application as simple as possible and
reuse pages and components where
possible but sometimes people want to
build our applications that maybe they
do have 30 pages and 20 custom
components and a whole bunch of code
that they need to load
so by using lazy loading in those
circumstances you don't see a much
bigger benefit to doing that so rather
than having to load 50 components as
soon as your application loads you can
just load the things that you need right
away and then load the rest as you need
them so this doesn't it doesn't change
the overall size of your application
it's just changing the way that it's
loading in to give a better experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
