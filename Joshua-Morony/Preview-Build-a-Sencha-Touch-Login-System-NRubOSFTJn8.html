tutorial series where we will be
building a sencha touch login system to
start off with in this video we won't
actually be creating the application
just yet we're going to have a look at
the back end side of things and set up
the database and we'll start working on
our PHP API before we do this you will
need to have a database setup on a
server somewhere on the internet so if
you have a website you could use you
could use a free host doesn't really
matter but it needs to be publicly
accessible from the internet you can't
just set this up on localhost because
when you install this device install the
application rather on your device it's
going to need to be able to communicate
with this database and if it's sitting
locally on your computer you won't be
able to do that so I set that up
somewhere and we'll go through exactly
what we want that database to look like
in a second um i'll be using PHP and
mysql for this you don't necessarily
have to use those technologies if
there's a language that you're more
comfortable with you can just use that
instead and it should be pretty easy and
to adapt as well there's nothing too
crazy that we're going to be doing
essentially we're running for queries
against a database and returning
adjacent stream so to start off with
we're going to look at the build query
for the database table and we're only
going to have one table as well so it's
create a file called build SQL and we're
going to do a great table users and we
want to add and like d field it's going
to be in leven
unsigned not know and what I increment
the protocol we want an FB ID field this
is going to be used to store the
Facebook ID from facebook if they use
that method to login otherwise this will
just be left blank we want an email
field we're going to make that bar chart
again to 100 and not know a password
field again no and a session field and
that will be used obviously the story
use a session and we'll check against
that when we're automatically loving
them in and we just set the primary key
to ID and that is it as far as the
database ghost this is all we're going
to need to do is this one table to store
how users if you are taking this a bit
further and are using this login system
to create a specific application you'll
probably want more tables to the store
other information you can easily extend
the users table if you want to include
things like a phone number or country
you can easily store that information in
here basically we just want to add the
the minimal amount that we need just the
stuff that we need to actually get this
system working so once you've done that
create your creative database on your
website run this query and then
basically you're done that's all we need
to worry about for the database we're
going to set up the API as well so
create file called user stock PHP and
basically the purpose of this PHP file
is going to be to sit between
application and the database
our applications going to make requests
and we pointed to this PHP file the PHP
file will figure out what it needs to do
and then it might shoot up some requests
to the database and might change the
data in there and then it'll tell our
application what's happened it might
return sign from the database it might
say that it ran some query and it didn't
find a match for username and password
and things like that so to start off
with let's create our opening closing
PHP tags there and we're just going to
create a connection to our database so
we'll do new my SQL I a local host
that's probably what it will be and then
your database username the database
password and then the name of the
database and we're also going to be
supplying a parameter by using the
action variable here so when we make a
call to this API we're going to supply
several different actions in the URL and
then we're going to do different things
based on what we get we won't get too
far into that in this video we'll expand
on this much more in a later one but
essentially will just be switching
between different actions and then
performing different things based on
whatever the action is the result will
be what gets sent back to our
application so just as a default we're
going to create a JSON string that says
a success folks just so we know that
whatever we tried to do dinner wound and
then end of this file we're going to
echo out that result so our application
can pull that in and read what's going
on and in between here this is where all
the magic weapon will have all at
different cases and if users logging in
we'll run a login query into database
if I want to create a new account will
do that but that's the stuff that we'll
get into in a later video what we do
need to do here to get this API set up
and working though is supply a few
Heather's so if you're trying to
communicate with the server it's outside
of the domain of the application you run
into cross-origin resource sharing
issues so basically it's just a security
measure if you're requesting these
things from outside of the domain that
you're in it might not necessarily be
something you want but in this case it
is so basically we just need to say that
we're happy for things to be requested
from a different origin so we're going
to set access control allow origin to
all wild card you can't specifically set
domain to you as well if you like we
also want to set access control allow
methods and we want to set that to get
post and options and we want one more
header which is access control allow
headers and we want to allow content
type X prototype version and X requested
with and with those set up everything
should work now so if we set this up
uploaded it and went to the address we
just get this JSON string for now the
success Fox a but in one of the later
episodes we're going to rather a
tutorial and episode we're going to go
through different cases and then we're
going to modify what this result is
based on what we're doing and then our
application will pull that in and
perform functions and
asian so in the next video we will start
looking at actually building the
application and generating it but for
now that's all we need to do on the back
end side of things so I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
