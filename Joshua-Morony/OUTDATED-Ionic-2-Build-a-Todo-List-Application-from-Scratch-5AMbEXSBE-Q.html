how to build a really simple to do style
application with ionic 2 it's going to
be very simple for now what it's going
to create something that can view some
data add some data and also save that
data so it's available later as well so
we're gonna do this completely from
scratch so we're going to start off by
creating a new blank ionic 2 project if
you haven't already got ionic 2 set up
yet I'll link to a blog post I've
already done I explained how you can get
up and running
yeah but it's more or less exactly the
same as it was in ionic 1 you can just
run ionic start and then the name of
your application which we'll call ionic
to do we want to use the blank template
for this one and you also need to
provide a v2 flag to actually build it
with ionic 2 so hit enter and get that
just generating ok that's finished
generating now so if I just change my
directory to the project that I just
created and now I can run on it serve
again that's the same as ionic 1 to pop
up the application in the browser window
I've got unit and so this yes still has
all the live reloading so as soon as you
make any change in your file you'll see
it here right away
so there's a little bit of template code
here in the blank application but it's
more or less just an empty project so
now I'm going to open up that project
and I'm gonna have a look at the code ok
I've got the code open up and now in my
text editor you can see where the files
and folders over here if you want more
of an explanation on I guess general
structure of an ionic 2 projects the
blog post I'll link will give you some
more information on that but we're just
going to jump straight into the coding
side of things and the folder we're
going to look at here is under the www
folder we have app and that's where
basically all of the code for the
application is going to live and so
there's a default home component that's
already being created here and that's
what we saw just a second ago
we don't really want to call that home
for this application though so what
we're going to do is just rename it to
what we want so I'm going to call that
list and we're going to be creating a
few more of these components as well and
I'll rename that to list or HTML so
that's the template file for the list
component or what will be the list
component at least and this is our
JavaScript file and rename that to list
is okay we'll come back to that in a
second actually one might just change
this now so we don't think yet so
obviously that's importing from
different location now so change that to
list list and we'll call it list
component instead to actually we'll call
it list page instead of home component
save that and let's jump into the app
J's file here and so you can see it's
importing the home component from that
folder that we just changed so we'll
also change that to list page and that's
importing from the list folder okay and
you can see there's a template defined
for the app dot J's file just like
there's a list template here but it's a
pretty simple one so they've just got a
defined in a string here but if you want
to define it in a file you could
separate that out say template URL and
provide that there instead but we'll
just keep it like that for now
we'll leave that as AB component that's
fine but we do want to change the root
page here to a long list page okay so
that should all work now so if I take a
look in the browser again that should
just look exactly the same
and it does and I just to show you
that's a lot of updating I just changed
that 201 save it and a couple of seconds
you will see this change I know you
weren't actually Heco's I caused an
error it's are deceptive that we stopped
that again if I run on it so again that
should fix that
okay I've got the app up again now and
if I change that to take home to now you
guys are reloads and we can see the
change right away okay now that that's
all working correctly we're going to
actually start building some stuff and
we're gonna start by modifying this list
template so that looks more like what
we're actually going to need for our
to-do list application so to start off
with we have this I'm I own navbar the
fly interior and it's using this weird
star thing which is new to angular 2 so
basically that transforms this into a a
template component and the ion nav by
uses that the ion nav rather uses that
as its configuration for what should be
happening in the navigation bar so right
now we're just supplying a title called
column but we're going to want to have a
little button over here on the
right-hand side
so we can add new items to the to-do
list so to do that we can add director
via called on nav items and we can
either set this to the primary or a
secondary so I'm going to set that to
secondary and what that means basically
is in the case of iOS the secondary
items will be on the right side of the
toolbar and the primary buttons will be
on the left and that's that depends on
what platform you're running on so ionic
will automatically decide where it
should sit based on what you supply here
but if you want to more explicitly set
that and say I wanted to always be on
the right then you can do that as well
okay now we're just going to add a
button here and we're going to add a
listener to it a click listener this is
kind of like ng-click from ionic 1 or
angular 1 and we're going to call the
add item
function when that is clipped of course
we haven't defined that yet but we will
soon and we're going to add one of the
new ionic ons or at least the new syntax
here so to add an icon all you have to
do is type icon and say well icon you
want so I want the add icon for that and
let's also say add item to make it
really clear so hit save I should see my
button pop up there and I can which is
good and now we want to replace this ion
content the island card section rather
with a list that's going to display all
of our to-do items so we use the same
ion list that you would use in mine as
well and we will add the ion item to
that and now we're going to do an NG 4
which is similar to ng-repeat from
angular 1 and so we want to loop over
items so we're going to say hash item of
items and so what this sort do is I look
through each of the items in our items
data over that's defiant and we're also
by setting this hash here we're keeping
it a reference to which item which we
can then say pass into a click function
which we are about to do right now so
we'll add a click listener there and set
that equal feet item again we haven't
defined this yet but we will soon and
we're going to pass in that reference to
the item so when someone clicks that
we'll be able to pass it into our
function and do what we want with it
which will be displaying a page with
some new data or eventually and we also
just want to render the title of the
item here again it's the same as ionic 1
it's use the double braces there to
display that okay I'll get saved there
ok so now the car
obviously the list is blanked because we
don't have any data actually defined yet
so let's jump over into lists yes um now
we're going to set up our constructor to
actually have some items defined okay
I've gone ahead and just added some data
into the constructor now and you can see
that that's reflected in our list that's
getting pulled in there so now what we
want to do is let's go with the add item
I guess that's a good place to start so
we're going to create our function here
so we're already calling this from a
list of HTML where we say add item so
when that's clipped that's calling an
item from list of JSU so let's create
that add item and what we want to do is
say this now push add item page and also
going to pass in the this list page
component so we have a reference to that
so none of these this isn't going to
work now I suspect if I change that
that's going to reach the live reloading
no it still works okay that's good so
we're pushing a new component onto a
navigation stack here so we've got add
item page where does it it doesn't exist
yet that'll be a new component just like
his list is and we're also using the nav
controller as well but to use the nav
controller we need to import that so
I'll just add that to you here that
comes from the ionic library as well so
just write and have control of it it's
gonna put semicolon on the end of that
to make me feel better and then we can
pass that through our constructor here
so we can say no shouldn't nav
controller
and then we'll just store that as a
member variable one our component here
so say this don't know equals no and so
now that will be available here and now
we just need to add that item page so
let's go over and create that component
now and to make things easier I'll do
this off-screen okay so I've added a new
component now I've copied the same
structure that we're using for the list
here I've got the add item to HTML and
add item jeaious and so now I'm going to
create the template for that so I'm just
gonna copy and paste this one over save
a bit of time and it's going to be very
similar setup but let's change the title
of this one to add item and we're also
going to change this click handle to
cool
save item and I'll change how scared of
that icon and change that to say I so
we'll create this save item a little bit
later as well and we're going to replace
our own item here with a couple of input
fields so I do I on input and we use the
floating label and I think this is a new
to ionic to haven't seen in ionic 1
Abbott provides a nice little effect
when you click on the input area which
you're seeing it a second obviously
title that's the title of the the notes
and we'll do a text input and this
syntax here sets up that two-way
data-binding so that's again that
similar to the ng model from ionic one
and I'll just copy over the next one to
do that off camera so I'll just speed
things up a bit
okay we've got a couple of inputs up now
so we've got the title of the note the
description of the note and we have this
two-way data-binding setup so this will
as we change this it'll affect our item
jeaious here we'll have the title and
description set up kind of like we have
the item set up here and so as soon as
we make a change to these fields it'll
automatically get updated there as well
so now we're going to build this add
items jeaious so I had item J as page
file so let's just steal the code from
our list jeaious and again it's going to
look pretty similar okay we're gonna
keep the the nav controller for this one
as well but we're also going to import
the nerve params which will basically
allow us to pass in data from one view
to another so in this case we're going
to want to pass in the list page and the
reason for this is because eventually
I'm gonna create a data service and
we're going to save this into permanent
storage so we're not going to need it
just yet but we will eventually now
we're going to change this of course to
be called something else so we're gonna
call it add item page and we're going to
change the template URL here to add item
and we're gonna pass in that Neve params
as well and sit that yeah it's don't
know params equals no parens and I'm
going to set up the title and
description as well I will just set
those to be blank and we can get rid of
items because we won't need that in this
view and we'll remove that function as
well and instead we're gonna replace it
with the save item function and we're
going to say let new item and let's
another new thing to angular to
basically it just keeps the variables
within a smaller scope rather than
having variables leaking out into other
functions and stuff we're going to give
that a title of whatever this stock
title is and a description of whatever
justdon't description is so as they
modify those fields we created that will
get updated here and when they hit
stable item it'll look to see whatever
those values are and create a new item
based on that and now we're going to
call this shot
no params get this page actually want to
call a function on that list page which
would be save item and we want to pass
in new item which is that item is
created there based on what the user
inputted and then we also want to pop
that view so that we'd go back to our
list page so basically push in your
property is so we pushed on the add item
page and then we pop it back off again
to go back to where we were
I could also push more pages on here I
could push a add an extra details page
or something and then I can provide even
more information
and I could pop that page to bring me
back to the add item page I pop it again
I'd go back to the list page okay now
that we've got our component created
let's actually import that into list
objects so we're not actually importing
from the ioniq library anymore we're
importing our own component that we
created so I'll do it on a set the line
add import add item page from and we'll
just supply the path to where that can
be found which is in add item folder so
if I save that now I should be able to
hit the add item button yeah there we go
now it's refreshed if I hit add item
that will break I think it's because I
had a syntax error here I've missed the
closing bracket so hopefully I can hit
save and try again okay that's it now
that works so we've got those two fields
that we created before and got those
floating label things as you click on
them it is this fancy little animation
there we can hit back to go back to the
view we were on before so that's all
added automatically just like in ionic
one and then we will be able to just
save eventually but if I do that now
that's not going to work because we
haven't hooked that up yet sorry just it
just just hit save and I think so
basically now what we need to do is add
a function that will add that data to
the list and we're also going to make it
save into permanent storage as well but
before we do that let's make it so that
we can click on these and see the
details of the to-do item so as you saw
we're also adding a description which
you can't see here probably make more
sense just to put on this page but after
the sake of the tutorial we'll do or -
everyone
so we're going to create another new
component this one's going to be the
view item component so I'll create that
now and then come back okay so i've
created a new folder hole to hold the
item detail component we're going to
create now i'm gonna steal the template
from this one again just because i'm a
bit of a slow typer and i'm sure you
don't want to watch that so with this
one we're gonna use the whatever the
title of the item is as the title we
don't need any extra buttons here so
we'll get rid of that and we're going to
use the eye on card directive that was
actually G in there by default and use
that we will use my own card content and
whatever we want to display in the card
will go inside of here and all we want
to do is just show the description of
the item yeah I'll save that and now I
need to create the item detail jeaious
and again I'm gonna steal some code from
here okay for this one we're not doing
any pushing or popping so we can get rid
of the nav controller but we do still
need nav grams because we're going to
pass in the details of the item from the
last page and we're also going to get
rid of add item page because we don't
need that here change the template URL
to be the item detail template and of
course we'll change this to be item
detail page
I will change that controller with the
nav friends
set that here as well and get rid of the
items again and I go here to this
function because we don't need that and
then we'll set the title and the
description to be the values that were
passed in from the other page so I'll
set this to this stop now the params
yeah item dot title and they stop
description goes this stops no prams fix
that don't get item description okay to
walk you through what's actually going
to happen here so the whole process
starts off at the list page we have the
ng 4 here creating an eye on item for
every one of the items that are in our
array here and for each of those if you
click on them it'll call this view item
function which will pass in that
specific item that was clicked that will
come into here and we can see we're
setting title and description to
whatever the title in the description of
the item that it's getting passed in is
and then that will allow us to render
that the title and the description yeah
because that will pull in these values
this top title desktop description so
the last thing we need to do is actually
create this view heightened function so
we'll say you I turn item and then we
want to push that I chime in to our new
page so we'll call that item detail page
and then pass in the item as item and we
also need to make sure we import that
item detail component up here so item
detail page from the item detail folder
and as long as I haven't missed anything
that should all work now and so I should
be able to click on one of these no
arrow again okay I found the problem I
forgot to capitalize that in there
hopefully if we hit save now and try
again it should work okay there we go so
now I can click on the item to bring up
the new new page with the detail is in
this little card here okay so the only
thing left to do now is to actually have
our items be added to this list when we
add an item and then save that into
permanent storage so I'm going to create
a data service now that will help handle
all of that for us and then we'll just
be able to call a function called save
item from our list that will handle
storing that okay so this one's going to
look a little bit different to the rest
of them it's going to be rather than a
page we've been defining all the others
as at page that's a decorator which
tells onic that we're building a page
essentially
this one's going to be an injectable
which is basically this service we can
use throughout our application so for
this one we're going to import storage
and SQL storage from the ionic library
and so what this does basically is if
you do st. like local forage before it's
a similar concept so just the plain
local storage in the browser which you
access just by storing strings on window
dot local storage it's a great way to
store small amounts of data but the
problem is that it's possible for it to
get cleared at some point so if you
you're storing important data for your
application in local storage you know
obviously if it's randomly you can get
wiped it's not really a great solution
so things like local forage I'll link to
a post which explains all the different
storage options in more detail but
essentially it helps you store it
permanently so in the case of SQL
storage here which design that ionic
provides to us that'll use the web SQL
as a storage option if you're running
for the browser but if you install the
SQLite native plugin it will actually
use an SQLite database rather than
storing data in the browser so that's a
much more permanent solution while it is
a permanent solution it won't get Udall
never get wiped and it also provides
more powerful ways to query that as well
rather than just you know fetching and
retrieving strings from local storage
the downside is I think the only
difference I can see between Onix sq SQL
storage and local forage is that with
SQL storage you still have to store them
as store data as strings as far as I can
tell but let's get into it I hopefully
will be made more clear as we actually
coded and so we're importing the
injectable from the angular 2 library
and it will add that decorator there and
we're creating a new class called
daata sir's set up a constructor here as
you probably seen every class has a
constructor and we'll set storage to a
new instance of storage and we use SQL
storage for that and we'll come up with
a name for it database I will call it to
do that now you can call that whatever
you want really it will set the data
initially to null and then what we want
to do is fetch any existing data that's
in that database when we load the
application so I will get to do that
then once that's finished fetching that
data will pass through the - duze to
this function and we'll just set the
data to whatever came in and as I said
you can only store strings so whatever
we store in the database is going to be
in a JSON format so we want to pass that
so we get the actual array back rather
than just a plain string we're going to
add a function called get data and this
will basically just have the role of
returning the data from this service so
we're gonna do rather than actually
returning just this doc data we're gonna
return this just storage should get to
do that so this will return a promise
rather than just fetching the data from
here because if we just return the data
then that's not going to update
throughout our application so if I had
say mu then that's not going to be
reflected here but by returning this
promise when we call get data and that's
going to go fetch the latest data that's
available in the database
now we also want a save function here so
we want to be able to pass in an item to
this service and we want it to handle
updating our data in the database
essentially so we're gonna add a check
here to see if the data exists if it
doesn't we're this going to set it to
whatever the item is the past in that
was passed in because there's only one
of them and we'll say let new data equal
Jason dot stringify item so that will
create a JSON string of the item that we
passed in and then we want to set the
storage to to the new data if we already
do have some data we don't want to just
overwrite it we want to add to it so
we'll do this data push item they don't
add that to the array and then we'll
that I new data from jason dot stringify
it's dot data and then again we'll set
the storage to that so in this case
we've got all the data that already
existed added to it and then stored all
that new data otherwise we just
overwrite what was there already okay so
now we're going to make some changes to
our list is to make use of that new data
service we just created so first we're
going to import the data service from a
folder and we're going to have to pass
in the data service as well
and set that here okay so now we're
gonna get rid of this dummy data that we
have and we're just going to set that to
be empty right because the calls to load
the data it going to be asynchronous
which means that our programs going to
continue running until it comes back
here the data comes back at a later
point in time so we want to set that to
be blank so if we're trying to do
anything with distant items before the
data is returned it's not going to throw
an error and what we want to do in the
app first loads is we want to call the
data service will call that get data
function and as I mentioned before it
returns a promise not just the data
directly so we can create a function
here to take in the dues that are
returned and when we do get them or set
the stock items to Jason pass to do this
or if nothing comes back we'll set it to
an empty array I just noticed the screen
on the right is blank here which
probably means there's an error
somewhere and is I forgot to mention
that we need to import that data service
as a provider in fjs so we'll have to
import that as well here from the Java
folder again and we'll add it as a
provider to make it available throughout
the application yes I hope so if I save
that the things should start looking
normal again
okay so yeah with applications working
now but obviously we've got no items
because we haven't stored any in the
database yet so let's jump back into
here and create a function called save
item that will allow us to do that so
we're going to pass in an item which
will come from the add item page and
we're going to push that to our data so
to this stop items I'm so best thing
that will make sure that as soon as we
save an item will immediately see it in
the list here but as well as doing that
we also want to send off that item to
our data service to get saved
so that will go to here and then it will
run through all this and historic using
SQL storage okay so hopefully and that
should be done now so let's give it a
try and see if it works
so I'll click add item we'll do chest
chest I hit save and we have another
error I should have seen that I use this
items instead of item and let's try that
again hopefully no more errors add item
chest brother test test
save okay and now you can see chest was
out of there let's click it and we have
tests they're still let's try add
another item to make sure it's working
correctly
hello save you can't me out there we can
look at that and we can also look at
that okay so that always seems to be
working and one final test if i refresh
that now all the data should still be
there so it's not being lost on refresh
which means that our data service is
successfully pulling that from the SQL
storage which since running through a
browser is storing in web SQL but it was
on a device then it
from the SQLite database okay so that's
the end of this tutorial
obviously there's a lot more we could do
with this application we could make it
look a lot prettier we could add the
option to edit - duze we could add the
option to delete - duze but it's
probably a good place to leave that
we've covered off a few few of the new
ionic - things like how to add a switch
between views how to push data to views
how to save data how to handle events
and buttons and all that kind of stuff
so hopefully that's a pretty good start
application if you're new to I Nick -
it's probably a nice little app to have
a bit of a play around in I probably
will release another tutorial at some
point maybe Webb will extend this to do
some more stuff
they'll definitely be releasing plenty
of ionic - content in the future so make
sure you subscribe on YouTube subscribe
to my email list if you want I'll
provide all the links in the description
