how to include native plugins in ionic 2
applications our native plugin allows us
to access native functionality on a
device add functionality that's
typically not available directly through
the browser which is where our
application lives and so what I have up
on screen now is an example of that we
have - we have two native plugins being
imported from learning native here the
status bar and splash screen plugins and
then we're calling some functions here
once the application is loaded so we're
calling satisfied or style default to
style the status bar on the device and
we're also making a call to hide the
splash screen so both of these things
are specific to a native device it's not
something that's available through the
browser so the status bar is the bar at
the top that has the battery indicator
and things like that and this plug-in
allows us to styled up of course in the
browser that is an exist and same with
the splash screen that's only visible or
available on a actual native app that's
installed on a device so to explain
exactly how these plugins work I'm going
to go sort of right back to the
beginning and explain the core concepts
outside of ionic 2 and just the bare
bones of basics of Cordova itself so if
you don't already know Cordova is what
we use to package our own ik 2
applications into an actual native
application that can be submitted to an
app store now you don't have to do this
if you're just creating say a
progressive web app that's going to run
through the web you don't need Cordova
the Cordova allows us to package our a
browser-based application into a native
package that then has access to native
API so the browser itself can't access a
lot of these the native API is on a
device
if we want to access contacts for
example we can't do that through the
browser
the contacts live on the device and
we're sandbox into the browser that our
application is running through there's
no way for us to grab those contacts
because that's using a native API so
what Cordova does is since we're already
in this native environment we're running
in a browser that is embedded into a
native application that native
application that is embedded into does
have access to all those things so the
basic concept is that a Cordova plugins
provide a little bridge for us so we can
make our browser-based application
communicate with the Cordova package
which can then communicate with the
native API to get what we want and then
it can then tell us the information we
need
so the browser sort of makes a request
to cut over that communicates with the
device the device tells Cordova what we
wanted and then Cordova give that
information to our application in the
browser so for Cordova itself we don't
need to use ionic - we don't need to use
ionic one we don't need to use anything
any specific frameworks Cordova will
just run a web code it's going to run
HTML CSS and JavaScript so if we wanted
to we could build our own just basic web
page
we'll just with plain HTML CSS and
JavaScript package it with Cordova and
we could make that into a native
application and you can use the plugins
that way as well we have say that
Cordover status bar plug-in here so all
you need to do is run the install
command for that once you have a Cordova
project running and you'll be able to
access that with your basic webpage that
you're packaging with Cordova the
problem with that is that if you're
trying to build a mobile app it is very
very hard to create a mobile app without
a framework like ionic so that just
makes it a lot easier for us to create
something that looks like a real native
mobile application but my point is
though that you don't need ionic to use
plugins a lot of people will ask the
question how do I use this plug-in in
ionic
some people might think well I'll use
this plugin and ionic one but I don't
know how to use it in ionic 2 but the
point is there's no real difference
service the same plugin and it's going
to work the same no matter what
framework you use it in or even if you
use no framework at all so that's how
Cordova works and of course we're using
ionic 2 because we want to make it much
easier for us to create these
applications and then we are going to
use those Cordova plugins ni on it too
now there is one little extra thing with
iron it to regarding plugins and there's
a similar thing for ionic 1 which used
to be ng Cordova but now it is this
thing called ionic native and you can
find the documentation for that here so
this isn't this doesn't use any kind of
different method for accessing native
functionality it's still just using
normal Cordova plugins what our nickname
does is adds this wrapper around that
functionality if you look in any
documentation for this for example
you'll find all the methods for
interacting with this plug-in and the
the status of our plug-in is quite
simple just plain not the best example
here but a lot of Cordova plugins work
whereas they you should provide some
global object and they provide some
functions on that I wish use things like
callbacks typically callback functions
and it's a bit messy to work with in the
structure of an ionic 2 application and
so what the ionic native service does is
it wraps these plugin interfaces up into
something that integrates more easily
with ionic 2 so rather than using
callback functions and global objects
and stuff like that we just have this
plugin that we can import likely import
any of our pages and then that handles
all of the type issues for us you may
have run into an issue where you try to
use some functionality and you get a
typescript error saying it doesn't know
what it is it can't find the type Google
for example so if you try to use a lot
of plugins in your ionic 2 application
without ionic natives
it doesn't have the types installed and
so if you use a plugin through ionic
native you're not going to worry about
running into issues with types and as
well as that when you use a plugin
through our nickname it's going to
return things like observables and
promises and things that work better in
the ionic 2 environment you can see here
for the geolocation example they have
here we've got a geolocation of watch
position and then I subscribed so this
is returning and observable and we're
subscribing to that observable which
then reports the position so this is a
very honest - way of doing things
but if you were to use the normal
geolocation plugin so I've just got the
documentation for that up now so if we
find the what we were working with watch
position you can see this is the normal
Cordova way to use the watch position
function from the geolocation plugin so
we call navigator dot geo location which
is this global object so that's going to
cause issues for us with types and type
script and then we supply it with some
callback functions and some options here
so we have a success function and an
error function and so that's going to
then when that result returns it's going
to call this this callback or this
callback and if you take a look just
here you can see how that might look and
this is it's a very typical way to do
things in JavaScript but it's not the
nicest way to do it it's not the way we
typically do things are using ionic 2 so
ionic native just makes it a bit nicer
for us to use but again you don't have
to use ionic native generally I would
recommend to use the ionic native
implementation of the plug-in wherever
possible because it is a lot cleaner and
nicer to use but it is not a requirement
this doesn't add any kind of extra
access over what Cordova already
provides
so if we just look at this plug in
itself you can see there's a source
folder here and if we jump into there
you'll see a bunch of different folders
so we have a folder for Android and a
folder for iOS and so what this plug-in
does is it provides actual native code
for each platform that it can run on
which is going to communicate with those
native API so if I open up the iOS
folder here we can see the header file
for the geolocation plug-in and then we
just have this objective-c code which is
a native code for iOS it's what native
iOS developers would use either they
thought Swift and this is what is
responsible for grabbing the information
that we need from the native API and
then it provides that interface back to
our application in Cordova so then we
can then access those results from the
browser and it's the same for the the
Android version but rather than being
objective-c uses the native language for
Android which is Java and so you can see
is the the Java code for accessing that
same functionality so it will provide
the native functionality the native code
for each platform that can run on and
then it's going to return that to us in
this common after this common API that
we can access through the browser so
it's not going to matter whether it's
running on Android or iOS we're just
going to use the same code in our
application and you don't need to unless
you want to develop your own plugins of
course you don't need to worry about
this actual implementation I just wanted
to point out a little bit about how it
works so if we just jump back to that
example application I had before so you
can see here as I mentioned at the start
we're importing those things from my own
nickname and then were accessing them
here the other important thing to note
is that you still need to install those
plugins with Cordova so if we come back
into the documentation here I'll just
bring up the status bar plug-in
or is that you'll see there's this
install command here so that's what
installs the Cordova plugin so in the
case of status bar in the splash screen
they're actually already installed by
default because ionic includes it in the
app generation here this is all just
boilerplate code but for other plugins
to use you'll need to make sure to run
those install commands so you can access
that functionality so if I just serve
that now so you'll see in the console
over here that we're getting a warning
which is another handy thing about ionic
negative is that it does provide these
nice warnings for us if things are wrong
as opposed to using the Cordova plugin
directly which is just going to create
errors for us but it says here tried
calling status file style default but
Cordova is not available and make sure
to include Cordova dodge as a run in a
device flash simulator so as I mentioned
at the start this status bar it's not
available through the browser it's a
native thing and most Cordova plugins
access some kind of native functionality
which means you need to be running on a
real device or on a simulator for it to
work
so since I have the Cordova plug-in
installed and I'm trying to access the
functionality here I was to instead run
this on a real device this code would
work but again it's not going to work
when I run it through the browser okay
so I hope this tutorial clarified
exactly how a Cordova plug-in actually
works a difference between using a
plug-in in ionic 2 or using in any other
framework or just using it with no
framework just directly through Cordova
the main point there is that it doesn't
really matter there's not any difference
between using a Cordova plug-in in ionic
2 or any other framework the only
difference in only 2 is that we have
ionic native which makes it a little bit
easier for us to implement but it is not
at all required ok so I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial and I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
