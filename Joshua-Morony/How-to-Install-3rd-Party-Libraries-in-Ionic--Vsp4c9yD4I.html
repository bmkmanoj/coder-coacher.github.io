how to really quickly install
third-party libraries into your ionic 2
applications
now obviously ionic 2 provides a lot of
functionality by default but they're
likely come a point in time where you
want to include some kind of generic
JavaScript library or something like
that into application so that you can
access the functionality that provides
so that might be things like Google Maps
or charts library or CouchDB like I have
up on the screen here I'm not gonna talk
about the different things you can do
with libraries in this video I'm just
going to show you a couple of examples
of how to just install them in your
application so primarily there's there's
two different ways you'd usually
approach this one is using es6 modules
and importing that functionality into
your application or you can also just
use the kind of old-school method I
guess of just using a script tag in your
index.html file so I'm going to cover
both of those examples and I'm also
going to cover how to use types which is
an important aspect of getting these
libraries working so we're going to
start off with a pouch DB example Keena
and i've got up the setup page here
which describes different methods for
installing pouch DB and so the one we're
going to use is this NPM one here we're
going to install pouch DB using NPM and
then we're going to import pouch D into
our application using the es6 module
approach and so here you'll see that
they're using the using require here to
load in pouch DB
we won't be using require will be using
assigning a little bit different so I've
already generated an application that
I'm going to use as an example so to
install pouch DB all we need to do is
run that command there so you'll just
need to run NPM install pouch DB and
this would be the same for most
libraries you'll find
it'll just be npm install' and the name
of the library so just check out the
documentation for whatever library you
were trying to install and they'll
likely have some instructions for that
okay so a patch to be is installed now
so I'm going to jump into the code for
this application I've generated okay so
usually if I was going to do some kind
of pouch DB implementation I'd probably
create a provider or something to handle
the pouch DB functionality but just for
this example I'm just going to do it
directly in the home page here so what
we need to do is at an import statement
and we want to just want to say import
pouch DB just like in the require
example here how setting up it s ending
up on a pouch DB variable instead we'll
just do import pouch DB from and then
the name of the library that we're using
so we just use pouch DB so that should
now make that functionality available to
us if I was to just add in an ion
viewdidload
function here it should trigger once the
view has loaded if I try to log out
pouch DB hopefully we see something in
the console okay so I can see something
being logged out to the console here for
pouch DB so that means we're
successfully managed to import something
now which is good okay so now let's try
a bit of a different example with Google
Maps now so this time rather than
installing the library through NPM we're
just going to grab a script tag we're
gonna grab the Euro for the JavaScript
SDK and just add it in a script tag just
as they recommend in the documentation
here so all I have to do here so I'll
just grab the URL we're only going to
use this first bit here we don't need to
supply an API key for this test if you
are creating a real application that
you're gonna submit to the App Store you
should generate new picker API key and
display it here or rather insert it here
I won't talk about that here I'll link
to another
tutorial I have on Google Maps if you go
interested in learning a little bit more
about how it all works I just want to
show you how to get it set up using a
script tag so I'm going to copy that out
there and then we have to jump into the
index.html file and add a script tag a
script source equals supply that close
the tag and that's it now I'm using this
approach rather than so with the module
approach here with pouch DB this sort of
makes it this is going to make a global
object available which in terms of the
structure of ionic 2 and angular 2
applications and I think it makes more
sense to use the the module approach and
keep everything isolated but this will
work will have a global object called
Google which will be able to access from
anywhere so then if I was to come in
here and I'll just try to log out the
Google object here and we'll just take a
look at what that does ok so you can see
we get an error here which says cannot
find name Google this is an issue you're
going to run into a lot when trying to
install third-party libraries into your
ionic 2 applications since we're using
typescript essentially typescript likes
to know everything that's happening in
the application so if it finds a keyword
that it doesn't know exists it doesn't
know what it's supposed to be it's just
going to assume that we've made some
error there and so we're trying to
access this Google Google global object
the typescript has no idea that it even
exists so it's going to trigger that
error so what we need to do is let
typescript know that this is a thing
that we want to use so there's two ways
you can do that one of the Gangstar the
less preferable way is you can simply
add a declare VAR Google above the
component decorator here and that will
suppress that error so we'll save that
in this check that actually goes away ok
so you can see that error is gone now
and
be able to use Google and everything
will be fine but the proper way to do
this is not to do that but rather
install the types for Google
specifically or for Google Maps so I
save this again we're gonna get that
error back or just get back to that
state first okay so we've got the error
again and what I'm going to do now is
install the types so we can install
types for a bunch of different libraries
by using this command so just npm
install like you wouldn't normally
install a library but instead use app
types and then the name of the types
package you want to use so in this case
that's Google Maps and we want to save
that as well and so obviously what types
you and still here is going to depend on
the library so you do a quick Google
search will bring up what types packings
you actually need to install but if I
run that command now and then I try to
serve this application again hopefully
we won't have that error any longer okay
so now the type error is gone now and we
can continue on so it's the benefit of
using the actual types is that's going
to set up all the types for the the
Google objects related to the Google
Maps which is I guess taking advantage
of the what typescript offers in
ensuring type checking and making sure a
variable was being assigned to the right
things and in general adding a sort of
extra level of checking to your
application but if your particular
library that you are using doesn't have
a tie it's packaged available or I don't
know for some reason it's just not
working for you if you need to you can
use that just declare the approach
instead and that's the same for a pouch
DB as well if you want to install types
of pouch DB I think these impairments
stool types and I think it's just pouch
DB for that any any any sort of library
it'll be a similar format with just the
name of the library place there instead
but again make sure you just look it up
to make sure you're installing the right
package
the exact installation and setup of a
third-party library that you're using is
going to depend on what the library is
but most of them will follow this sort
of general format we just install it by
NPM and port it install the types and
then you can use it some might be a
little bit different some might not have
sort of a module approach available some
might require even in the module file
some come as their own ng modules
angular 2 so you can you may have to
actually set it up and import it in here
as well as installing it but for the
most part it will just be pretty
straightforward for most libraries ok so
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
