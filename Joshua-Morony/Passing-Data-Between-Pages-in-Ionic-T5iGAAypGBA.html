pass data between pages in ironing to
there's a few different ways you can go
about doing this and I'm going to go
through sort of the most common way to
do it through to some more uncommon ways
so we're going to cover how to use just
passing data using the nav controls and
retrieving it with nav per am's
we're going to use modal's and we're
going to use a provider to share data
between pages and we're also going to
cover how to use events to pass data so
I'm just going to start out by
generating a new application we're going
to generate a page as well and we're
just going to walk through all of the
different examples so I'm just going to
run the start command to generate a new
ionic to application and we're going to
call this one this ionic to pass data we
use a blank template and use the V to
flag so we'll just wait for that to
generate okay so that's finished
generating now I'm just going to change
into it and then we're going to generate
a page that we're going to use to pass
data to and also to pass data from that
page back to our original page as well
so just going to run ionic G page and
we're just going to call this second and
then we'll use our default home page as
the the other page that we're going to
send the data from okay so we're just
going to serve that so we can check out
what's happening in the browser and
before we can make use of that second
page we generated we're going to have to
set that up in our module file so I'm
going to open up the code now and
sublime and we're going to do that okay
so I've got the project open here if you
take a look in the source folder you'll
see under pages we have that second page
we've generated which looks just the
same as the default home page and so I'm
just going to come into this app folder
here go to the module file and we're
going to have to import that and then
add it to the declarations and entry
components
right in this file so I'm just going to
import that now add it to the
declarations array and to the entrance
components array so with that done we'll
be able to use that page throughout the
application now so we're going to start
off by showing how to pass data from a
page that we've pushed to with the nav
controller so this is a going to be a
really common case a lot of the time
this is how your pages would work and
how you pass data between them and so to
do that we're going to just come to our
home page here and we're going to import
that second page that we just generated
and we're going to push this onto the
navigation stack and we're going to pass
some data to it so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to create a function
here that we're going to activate in the
template so we'll just call it a launch
second page I will just get this hooked
up first so I'll make sure it's all
working so I'm just going to log out
clicked here for now
and then we'll open up the template here
and we're just going to create a button
now we're going to add a click handler
here that launches or the triggers that
function which was launched second page
so if I jump over into the browser now
we should be able to click that and see
that it logs out clicked to the console
there and it does so that's working fine
so now we can change this function so
that we launch our new page and pass a
data to it so to push a new page we just
use the nav controller here which has
already been injected for us by default
and we do this dot nav controller dot
push and then we supply the the page
that we're pushing so we want to push
second page so let's save that and we'll
check that it works so if I click on
this now the second page comes up and
the back button automatically displays
if we click that it goes back to the
original page so if you don't really
know how this works if you've never come
across it before I'll link to some
resources that you can check out that
explains any more depth so we don't just
want to push that page though we want to
push some data to the page so let's say
we have some data here that we want to
pass along I'll just make something up
let's say we had some kind of recipe so
I wanted a title which is yummy pancakes
and we might have an ingredients array
which can have flour I guess and pancake
stuff
and we'll also put in one more thing
let me think time so if it takes ten
minutes to go so we want to pass all of
that data into the next page so what we
can do we have this data object now that
contains all of that data and we can
just pass that in as a second parameter
to push here so if I supply that there
that will pass that along you can also
if you didn't want to predefined that
data as a separate variable there you
could also just directly define the
object here instead but I'll just do it
this way for now if I save that and I'm
going to jump over into the second page
now and so what I need to do is grab
that data that's being passed along and
you can see it has actually already
injected nav params for us which is what
we're going to use to grab that data so
in the ion viewdidload function here
which automatically gets triggered when
the the view is loaded we can do this no
params don't get and then we can get
whatever data we are trying to grab so
let's say I want to grab the title I can
say get title here and save that and
we'll see if it works by jumping into
the browser here sorry that's not
actually going to work because all I'm
doing is referencing here I need to log
that out so we can actually see what
that value is you could of course also
assign it to some variable as well and
use that somewhere else but for now
we're just going to log the hell and
we'll see what that contains so let this
refresh now
click on the next button and you can see
that it's logging out yummy pancakes
they're so anything that we pass along
in this data object here we'll be able
to access on that second page so this
works well for data that's flowing
forwards we want to push a new page pass
and data to it and then we could also
say have a third page and we push some
data from the second page to the third
page but this doesn't work well for data
that's flowing backwards let's say if we
want to do something on the second page
that we then want to pass back to our
home page we can't really do that with
this method it's a really great way to
handle that is to use modal's and so a
modal is so essentially like a pop-up
type page probably very familiar with
modal's like Facebook in photo viewers
where it pops up the picture under the
page in front of everything else to
probably than going to a separate page
and so what we can do with that modal is
we can pop it up and then we can also
add a listener so when that modal is
dismissed that it passes data back to
the page that launched that modal so
we're going to modify this now to use
that method and we're going to try and
log out data from the second page in
this home page instead so before we can
do that we're going to have to import
the modal controller so import that from
the ioniq angular library and we'll also
set it up we inject it in our
constructor here
now we don't actually need this data
anymore so I'm just going to delete that
so it's not confusing what we do need to
do is now create a modal and so we can
create a new variable to hold that so
let's say let modal equal and then we
use the modal controller to create a
modal from that so I say let modal he
call this modal controller don't create
and then we just supply the page that we
want to use so second page now and then
we can get rid of this here and then
once we have that created we also need
to display it and to display it we do
modal present so I'll save that now and
we'll take a look at what happens in our
browser so if I click on next now you
can see it pops up at that second page
there and we're still trying to grab
stuff with nav params which doesn't
exist anymore so that's why it's popping
up undefined there so right now I have
no way of actually closing this modal so
I have to jump into here again and we're
gonna have to add a button just to close
that so to do that I'm going to just add
a button in the nav bar here
so just link that up to a closed modal
function that we're going to create in a
minute and I'll just use a close icon
which i think is set the cross or closed
I think let me just try that see if that
works
okay cool so we have the cross there now
as we can click that to trigger the
function which doesn't exist yet so
we're going to do that now we'll create
the closed modal function in here so it
was a closed modal and when we click
this button we want to dismiss that
modal and to do that we're going to have
to import a thing called the view
controller and we're also going to have
to inject that in here and then we can
just call this dot view controller dot
dismiss and that will trigger closing
that modal so we'll just double check
that that works first
okay so I'll click Next to launch the
modal and I'll click cross and it goes
away so that's great we have the modal
working now but we still need to figure
out how to pass data from that modal
back to the original page and to do that
what we can do is use a method called on
did dismiss so you can see I'm
presenting the modal here but if we just
jump into the documentation for the
modal controller you can see that in
this case they're creating the modal
here but before it's being presented
this on dismiss listener is being set up
so what this will do is it'll wait for
that modal to be dismissed and when it
is it'll allow some data to be passed
back so we're going to get set up our
own handling now so we'll do modal got
on did dismiss and then we can just pass
in the data that's being returned and we
can do whatever we want with it in here
so all I'm going to do now is just log
that data out and then if we come into
the second page we can pass that data
back in a similar way to what we did
with the nav controller before so let me
just quickly create another data array
here or object rather and just I want to
say hello and
how are you and to pass that back we
just have to supply it to the dismiss
method so if I add the data here save it
hopefully we can jump into the browser
again and see that data being logged
down on the home page click Next to
launch the modal and when I close this
we can see that that is now being logged
out the data I added to the dismiss
method and that's coming from the home
page now so we've had the second page
pass data back to the home page and log
that out now another way you can share
data around your application is to use a
provider as a singleton object where
basically anywhere in the application
you're going to be able to access this
object and grab some values for or set
some values on it so I'm going to go
through a really quick example of how to
do that so we're going to generate a new
provider now so we're on ionic G
provider and we'll just call this a user
so we'll pretend we have some user data
that we want to share throughout
multiple different pages and just like
we had to do with the page we're going
to have to come in here and set that up
in our module file so I'm going to
import that provider that I just set up
and set it up in the providers array
here so now if I jump into that provider
we've created the user provided here
what I can do is I can create any kinds
of methods I want to miss which I'll be
able to call from any page or I can even
just set some data directly on here that
I could directly access so for the sake
of keeping this really simple I'm just
going to get rid of this stuff that I
don't need and we're just in a really
simple example of setting a value on
here so I'm just going to create a
username string here I will just set it
to Josh for now so if I was to come into
a home page again now I could import
that user provider and inject it into
the constructor here now quickly just
save that to make sure everything is all
good I'll just serve the page okay so
nothing seems to be broken yet so the
paths are all probably correct and so
what I'm going to do is I'll just look
into this launched second page function
here and I will just delete this stuff
for now so what I'm going to do is
access this dot user service dot user
name and I'm just going to log that out
so if we jump back into the browser
again and click on the next button you
can see that Josh is being output to the
console here so that user provider could
be injected into any page anywhere in
the application we could modify the
values in that provider from anywhere in
the application so this shared provider
could use to share data in any page in
any manner basically so it's fine to use
this where it makes sense but I wouldn't
rely on it too much in a case where it
makes more sense to so you pass the data
through the nav controller like we have
in the first example or through using
modal it makes more sense to keep
the dataflow working in that manner
rather than just creating global singled
and objects with things and in some
cases it does make sense like in the
case of a user service where you're
going to access values from that
provider in all different areas of the
application and you need just a single
reference to it so we're going to go
through one final example now of how we
could share data between pages and
that's using events and other events are
a it's a utility provided by ionic which
is a way to create application wide
level events so I intriguer an event
from anywhere in the application and
then I could listen for that event
anywhere else in the application so we
just jump into the documentation here we
should be able to find an entry for
events in and so basically it works is a
publish and subscribe type system here
so it's like an observable you can see
here that they're using events to
publish a user created event which is
passing on some data and then that event
can be subscribed to elsewhere to
retrieve that data and now I'm not sure
if this syntax is actually correct here
I think it's only I supposed to take in
a single event data object I haven't
actually tried to see if this syntax
does work or not but we're just going to
be passing in a single event data object
and grabbing that someone else so the
scenario I'm going to run through here
is we're actually going to bring this
modal back and but we're going to get
rid of this on did dismiss handler we're
just going to display the modal directly
let me get rid of this as well and so
what I want to do basically is launch
this modal and have it so that maybe we
are launching an add recipe page and
from this page we can add as many
recipes as we want so maybe you want to
add five different things before you
even closing that modal so we'll also
get rid of this data here and we'll just
make this closed modal just close it now
also delete that
and so we're going to import that events
and class from ionic so we'll import
that here and again we'll inject it into
our constructor now we're going to
create a another function here called
add recipe and we're going to trigger
that from our page here so we're just
going to add in another button and
that's going to trigger our function so
we'll just say an ADD recipe so when the
user clicks add recipe what it's going
to create small fake data here we'll go
back to the pancakes example again make
it a bit simpler this time
and so what we want to do is then use
the events to publish that event and so
anywhere anywhere else on the
application we'd be able to listen for
that so I'm going to do this dot events
dot publish I'm going to call this event
recipe added and we'll just pass through
that data so whenever we click on that
button now we're going to publish an
application wide event that will have
that data center along with it so that
means we can jump into home page again
here and we can also import that events
class and set it up here and then we
just need to set up a listener for
events that are being published so we're
going to add the ion viewdidload cook
here and then we can just do this dot
events don't subscribe and we're going
to subscribe to the recipe added event
so I'm just double check that is what I
called it yes and then that's going to
pass us back some data that we can do
something with so for now I'll just log
that out we just want to check that it
actually works so now every time that
this event is detected it's going to run
this handle ahead and log out that data
so we'll save that and check that it
works ok so I'll launch the modal first
and I click on add recipe and you can
see home has logged out that data we
were publishing so if I can just keep
clicking this so it's going to happen
again and again and again you can do
that as many times as I want and I can
close it and go back to my home page so
the methods I've gone through in this
tutorial are probably just about all you
will need to do in terms of sharing data
between pages as a general rule try to
stick to the first two methods that I
mentioned where you can if you can just
pass it through the nav controller by
using nav params do that if you can use
a modal to pass data back to a previous
page if that makes sense in your
application use that
but where it's required the using events
and using a single term provider' can
also make sense in an application okay
so I hope you learned a bit about how to
pass data between pages in ionic 2 in
this tutorial and I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
