how you can go about a debugging and iOS
application built with ionic and whilst
it's actually running on a real device
as opposed to just testing it through
the browser so I have my iPhone hooked
up to my computer now by a USB cable and
I've just got this app called reflector
that's displaying what I'm seeing on my
phone on the screen here as well so that
you can see what I'm doing there so one
of the good things about ionic is that
we can do a lot of the development in
the browser it's web-based and so it's
fine for us to test and debug a lot of
our code just straighten the browser we
don't have to worry about deployment to
a device or testing it on there but in
the end if you are developing an iOS
application with Cordova you will want
to test it at some point on a device and
it's probably you know vestige
throughout the process as well
theoretically the code should run the
same on the phone as it does through a
browser but there can be some
differences and you're also not going to
be able to test things like Cordova
plugins if you're running through the
browser so what I'm going to do first is
I have this application here that I
built in a tutorial last week I think
where I created this kind of fake splash
screen and so if an animated splash
screen you can't usually do a splash
screen that's animated because it just
has to be a PNG file so I created this
little method where we have a safe
splash screen that pops up to make it
look like this splash screen is animated
so I'm just going to launch it now and
you'll see what that looks like as I
wanted so that's the real splash screen
there that just blank white screen then
a fake splash screen with this SVG
animation runs now so this isn't
something that I can really test
properly on or through the just a normal
browser on my computer because I'm
relying on using that splash screen and
using
some Cordova plugins to interact with
that so it's like that I'll need to test
on the device and so in this case
everything is working fine but if I were
to run into some issues maybe the splash
screen never displayed or it was just
crashing or something like that it would
be hard to figure out where to go from
there because in the browser we can just
inspect elements we can see the console
logs but it's not so obvious how to go
about doing that on a real device but
it's actually quite easy all you have to
do is connect your your phone via a USB
cable to your computer you need a Mac if
you using if you're trying to debug an
iOS application on an iPhone you will
need a Mac for this to work and it's
also similar a similar method available
for testing Android our debugging
Android applications by using the Chrome
web browser but I'll probably do that in
a separate video maybe add all we need
to do is come into Safari just open up
Safari on your computer go to the
develop menu and this might not be there
by default so you might have to Google
how to make that available and then
you'll be able to find your iPhone or
whatever device are using there and then
just click on this ionic link or you'll
have the title of whatever your pages so
click that and it's going to open up
this debug console which looks appear
much exactly like the one that you the
normal one you get through the browser
so far both of these unknown just resize
that a little bit so if I go through
here now I can select various elements
and you can see as I sort of hover over
iron up you can see that highlighting on
the device and remember that phone
that's on the screen to the letter
that's my actual device actual phone
that's running the application right now
so I can even go in right now just
change stuff in here and that's going to
immediately take effect so I've found it
to debug some stuff in the Dom here I
could easily play around some stuff
delete some things that can be used for
some weird styling things going on and
you want to just try out a few different
things we also have a we did have a
network tap until I closed it down
let me get like
we have the network type here if I were
to refresh the application now you can
see a bunch of network requests going on
there and this is an important point
sometimes errors will happen at startup
so this happens a lot where so maybe you
get like just a white blank white screen
but you open up this debugging console
here and there's nothing there there's
no indication if anything that's gone
wrong but what happens is since we need
to open this inspector after the app has
already started some console errors
could have happened but we didn't get to
see them so what you can do is click
this little refresh button up here in
the top left and that's going to reload
your application with this debugger open
and you can see as I refresh that then
we hit this debugging thing you have the
breakpoint set on this code so we can
also debug our applications using the
debugger like we would in the browser as
well so to do that all you have to do is
just come into to the resources page
here and you'll see we have the
index.html file there and we have a
script on the style sheets folder so if
you onto the scripts you'll be able to
see your main dot J's file which is the
the bundled code for your application
you can actually expand that and you can
see your source code as well so you come
into the source folder you can see the
individual pages of your application and
say if I went into the splash screen
folder there click on that and I can see
the code that I've actually written and
then I can set up that breakpoint on the
splash screen call there I could set up
a breakpoint anywhere I want and then
when that code runs it's going to pause
the application and we can try and
figure out what's going on so I don't
want to actually get into how to use the
debugger and stuff like that in this
video I just want to mainly show you
this so if you are familiar with
debugging to a normal browser this is
basically exactly the same thing if
you're not familiar with debugging with
breakpoints and stuff like that you
probably won't really understand what's
going on here but as
this is just a way to kind of stop the
execution of your after certain point
and then we can sort of see what's
happening at that point in time we can
also use break points to maybe you want
to see if this this section of the code
ever even executes so maybe maybe in the
application our splash screen with some
fake splash screens he was never getting
hidden and I think we'll that's weird
because well this cool should be
dismissing the splash screen why isn't
that happening
maybe I set a breakpoint there refresh
the application and see if that ever
gets hit and so in a second here that
triggers out for four seconds and you
see that triggers so that's fine and
obviously this is working but again I'll
probably make a video may be going
through a more in-depth example of using
this and you also have your timeline tab
here let me just get rid of that break
point so in the timeline tab we can see
we'll leave a network request and stuff
coming in and you see a breakdown of the
timing of how your applications loading
and you can even sort of highlight
specific sections in here I could look
at the JavaScript events going on and
it's now within this time frame here and
I can see we have a micro tart there
with a promise that's being executed so
there's not a lot going on in this
application to really do anything
interesting here but you can kind of
sort of organized stuff by the amount of
time they take to execute and that can
help you find have some errors in your
application where you could do with some
improvements especially if you see
something in here that's taking up a
huge chunk of time okay so in this
videos really wanted to show you quickly
how to launch this debugger and how you
can test a test and debug an application
while it's running on a real device as
opposed to through the browser there's a
lot you can do with the debugger
obviously and there's a lot of stuff
here I haven't covered so we'll probably
do maybe even a few video from stuff
like this in the future if there is
anything you'd like to see specifically
leave a comment and
I'll see if I can come up with some kind
of tutorial for it okay so I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
