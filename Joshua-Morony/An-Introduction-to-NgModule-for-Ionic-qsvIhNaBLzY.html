the ng module in ionic 2 applications
it's the bit of code in the module TS
file and if you've seen any of my
tutorials before I always hear me say
all right that when we create some new
component or a directive or something
like that we have to add it to the
module file before we can use it so I
wanted to talk in this video about why
we need to do that what this file even
is and some of the the specific things
that in this file and what they do so
ng module is a it's an angular concept
and essentially it's a way to organize
an application into these cohesive
blocks of functionality and so an ng
module is any class with this ng module
decorator at the top and then you'll see
it has this object with various
properties and how they use in here so
at a glance you can see that it's
specifying the components that we're
using in the application you'll also see
plots and directives that listed in here
and providers down here but there are
some specific things you'll need to know
about how to include certain things and
where to include them and when to
include them and when it comes to ionic
application specifically you always see
that we're using this entry components
array as well as well as other things
like this for root and the I ionic
module so there's a few weird things
here so again the idea is that we're
kind of putting together all the
components and directives that we use
into this module and it's organizing all
the code we need into this block into
this module that we're going to use for
our application so all applications will
have at least one root module and so
that's what this is this is the root ng
module that we're using for the
application and you can have multiple
modules in an application as well so
usually we're just using the one
in basic applications you probably just
have the one module if you're used to
using angular you may be more familiar
with including things like the HTTP
module independently but we don't need
to worry about any of that in an ionic
application you may include library
perhaps at some point I believe the
charts tutorial I did included its own
module I'll link to that tutorial I
can't actually remember if I had its own
module or not but if we want to you can
import other modules into this module
here in the import section and so that's
going to do is make all of the
functionality that that module sets up
available so that will have its own
components and pipes and directives
added to that module and then by
importing it we can use all of those
things and so that's kind of what the
ionic module is doing here we're
importing the ionic module and by doing
that we're automatically adding all of
the ionic components and directives and
things like that into our application so
when we're using ionic obviously we use
things like say a tabs layout or we use
the ionic buttons a list this slides
component there's a whole ton of things
that ionic provides they provide these
custom components and so rather than
having to import every single one of
those in manually we can just import the
ionic module here and that sets it up
onto into our application for us and
that's why we call this full route map
here that just passes our route
component along to the ionic module so
that it can set up all of those
components and directives into our
application for us so of course we can
include these external modules we can
include the ionic module we can include
a charts module or some other
third-party library but you can also
create your own modules if you wanted to
and it's common to create something
called a shared module so you would also
import that just in here as well where
the ionic module is and you could use
that for things
like say if you have a common set of
components that you've created that
you're always using in your applications
you could set up these common components
into a shared module and then just
import that module and that's going to
save you from having to import all of
these things all the time so I've added
some comments to each section of the
energy module here to sort of explain
what each part is doing someone's going
to go through that a little bit now so
at first we have our declarations and
that's going to be a list of all of the
components directives and pipes that the
module is going to provide to the
application so these are things referred
to as declara Buhl's and these are the
only types of things you're going to
include in the declarations array if
you're creating some custom model class
or a provider or anything like that
anything that's not a component
directive or a pipe doesn't go in the
declarations and it's also important
that any component anything any declare
ball is only declared once in one module
so you shouldn't put so I've got the
home page declared here I shouldn't and
then have if I created a shared module
or something else
I shouldn't also declare that in the
other module as well and then we have
the the imports which we've already
discussed
that's for importing other ng modules it
shouldn't be confused with imports like
this you can't import normal classes or
anything else into here it's only for
importing ng modules and we have the
bootstrap property here which just
specifies the component that's going to
be created during the bootstrapping
process which I'm not going to go into
in this tutorial essentially though it
Just's the bootstrapping process is
about creating the component and
injecting it into the Dom so typically
you'll just have you know one root
component that's injected into the Dom
into the web page and that sets up the
application and then we have this weird
thing here which is a bit more
complicated and that's entry components
and the idea behind entry components
also an angular concept but it's like
that ionic relies on quite heavily its
the idea is that here we specify any
components that are going to be
dynamically loaded it allows the
application to make use of this thing
called tree shaking which is a concept
that I'd certainly don't have a deep
understanding of but essentially it's
about creating the the smallest possible
code we can from our application by
removing anything we're not using
anything that's not necessary
so any pages that were using in our
application which dynamically loaded by
ionic were you specify his entry
components so that we can make use of
that tree shaking so in here you'll just
put any pages that you've created in
your ionic application so it's got the
home page here by default but if you go
ahead and create some other pages you
should add them here
you don't just copy everything in the
declarations to the entry components if
I just created some component say my
custom component it's not a page we're
using it's just a custom component we're
providing to the application you don't
need to add that to entry components I
you only need to add pages to entry
components and then finally we have the
providers array here which is quite
simple any providers that you've created
in your application or services you
should add here so you may create you
may be familiar with creating things
like data services or things to
integrate with api's so you just add
those here you've important them at the
top so yeah the data provider may be
you've got a user user provider they
just go here the weird thing here of
course it looks like I need to backup my
computer at some point let's get rid of
that the weird thing here is this
strange little object
we have in here that says provide aera
handle at use class ionic error handler
this is similar to just adding a
provider provider normally like this the
difference is that what we're saying is
we want to provide error handler
but we want to use the ionic error
handler class so we're providing this to
the application but instead of using the
default error handler we're using
ionics own custom error handler which
we're importing up here so this just
adds some extra niceness to the error
reporting you may have seen it when
you're coding an application Ione can
you make some typescript error or
something you'll get a little pop up
over application that describes the
error so that's all that that's doing
there so I think that the concept of ng
modules is a bit confusing at first but
it can be a very powerful thing to use
starting out you're not really going to
have to create your own custom ng
modules or anything like that you have
to worry about separating out parts of
your code into custom modules until you
get to a point where you think that
might be useful to you and you can
understand it a bit better the main
things to remember for ionic
applications you can ignore most of this
to start off with you just need to
remember to add all of your components
directives and plants that you create
into the declarations provided here you
need to remember to add any pages you
create to entry components any providers
you add for the application you should
add as a provider here and also make
sure to import all of these first
otherwise it won't work and that's about
it you don't really need to worry about
what's going on here you don't you worry
about the bootstrapping you just need to
add things to the declarations entry
components and providers arrays okay so
I hope that helped clear up a little bit
about what this app that module dot TS
file does and what it's all about
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and I'll
see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
