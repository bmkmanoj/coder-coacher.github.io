the difference between asynchronous and
synchronous code in ionic and I like a
lot of concepts we've covered this isn't
something that is specific to ionic it's
a general to programming in general
really I guess but it's certainly it's
like we need to be aware of when working
with languages like JavaScript and
especially when we're dealing with
things like communicating with servers
and loading in data that is when this
becomes an issue now recently released
an article about this which I'll link to
but I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk through it a bit as well because I
think the concept can be quite confusing
until it kind of clicks in your head a
little bit as the basic idea is that a
synchronous code is code that executes
sequentially and it happens right away
so when you're doing things like making
function calls maybe you're doing things
like adding numbers together or
displaying sign on the screen those
operations are performed in the order
that you call them the way that they're
set out in your file and everything just
kind of happens one after the other so
you don't really need to worry about the
order in which things are happening
because it's obvious with asynchronous
code it's a little bit different when
you're using asynchronous code you might
have it somewhere in your the flow of
your program it might be the first thing
you do but it's not necessarily executed
and finished straightaway it might not
execute until later this can cause
problems with things sort of happening
out of order you might try to load in
some data right away but if that data is
going to take say 10 seconds to load
just to exaggerate a little bit if the
rest of your program is going to go on
and continue functioning after that and
if you're relying on that data and it's
not available yet it's going to cause
problems and so we've run into issues
like this with ionic one common example
is when using the storage mechanisms a
loading data in from storage
isn't synchronous asynchronous so when
we make a call to load in that data it
doesn't happen right away so what I'm
going to do is just run through a couple
of examples and talk through and the
concept a little bit so have an
application up here already
we're going to use this as an example
what we're going to do is set up the the
storage service because it is an example
of a common example of silently there's
a synchronous it's certainly not the
only thing basically any sort of HTTP
requests you're making will be
asynchronous anything that returns a
compromise or an observable is going to
be asynchronous so in order to use these
storage service we need to set it up in
the module file here and you can find
out how to do that in the documentation
here it's listed how you need to set
this up so you just need to import this
annex storage module add that to your
output module ts file and then make sure
you also add it to the import section so
now we should be able to import that
anywhere on an application and make use
of that storage service if you aren't
familiar with the storage service
basically it's just a little API the
ioniq provides that allows us to easily
set and retrieve simple key value data
pairs in a local storage or even a
native storage of that available but
that's not really the focus of this
video I just want to mainly focus on the
fact that it's asynchronous and loading
in that data like you see here with
storage get that is an asynchronous
operation which returns a promise so I'm
going to make use of that in the home
page here that's what we're going to do
is again import the storage the storage
service but we're not going to be
importing the module this time we just
want to import storage we will add that
to our imports and also going to have to
inject that so that we can use it
throughout this class so to start off
with I'm just going to make sure we have
some value set in storage that we can
grab and work with so I'm just going to
call this stuff storage dot set and
we'll just set a
we'll just set a key of test and we'll
give that a value of would you say hello
it doesn't really matter what the data
says so we'll save that and if I do some
let the application load now that's
going to set that in storage for us and
then we don't really have to worry about
it anymore so that should be set now so
really active I'll just comment this out
for now X we don't need to keep setting
that again and again so what I want to
do first is highlight the fact the
asynchronous code is going to execute
out of order compared to the synchronous
code so if I just do some stuffing here
that sailed aside a console that logs
daemon and we'll just say a start of ion
viewdidload now after we do that we're
going to try and access a value that's
in storage now after we do that we're
going to try and access a value that's
in storage so we can use the get method
so we can do this stop storage don't get
and we called the key test so we're
going to get the value for that and
since this returns a promise
we can't just assign the data directly
we can't say let's data equals this
storage get test because that's
returning a promise so that's not going
to give us anything useful now we need
to handle that promise me to set up
event handler which will get that data
passed into it and then we can log it
out and so we're not actually going to
log the data itself out but what I'm
going to do is add a statement in here
so we could do concert log data to get
the value for lo here but just to make
this more obvious I want to say if that
data has been retrieved from storage and
then beneath this I'm just going to
write end of I and view did load so if
you're not familiar with asynchronous
code you might look at this and think
what obviously going to happen in the
console is we're going to get this log
down and then we're going to get this
logged out and then we'll get this log
down but that's not what will happen so
I'll save this
and we'll take a look in the browser so
you see the top here we have startup
ions you did load then right away we
skip right to end of iron viewdidload
and then even all this other stuff
happens here so we get these warnings
which just prop up normally but this is
delay and then we get data has been
retrieved from storage so you can see
that even though the order of operations
here as we do this then this then this
this doesn't actually happen until later
on so the problem there is that if we're
relying on something being retrieved
from storage we can run in different
issues so this is a really common thing
that I guess people email me about and
they get sort of stuck on is that let's
say they're trying to load in let's just
say username from storage so they might
do something like this maybe they set up
a a member variable called username
making your stream and we'll just we'll
try and load this test value as the
username and so what they might try and
do here is initially people will often
try this as though they this got a
username in consistent storage get test
but as I mentioned that we can't do that
because that returns a promise that's
not what we wanted to we need to handle
that promise with this then handler so
once you pass that hurdle you might
change the code to something like this
so inside of the handle is so that we
can actually make use of that data
people might try this dot user name
equals now we'll just set it to the data
that's returned there so that will be
hello in so we're setting this doc
username to be hello and then later on
let's say we have another function here
called display username and inside of
this it just logs out whatever the value
for this type username is and so then we
might have at the bottom of the our
viewdidload function here we might call
it stop display user name and so the
idea is that
we first load in the data and we
certainly start username to whatever the
data is that is returned and then we
call this job display username which is
going to log out username for us so if I
try to run that now you can see the via
cat the start of iron viewdidload and we
get the end divine uses load as before
and we also have that data has been
retrieved from storage happening at the
end again still a but then we have this
undefined being logged out on line 32
which is in the display username
function so this username is currently
undefined but we want it to be hello
and for looking at this it's not
immediately obvious what's happening it
seems like we're loading it in and when
we're trying to display the username of
that should be set and we should be able
to display but the problem is that this
code as we can see from this console
that log message here it doesn't run
until right at the very end so
everything else happens before this
happens so all the synchronous code runs
before we get to this which means that
since we are accessing this
synchronously the synchronous code
wherever this console that log statement
and it's triggered synchronously here
this is going to happen too late and
it's not going to be defined yet if we
were to say have a a button that we
could click now it would trigger this
function you would see that the second
time when we click it it will be defined
because it's had that time to retrieve
that data from storage and then set it
up on this dot username so in order to
get this kind of code to work it's just
important that if you're relying on some
data that's being loaded asynchronously
like this then you need to trigger
whatever way you're going to use that
value you need to make sure that it is
triggered from within that handle if
that is also triggered after the data
has been loaded so instead of trying
this type display username here we would
instead do it inside of the handler
after we set that data so now this
function isn't going to get triggered
until that data is set
so if we save that again now and try
again now you can see that again we have
our starting and happening at the top
there but now we actually get a Hello
value being logged out for this username
rather than getting that undefined value
so basically what's happening now is we
have we have that logging out we have
this call being made that this code
doesn't execute yet we go straight to
this and then eventually we come back
into this block here this code runs
which calls a display username function
and then that's the last thing that
happens and I think the main problem
that a lot of people run into with this
is that even when they kind of
understand this concept they still they
still kind of attempt to use it a
synchronously when it's asynchronous so
I've seen things like people then sort
of creating functions that they'll call
maybe you create a function called link
get from storage and then you have this
code in there and then call that
function from somewhere but in the end
it's still asynchronous and you're still
trying to use it synchronously the only
way to actually make sure you have that
value loaded in properly and be able to
access it is to make sure that you're
only using it after this code has run
now the other thing I will mention here
and I do have an article on this as well
as I'll link to it so you can read about
it in more depth that you can also
create asynchronous functions which
allow you to use it essentially allows
you to write asynchronous code in a more
synchronous manner so if you wanted to
you could create a function like get
from storage and then in this we could
to say return that call to load that
test data so we just return that and I'm
just going to comment out all this stuff
for now it's not really important to the
example and so what we can do so right
now that's going to return a promise and
so if we wanted to make use of that in
here we could do we could do things like
this stop
from storage don't answer that is
returning the promise for us we could
add then handle here and then do
whatever we want with that data inside
of here but you can also use this I
think a a wait syntax so if we declare
this as an asynchronous function and
then we add an a wait before the the
method that's going to return the
promise instead we can just set the
username to be the result of that
directly so we can disturb mr. username
equals this don't get from storage and I
said before that you can't do that
because it returns a promise what it's
returning isn't what we want we wanted
to handle that promise and then use that
the data that it actually resolves with
but in this case if you are using an
asynchronous function you can just
directly assign it like this and then in
your template file here I wanted to
display that if I were just to write
user name like you usually would you'll
see that this won't work that wasn't the
error I was expecting actually but I've
said this has to be a string since we're
using this async syntax we won't be able
to do that because it's not a string so
I'll just get rid of the type and that
should get us past this error so you can
see it's just the interpolation renders
out as object object here as it's like
it's a special object that handles this
asynchronous behavior for us but if you
just add the async pipe to it it's just
going to display the data for you
correctly so now it says hello
so even though this is kind of this
using a synchronous syntax by using the
async function or the async syntax here
with a weight it allows us to still
display that value correctly so if
you're a beginner and still trying to
get your head around the whole
asynchronous first synchronous thing I
probably don't worry about these async
functions I think they kind of as muddy
the waters a little bit
a little bit more confusing but if you
do have you know solid grasp on this and
you prefer this kind of syntax where you
don't have to write handlers and stuff
like that then asynchronous functions
can come in handy okay so I hope this
video cleared up a few things if you
find our whole asynchronous thing
confusing I really do think it's one of
those things that when you do get it you
get it it clicks in your head and it
kind of seems simple after that but that
initial sort of learning curve can be
quite confusing so yeah I hope you enjoy
the video and I'll see you in the next
one
