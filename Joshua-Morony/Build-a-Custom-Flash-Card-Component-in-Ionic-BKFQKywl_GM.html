this little flip card flash card
animation thing here we're going to
build it as a component in ionic 2 so
all you'll have to do is drop this
component in any way you want to use it
and then click on the card and it will
just flip and show whatever information
you want so let's jump right into it and
create our new application ok so we're
going to start this project by running
ionic start then the name of the project
which we're going to cool only to flash
card and we use the blank template and
specify the v2 flag so that we create an
ionic 2 project so we're just going to
let that generate now and as you can see
obviously I already have a blog post for
this particular tutorial which can go
and have a real if you like this is
probably a more basic version of how to
use the component here this is just
building it and getting it set up an
application I'm gonna just talk about it
a little bit in this video and also do a
more I guess realistic example and then
also talk a little bit more about how it
works and point a few things out ok the
app has finished generating now so now
it's going to change into it by running
the CD command and going to ionic to
flash card I think I called it no what
do I
Nanak to flashcard one word okay cool so
now we're gonna jump straight into the
code which I will open up in here okay
we've got the project up now so what
we're going to do first is create our
flashcard component so the idea of the
component is that it's this modularized
bit of code that you can just drop in
where you need to use it and so the
whole ionic to application is built up
of components I explained this a bit in
the blog post if you look in this
index.html file now you'll see here
there is an ion app HTML element now
that doesn't exist in HTML that is an
ionic specific thing so what because I
would have do in this case is create
their own custom HTML element and that's
using angular 2 components so what will
happen here is when this is rendered out
to the browser we're not going to see
ion app you're going to see whatever the
template for that component is and so in
this case that's actually the root
component of our application which you
can find here so this is the typescript
file for it and we just have a really
simple template here which uses ion
nerve and sets up a route page so again
that iron nerve is another custom HTML
element so it's a component and setting
up this route page here and is again
another component it's setting up so if
we look in the typescript file just here
it says root page equals homepage so
we're essentially injecting the home
page into this ion now and if we take a
look at that component which is made up
of these three files we can again go to
the template here and we can see that
this also contains its own custom
element so these are all components as
well Ione header nav bar on title so
this will get injected or displayed
because we've injected it with the ion
nerve
in turn each of these things are going
to have their own templates from
different components that are going to
be loaded up so what we want to do is
create our own custom element like this
our own custom component and we want to
be able to just write in here flashcard
and then that will display a flashcard
for us and we're also going to add a bit
of configuration to this eventually so
that we can specify what we want to be
on the flashcard I will get to that in a
little bit so we're going to create that
component now which we can do with the
command line interface we can run the
ionic generate command so if we run
ionic G component and then the name of
our component so it's called it
flashcard
that'll go ahead and generate the
component for us and you would have seen
it just fly-in on the left over here and
so we have a thing that looks a lot like
the page essentially a page and a
component the same thing hey does a
component the only difference is that
with ionic we have these specific
components we're using to display the
views for our pages the different
screens of our app but in effect they're
the same thing if you look at this type
script file in this one basically the
same before we can actually start
building this component we need to
include it in our app dot module TS file
so if you run away this is what sets up
all the dependencies of our application
so we have my home page in there and
basically any other pages we want we put
in here and apply it any custom
directives components our providers all
need to be imported in here and then
added to the appropriate array in the ng
module decorator so what we need to do
is import that flashcard that we just
created so become a flashcard component
which is that
and then we need to import it from or
it's located so that is in the
components folder and then it's just
under the flashcard and then the
formulas flashcard ts right you don't
need to put the TS on the end there
so that should import that and then we
just need to add it to our declarations
right here I'm gonna save that now and
also serve it just to make sure that we
haven't run into any errors yep and
browser has popped up doesn't the right
there's any errors so we are good to go
so it's gonna get your emulator set up
here so that 205 okay so now we can
focus on building the component so let's
jump right back into the HTML for the
component so right now this is the
default component that is generated you
can see we've just got our binding here
for text so that will render out
whatever text is in the component and if
we look here we see the text is a string
and it's being set to hello world so if
we were to display that component now it
would just say hello world and for the
sake of demonstration let's just do that
so if we come in here we've really got
the flashcard set up so I should be able
to save that and then see what happens
and you see it says hello world if I was
to change that hello world to just hello
oh xw that's better
refresh and now it just says hello so
we're going to replace
the text here with what we actually want
our component to be and for this I'm
going to be using some HTML and CSS
based on this flip animation which was
actually created by David Walsh so if I
confronted demo here so this is just
pure HTML CSS and he's created this CSS
animation that looks like a flash card
flipping so we're going to apply that
CSS to our component in our learning -
and so we can create the same effect
we're gonna make just a few minor
modifications we've got to change the
functionality a bit so it works with
ionic but in effect it's we're just
making this into a component for ionic
so I'm going to start by setting up the
HTML that's required for that flash card
I'm just gonna curve that up now and
I'll talk about it once it's done
okay so I've got the HTML set up now so
this is what's going to be injected
instead of that text now as we've got
some new containers here which are going
to be useful for applying that CSS
animation soon we have a click handle
here which we've added so that's going
to hook up to a function in our
typescript file which is going to toggle
this flip value on and off so we've got
a conditional class set up here and so
it's going to apply the flipped class
whenever this flipped value is true and
when it's false it's not going to apply
that class and that's what's going to
allow us to turn that animation on and
off and make it flip backwards and
forwards as we click now the strange
thing here is this ng-content tag and so
what this does is content projection so
if I were to go into my home dot HTML
file where I'm using this component I
want to specify what content I want on
the front and what I want on the back
and so to do that by using energy
content I can specify that content in
here so if I just create two divs here
and I'll save front and back and so I
want run to go in here and I want back
to go down here and so to do that we use
this select property here and this is a
CSS style selector so we're looking for
a class of flash card front and whatever
is inside of that element we're going to
put in here and whatever is inside of a
class with a certain element with a
class of flash card back it's going to
be put down here so if I come back into
here now and say do you class because
briefing on wood was flash card front
flash trunk and for this one flash card
back and so save that make sure these
are saved too and so let's see what
happens when we look in the browser now
okay so you can see the values we're
putting in front and back so if we were
to inspect them you can see that we have
that CSS for a flash card in here so you
know home bahama file what we did was
put flash card and those two dibs but
what's actually been set up in there is
this flipped container flipper the front
back and inside of those we have that
the text that we wanted to be in there
and so you could put anything you like
inside here but just for the sake of the
tutorial obviously that's front and back
so now obviously what we need to do is
the CSS or the animation acquires and we
don't see both the front and the back at
the same time so to do that we're just
going to drop it in our flash card dot
yes s CSS file for the flash card
component and I'm just going to copy
over David's CSS for that now this is
slightly modified to his version so
if you want to grab this you can either
grab the code for this video tutorial or
you can grab it off the other blog post
and just paste it in here if you want an
explanation on how all this stuff works
I'd recommend checking out at David's
blog because it does a lot a lot better
job than I could ever do and explaining
what's going on here
so I'll save that and now let's see what
happens okay so this is reloaded now and
we have nothing nothing is happened
which is not cool obviously so there's
still a little bit more we need to do
before it works as you can see we have
this flipped value being apply it and
right now that's not doing anything
because we haven't made this quick
function and we had don't even have this
flipped value either so let's jump into
the flash card or TS file and we're
gonna add in those things now
okay so this is what our typescript file
will look like super simple what we have
is a flips variable here which means
that false initially and we have the
flip function which we just toggle that
from between true and false so you know
come components that are way more
complicated than this but this is what
we need to do for this particular
component so now I look the the browser
we can see we have a flip card here now
so hopefully when we click it yeah it
works so we can click it and it flips
from front to back which is super cool
but we're going to do just a little bit
more than what we did in the blog post
and the tutorial for that and display
this data dynamically so what we can do
is jump into our own file here and let's
create an array of data that we're gonna
use to create multiple different flash
cards so if I go in here and let's just
make a variable called flash cards make
sense and then whether it's going to
assign some values did that you don't
need to assign values to stuff in the
constructor here you could just as
easily create an array here and put the
belly is in and I just prefer to do it
in the instructor because I think it
looks Anita they're gonna sit that yeah
and what we want for each flash card is
both the front property and a back
property so to do that we're gonna
create an object with a front and a back
property so I'll say front front and
back so we can create as many of these
objects now that we want this alright
and then it's going we're going to
display each of them as a flashcard so I
was putting some random bellies yeah
save that and then jump into the home
got HTML file and now we just want to
loop over that with an NG for so let's
do energy for equals let card of
flashcards and then we can access those
values in here so we have the front
property and a back property so to
display the front I need to do card dot
front and the back that should be card
dot back save that
and now you can see we've got multiple
cards displayed to you now and I should
be able to click all of those and they
flip and they work with the values that
we specified in the transcript form and
that's about it I mean I have a pretty
cool component we can drop it in
anywhere we want if you wanted to use
this flashcard component in a different
application all you need to do is just
copy that folder out put it in a
components folder a new application make
sure you set it up in the module bar
however apart from that you can just use
it with this format here which is super
fun
sorry I hope you enjoyed the tutorial
and I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
