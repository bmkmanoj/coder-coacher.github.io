through how to build a simple list
reordering in ionic 2 there's a pretty
common requirement in applications and
it is super simple to do in ionic 2 so
is going to be a really quick tutorial
and hopefully something really easy that
you can add to your own applications so
I have generated this application to
start off with it's just a simple link
template we're going to use this to
first create a list and then we'll cover
how to reorder that list so let's jump
into the code now and what we're gonna
do is just make use of the home page and
we're just going to define define some
data in here and then we'll display that
data in a list in the template so I'm
just going to add a variable here I
haven't actually come up with data to
use in the list yet let's just go with
animals so we're just great and I'm
almost remember variable there and then
we'll just assign some data to that in
the constructor here let's go we're dog
cat elephant kangaroo and koala that
should do okay so we save that and then
jump over to the template I'm gonna
delete this and we're just going to add
a list so we use ion list
and then we're just going to loop over
that data with a structural directive in
our eye on item here I've covered this
pretty extensively in a separate
tutorial so if you want to check out
exactly how structural directives like
energy for work I recommend checking
that out I'll link it in the description
so what we want to do is loop over the
animals array we created so we'll do let
animal of animals and then we'll just
render out the animal with an
interpolation here so I save that now we
take a look in the browser we can see we
have dog cat elephant elephant rather
let me just fix that okay so a dog cat
elephant kangaroo and koala and I
certainly can't drag to reorder this
list yet so what we can do to enable
that it's all we have to do is come into
our template and we'll add a reorder
cause true attribute there and so save
that we'll see what happens now okay so
I've got this little hamburger sort of
icon here that we can then use to drag
so if I drag koala to the top now it
doesn't stay there so I can move these
around but nothing is actually changing
as a result of that so what we need to
do is we need to update our data to
reflect the change and so what we can do
is set up an event binding for an event
called
eye on item reorder and then we want to
create a function of our own to reorder
those items so we'll create a reorder
item function and we'll pass in the
event that that I own I own I own item
reorder creates so this is going to send
the new positions of the list to this
event to this function here and it's by
passing in that event so that means
we're going to have to create this
function
in here so create a function called
reorder item and we want to take in that
event which is going to allow us a give
us access to the new indexes for the
items and so by index I just mean their
position in the in the list causing some
errors now but so the dog would be index
0 cat index 1 elephant index 2 and so on
and so what we need to do with those is
change our list reorder our list to
reflect those new indexes that are being
passed into this a reorder item function
now you could do this manually but ioniq
provides a method to do this so we can
just import it this thing called reorder
array and that's just going to handle
doing that automatically for us so all
we need to do is set this dot animals to
reorder array and we'll pass in our
current array and then the indexes that
we got from that I on item reorder event
so if I save that now and we'll jump
back into the browser if I try dragging
koala now up to the top it stays there
so now I can reorder these however I
wish and the changes are going to be
reflected so in its in a real
application we'd also want to make sure
you save this new array to whatever
storage mechanism you're using if that's
required so that when they use it comes
back to the application later all these
are still in the order that they set
them to so I think that's pretty it's
really cool and easy feature to
implement in ionic 2 all the sort of
hard stuff is handled for us and we can
just easily create these lists that can
be reordered so I hope you enjoyed this
this quick tutorial and I'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
