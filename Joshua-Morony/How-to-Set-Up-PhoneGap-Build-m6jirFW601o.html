video tutorial before you get started
with this one I just wanted to
acknowledge some audio problems that a
past video seemed to be having the
videos were playing fine for me when I
listened to them but I got a few
comments saying the audio was very low
and I also checked it on another
computer and yeah you could barely hear
the audio so I've changed a few settings
for this one and I'm also sitting a
little bit closer to the microphone on
my laptop so hopefully it works a little
bit better this time let me know how it
goes for you hopefully at some point in
the future I actually invest in getting
a proper microphone right now I'm just
using my webcams
inbuilt microphone so hopefully it's
alright so in this tutorial I want to
look at how to set up a phone gap build
and in your project so I'm going to
obviously focus specifically on a Sencha
touch project but you could probably use
this advice for different UI frameworks
as well so before I get into the code
side of things first you're gonna come
to the funk out build website so that's
just build fine go calm and you'll have
to create an account here to start using
it so we just click on register and
you'll see the options available you can
just do the free-foam which gives you
one private that you can create as many
and open-source apps as you want but
they have to be pulled from a public
repository so anybody will be able to
see your application and then you have
the option of paying monthly I think I
forget how much it costs that you get 25
applications that you can create that so
just go ahead and sign up for the free
account for now get that all set up and
then you can jump into doing the next so
but before I get into that just quickly
explain what exactly PhoneGap go it is
Frankie abode is the cloud service which
essentially makes implementing PhoneGap
a lot easier
rather than having to maintain it on
your own computer
the PhoneGap build servers take care of
all the compilation for you you can
essentially combine PhoneGap with most
UI frameworks and what it does
essentially is gives you access to a
more native functionality of a device
that typically a web application
wouldn't be able to access but even if
you are not utilizing the extra
functionality that PhoneGap offers you
don't have to have in any stuff at all
your project but sort of at the bare
minimum it allows you to install your
web app onto a device so it wraps it up
in a native package and then you can
install that on an iOS device or an
android device you can distribute it
through app stores like you would any
other natively built application you can
also achieve the same thing for using
the Sencha touch native package but I
tend to find phone games a lot easier to
use and it's a bit more feature-rich and
quick to update and then Sencha touch is
then I'm gonna look at how to go about
getting this set up in your application
so once you've all signed up you can
jump into your Center touch application
or whatever application you want to use
phone get wheels first I'm going to open
up the index dot HTML file the
application I'm using here by the way is
just the sliding menu application I
created in the last video tutorial a
whole link to that as well if you want
to check it out after this but to get
the phone get installed first we're
going to have to reference it inside of
our index.html file so there's going to
include this script here so basically I
need to reference the finger is file and
I think this confuses a lot of people
because you don't actually need this in
your project at all a lot of people
think that you need to and it make sense
to think that you would have to have if
I get J's file store
here someone but their services handle
handled on the phone kept the old
service Orion it was reference it and
you don't need to worry about actually
including that follow and your project
as well as that you also have to add a
config.xml file so I'm just going to
pull up an example one to get us started
I just create a blank blank file you
know save that as config dot XML in the
root folder of our project for now XML
okay so I'm just going to pull in the
default config dot XML that is in the
documentation provided by PhoneGap okay
so I've just pulled this in from the
documentation and basically what this
config file does is a telephone got
built what we want to do when we're
building the application so this is the
most basic config file you could have
you can see in here we've got the author
so obviously we'd want to change that to
our name give a description of the
application give it a title you have
stuff like the version code in here
you'll probably want to keep that one
for now and you also want to change this
to something unique as well so usually
uses this reverse domain style so you
might use something like com dot your
name dot your project your app name
there's a lot of different options we
can put in here it's really best to take
a look through the documentation which
are also linked but one thing you're
probably going to want to do is include
some plugins so all of the functionality
provided by PhoneGap needs to be
included as a plugin now even the sort
of core things that it provides so if I
wanted to pull in some device
information I can include this plug-in
here
which is the device plug-in and there's
some other plugins as well we can
include like you know browser for
example which is his org Apache Cordova
don't you know browser and that'll allow
us to open up a browser within our
application try to only include the
things that you actually want to use in
here obviously the besides plugins
there's also other things and options
that we can set such as the target
platform whether we want the icon to be
pre-rendered options around the splash
screen there's tons of different options
we can have for both iOS and Android
platforms and then that's most
importantly where you can specify all of
our icons and splash screens as well I'm
just going to copy and paste in some
coloring from another config file I have
here for the example application in my
sense of touch a book just to show you
what it would look like so you can see
this is referencing all the different
types of splash screens and icons that
are needed for the different platforms
that's probably too big of a topic to
talk about right now and so I'll link to
another blog post I've done where I talk
about this a bit more in depth so I'll
leave the config file there for now so
that's really all we need to do to
include PhoneGap in our project is to
put that line in our index to HTML and
include the config file as well so now
now what I'm going to do is open up the
command prompt and I want to build the
application now now I'm ready to upload
it to find a field so let's change the
directory into projects and on Sencha
and production and this will start
building that minified version of the
application
okay so that's finished building now now
what I want to do is bring that up and
we want to go to where that was just
built so that's gonna be infield
production a sliding menu and what we
want to do is include that config dot
XML file in here after that we just want
to package yourself into a zip file so
everything from the resources to index
to HTML and I would don't need that and
Delta's folder seemed to have a bit of a
problem with my context Angela I think
every time I right click on my computer
it seems to take forever to load which
is really annoying so I want it now say
send that to zip folder and now that we
have that already we want to jump back
into phone again field so now I'm gonna
sign in under my account and just sign
up with that github if I already have an
application in here right now this is
the touch friends application that comes
with my Accenture touch ebook so this is
going to obviously look a little bit
different and when you log into it but
essentially there's not too much it's
gonna be different you have some button
where you can upload a zip file which is
what I do here so just go to update code
choose file and then I'll upload that as
a zip folder that I just created and so
once you submit that it'll go through
building your application and then you
can come to a screen like this and so
right away you probably sees like
similar to this you have your iOS
version and the Android version so the
Android version should work for you
right away that should be fine and you
should have an error for the iOS version
the problem with the iOS version is that
you require a provisioning profile
before you can actually install it on
your application on your device rather
you can create these in Windows as well
and again it's a pretty big topic quite
annoying to do so I'll link to another
article I have on how to go about
building a provisioning profile and a
certificate to get this sorted but once
you have that certificate you can just
out of here refill with the application
and it should load fine like it is for
me yeah the problem with the Android
version here for me is that my keys lock
do you set a password for the keys that
you and so I just have to type in that
password click rebuild and it should be
fine but you can build Android
applications through PhoneGap build
without any certificates what will
happen is it will just create a debug
version for you so basically the title
of the application would be my app -
debug apk and so this will allow you to
install this on your device but it won't
allow you to submit it to the App Store
so it's a nice easy way to be able to
test it but yeah there's a bit of extra
work you need to do before you're ready
to go live with it so I hope you enjoyed
the video tutorial hopefully it was
clear enough I'll probably do some more
in-depth stuff with PhoneGap build in
the future but this is my first video on
the topic so again starting out with the
easy stuff and hopefully the audio
wasn't too much of a problem let me know
if the audio is still too soft and our
continue messing with my settings until
I get it right thanks for watching see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
