video tutorial before you get started
with this one I just wanted to
acknowledge some audio problems that a
past video seemed to be having the
videos were playing fine for me when I
listened to them but a good a few
comments saying the audio was very low
and I also checked it on another
computer and yeah you could barely hear
the audio so I've changed a few settings
for this one and I'm also sitting a
little bit closer to the microphone on
my laptop so hopefully it works a little
bit better this time let me know how it
goes for you hopefully at some point in
the future I actually invest in getting
a proper microphone right now I'm just
using my webcams in bill microphone so
hopefully it's alright so in this
tutorial I want to look at how to setup
a phonegap build and in your project so
I going to obviously focus specifically
on a sencha touch project but you could
probably use this advice for different
UI frameworks as well so before i get
into the code side of things first
you're going to come to the fungi build
website so that's just build da fone go
calm and you'll have to create an
account here to start using it so we
just click on register and you'll see
the options available you can just do
the free fan which gives you one private
that you can create as many and open
source apps as you want but they have to
be pulled from a public repository so
anybody will be able to see your
application and then you have the option
of paying monthly I think I forget how
much it costs that you get 25
applications that you can create with
that so just go ahead and sign up for
the free account for now get that all
set up and then you can jump into and
doing the next so but before I get into
that just quickly explain what exactly
phonegap build is Franco build is the
cloud service which essentially makes
implementing phonegap a lot easier
rather than having to maintain it on
your own computer the phonegap field
service take care of all the compilation
for you you can essentially combine
phonegap with most UI frameworks and
what it does essentially has gives you
access to a more native functionality of
a device that typically a web
application wouldn't be able to access
but even if you are not utilizing the
extra functionality that phonegap offers
you don't have to add in any stuff at
all your project but sort of at the bare
minimum it allows you to install your
web app onto a device so it wraps it up
in a native package and then you can
install that on an iOS device or an
Android device you can distribute it
through app stores like you would any
other natively bill application you can
also achieve the same thing for using
the accenture touch native packager but
i tend to find phone games a lot easier
to use and it's a bit more feature-rich
and quick to update then sencha touch is
then I'm going to look at how to go
about getting this set up in your
application so once you've all signed up
you can jump into your Sencha touch
application or whatever application you
want to use phone get wheels first I'm
going to open up the index dot HTML file
the application i'm using here by the
way is just the sliding menu application
are created in the last video tutorial
whole link to that as well if you want
to check it out after this but to they
get the phone get installed first we're
going to have to reference it inside of
our index 2.html file so there's going
to include this script here so basically
I need to reference the finger j/s file
and I think it's confuses a lot of
people because you don't actually need
this in your project at all a lot of
people think that you need to and it
make sense to think that you would have
to have if i get dot JS files
what in here someone but essentially all
this is handed handled on the phone kept
build servers so all units it was
reference it and you don't need to worry
about actually including that for when
your project as well as that you also
have to add a config xml file so i'm
just going to pull up an example one to
get us started I just create a blank
blank file here save that as a config
dive xml in the root photo of our
project for now xml okay so i'm just
going to pull in the default config xml
that is in the documentation provided by
phonegap okay so I've just pulled this
in from the documentation and basically
what this config file does is a
telephone get build what we want to do
when we're building the application so
this is the most basic config file you
could have you can see here we've got
the author so obviously we'd want to
change that to our name give a
description the application give it a
title you have stuff like the version
code in here you'll probably want to
keep that at one for now and you also
want to change this to something unique
as well so usually uses this reverse
domain style so you might use something
like Conda your name dot your project or
your rap name there's a lot of different
options we can put in here it's really
best to take a look through the
documentation which are also linked but
one thing you're probably going to want
to do is include some plugins so all of
the functionality provided by phonegap I
needs to be included as a plug-in now
even the sort of core things that
provides so if i wanted to pull in some
device information that can include this
plug-in here
I which understand the device plug in
and there's some other plugins as well
we're getting food like in a browser for
example which is this Borg Apache
Cordova dot in a browser and that'll
allow us to open up a browser within our
application try to only include the
things that you actually want to use in
here obviously besides plugins there's
also other things and options that we
can set such as the target platform
whether we want the icon to be
pre-rendered options around the splash
screen there's tons of different options
we can have brought the iOS and Android
platforms and then that's most
importantly we can specify all of our
icons and splash screens as well I'm
just going to copy and paste in some
code from another config from i have
here for the example application in my
sencha touch in your book just to show
you what it will look like this down
here so you can see this is referencing
all the different types of / greens and
icons that are needed for the different
platforms that's really too big of a
topic to talk about right now so I'll
link to another blog post I've done
where I talked about this a bit more in
depth so i'll leave the config file
there for now so that's really all we
need to do to include phonegap in our
project is to put that line in our index
2.html and include the config file as
well so now our what i'm going to do is
open up the command prompt and i want to
build the application now now i'm ready
to upload it to find gamfield so let's
change the directory into projects and
run sencha add fuel production and this
will start building I had that minified
version of the application
okay so that's finished building now now
what I want to do is bring that up and
we want to go to wear that was just feel
so that's going to be in field
production sliding menu and what we want
to do is include that config.xml file in
here after that we just want to package
yourself into a zip file so everything
from the resources to index 2.html and I
would don't need that and deltas folder
seem to have a bit of a problem with my
context Angela I think every time I
right click on my computer it seems to
take forever to load which is really
annoying so I wanted now say send that
to a zip folder and now that we have
that already we want to jump back into a
phone again bill so now I'm going to
sign in under my account just sign up
with a github so I already have an
application in here right now this is
the touch friends application that comes
with my essential touchy book so this is
going to obviously look a little bit
different than when you log into it but
essentially there's not too much it's
going to be different you have some
button where you can upload a zip file
which is what I do here so just go to
update como choose file and then i'll
upload that as a zip folder that i just
created and so once you submit that it
will go through building your
application and then you can come to a
screen like this and so right away you
probably sees like similar to this you
have your iOS version and the android
version so the android version should
work for you right away that should be
fine and you should have an error for
the iOS version
the problem with the iOS version is that
you require a provisioning profile
before you can actually install it on
your application on your device rather
you can create these in windows as well
and again it's a pretty big topic quite
annoying to do so I'll link to another
article i have on how to go about
building a provisioning profile and a
certificate to get this sorted but once
you have that certificate you can just
add it here rebuild the application and
it should load fine like it is for media
the problem with the android version
here for me is that my keys locked you
set a password for the keys that you end
so i just have to type in the password
click rebuild and it should be fine but
you can build android applications
through phonegap build without any
certificates what will happen is it will
just create a debug version for you so
basically the title of the application
would be my app hyphen debug apk and so
this will allow you to install this on
your device but it won't allow you to
submit it to the App Store so it's nice
easy way to be able to test it but yeah
there's a bit of extra working need to
do before you're ready to go live with
him so I hope you enjoyed the video
tutorial hopefully it was clear enough
I'll probably do some more in-depth
stuff with phonegap build in the future
but this is my first video on the topic
so again starting out with easy stuff
and hopefully the audio wasn't too much
of a problem let me know if a is still
too soft and our continued messing with
my settings until I get it right thanks
for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
