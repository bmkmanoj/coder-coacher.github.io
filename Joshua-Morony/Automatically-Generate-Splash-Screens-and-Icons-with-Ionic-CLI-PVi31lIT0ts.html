how to create the splash screens and
icons necessary for iOS and Android are
when submitting to our stores as if
you've never been through this process
before basically we need to create a
whole bunch of different icons of splash
screens for Android and iOS because
there is so many different device types
different size devices we have different
size splash screens they're going to get
different size icons and so we need to
create separate images for each of those
this is the documentation for cord over
here which lists some of this is for the
icons specifically and so you can see
the different sort of sizes that are
required for Android here you can see
there's 6 6 different sizes depending on
the the DPI of the device and we've also
got the iOS ones here and there's a
whole range of different ones and we've
even got retina and non-retina versions
of the same icon so we've got the 76
pixel one here and then 76 at two times
so obviously creating all of these icons
is just a massive pain and it's not
something you want to do you won't have
a good time unfortunately ionic has a
command built into the command line
interface that can create all of these
for you you just have to supply it with
the initial original file and it will go
about resizing to all of these different
sizes for you and so the way that we can
do that is obviously we need to supply
some kind of graphic but we have this
thing called the ionic of ionic
resources it's a command that we can use
so if I just type ionic help resources
into the command line now it's going to
show the documentation for that specific
command and so you can see here it says
automatically creates
we'll just closed math I automatically
create the icon and splash screen
resources and all we have to do is put
our images in the resources directory
and name them splash or icon and so we
can supply a PNG an AI file or a PSD
manager all we need to do is put those
files in that folder and then run my own
entry sources or if you just want to
generate just the icon which is the
splash you can also supply the icon or
splash flags so I'm gonna go through a
really quick example of doing this and
so the files we need to use I've got an
example up here we need to create a
splash screen that is two thousand two
hundred and eight pixels by two thousand
three hundred and eight pixels and a
icon that is 192 by 192 pixels so the
icon is quite obvious it's a square it's
just going to get resized to whatever
size is necessary if the splash screen
is a bit more difficult because you have
a horizontal or landscape versions of
the splash screen you have portrait
versions you have different just
different device sizes with different
proportions and it's it's not a simple
just resizing of the image and so what
you need to do is sort of as a guide set
up here where you kind of have this safe
zone in the middle this is an area
that's not going to get cropped out and
then all this stuff around the edges
this is stuff that is potentially going
to be included but potentially cropped
out so the idea is that you want to do
all the important stuff in here you say
you have your logo or whatever you need
and I guess the less important stuff
shouldn't occupy this space so when
designing it make sure that if is
sections these sections around here were
cropped out that it wouldn't look weird
so if you try to say do a logo here I
will just crank that up to say seven
hundred and five hundred so if I want my
logo to take up the entire screen here
on some devices it's just
going to say why log because the Eminiar
going to get cropped out so instead
going to make sure it fits nicely into
this center portion and if you do have
some stuff going on in the background
make sure that it makes sense for it to
be cropped out of course if you do want
to make use of more space you can do
that if you want it just means that
you're going to have to manually create
and save these for individual platforms
itself rather than relying on this
command which will generate them all
automatically for you so let's say that
is my splash screen I want to go is
obviously it's not that exciting but I
have to save that now as a splash dot
PNG into my resources folder and then I
also need to save this logo which will
just have as a rather than whites Queen
why not actually now I'm going to change
it make it a pink square as I'll need to
save that as logo dot PNG in the
resources folder for my project so I'm
going to do that now and then we'll run
the command okay so what the resources
folder open here now and you can re see
there's a default icon dot PNG and
Splashtop PNG that I only put in the
projects by default so I'm just going to
overwrite the existing Splashtop PNG
with my own and now I'm just going to do
the same for the icon so just change
that to PNG and an overall icon dot PNG
with that so save that and I'm also just
going to bring up the add the folder for
that project now as well okay so I've
got the the folder open here and it's
going to go into the resources folder
and you can see I've got my splash in my
icon and then now we need to go if we
look in the Android file folder right
now you'll see we just have the default
icons there the ionic have just
understood project won't default but
when we run the command we hard to see
own resources there
so if I come into the command line now
I'm all have to do is just run ionic
resources as I hit enter and we'll let
that do its thing you can see that it's
uploading files to the server there now
it's going about creating all of those
different formats that we needed okay so
that's done generating now if we jump
into the iOS folder here take a look in
the splash screen folder we can see all
of our splash screens created for us
here at the different sizes you can see
we've got some some portraits and
landscapes and if we jump into the icon
folder you see the same and we do a
lovely pink logo all the different sizes
we require now if we go into the Android
folder now this won't actually be done
we still just have the default images in
there that's because we haven't added
the and the android platform to this
project yet so if I want to do that I'll
just do ionic platform add Android will
let that add and now if we were to run
the ionic resources command again I'm
not actually going to run just adding
resources let's um let's say we only
want to create the splash screen so I'll
run I don't agree sources and give the
splash flag so let that run so you can
see just they're only uploading the
splash okay so now if we go into the
splash screen folder we can see that all
of the splash screens from Android to
there now but if we were to go to the
icon folder we don't see anything
because we gave the splash flag instead
of creating words of splash and the icon
and the last thing I want to show you
here is the config dot XML file so if
you open up and you can pick that XML
file for your project this is the file
that kind of configures the Cordova
build if you looked in here before we
ran the ionic resources command you
wouldn't have seen all of this notice we
have these splash source entries and
icon source entries so this also handles
setting up all of the
images in the config files so if you
just add the images without adding them
to the config file they're not going to
be used for the splash screen for the
icon so you need to have these entries
in here but obviously talking all this
out is a lot of work as well so with the
resources command we don't need to worry
about that either okay so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
