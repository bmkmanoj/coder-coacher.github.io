quickly show you how to create a more
Pinterest style layout in ionic I don't
actually even have a Pinterest account
so I'm not going to bother logging in
here but you can see in the background
sort of view of what Pinterest looks
like and you kind of have these cards
with images on them and they're all kind
of sitting one underneath the other so
we kind of have these rows of images but
they're not you know really conforming
to be a strict kind of table they kind
of flow to fill in the space that's
available now the default behavior for
the grid and with iron row and I on coal
in ionic kind of does this but I have
got an example up here where if you if
you have a whole bunch of things a bunch
of columns in your row they will
automatically flow on to the next row as
it reaches the end of the screen but if
you have inconsistent image sizes or
card sizes or whatever you're using they
don't kind of flow to fill in all the
available space there's kind of these
rigid rows and so it's just going to be
as tall as the largest image in that row
essentially so what we want to be able
to do is have this 200 by 200 image here
we want that to sit up right next to the
175 and this 175 image here should stay
where it is and this one should move up
and everything should fill in all these
white spaces there's a pretty simple way
to do this just with standard CSS and
dibs and I'm going to show you how to do
that so the default code we have here
this is the ionic way to do that we have
our eye on road and eye on coal we set
the coal for attribute here so we have I
believe the total column size is 12 for
the width of the page so that's going to
give us three we're going to fit three
columns onto the screen
and you can see that here we have the
three images and then we're just
displaying the image now instead of
using that I could instead use just some
manually defined containers here and if
you're wondering I do have in the tack
script file here I've just defined a
bunch of images and that's what we're
looking over for the ng4 so we're doing
a very similar thing here where we're
looking using an NG for looping of all
those images displaying image we've just
got our own death set up here with some
custom classes now if we take a look at
what's going on in the CSS file here
we're just adding styles to that
containing pins div and the individual
pin as well which will be that code will
be duplicated for each image we have and
so we need to do is to find this
property called column count here and
that's going to organize our images into
columns for us now we've set a column
count of three
and I've just added some styles that the
individual pins of they're displaying
properly but the important thing here is
the column count so if I save all this
and jump back into the browser you can
now see that the images are sort of
flowing one underneath the other now
whereas before when we use the ionic
grid things are kind of stuck in those
more rigid rows and so I can easily just
change the column count here I've change
that to column count four and that's
going to now organize our images into
four columns instead of three and so
maybe if I just I'm going to duplicate
these a bit more so we can see the
effect on a larger scale and make sure I
don't miss that comma there let's take
another look now so you can see
everything here is flowing one
underneath the other and these big
chunky 300 tool images aren't really
causing us any problems and so there is
more you can do of course with the the
column count property here but I just
really wanted to quickly show you an
example of how to create that Pinterest
style layout and I guess it does
highlight that why a while there you
know ionic components are certainly
useful in a ton of
cases you can still just do normal web
things and create your own styles and
everything as well so I hope this video
was somewhat interesting and I'll see
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
