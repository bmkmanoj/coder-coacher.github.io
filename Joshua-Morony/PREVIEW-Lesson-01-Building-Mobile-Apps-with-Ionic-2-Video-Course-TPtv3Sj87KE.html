how to get ionic to set up on your
machine and we're going to walk through
creating a new ionic to project and then
we're going to talk through some of the
files and folders that are in an ionic
to project and what exactly they're
doing and to install ionic - I'd
recommend going to this page on the
ionic website just follow the
instructions here to get it set up
but essentially you'll just need to
install node and run the install command
once you've finished doing that and
everything's finished installing you'll
be able to create a new project by using
the ionic start command in your command
line and we're going to do that right
now to create our to-do application okay
so once everything is installed open up
your command prompt or terminal item
whatever you prefer to use and we're
going to run the command to generate our
project now and to do that we write
ionic start and then the name of our
project which we are going to call our
neck - to do and then you can also
specify a starter template to use but
it's going to use the blank template
which is just a standard one-page
nothing a template but there's others
you can use - like a tabs template and a
side menu if you prefer and we also need
to use the v2 flag to specify that we
want to create an ionic 2 project and an
ionic 1 project so hit enter and that
will start generating your project okay
once that's finished generating you
should see a screen with some messages
like this and your project will have
been created now so you can change into
that by using the CD command so write CD
ionic 2 to do and it'll take us into the
project directory from there we can run
ionic serve which will actually display
our application in the browser for us
so once iron xserve finishes running you
should see you app in the browser now
are we going to see that the default
blank template that I was talking about
from here if you go into inspect to
bring up the debugger we can actually
run it through the emulator in the
Chrome browser so if you hit this button
here that will toggle the emulator on
and off and then we can actually see
what it will look like on a device so
right now it's set to a Galaxy s5 which
is an Android device so we're getting
the material design Android styling if
we switch that to an iPhone 5 and hit
refresh you can see that now we've got
the iPhone styling instead I was going
to set it to the galaxy throughout this
tutorial but you can set it to whichever
you prefer now that we can see that
application is generated and working
we're going to open up the project in a
text editor or IDE whatever you prefer
and take a look at the project itself so
I just use sublime but you can use
whatever you prefer and this is what our
our nectar project looks like when it's
first being created there's a lot of
files and folders here and a lot of them
won't really matter to you at least not
in the beginning
we have some folders here that are
specific to Cordova and if you're not
aware Cordova is the framework that
wraps uronic to application in a native
wrapper and that's what allows it to be
installed onto a phone and also to
access native API s but as far as
development goes for a lot of it you
won't really need to worry about any of
that
so the hooks folder platforms plugins
that's all part of Cordova the node
modules folder is all the dependencies
for the project again you'll never have
to touch this folder at all you might
install some more dependencies later on
down the track but that's not something
you need to worry about right now the
main two folders you need to actually
work with here
well rather as one folder you really
need to work with which is the source
and then also the WWE folder which
you're not going to be editing at all
but this is your bulk ionic to
application so essentially the way it
works is that we will be coding inside
of the source folder and we're going to
be using a typescript rather than
JavaScript for the coding because we're
using typescript which is very similar
to JavaScript it just adds a few extra
features to it but typescript doesn't
actually run through browsers by default
it needs to be transpired into normal
JavaScript code so that's why we have
this separate WW folder where basically
when we build our application the
transpiler will go through all this
typescript code put it together and then
it spits out the output here and that's
what actually runs through the browser
so you can see there's an index to HTML
file here so just like any web site you
have the index file which will be run
through the browser and that's what will
load in all the scripts and styling and
so on to actually run the website or in
this case the app but I want to
reiterate again that you shouldn't edit
anything inside this www folder when
your app is built it will be overwritten
so if you make changes in here
next time you do a build they're all
going to disappear instead all of the
changes should happen within this source
folder and you'll see that we have an
index.html in here as well so if you do
want to make a change to index dot HTML
which probably won't ever be required
but make sure you do it inside the
source folder and not the index dot HTML
file inside the wwm similarly we also
have an assets folder which is used to
store things like images or any other
kind of static assets maybe JSON files
things like that and again to make sure
you put them in the source folder and
not the assets folder that's inside of
ww
so let's just go through a few more of
the things inside of the source folder
here we have the apt module ts file
which is quite important basically this
is responsible for importing all of the
dependencies for the application
basically if you create any pages so
right now we just have a home page but
soon we will be adding in a edit to do
page as well you have to make sure that
those pages are imported here and also
that you add them to the declarations
array and to the entry components array
you may also want to import other things
like providers we will be creating a
data provider for example which will
handle saving data from our application
into storage and then also retrieving
that data from storage so in that case
we would again import that file here and
then add it to the providers around so
essentially pages go here and here and
providers go here then we have the app
component ES file and this sets up the
route component of the application so an
ionic 2 project or angular 2 projects
are heavily based on components so
essentially component is a chunk of code
that handles some tasks so in our case
we will be creating a lot of pages which
are components so they're going to be
different screens on our application but
they don't have to be pages they can be
anything so the route component is
basically the first component that is
loaded in the application and in the
case of an ionic 2 project it's
responsible for setting up the root page
so here you can see that we're importing
the home page and then we're setting it
as the root page here so what this will
do is take that home page which has been
auto-generated for us and make that the
initial page that's displayed in the
application if we wanted to instead say
create a login page for our application
instead of displaying that home page we
would import that login page here and
then set the root page to login page
instead
usually you won't really do much inside
this file you may sometimes but most of
the time it's just going to be setting
up that initial root page now we have an
app dot s CSS file here that's for
creating and any CSS Styles that you
want to apply to your entire application
and we have a main dot dev D s and a
main dot product ES file these are two
files you don't really need to worry
about at all
it's just responsible for bootstrapping
the application in production mode it'll
use the production file in dev mode uses
dev but you don't and really need to
edit these at all we have the pages
folder which stores all the pages in our
application we'll have a separate folder
for every page that we create so right
now we just have the one home page but
you'll notice we have three files for
the home page so a component is
generally made up of a type script file
which defines the class definition it's
going to import any things we need we're
going to talk more about this a bit
later but essentially this is the logic
for the component we have the template
file now which is essentially the HTML
that's going to create the view for the
component and then we have a scss file
which again can be used to apply some
styles to that component so when we
create more pages and we will in this
example we're going to create an edit to
do page that's going to show up in its
own folder here then we have the theme
folder which simply holds this variable
store a CSS file you can use this to
change some values in the application
you may want to come in here and change
the background color for example or any
of these colors we can use these primary
secondary danger and so on colors
throughout the application and it's
really nice and neat way to tidy up the
code a bit rather than having to
manually apply styles for these values
each time if this all looks a bit
foreign to you might be worth just
looking at what
asses just very quickly but essentially
it allows us to do things in CSS like
create our variables which otherwise you
can't do with CSS so there are probably
a few more files which you may end up
using that I haven't discussed just yet
but those are the main things you will
need to know right away and if you can
sort of grasp what I've just talked
about there you should be pretty
comfortable with moving forward creating
your own pages and starting to edit
things just to get us started we're just
going to make a quick change to the home
dot HTML file as you can see in the
browser here apparently says ionic blank
the world is your oyster and so on so we
can make a change here so we'll change
that to to do instead because that's
going to be the title with our
application and if we save that ionic
actually has library loading so you can
see some stuff happen there so if we go
back into the browser its refresh right
away so as you're coding you can make
some changes in here so that switch back
to the browser and you can see your
changes apply right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
