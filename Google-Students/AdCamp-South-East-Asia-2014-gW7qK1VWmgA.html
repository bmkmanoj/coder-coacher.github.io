opportunities interact with who was any
dates
on day three we give the students a
digital advertising case studies where
the students get to put to use
everything they've learned over the last
two days while presenting the solution
to the case tell Google and Ken has been
really amazing so far we have not so
much about Google products and how
businesses can effectively live it under
and I think most importantly is that I'm
really lucky to have this opportunity to
rub shoulders with so many brilliant
University students from across
Southeast Asia
who also share the same passion about
digital marketing Google is a really
magical company and Google ad camp is
such a great way for us to experience
that magic it's a really nice place to
be inspired by a lot of people the
speakers and even my fellow delegates as
we bond with each other and learn a lot
of things at the same time my favorite
part about the Google Ad Council fly is
really just the culture the culture is
exceptionally unique and I can feel it
within the first hour Stephan engine so
yeah the culture a great trip around
Singapore was one of my best experiences
so far got to see the local culture
high-rise buildings and tried some of
the incredible food I just want to thank
Google for the create opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
