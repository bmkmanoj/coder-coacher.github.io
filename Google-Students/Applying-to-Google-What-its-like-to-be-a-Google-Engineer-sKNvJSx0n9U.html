you'll notice that there is an RSV key
linked both in the description of the
video and on the slide that you're
looking at right now if you have not
already RSVP'd make sure that you do so
just go to that short link and fill out
that information we'd love to hopefully
get in touch with you after this so make
sure that you prioritize that
all right and welcome everybody to are
applying to Google series today my name
is Jesse I'm about to be off camera and
not standing awkwardly in the corner
this whole time I will be moderating the
event today I am joined by four of our
lovely engineers do you guys want to
share your name is here start down here
I'm John psyche man Matt great and so we
will go into your questions we can see
that the chat has been really active
which is what we love but before we dive
into that let me just show you the
agenda really quickly what we're gonna
go over today so we are gonna go ahead
and do a warm-up video right after this
so this is YouTube we do have some
videos it's only three minutes and
you'll see kind of what we're getting
into today then we'll do some proper
introductions go into what the culture
is like at Google and we'll talk about
the opportunities that are available for
our graduating students who are looking
for full-time if you're interested in
hearing about what our internship
opportunities are so thank you jumping
on the screen here we do have some talks
on that in about two weeks so on the
RSVP form indicate that you want to hear
about those and we'll make sure that you
get the links to those ones all right so
just so you know who I am because I
won't be on camera today here's a quick
little introduction of me again my name
is Jesse I've been at Google for about
four years now I made sure to select
this picture so that you're all
confident in my moderating skills I've
done this once before I went to school
at UCLA I'm currently on the university
programs team here at Google favorite
thing about Google is definitely the
number of teams that I get to interact
with on a day-to-day basis but also you
can bring your dog to work so if you're
not a dog person that might be a
downside but you can work it out we have
dog free zones but I am a huge dog
person that was probably the biggest Pro
to working at Google and my fun fact is
that I am currently learning piano
hopefully by the end of the series I can
do a song or two not right now and
before we get to our panelists here who
will actually be answering the questions
today
we're going to go ahead and show you a
video of what it's like to work here at
Google and then
here from the actual experts so let's
roll it so let's go into the office
that's that this is our garage
nobody's in here I mean we were all a
bunch of kids we were you know we were
all somewhat idealistic in our own way I
did not inhale we wanted to do things
that made a difference in the world and
that you know that mattered right that
were interesting and hard we didn't
start out as a conventional company and
we never followed a normal path we want
to organize rules on the one hand it was
a perfect description of what we were
trying to accomplish in search and yet
it was also so broad as to leave the
door open for all of the many many
directions we wanted to go in the future
we set out to do something really useful
for people and all other things began to
follow all right here we are I don't
think any of us possibly could have seen
where this story was gonna go
it may sound notes but it's often easier
to make progress on mega ambitious goals
than on less risky projects a few people
are crazy enough to try and those are
usually the ones you want to work with
what if distance wasn't a barrier to
exploding our world
can we bring the internet to the five
billion people who don't have it today
you watch it yourself Matt you couldn't
wait for me know yet not wait what if
everyone in the world could speak every
language what if everyone could make a
living doing what they love almost
everything we do is an experiment in
some way shape or form everything has
some aspect of the unknown you're
probably gonna fail a few times before
you succeed we always tend to ask the
question how can we make it better so
there's always the sense of optimism and
curiosity that you can make a difference
if our ambition is to create products
that have planetary impact it's not good
enough to just solve it for some people
you have to solve it for absolutely
everyone the unifying theme if there is
is seeing something doesn't work that
well trying to use technology to make it
better
wow I solid that is fantastic
we want to get deeper into the problems
that really matter to people and to the
world
just because we've been successful in
the past doesn't mean or preordained to
succeed in the future that's why we need
to keep on asking the big questions and
work really hard to find the best
answers
so let's going all right so now
hopefully after you are all feeling
super inspired or as Jackson in the chat
put it it's hitting you right in the
fields we kind of go ahead and move on
to introducing some of our real live
engineers this is not pre-recorded this
is happening live so ask any questions
that you feel and I will try and get to
as many as we can but let's go ahead and
do our official introductions here so
Ian foo we'll start with you on the end
hi I'm from a small town called Cuddy
Nebraska and I went to school at MIT now
I work on my favorite thing at Google is
definitely the people that I work with
they're really nice and really
supportive and there are definitely days
where I make a ton of mistakes and don't
wanna come to work but they've been very
nice to me so awesome
and then we will just go right down the
line hi I'm Matt I went to RPI I
currently work on project wing which is
the Google drums my favorite thing about
Google is definitely the people I work
with and the types of work we get to do
and fun fact about me I did my first
Ironman about three weeks ago
hey guys my name is Sekulow I went to
school in Colorado
I've got other qualities in Colorado
Springs I'm under social social to keep
our team we spring are from dr. Poole
blasting my favorite thing about gobo
respecter of like people I work with
we've been very smart people who are
always meant to have and anytime the
fine facts is that I never actually
thought I'd all be able to get into
Google so that was like a miracle to me
and John before you happen we're getting
some comments in chat that the volume is
just a little low so I know it seems
like we're close to the camera but let's
just yell out it it's fine it'll be a
nice yelling environment here so you're
on John I am John I'm good at being loud
so I'm in consumer
hardware and that's kind of a large
broad topic but I'm an embedded software
engineer my school that I graduated from
is the University of Saskatchewan so in
Canada in the middle and then my
favorite thing at Google is I think that
we're on that slide all the free food I
have a lot of favorite things at Google
but you know that's a pretty good one
and my fun fact is I hiked up mountains
and then I run off them so I fly off
mountains nice so we we're getting a lot
of compliments on the volume no not a
ton of questions rolling in so I'm gonna
throw a softball wouldn't you want to
get started um for those of you in chat
this is the time if you've got questions
for the panel go ahead and type them in
there cat will try and get to a bunch
and I'll pull some out to ask the
panelists but the first softball one and
you will start with you at the end and
just run down the line again if you
could just tell me what a typical day
looks like working at Google or your
your typical day okay
I'm not sure my typical day starts
because I'm a night owl so I come in and
I do like a first meeting in the morning
and then I go eat lunch and then I do
most of my work in the afternoon and
Google also has free dinner so I stayed
here for dinner and then I go home at
about 6:00 or 7:00 and sometimes the
issues come up oh I got some but most of
the time most stuff is taken from about
work I'll just go down the one yeah so
I'm a bit more of a morning person I
usually wake up and get in around seven
ish and then we have swimming in the
morning which is actually kind of fun
then we go to breakfast afterwards what
we'll also do is there's then I'll
usually have a couple meetings first
thing in the morning they have stand-ups
then just work through til lunch I
usually stay for dinner and then
stand-ups stand-ups are basically like
little 15-minute status meetings among
your team to make sure that nobody stuck
who's who's blocked on this this way
everything keeps moving forward
then I'll usually stay till a little
after dinner because I'm traffic's a bit
better in the middle and then I'll work
from home a little bit because my day
actually that pretty much looks like the
same as Matthew's so I know my deed but
like I in the morning I prefer working
from home so I just wake up like say
like around 7:00 a.m. and then we went
from my bed and most of my surprising
decade above what done that working from
home and then like at about like
lunchtime I just go to work and then I
have lunch at work and then do some
coding I talk to other engineers most of
the work that we do we take we have to
put up with like a lot of other teams
that talk to people that do something
like centerfolds
Center back off all of you you other
people's work and maybe once a week we
have like a stand up where we just talk
about that our progress and then like I
normally wait for for dinner back which
is of all X 6 6 p.m. and then like just
for home sometimes like I try to portray
to you before coding going back home or
just like doing that when I go okay cool
um I'm more of a night person also
so I although the reason why I've been
getting to work a little earlier
traffic's a little bit better and
there's a sweet spot to get to the
campus um so I'll usually get into the
office you know go through email I get a
lot of email through the evening
working in hardware we often work with
people who aren't local so we get email
from different time zones scrub through
that and then usually I have a couple of
meetings where we're in a different
phase of development right now so a lot
of my meetings are more
linking up with other people and just
chatting about what's going on and
figuring that out work through the day
and then I usually grab dinner and head
over to the gym and then head home and
then maybe send out a couple emails from
home so that's kind of my regular day
awesome thanks everyone
so that definitely got
kickstarted we've got a lot of questions
rolling in here so I did want to start
off these kind of rolled in before we
actually went live and not necessarily a
question but I'm gonna kick this over to
you in foo because I heard a story about
maybe how to how many times you applied
so shreya and Candice both had the same
comment I'm too scared to even apply and
Joshua said I've applied to over 50 jobs
and haven't received any interviews so
far so what what do you have to say to
that keep trying guys please please
please don't give up because if you give
up you are definitely never going to get
in I personally applied for Google
internships three times before I finally
got it and I don't know if you guys saw
on my slide but when I was in high
school I actually thought engineering
was for people who wanted to work on
engines cool
um and Ryan sorry this was from
yesterday
I apologize John I want to direct this
one at you people are asking a little
bit about what it's like working in
consumer hardware and what that means so
please give us as much as you can yeah
so my job is I'm an embedded software
developer so what that means is I'm
working on software that goes on devices
that you might use that's cellphones or
anything else watches are popular the
team I work on is a follow-on from glass
so it's a lot of the people that worked
on Google glass if you're familiar with
that project so we use consumer hardware
to talk about any of those devices that
we might want to sell to a consumer or
that a company might want to sell to
consumers and that's that's the area I
work in and then my primary job is
making that work so there's a lot of
technical parts of actually taking
components putting them on boards and
then making something that works and so
my job is a lot of making things work
that's a good way to put it um okay I'm
gonna toss this up to the group whoever
wants to take this one Jackson asked how
is success in an engineering role
defined and/or measured and that might
be different across the board here but
does anyone want to take that yeah so
this is actually an awkward time so
we're all actually rather versed in this
there are the three main criteria Google
uses to evaluate this impact is the
first one so how much did it help Google
how much like how much did your overall
project help Google how much did you
contribute to that project and how
successful was it the second thing is
difficulty right so how hard of a
problem was it for you to solve and then
the third level is leadership so and I'm
not talking managing people I'm talking
like how how much did you set the
direction for the components you worked
on
okay so Irina asked a question and we've
got a couple responses of good question
Irina so we're gonna go with this one
how much experience did you all have
before getting a job at Google and I'd
like to kind of hear down the line so
Jen we'll start with you and go down the
line the other way yeah so I came into
Google as my third job in the valley
here in Silicon Valley so I have about
seven years experience in this space
coming into Google so I'm maybe a little
different from a few people I was
brought in for a team to work on on
products and they needed people with
with my expertise so when I got to
Google I was actually there just a loose
end
actually I had zero experience our set
of flex one something experience I got
was from like one campus jobs I was
working for like a department in my
school district expanded like off like
as I hop tasks and doing like I also did
make a website development well that's
about that as much experience I had so
he was almost like
experience so I came home with seven
years of experience at a previous job
doing a similar work so you can
definitely see that there's an array we
will get into it a little bit later our
new grad opportunities so sick Elia and
Yin food can probably talk a little bit
more to those since they came into your
new got opportunities but both Matt and
John talked about it a lot at campus
presentation so we will we'll jump into
those in a little bit um
Yin route you you mentioned your
internship experience and we had a
question on here Oliver asked did you
all have internships prior to
interviewing for Google so I guess my
case is I was actually an intern right
before I started full-time and so I
didn't actually do the whole full-time
interview so I could go if you're an
intern and at the end of your internship
you would like to convert to full-time
you only have to do two interviews
instead of five so that's what I did so
getting a Google internship is
definitely a good way to go about
getting a full-time job but you don't
necessarily have to have one we get
plenty of applicants who are not like
who have not intern that Google before
and even if you have an internship at
all yeah and then outside of being a
Google intern did you hold internships
while you were in school outside of
Google and if so what types of
internships were they I worked at a fuel
cell company in general after I didn't
have any formal internships I worked a
few summers with a local company that
was sort of related in computer science
okay so we will jump into another
question or so this is from I'm so sorry
if I'm messing up her name here but it
looks like she open do
people who end up working for who will
get to choose which department they work
for so let's go to securing for that
what was yours like and maybe if you
have a general response to that also um
so I think it depends on if you have
like clear experience who like sometimes
I passed you back which department you
would like to work in in my case like
since I was like recently just making
mention with like the position that that
they thought I've been mostly suited for
so that's what like ended up like that
listen does anybody else have anything
to expand on that or maybe a different
experience okay so when I did it they
did it kind of matching style whereas I
was coming in my recruiter worked with
me and then so I went through a couple
extra interviews because I didn't be
with several different groups and then
the groups that wanted me sent their
positions to the recruiter and then the
recruiter and I went through them and
chose it's generally a matching it
matching thing where you know your
recruiter will take your interview
results they'll look at what teams have
openings inside of Google the teams will
say oh we want this person and then
shoka he or she will come back to you
and say okay these are the opportunities
we've kind of found for you Oh kind of
quickly common I came into a kind of a
different Avenue so my team was looking
for someone with a specific skillset and
we were recruiting directly for that
that person so I came in and interviewed
with only people who are on the team I
work with now and was hired into that
team so it's a slightly different path
in the matching if you have a specific
area and you find the job posting on on
the website you can end up in in that
track where you're looking at a very
specific job so originally when I was up
laying out a plan for a software
engineering side everyday ability and
then so I did my first interview and
they thought oh you're not a good match
for that position so they ended up like
nationally for each other software
awesome okay let's see here so we've
gotten a couple questions about
degrees so Neil asked what kind of
degrees are you looking for I've heard
rumors that you need to have at least a
master's to work at Google lol and then
the joke one too to ask is a BA in
computer science good enough to work at
Google so if maybe somebody could speak
to the degree level yeah so I was
actually in the middle of getting my
masters and after my internship I
decided you know getting a master's
probably wouldn't get me as far as a
year experience in industry so I quit my
master's program and came to Google
right after my bachelor's and there is
actually some team members on my team
whose bachelor's degrees are not even in
CS they're our physics majors math
majors I think what Google is looking
for is whether you have the technical
skills to succeed regardless of your
major I didn't have a background but the
interviews are very technical and
they'll very quickly figure out if you
have the skills to do the job yeah and
we'll just plug this in a couple weeks
arted session will be going over what
we'll go through a mock technical
interview and you can ask questions
about that too so make sure to RSVP to
that one um ok let's do this one Mohsen
asks can you tell us the differences
that you came across between college
projects and the projects that you do at
Google and how do you handle that
difference and I'll let anybody take
that one so so the big difference is
your college project has to run once for
your professor and you're the only
person that in real life that project
has to last for 20 years and then 14
people are going to change it and you're
gonna get called at 2:00 in the morning
about at one time because some flag
didn't get spelled right so things that
become much more important or making
like nice concise modules that are very
very cleanly documented with really
pretty variable names because those
things are what are going to save you 10
years from now when you go to look at
that code that you haven't touched in 10
years and wondered who the hell wrote
this and then you realize it was you
um great answer this I think this kind
of segues its into Trayvon's question
here asking are you guys constantly
nervous about making mistakes and now
that something's on such a large scale
your success is not like only measured
by whether the things you make work or
not there's going to be times where
you're experimenting and like things
break and the models one of the models
at Google is actually asked for
forgiveness not permission so you sort
of like have free rein to go try things
out and if you find out it doesn't work
or something's broken then you let your
team know and your team figure it out
and you know you don't do it again the
next time most of the time you actually
like me not the only person like looking
at the stuff we have like code reviews
in place to make sure that like we
minimise yeah one thing about that I
mean that my experiences in in the real
world we accept that mistakes happen
um and that's just a thing the the
biggest part about when you make mistake
is just owning that mistake and how you
go forward from there
so if you make a mistake you have to
reach out to people who can help you fix
it and and you have to own that so
Google doesn't waste time assigning
blame if something breaks the only thing
people care about are fixing yeah
there's no witch-hunt
there's no whose fault was this how are
we going to stop this from happening
ever again and simply this broke what
can we do to fix it um great answer I
feel like you guys are very passionate
really nice to hear from everybody it's
okay to break stuff I think it's
probably there but don't try to so we've
been getting a lot of questions about
the languages that you all use when
writing code and then in particular what
languages are good to know when you're
going into an interview so Google has a
few big ones Java and C++ and Python are
pretty much the bigger back-end
languages javascript is pretty much the
front-end we have our own frameworks
around most of that stuff so you don't
necessarily need to like focus on the
little teeny-tiny JavaScript frameworks
to this Java framework because you're
probably never gonna see it when you're
inside of Google because it just doesn't
do what we needed to do as far as your
interviews I would recommend the more
structured languages like the Java's and
the C++ is versus JavaScript because
there's just so many little nuances to
JavaScript that you can get wrong and if
you say I'm a JavaScript expert then the
person that's interviewing might have
written the book you read about
JavaScript
I've seen this happen and I'll ask you
some obscure questions just to say so
don't list expert unless you can say you
wrote a book about this yeah some teams
say just pick a language that you're
more comfortable with like whatever your
favorite one is and that's pretty much
gonna cover it the only the only warning
is if you're gonna use JavaScript make
sure you're very clean about what you
write yeah as a different perspective on
that in myspace where you're working on
small systems C is pretty much our bread
and butter so umm if that was an area
you're targeting going to that would be
the language we would expect you to work
in yeah and from a recruiters point of
view I will just add to that that again
whatever you put on your resume is fair
game but you can work with your
recruiter to let them know what language
you're most comfortable interviewing in
and they'll do their best to match you
with an interviewer an engineer who's
comfortable coding in that language as
well so don't try and tailor yourself to
you know the language that you think is
gonna be best you want to go and do your
interview and the one you're most
confident and um okay let's hear some
questions over here people are getting
now the interview process seems to be a
hot topic and prepping for that so this
is from Heather she asked us a little
bit earlier what is the best piece of
advice you could give us in order to get
a job at Google or even get an interview
at Google so that one's really vague I
might take it as like you know what
could you personally recommend or maybe
like go back and tell yourself at this
point in time so getting an interview is
generally a function of your resume
because that's the only piece of
information we're gonna have at that
point so you want to make sure to
highlight the most important few things
about us you know nice and cleanly at
the top of the resume so here's some
awesome project I did you know don't
don't just list a chronological history
of what you did and the top half of the
page should be
like your three biggest accomplishments
over the last several years the things
you're most proud of and it doesn't have
to be academic you could be president of
a club or you raised a million dollars
for cancer or who knows what whatever
you're excited about make sure it's
front and center on the top of that
resume you know don't you don't
necessarily need to go into your high
school employment because the recruiter
is only gonna have say a minute or so to
actually read your resume and then make
a decision whether they're gonna go
forward with it yeah I get their
attention first and then hold it and
Matt why don't you you were talking
about this before we went on the panel
live today but about how we look at
resumes actually oh and that's the other
thing is unlike a lot of companies
Google has a human look at every resume
we got and that that's an astounding
number of resumes so like I said you
have about a minute of the recruiters
attention you know to grab it and have
them click okay yes I want this one and
swipe you in and you know you'll get
queued up for a phone interview if you
get selected for an interview the
biggest advice I can give you is
practice write practice writing a
program in a Google Doc go go find
yourself your favorite computer science
textbook and reread some basic
algorithms and just actually implement
them in a Google Doc and then copy and
paste them into Eclipse or whatever you
want to use and make sure it rots
because that's a very tricky thing and a
lot of people stumble when they get into
that world because they don't have
autocomplete and they don't have
invitations and they don't have
parentheses being highlighted and the
colors are not there right like make
sure you can cut that cord
only reply to technical interviews but
apply for some jobs that you care a
little less about and sort of practice a
real-world interview on those companies
first so that when I buy someone like
that gave me when I was doing my
interview that they're like the
recruiters and the engineers who'll be
interviewing you they actually want you
to get hired so that's the that should
tell you that like like most of your job
you should do the type of your job like
during the interview processes just give
them the reason why like you should be
hired and like what happens in my
experience that like here you see like a
lot of like really good engineer that
detect our candidates who when I really
never stood in the interview and they
cannot like really like like talk
properly or maybe communicate their
ideas and as that becomes a problem
because you don't get to give back the
interviewer or maybe the recruiter like
what you are tweeting that made of so
just be confident who already wants to
hire you
yeah as an interviewer comment kind of
related to that is a big thing once
you're in that interview processes is
talking is its reasoning out everything
care you're thinking so when we're doing
technical interviews and we're asking
you to to go through a problem even if
you're struggling knowing how you're
thinking through that problem it's very
important to us because even if you are
a little off the solution or something's
not quite right if we can understand how
you how you think is there a problem and
that's more valuable to us and and
that's what we're looking for that's
what we're gonna write feedback on is is
the problem-solving in the process and
less of the did they get every single
semicolon and an angle bracket in their
correct place yeah and actually on that
note
John Patrick asked what does Google
value more in code readability or
brevity and I think maybe let's apply
that specifically to the interview
grief code is generally more readable
you generally don't want to be the one
that knows the world's most obscure
JavaScript conversion to get a string
into an integer so yeah you know it
should be apparent what you're doing and
you should be doing it in as few lines
yeah yeah I think yeah I would
definitely agree with that
good good software engineers are lazy
but fewer lines of code you have the
fewer bugs are in that country and the
other thing about the interviews too is
you're going to get a lot of interviews
and people might think we're looking for
you to fail but for the most part hiring
committees are looking for which
interviews you did the best end they're
not like oh he really bombed that
interview he just doesn't get grass very
well great we've got lots of things that
don't involve grass very we're looking
for you to not one or two of those
interviews out of the park because then
we know what you're an expert oh yeah
okay cool I'm gonna do one more question
and then we will jump into our new grad
roles that we offer at Google so this
comes from Christina and she asked do
you expect a certain level of knowledge
and experience or do you provide
training on the job so I guess we can
take that at face value again whew do
you have anything to say for that from
my perspective I think it's training on
the job because there's a lot of Google
technologies that are specific to Google
that no other companies use and no
matter how many years of experience you
have you will have to learn those anyway
so I think that demonstrating that you
are willing to learn and can learn
quickly is a plus yeah
I want to just visit hiring on to that
like the first week as a as a new
engineer at Google is all training
classes and those are just introductory
classes to different areas of technology
and for any given area there's more
classes you can take so yeah there's a
lot of on-the-job training as long as
you have the base technical skills
alright let's take this time to dive
into the positions that we offer here at
Google these are specifically for new
grad related roles so you can see us as
want to join us as an engineer these are
legitimately the four pillars that we
looked at during interviewing so we'll
go over this again in some of our later
sessions but always good to kind of keep
these in mind one other thing that I do
want to say about these roles or is that
these roles are created and intended for
people just graduating from University
we do have different levels undergrad
masters PhD but that's all taken into
consideration when you're applying and
when you're interviewing so I just want
to make sure nobody thinks that when
they're interviewing or apply and
they're going up against somebody who's
been in the industry for seven years or
something like that or even really going
up against anybody it's just a matter of
how well you personally perform so
what's that being said let's dive into
our most common new grad role by far
which is the general software engineer
role I think the in foods talking about
that one and software engineers do all
kinds of things you work on different
teams on Google doing different things
and oftentimes you have the opportunity
to switch to a different team if you
choose to within a couple years or so
Google likes its engineers to go around
and explore different things awesome
okay and then our next one is the
engineering residency program so the
engineering residency program are
targeted for people who have a strong
academic background but maybe don't have
enough industry experience so what
you'll do is you'll spend a year at
Google during the residency program
where we'll catch you up on like an
industry specific tools Google specific
tools and that takes a few weeks and
then you'll be matched with a team of
real team at Google doing a rotation for
a few months and after that you have an
opportunity to switch into a full-time
role with that team and my team actually
had an interested in who converted full
time last year and this year we have two
in residence joining us so this is
definitely a real thing okay and
actually before we dive into the next
one I think from showing that first
slide of the four pillars people are
really really assisted and what the heck
we mean by googliness and I know that
there's not one definition but does
anybody have a little spiel on
googliness that they would like to share
or have ever heard a good definition of
it yeah just weird enough to be
interesting
I like that yeah you'll hear it
described a lot of different ways at
Google so that's actually a question
that's brought up even when you get here
but it is interesting I feel like when
you work here everybody does have sort
of that googly factor as we describe
about it and I think it's just you know
you like being here you're a good person
you're not being evil and you're
passionate about the work that you're
doing and most of it is like yeah and a
way to show it on your resume I know it
a lot of other companies they might
discourage you from putting like another
interest section or something like that
but we love to see that at the end of a
resume love to see sort of like a
well-rounded person and want to hear
about your interests and things like
that so feel free to always throw that
at the bottom okay and with that that
was just a really hot topic in the chat
so I wanted to address it but let's go
ahead and dive into our next role site
reliability engineer okay so reliability
engineers can work in a few different
capacities one of the more popular ones
is they're the ones that actually keep
the data centers up in brine so they're
responsible for setting up the hardware
doing the networking making sure the
power supplies are up and running
additionally the site reliability
engineers are the ones that actually
push code out to production they're the
ones that get paged if something goes
horribly wrong and they do the roll
backs these are these are like the
system administrators and other and
other lingo they're the ones that keep
everything running and also write the
tools to make sure things keep running
so it's not just simply they're plugging
and playing things they're literally
writing the tools that allow data
centers to come online and come offline
and switch data and move things over and
migrate your sessions without you even
knowing that we took Atlanta offline for
whatever reason cool and let's move
right along
I believe our next one is software
engineer tools and infrastructure
finally referred to as SETI here yeah so
that's that's me over there I'm actually
like very passionate about this one so
as us as the tools and infrastructure
engineer responsible for like making
sure that like the Google products are
awesome making sure that like deflector
flows in the like in lighting the
products you find them and then that
part you fix them so that the main role
of like these people you said you wanna
make sure that like developers are not
spending like the same amount of effort
in different teams doing the same thing
you wanna die improve like the
developers like productivity so if like
a team that got names like this button
to look this way and then another team
back you missed this fighting duped
another way you'll be like the the team
that to provide like you are usable
component like in Google will use like
the same codebase now we want to make
sure that like when different engineers
submit via code everything that works
mostly back like another engineer will
be able to see like the changes that
we're away all the tests are passing so
you are we are me as a as a tool and
infrastructure engineer you are making
sure that like things are running
smoothly at Google like the products
that like now you are checking out and
like is shipping to customers like up to
the greedy booster Anders are they
conform to that the privacy standards
bad like we expect privacy security and
all those kinds of things so it's really
an awesome whole great and then we will
round it out with three more of our
roles that these ones we hire for in
sort of smaller quantities than the
others but nevertheless do you have new
grad roles so associate product manager
so an associate product manager so you
can think of it like as a transition to
like a project manager which are people
that who are actually like making like
really important like decisions at
Google so as a product manager like you
be like you're being trained to be the
person like who be like planning the
execution cycle of the product so by
being trained I mean like at Google that
everyone is expected like to actually
like contribute like poor quality of
work so you will be planning like
from like that just planning the product
in like the inception of everything
thing like getting that UX like user
experience like feedback that getting
someone to work on that you will be like
working with other teams to actually
like making sure that like whatever you
have in mind is actually feasible like
you'll be working to us like that we
have a lot of things that we need to do
so you want to make sure that let me you
prioritize them accordingly and this
program done like that we provide for
that the associate manager is a two-year
program so it's a two-year rotation
program where that guy like you spend a
year in one team so like say you you
have like two rotations yeah it's
awesome you should check it out awesome
okay and then our last few over here
user experience in new X yeah so user
experience in UX we have a couple of
different roles under there there's UX
designer UX engineer and UX researcher
so at Google we have a big priority
about the customer and making sure that
the customers first so UX designers
contribute in making sure that those
interactions and how people use Google
products make sense our UX engineers are
responsible for researching while
prototyping and developing how these
things look figuring out what will work
and then we have US researchers who
actually do larger scale studies and
take a look at how people use things
whether or not different interactions
really work with a larger base of of
people often working with people all the
way across Google campus to get a
diverse sample so last but not least we
have our quantitative analyst role yeah
so this is as best I can tell that the
statistics geeks so this is people who
are really comfortable with huge amounts
of data looking at validating whether or
not features are working on our
different products
these are people whom our background is
masters or PhD in statistics or computer
science so really digging in there with
all of the data that Google has and
understanding how things work awesome
thank you so much everybody for diving
into that we've definitely had some
questions sort of boil up as that's been
going on so this one is actually from
earlier this is from William and he says
I just started a BS in computer science
in college up in Chico California and
I'm just wondering what advice what
advice do you guys have for a college
freshman interested in working in places
like Google so this from a freshman
perspective so or do something
interesting for it like you know like
the things you're learning in school are
like putting tools in a toolbox as soon
as you have one try it
find an excuse to write something or
build something because you'll learn a
lot more actually making something that
has to work than you will reading a book
or you know solving little problems your
professor gives you another thing along
that lines I have several colleagues who
are really successful signing up for
code Jam so get involved in that it's a
good way to get your name kind of out
there if you do really well it will be
interested in reaching out to you or you
know if you subsequently apply there's
already kind of this history that Google
knows about your Nassim kind of some of
your work well and this one comes from
Katie are there a lot of opportunities
to rise up in title say going from
software developer to developer manager
and and yeah maybe people could just
speak to sort of like the movement
within Google as well so Google has a
large number of ladders that's I guess
the best way to describe this is like a
software engineering ladder
and then you have the product manager
ladder and then there's actually people
management is its own separate ladder so
you can move up in your letter you can
laterally jump over to different ladders
and that's all be relatively easy to do
obviously going up for promotions
trickier but if you wanted to like find
a different role my recommendation is
you do what's called 20% time which is
at Google we're allowed to spend 20% of
our time working on anything that would
benefit Google so you can find another
team and volunteer to help you can come
up with your own project and get it
approved and then this way if you're
interested in being saying people
manager or a product manager or a
recruiter or being on a panel like this
you kind of get in touch with someone
and give it a shot do any of you have
any 20% projects that you're allowed to
talk about that you might want to share
with the group
my main 20% focus it's not really
official but I do a lot of like outreach
and recruiting stuff so this and doing
virtual presentations for schools and
then on-campus recruiting and interviews
and things like that ok I didn't feel
this one is actually for you
specifically this comes from this comes
from maybe and was kind of a plus one by
a couple people in there can you please
tell me what your experience has been
like as a woman engineer at Google and
then specifically do you ever feel
uncomfortable and if you do what do you
do about it
so I'm not gonna lie to you the numbers
are pretty much the same across the
industry it's like somewhere between 15
and 20 percent of engineers are female
so that's kind of a small number but the
people here are very nice and everybody
at Google are encouraged to take a class
called unconscious bias where we have to
basically make sure that when you're
making decisions and when you're talking
in a meeting or something make sure that
what you're saying is targeted at the
idea and not the person and like their
background and my experience here has
been pretty great actually
awesome
okay and then sort of switching gears
here Adrian adriani Adrian why asks what
is more important when trying to be a
Googler GPA or experience I can take
anywhere that we did some research and
it wasn't highly correlated with your
performance metrics about a year after
being hired I'm willing to bet that
there's a line that's not of your
likelihood to succeed at Google yeah and
we'll expand on this in our resume talk
in a couple weeks we do want you to
definitely include your GPA on your
resume a reason being if it's not there
that's kind of you know creates a big
question mark of why isn't there and it
might be easy to assume that it's rather
low but if it is there then you can
speak to it if you're worried about your
GPA being a little lower than usual we
absolutely look at your experience and
we look through your whole resume I know
we were saying you know only a minute
per resume or something like that but a
human does read through it and it's easy
to see why a GPA might be a little bit
lower we also do a good amount of
research into the schools and things
that you're coming from so while you
know a GP at one school might mean one
thing it might not mean that at another
University and we take that absolutely
into consideration so well you should
definitely work hard in your classes
make sure you're getting that experience
outside of class too because that one
takes up a larger chunk of your resume
and is something we definitely look at
don't worry about maybe like the art
class or English class where you got
like a C in so you if you're a technical
or major GPA it's higher than your
overall GPA okay cool
on sort of that topic here just in class
as wise alec asked what type of computer
science courses would best prepare you
for working at
um so you don't need to list specific
course names consuming they're probably
different from school to school but
we're there any that really helped you
out in school algorithms don't take
classes where you're gonna learn a tiny
framework right like algorithms data
structures and a nice overview of
machine learning and you're pretty well
covered yeah you know you should be able
to like eat sleep and breathe big
o-notation and you should know the
sorting algorithms the graph algorithms
you shouldn't you should be able to
implement your own hash map you should
be able to implement like a linked list
like know how those pieces work and be
able to build them in a couple different
languages and you'll be able if you're
targeting something more OS type
invented or working on kernel then
operating systems classes are going to
be really important yeah concurrency and
then if your school has anything that
deals with lower level concepts like
assembly language or if you can get into
an electrical engineering class and take
some VLSI and those other things to get
a real understanding of how computers
really work if that's where your
interest area is and maybe one with
database then a lot of programming learn
how to store data ok and then this
question actually acts as a perfect
segue so thank you Swapnil what is the
typical interview process like at Google
so we actually have some slides prepared
for that and so we're gonna show you
this this is basically what your
interview experience would look like if
you're applying for a full-time role so
there is first a coding sample or survey
sent over to you I don't want this to
intimidate anybody you do have to take
it but it's basically just to get a read
on if you know how to code or not after
that there's about two to three phone
interviews where you will be coding in a
Google Doc with a Google engineer on the
other end of the phone after that
there's about three to four on-site
interviews were actually brought on
campus where you would likely be working
and then that's
you have your whiteboard interviews so
you'll be coding on whiteboards we also
ask you no other questions outside of
that but coding is the biggest part for
the software engineering role after that
you're done but all of the feedback goes
into a committee review to make sure
there's no bias in there whatsoever it's
seen by a lot of people and then
ultimately that leads to an offer so
that's the behind-the-scenes process
it's a little bit different for the our
internships so this is what it looks
like for internships and there's a
coding sample and survey this is fairly
new so it's actually a little funny
about this is that you might not get
this but you might get this they're
starting it off I think kind of at
random with some folks are selected some
art so if you do get it do it it's
definitely mandatory if you do get it
and then after that you have about two
to three phone interviews and then you
are done so if you're going for the
internship the biggest thing to practice
is getting comfortable working in a
Google Doc and talking over the phone
after that though on our end it goes
through an engineering review in a host
matching process so matching you with
somebody who's working on a project
you're interested in then to a committee
review and then to an offer and last but
not least if you're actually wondering
how to apply to any of this stuff this
is how you do it so G dot co / student
careers is where you can go to find the
best roles for you all you need to do is
upload your resume and transcript we'd
need your transcript we need your resume
what's nice is that we don't ask for
cover letters we don't want them so you
don't have to stress out about a cover
letter and then you click Submit and
you're done so it's a super easy
application process some of the programs
might require something a little bit
more but it's nothing too bad usually
it's just this for almost all the roles
that we've talked about today um let me
hop into chat really quickly and see if
there's anything else we want to jump
into um the one this is since we're just
on the interview one Daniel does ask if
you get an interview how much did you
all prepare for your interviews and I
know for you too it might be a little
bit
since you didn't come in on the new grad
role but menB advice you could give to a
new grad for preparing for their
interviews find yourself a wife or write
it you actually did a lot of like the
preparations because I wasn't that
confident in my programming so like I
read like a couple of books one is like
how to prep like software engineering
like interview questions another one is
about nature structures other ones was
like programming there for the game
programmers or something like that so
you want to get awesome alright we are
just about at time and I want to maybe
give everybody a couple minutes of their
day back but we want to genuinely thank
you all for tuning in and we will see
you hopefully soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
