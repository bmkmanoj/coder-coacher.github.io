Europe and they're going to be here to
learn about google products Google
programs and absorb a lot of information

universities thank you see ya that's
what they call the google swag google is

with fresh ideas fresh new ways of
thinking the GCA program is for students
to be Google ambassadors on their campus

things google talking about some of our
really cool products getting students
excited about using google understanding
all of our products that different
