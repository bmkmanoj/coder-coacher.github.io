Google hangout on the air really excited
today we're talking about the Google
freshman engineering practicum practicum
excuse me hard time speaking today I
know a good sign which is a really cool
new exciting program we have here and
have two folks with me one Googler one
non Googler
which is exciting you're a first person
who's not a Google employee Tasha so
welcome
I have Jessa so why don't we let just
get started introduce yourself what you
do at Google and we'll go from there
great so my name is Jessica Lola vyx and
I work on our university programs in
Mountain View California and I am
managing the freshman engineering
practicum program this year
awesome I'm Tasha my sophomore at New
Mexico State University and I am
majoring in computer science how's the
weather in New Mexico oh it's it's
lovely
awesome it's cold nothing anyway I
digress just tell us a little bit about
the freshman engineering practicum like
what is it what's the what are we doing
sure so freshman engineering practicum
is actually a summer internship program
specifically designed for college
freshmen or first-year students in
undergraduate study at a university in
the US or Canada and it's a full
internship students do get to work on a
what we call a product on production
level code on real projects at Google
and they work in teams of three with two
hosts and they in addition to this
project there's also a skills-based
training and professional development
involved in the program so it's a really
exciting program that we just started
last year in 2011 and this will be our
second year in 2012 and it's very
similar in format to our engineering
practicum program which is for sophomore
going into junior year students so we
wanted to extend the opportunity to
students even younger so that's what
we're doing so cool very very very cool
and applications are soon applications
are now and are due on Sunday so that is
the last day to apply so google.com
slash jobs slash and practicum is where
you can go to find that application
so we're really hoping that students get
their applications in soon cool so fill
out your applications then watch the
Super Bowl yes perfect awesome and now
what you know why don't we sort of look
for when it comes to a candidate for the
practicum what do you what do you look
for in somebody yeah so first off this
may seem obvious but we have that in
some applications that don't fit this
criterion so we are looking for students
who are in their first year of
undergraduate study at a university in
the US or Canada and we're looking for
students who are performing strong
academically who've taken at least one
computer science course and maybe have
like a little bit that they're doing
outside of class so maybe they're
working on a personal project to develop
an Android application or maybe they're
tutoring a high school students who are
considering being engineering majors so
we want people who are a little bit more
involved such as Tascha
so maybe Tasha can talk a little bit
about her background from before she was
in fep yeah I was gonna say you just
described Tasha I guess yes yeah um I
guess a little bit of background on me
before I did freshmen practicum um I I
guess currently I'm an undergraduate
research assistant for a program called
young women in computing and so
basically the goal of that program is to
kind of get middle school and high
school girls interested in computer
science and so basically I know develop
curriculum and serve as a mentor to
young girls etc awesome when you do that
now on campus I didn't know on campus
it's very cool that's name and now tell
me a little bit about you know so you
were in the practicum last summer tell
us a little bit about your experience I
what kind of project you worked on how
cool your host was a lot kind of fun
stuff okay so well my experience last
time was fabulous definitely very
fabulous um you know I got to work on a
team with my four fellow freshman
engineering practicum interns there were
only five of us since it was the first
year so that was pretty fun we all
worked on with the mobile search team on
iOS UI test automation so basically we
just kind of our goal was to turn manual
tests into you know automated
and that's what we did pretty much all
summer we worked with two hosts who were
really cool they were able to help us
out and you know technical problems you
know and you know anything else we did
help with cool and how are you cooked
were you doing writing all the code
mostly Python or Java doing JavaScript
JavaScript cool so that was I never done
Johnson before so it was it was fun
getting to learn a new language
has it helped you back at school oh
definitely
ah yeah you know coding in general just
uh just kind of you know help peanut
build on those programming skills and it
was good it was better than having taken
a whole summer break and not doing
anything and so going to school ready
ready to work Tasha we're very different
students absolutely like summer ah
sounds great I mean what was it like to
work on a team of interns so you know
what I mean like was it was it kind of
similar to school where you do projects
or was it a completely different
experience it was it was fun I liked it
it was different you know in school or
kind of in the lower division classes
you don't really work in team projects
it's more individual base so that you
know you're able to pick up the
programming concepts but um I think it
was it was good experience and you get
to learn how to communicate with the
team how to collaborate and share ideas
etc and it was it was it was fun you
know we're all from different
backgrounds so we're all able to give
different you know inputs on you know
different problems we had in everything
cool now did you take into classes too
and you had the internal classes with
Google as well right oh yeah
did you take any classes externally as
well during the summer or are you just
doing the internship no I just say
internship okay but you took a ton of
sort of internal google little programs
too right yeah yeah what was your
favorite one of those um I keep watching
yes partly
hi
we took a html5 class with the
engineering practicum students now
that's pretty cool that was you know
fairly new and it was cool getting to
see you know how that works and how
different it is very cool have you had
have you been able to tie that back to
class as well not yet not yet give me
time I'll give you time right what was
your favorite part of working at Google
in the summer my favorite part
um I love the atmosphere of the
workplace you know everybody's always
really happy you know everybody who
works there is you know really
intelligent and smart and it's you know
I love networking and so it was fun you
know getting to talk to different people
from you know all around from everywhere
you know and that was one of my favorite
parts cool did you get to enjoy the
cafes oh definitely of course the food
yes yeah that's all silly and now what
are you doing this coming summer we got
playing jet mice this coming summer so
um I will be participating in the
engineering practicum and so I'm excited
my project will be on Google+ photos so
in what you yes and that music sounds
delicious
thank you very cool and now we're about
halfway done so I just want to remind
everybody that's up there listening live
but this is another Google hangout on
air
I'm Jeff Moore with my friends Jess and
Tasha and want to talk a little bit
about you know the application process
like just when we start notifying people
that they've made it will they hear next
week theirs are going to be a few weeks
what's the timeline and applications so
we were hoping to get back to students
starting before the application deadline
but due to kind of overwhelming interest
in the program we've just gotten a ton
of applications which is really exciting
and we're really enjoying reading
through all of the great applications
from students but it's likely that we
won't actually start contacting people
until early next week
so we'll be contacting students about
the interview stage next week and we
can't expect all students who applied as
long as they met the minimum criteria
Kennex
to hear back from us either way so you
won't be left in the dark awesome yeah
that was a question from Zach at the
University of Pittsburgh I would insert
a Patriots Steelers joke here totally
now totally doubt about that very cool
and now what's the what does the process
look like after application Jess is
there a phone interview on-site
individual stop that process apply yes
so the students will actually have two
technical phone interviews both with
Google engineers some of whom are
actually going to be hosts the summer
some of whom have just been very
involved with these types of programs in
the past and love working with younger
students so that's kind of basics it's
just two phone interviews and then after
that we'll do host matching and make
make offers a bit just based on those
two interviews but it's actually hoping
that Tasha could talk a little bit about
what her interview experience was like
okay um so my interview experience let's
see I had two interviews and it's the
way they kind of did them was not had a
Googler call me and they would share a
Google Doc with me and you know that's
where I would do the coding or answer
any of the questions that they had and
so um I think that was it was different
I had never you know I never even
realized that that's how an interview
could be conducted and so it was great
um basically the interviews you know
they pretty much just were composed of
you know the different CS core concepts
that you learn in the first year maybe I
was SES curriculum and now there was a
little bit of coding but there was I
mean they were good I was I was so
nervous oh my gosh I was so nervous and
so but at that point I will because
there are a lot of students who've been
emailing me nervous about the interview
process we do understand that students
are a little bit younger and so these
interviews are tailored to the younger
audience so we don't want you to be too
freaked out about the interview process
because we do know that you are just
starting out in computer science right
absolutely
I would shamelessly plug the recruiting
tips and tricks' blog right now
shameless plug all kidding aside when
when should people have final decision
they should know
mid March mid April we are actually
hoping to have all the final decisions
in the first week of March okay awesome
cool and now we're actually getting some
lot of questions which I know is really
cool
so we do have a question that justice is
right up you're having Josh I think you
can talk back to some of the skills
based training and like personal
development classes talk to up a couple
of those like what kinds of things could
people expect when it comes to those
those things sure and I'll let Tasha
chime in on this too but we are building
a customized curriculum that's just for
program participants and we're actually
partnering a bit with the engineering
practicum program so some of the courses
will overlap but the idea is to prepare
students not just for their internship
at Google but for beyond Google so we
really want to make sure they're
successful in their time here as well as
after their time here so this can be
anything from coding classes and coding
labs to you know more soft skills
trainings such as how to work in a team
because for many students this is
something that's brand new to them Tasha
wanted to talk a little bit about some
of your classes from last summer yeah
yeah um so definitely you know I think
they I think it's a really important
part of the interest I liked that aspect
um you know you know of course there's
technical skills workshops and then
there's soft skills workshops I I think
one of my favorites like this the soft
skills workshop that I went to was
called giving a receiving feedback you
know I you know I didn't realize that
there was a good way or a bad way to
give a receipt feedback I mean I guess I
wasn't really I never really thought
about it it was great to see it you've
never gotten bad feedback have you Tasha
uh and that was you know definitely and
of course the technical skills you know
those are always important and it's it's
it's fun to see you know the different
the different technical skills you need
to work say at Google and so it's it's
good insight yeah absolutely
cool um we have another question that
just came in from James Kim who came in
on Google+ the question is as Google
interns are we entitled to 20% projects
will we have time to think at all of
think at all based on the schedule
activity like will they have time for
20% project
based on all of the activities from the
engineering practical yeah so first of
all I want to say hi to James James is
in our computer science Summer Institute
program from last summer so I know well
so hi James hope you're doing well so
20% projects that's actually a common
question we get for interns so what we
generally tell insurance is that you
know they're here for a very limited
time for engineering practice or for
freshman engineering practicum it's only
going to be 10 weeks so we generally
they want to be as productive as
possible within their project while
they're here
that being said interns do have the
opportunity to meet other teams and
other interns and if they feel they have
the time they are allowed to work on
smaller projects and I believe actually
Tasha and her group did actually get to
work on a small project last year just
because they blew away their host
expectations and knock their project out
of the park so Tasha you want to talk a
little bit about project bull fun so I
guess so like I said there was five of
us on the team and so essentially we
kind of broke off into three different
three different I guess paths after you
know we started automated tests and we
figured out you know you know we kind of
got really good at that and so you know
some of us broke off into more I don't
know if I should go into these projects
with different projects and so you know
I was it was exciting because we got to
work on something else you know we still
at the same time we're working on our on
our test automation but it was that's
great cool all depends on the project
and each individual intern experience so
we don't want to guarantee it but it's
definitely within the realm of
possibility yeah and I think I would
just add based on Tasha's comment
earlier about networking giving in know
people you know you've got a limited
amount of time you want to really do an
awesome job on your core work so you've
got those folks in your network and
people like Jess can say hi to you over
Google+ so yeah another question is came
in they just keep coming
I'm worried about relocating well Google
helped me relocate to Mountain View yes
so students accepted into the program
will receive relocation assistance both
monetary assistance as well as
assistance from the team in helping them
to find housing and all
so students should rest assured we've
gotten a lot of questions about this
over the through the email alias
particularly for students who are
worried about it additionally I will add
that this is a paid site under
internship so students will be paid for
their time at Google so it's not
something that will cost you money to
come here
fantastic ok we have another question
this one specifically for Tasha can you
believe it
Steve can you speak about some of the
fun activities that you got to
participate in those mincer fun
activities on air with Jeff and jobs
there were lots of fun let's see here
you know within our intern group we did
a couple things you know we took a trip
to San Francisco we went and played some
trampoline dodgeball and then we got
some to do some activities with a larger
group of interns you know um we went on
an intern boat cruise that was so fun
you know karaoke and dance sitting in it
was great that was you know one of the
bests one of the best uh best activities
and then I played Ultimate Frisbee with
a group of the interns and we were
called the Google ultimate interns
sounds about right
cool um we have one last question I'm
gonna ask it all to you guys and Jess
will start with you just so you're on
the spot any advice for students who are
considering to you know applying for the
practicum what two tips would you give
someone who's going to apply two tips
well so number one would definitely be
for anybody considering applying for the
freshman engineering practicum apply so
this is my advice to everybody whenever
I'm on campus whenever I'm talking to
students it can never hurt to apply the
worst we can say is no and you're in the
same exact place than you are now so I
really encourage people to to spend some
time and and put together their
application the other thing is to
actually take some time to write your
essay so there is an essay component of
the application and we do I do recommend
that students do take time and take that
piece seriously because we will be
taking it into consideration in the
so don't just submit a two line answer
do you try to take some time and
formulate your words and really think
about it awesome Tasha you have two tips
for people wow I just took a lot of mine
copy so I copied rest plus um you know
just gotta be yourself especially in the
interview you know this you know it's
it's you know it's really nerve-wracking
but it's it's good experience and you
know even if they don't you know pick
you you still can say I interviewed with
Google how many freshmen have done that
not very many so it's cool it's it's
really good experience and yes apply
apply apply it's a fabulous program
awesome cool with that we'll end our
hangout on the air again this is Jeff
Moore from Google hangout with Jess and
Tasha really appreciate you guys joining
and hopefully this swamped you with
applications and we have a crew that's
is ultimate as Tasha's team was last
year yeah yeah
and Tasha special thanks to you I know
you're between classes that pretty much
rules that you're willing to hang out
with us between class oh you know good
applause I do well yes all right
thanks Mary it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
