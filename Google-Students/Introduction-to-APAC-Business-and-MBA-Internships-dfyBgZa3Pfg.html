trust me no pressure so just bear in
mind that this is a live session so
Justin are actually trying to manage
this whole equipment in front of you
which you cannot see and at the same
time trying to be talking to you so a
quick introduction to the agenda what
we're gonna cover today this is gonna be
a third
session and we're going to talk about
what you expect during a Google
internship we're going to dismiss defy
the hiring process talk to you a little
more about how we hire what do we what
do we look for and how to apply last but
not least we will spend the second half
of the session doing a live Q &amp;amp; A and we
would love for you to complete a one
minute survey at the end of the session
so one thing - one thing to note is very
important is we are going to be focusing
on Greater China and Southeast Asia
internships in the sales marketing and
corporate functions for this session so
we will not be covering anything
relating to engineering internships so
let's talk internship what can you
expect during a Google internship
whenever we hire an intern we really
want to make sure that we are giving you
a chance to have a deep understanding of
Google we also want to make sure that we
are providing you with opportunities for
development personally and
professionally
we want to also provide you with a
valuable learning experience at the end
of the day what we really want you to
treasure is - for you to be able to work
with amazing people from across the
globe and if in case you are converted
into Google in the future hopefully this
will be a smooth transition to the
Google team so just leave one thing
that's very important and are
interesting about the aspect of an
internship at Google is all interns
actually work on any projects that a
full-time employee will be working on so
if this gives them a chance to solve any
complex or challenging problem that we
are doing at Google and we're trying to
solve at Google sounds like really hard
yes we want to make sure that you guys
have fun as well
so tell us what do you think the interns
do a Punnett Google so Joslyn what are
your guesses I don't know that you guys
actually have a intern off sigh at the
end of each infant cycle so maybe you
can share
bit more about that sure alright so you
are right we do have off site for every
of the location that we have interns in
some of the fun things that you will see
is we have done sunset cruises in
Singapore we also flew interns from
Southeast Asia into sync
sorry from suffocation to Singapore and
we spent a day at Universal Studio one
of my most memorable off-site is
actually going into Mongolia Inner
Mongolia for the weekend with some of
the interns
yes so that is to say that we worked
very hard but we also play very hard now
that we have shared a little more about
what to expect from a Google internship
let's talk about how can you get
yourself through the door of Google
Joslyn is gonna walk you through the
recruitment process mix over the you
joseline thanks weenie and hi again so
I'll be walking you guys through the
intern hiring process so there are a
couple of stages in this process all
right so once you put in an application
and your shot listed for the role you
will first receive like a phone call
from your recruiter so if you're able to
clear the phone interview then this is
where you move on to up to two rounds of
on-site interviews so when we say
on-site it could be like a face-to-face
interview or it could be like just a
Google hangout interview depending on
where you and your interviewer are right
so once you clear the interviews we
still have to go through an approval
process with our hiring committee so
that is some could take about a week or
so before we can actually extend an
offer to you so I would say in totality
it will take about a good four to six
weeks okay so Justin if the interviews
are poor even you still think they are
gonna be any easier that's a good
question I really wish I could say yes
but unfortunately no so in terms of
hiring ba is gonna be exactly the same
as that of a
employee hiring and the rationale for
that is because any higher instance we
do hope to eventually convert them into
a full-time role and hence we have the
bar you know remains this thing so yeah
having said that not only know the
process so how do you ace that interview
is right and what exactly our interview
was looking for so when it comes to any
interview at Google there are gonna be
four key areas that you'll be assessed
on so the first area is problem-solving
skills and I would say this is also the
most important area out of the four
so the interviewers will really be
looking for looking to see logical
thinking in your thought process and
there are two types of questions that
need potentially be asked so one will be
behavioral where they ask you for like
an example from your possible experience
that you could share and the other one
will be hypothetical so this ready to
give you a hat like a scenario and ask
you you know what will you do in this
situation
so just remember there is no right or
wrong answer so they are just really
looking to see how do you how do you
derive at a solution right right well
the key factors you need to consider but
can I pass data that you need to look
into before you can come up with a
solution
so what them through the process that's
what they are more interested in okay
second area its leadership which is
pretty much self-explanatory so just
have a few good examples on hand where
you'll be a team towards the completion
of projects or even how you manage
conflicts within a team setting so even
have you have not let a team Despard us
the thing is fine because they are also
looking for traits where you show like
perhaps emergent leadership you know in
a situation like us for it we actually
step up to take the lead yeah and on to
the third area there will be google
Ennis so you may have heard about this
term before and wonder
you know what is it about so if you
actually ask you guys what googliness
means so everyone has their own
definition so it can mean that you care
for your team members or you can mean
that you strive in ambiguity or even
that you celebrate diversity so my
advice to candidates is always just be
yourself because after all this is just
a very general assessment of a culture
of it all right and the last area would
actually be really tech knowledge so I
would say this is some lesser importance
compared to the other three areas and
it's very much dependent on which is the
king that you're interviewing for so for
example if you are interviewing for a
sales team then you should expect you
perhaps even do like a live sales pitch
on the spot during the interview all
right so in this regard let us show you
like what are some of the teams that we
usually hire our interns into so we are
broken them down into two types so one
of these sales and the other one non
sales so you can actually find out more
about them on our careers page
google.com slash careers so on the sales
team you can see things like much
customer sales Google marketing
solutions so earlier on Vinnie actually
talked about you know how intense will
be working on projects right so within
sales teams I'm guessing you can expect
projects on you know such as research
work for clients or even launching
campaigns even coming up with a go to
market strategy for your clients of
their team yeah so I do know of like a
recent intern from the Google marketing
solutions team so he was actually tasked
to actually come up with an entire road
to market strategy for the Google
marketing solution Indonesia team
basically asking him to map out like
exactly how the team is gonna achieve a
certain revenue by 2020 yeah so that's
actually pretty cool and you can imagine
like
the intent such a heavy task you can
imagine a kind of autonomy that you'll
be given and also the skill of project
they can expect on this internship all
right and on the non sales team I guess
you can expect more on technical
projects or even things like writing
scripts or doing nothing research work
so I don't know of a treat at any time
all right so he actually helped develop
a tool to cut down on the data
preparation time by up to almost 50% for
our Support Specialists right so this
actually allows the specialist to spend
more time to focus on more value adding
an hour to go work so I thought that's
pretty cool even right now like the team
is there using the tool so it's pretty
amazing it's not yeah I also have an
example to share I know of an intern who
recently even like that in the Google
Play team so the team works very closely
with developers and what the team does
was to play a new game every single week
because they want to share their
insights from both the developers from a
customer point of view so imagine
playing games at Google during your
internship that sounds pretty cool oh
yeah and also just to let you guys know
depending on which market that you feel
supporting right in this respective team
so you may be required to have you know
the local language Justin so how to
intense pick your team's them oh yeah
that's a good question so um if your
that's apply for the role you'll notice
that you don't get to choose your team
ready start so what happens is we all
have a recruiter to you know review your
profile your background your skill sets
and we're differently I wish is the King
dies best suited for your profile and at
the point of phone screen view I feel
that you know
specifically which team that you're
being interviewed for so if you have any
strong preference right 417 feel free to
let a recruiter know is probably fine
yes so yeah now that you know we are
sure about how we interview and where
the opportunities are available I'll
hand it over to we need to talk about
how you can apply for the room all right
thanks Justine so first and foremost you
have to track your eligibility you have
to be a student who is graduating from
December 2018 to july 2019 and during
the internship process an internship
clear with us you should be able you
must be able to complete a 10 to 12
weeks internship at Google so some key
dates to take care of to take note of
all my applications are open from 20th
of November 2017 which is in about one
and a half months time and was that the
interview process the phone interview
process from early December onwards so
this means that the faster you get your
application in the faster you get
interview and also because the thing is
we roll our office on the rolling basis
and office will be rolling all the way
from January to April of next year I
think the last thing to note is this
again this timeline is going to be
specific for the business and MBA
internship positions in Greater China in
Southeast Asia and this is not
applicable for engineering internships
and if you want to apply for any
internships go to this website at the
bottom of the slide is go slash
google.com slash careers if you do a
quick search on internet on our
internship you should be able to find an
information
so we wrap up our presentation we want
to spend the second half of our
presentation really interacting with you
answering some of the burning questions
that we know you have so if you have any
questions take the time now to type in
your questions while we pour the
questions on our end so just an add-on
and start answering some frequently
asked questions first from previous
candidates so just in the first question
I had is if my MBA is sponsored by a
company and I am I still eligible for a
puka internship yeah so that will be a
little tricky because if your MBA is
sponsored by a company so I'm guessing
you're still under employment with the
firm right so it would be considered
dual employment so unfortunately we will
not be able to accommodate that so what
about if the candidate or the student
has a start-up where the candidates do
be eligible for an integer yeah so
actually technically you are so just
make sure you highlight this to your
recruiter right at the start of the
process right because there will be
sudden clearance that were needing from
our compliance team so the next question
a lot of students ask is if I'm a
foreigner and I'm studying I'm not
starting in a swing a pie am I still
eligible yes you can so long as you're
eligible to apply for the visa in the
respective country then you will be
so next let's start answering some of
the questions on the live chat we have a
question from I'm gonna butcher this
name for example Shang we team so can
students outside of the business major
applied for this internship absolutely
so we accept students from all majors
for a business internship so maybe we
should clarify right now that we have
got two internship roles available on
the sales organization marketing and
corporate function so we have got the
business internship and we have got the
MD internship so the business internship
is for anybody from any faculty from an
undergrad and PostScript that is not
anything a major
so if you're an MBA student you have to
then in this case apply to the MBA
internship opportunity so make sure
you're applying to the right one because
we have different recruiters what you
know different requisitions so I really
want to make sure that your application
is going to the right we could uh across
the globe alright next a question from
Sarah Sarah is asking are there any
language requirement so it really
depends on the location of the
internship for example if it's an
internship in our Indonesia office right
and usually they will require my bahasa
Indonesian as one of the language so it
really really depends so I think that
also answers the question from Florin as
well next question I have is what needs
to be submitted in the application a
application process by isabel
essentially it's really just your
resumes don't have a letter required
just a resume will be restricted
appointment may be a quick tip over here
is if your resume is more than two pages
long it is too long no they don't want
to make sure that you know you don't
want to make sure that you're formatting
your resume according to the the company
that you are try to you're interested in
actually concise yes imagine like
recruiters we look to hundreds of miles
and even thousands yes that's right so
you really want to make sure your
resumes popping and this music if your
resume is from short and sweet it's
obscene very great so we have a question
from Lucas
if you want to apply to a finance
internship do you just apply to the non
sales internship or do you specify that
you want to apply to the financing that
should go quick question so you don't
have to specify so for example if you
want to apply for a finance internship
right you should apply to business
intern 20 18 USC like a you know the Job
Description and just apply to that right
yes that's right
so from our end we will give you a
profile and I guess the only exception
is if they are MBA students who are
interested in working in the finance
team then you should apply for the MBA
it really depends on what degree you are
trying to study for what you're starting
for now so Charmaine is asking if I'm
graduating in December 2017 is that
acceptable
unfortunately this internship is meant
for students in the penultimate year of
their studies so in the second last day
of your studies so if you are graduating
in December 2017 we would actually
encourage you to be applying for
full-time roles right now so why
proposition next time on alright next
question is master interns be graduating
next year and 2019 I'm interested to
internet Google power be graduating in
2020 so I think I cannot answer that
we are only like sorry internships are
only applicable for students in their
penultimate year so if you are
graduating in 2020 then you can always
apply in your second a sea of your
settings so next question is talking our
CDs then are among the thousands of
others by Alfredo very good question I'm
gonna take this question I feel like
there is a ton of resources online that
will help you work on your help you
frame your perfect resume if you know if
you don't know this we do have a ton and
a drop of resources online as well if
you go to google.com slash students
that's where you can find information
about how to you write a perfect resume
so next question is from harm what is
the main difference between an
undergraduate internship and
internship actually it is the same but
it's just that perhaps you know the
projects will be different so I guess
the thing is MBA internship is meant for
students by starting an MBA yeah so that
because you're different
thank tens of thousands of students
globally so we just want to make it
easier for recruiters while taking care
of undergraduate and masters students so
review those applications and then I
mean recruiters are working on MBA rows
through doing and the application so
that's why you need to make sure you're
applying to the right application so if
there are chance for a student in
engineering faculty to join us a
business intern from technical teams as
well I mean who are you taking in
business interns with technical skill
set so yeah
so one of Union one of the department
that we showed just now was these
technical solutions team so in a
technical solution simple welcome
students with engineering background
because they do work on say for another
scripting writing class on you know what
for processors so we will of engineers
come to join us as well hmm so when were
the internships be available on the
Google career so one key date is the
20th of November 2017 which is in one
and a half months time so applications
are open so the rows actually posted
online now but applications were only be
open from 20th November so
all the way till like April so you have
this period to you know apply but the
sooner the better so we we do have about
ten minutes so we're gonna take a few
more questions so the next question is
how many internships can be applied to
buy a nah I'm so sorry if I
pronounce your name wrong
how many internships you can apply I
believe on the system itself we can
apply to up to three roles so if you are
in case you are wondering how many
internships can you apply globally you
can apply to any internships in the
world as long as you qualify for a work
visa
so let's say if you are I'm the great
student in your year three of your four
year degree then you should be applying
to the business internship and not the
end B internship so can people from Hong
Kong apply for Singapore other octaves
this is a question from James so long as
you're eligible to apply for yeah that's
right so we put on one second that a lot
of questions on chat where you trying to
go through those questions okay so keep
those questions coming so let's say if
we have got so I saw a question sorry I
didn't catch the name it was can do we
need to have an honours degree to apply
for an internship
no necessarily yes correct so next
question is is there help for work
experience for MBA students by Raja
no you're you know doing a full-time MBA
right now and you're you know in the
first year you're correct
oh it's not you die graduating from
number 2017 to july 2019 next question
we have is yeah there's GPA matter in
your recruiting process and discretion
is by Stephanie thanks for us thanks for
asking this question yeah um so we say
it's not the key you know factor that we
consider we do take it into
consideration but there's a lot of other
factors right so it's not gonna be there
so deciding science correctness so we
really want to understand the way we
interview is we really want to
understand what makes you you and what
makes you constantly it's not just about
GPS is one number and at the end of the
day what have you done that school did
you need at the project you have the
knobs certain sports scene what did you
do outside of school so these are things
that we also take into consideration as
well so next question is besides the 10
to 12 weeks internship would you
consider a five to six months internship
and this is from Randy unfortunately
five to six weeks will be a little too
short
I hope so BAM I again I know I sound
like a broken record you you have to be
graduating from December 2017 to 2019
and we only accept students in the final
seven years of their studies so this
means that we are expecting you to go
back to school before you after your
completion of the internship so we will
not ascertain unfortunately we are not
able to accommodate internships longer
than 12 weeks so michi earn us will be
where we'll be assigned and mentoring
sponsor when if we come in whatever yeah
yeah you do have like an intern host
right well
you know this person will kind of be
like a mentor throughout the entire
internship so before we take the last
question of the last two questions I do
want us to very quickly take time a
minute to completely survey that we have
actually this is only a five questions
survey and you should really take your
less than one minute so Charlotte or
shower either chellamma shower is going
to think the link of their engine
process so they found in the chat box so
we would love to hear from you what we
also want to do is this is one of our we
only started launching YouTube live
sessions recently this year we would
love to hear from you
what you enjoy about the session was
this useful and also we want to know
what topics do you want us to talk about
one last question so last question from
funny them the internship grows
different in different APEC regions for
example some girls are only available in
Shanghai and some girls are available in
Singapore yeah that's right so in
different locations maybe only certain
teams were open you know we'll be taking
in tents so you'll be different but sure
so maybe in this case let me go very
quickly to the slide that we shop just
now about the different teams so these
are the common these are the teams that
we do hire interns into but there are
some things that we don't list because
we have got many many different
departments or Google so just apply and
then we what you should be able to talk
to the recruiter about the team and also
again go to google.com slash careers or
google.com slash students this two sites
will give you a lot of information about
what 15
each team does so I think that marks the
end of our session we really had a great
time answering all your questions we're
gonna ask Charlotte and Sheryl to come
and save I very quickly thank you so
much for managing our chance I hope you
guys had a kind of good time so please
complete the survey I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
