then ask for all our participants to
introduce themselves we have Danny
we have Caroline and we have Jana
joining us today so if you could just
play
tell us what your name is where you're
from and what team you're in and then
we'll take it from there so we can start
with Danny perhaps because he's here
like this time hi guys hi guys my name
is Danny I'm working in the Nordic small
medium business team focusing around on
on helping small and medium businesses
make the most out of our our products
I'm from there if I'm done like myself
and study that could make business cool
cool and we have also Caroline and young
Meg if you could tell us where you're
connecting from and and what team you
are and that was a bit about yourselves
please
hi everyone my name is Caroline and I'm
from Sweden and I'm actually in Sweden
right now in the Stockholm office but
normally I work from the Dublin office
and I work in the SMB team which is
small businesses and small medium
businesses yeah and that's who I am
hi everyone
my name is my name is Amna and I am from
Bergen in Norway which is also currently
where I'm working from today as you can
see with the lovely weather behind me I
work in the same team as Danny he was
working the SMB experience team so we
support the Nordic advertising market
with their advertising on Google cool
perfect thank you very much for
introducing yourselves we'll get the
chance to get to know them a bit more as
we as we leave this conversation okay so
talking about Google internships like
our internships target mostly students
on their second to last year of their
studies okay regardless of a bachelor's
or a master's degree and we have here
right beside me Danny he just introduced
himself and he actually joined Google
last year as an intern and then from
there he was offered a full-time
opportunity that's why he's here and I
would love you that need to tell us you
know first what motivated you to you
know become a Google intern and what you
did during your internship and and how
that
do you feel that that prepared you for
your current role please yes well I I
think the the interest sort of came from
a general interest and fascination for
technology in the beginning and to be
honest I I wasn't very much into digital
advertising before hadn't worked for an
agency or works with any other sort of
ceased it's the product set before but I
was very fascinated about the culture
and sort of the innovation and and all
these things that were happening
happening at Google and and I just
thought like I would love to try it out
and see what it was like and the things
are you so you you you didn't know much
about digital advertising so your role
was somehow connected to digital
advertising so no need to know any
technical special features or
programming languages no no no no no
it's not necessarily that technical it
can be if you want to but it was more
sort of taking a strategic approach
around our product sometimes how
customers actually implemented and
that's not necessarily that that
technical not cool and what would be
like you know a come on day during your
internship what sort of things would you
be working on yeah so I think one of the
one of the very very cool things about
the internship was that I was basically
thrown into it like immediately yes
worked with clients from from the
beginning and that's basically the way
you learn it so I was very surprised
that you know I was basically just
allowed to go ahead and work with the
times directly and like those clients
were like businesses back in Denmark is
that it yeah across the knowledge so
they Danish Swedish in the regions and
also a few things okay so it was very
cool and then I also worked on a project
with the team sort of trying to improve
some of our core metrics so it or not it
was not only only working with clients
but also sort of helping the team
improve on certain things okay so you
had both like a core role that was
tightly connected to like dealing with
customers on a regular basis and also
like a project that you were working on
this with your team yes yes accepted
okay
that was sort of fair what prepared me a
lot for for the for the role that's was
last part of your question because I got
to work a lot with the clients which is
what I'm doing now all the time more or
less
and and and I got to understand the
products on a deep level I think while
still also trying to understand what
actually drives performance auntie
mm-hmm through the project cool yeah
nice in the world thinking like let's
move now to you know think about okay
you did that during an internship now
you're on a full-time position just like
Caroline and Jana so I would love to
hear a bit from from you girls you know
about your role and the team you're in
so Dan you mention some interesting
things you know this relationship this
interaction with clients
small and medium businesses like if you
would explain your role for someone
who's like not inside Google and it has
no clue how things work and perhaps has
this mindset they do know that Google is
a tech company it's probably just for
the techies like how would you explain
you know the key characteristics of your
team Caroline the characteristics on my
team or an actual job yeah first how
your team you know how your team is
organizing what sort of things you do
and then your job within it okay so I
work in sales with small and medium
businesses which means pretty much
there's there's so many companies in
Sweden that try to find in customers
every day and that is really my goal to
help them to find as many customers as
possible to help them navigate in all
the products that you ask because
there's a lot of them and it can be
confusing
and so my job is really to reach out to
different companies and can the retail
companies so it can be you to be
companies yeah and I really help them
with their online strategy so how can
they find more and interactions with
people online and what I think is really
cool is that I get to learn so much of
the different or industries it's not
just oh this is like so many different
ones so I I constantly challenged and
that's what also makes me knowing the
product so well there's so many
different things you can do with them
and my team are about ten people and
they're working in these kind of
companies
and they're amazing all of them we help
each other out there's really a good
team spirit I would say and we also hang
out after work a lot so yeah cool cool
and young knit sometimes when students
ask me you know okay what is the life
you know working with small and medium
businesses what is exactly that I'm
gonna do you know quite often to try to
make you peer III tell them that you
know normally businesses that size they
don't have the resources to have their
own like corporate marketing officer or
they don't really know what online
advertising is all about what sort of
you know solutions or like how does your
team how these you know small and medium
businesses you know within the Nordics
to get their voice out there online and
so but if you could put that into
context on what your team does and what
your role is that will be great yes so
the major difference between my team and
works more in services versus Caroline's
team sales is that our support is more
reactive rather than proactive so any
any has any customer with the wolf has
opportunity to contact us either through
phone or email or chat and we then help
them troubleshoot any issues they might
have with their with their advertising
but we also and most importantly we act
as a consultant for them so we would ask
them about what are their goals and and
give them advice on what is the best way
that they can achieve the goals that
they have for their business and what
are the optimal advertising solutions
that we have for them so it's a very two
sided job on the one side you do
troubleshooting and the on the other
side you're also acting as a consultant
and I think one major major benefit in
this role is that you get extremely good
product knowledge and not only will you
learn AdWords very very in-depth but you
also become very familiar with all the
other Google products I mean the last
offer such as analytics and shopping
and so on so I'm both the product
knowledge and how to customers is the
key things in this world and what would
a typical day look like on your own so a
typical day I probably spend a couple
hours on on phone on incoming phone
support and advising anything from small
or medium sized businesses on whatever
issues or questions they have regarding
their advertising some of it is on via
email so would also help them an email
or on chat also part of the day after
awhile in the role you also have the
opportunity to work on other projects
internally so after time you then choose
which areas are more more interested in
and you can start working on on
different projects so you also get to
spend some time during that which is
really a fun part of the job
oh that flame is cool and talking about
fun part of the job there is a Google
has a program that's tailored
specifically for people who join the
small and medium business team right
so it's named the business associate
program and basically every associate
account strategist when they join the
team they get into this program right
Caroline I would like to hear from you
you know what was the added value for
your professional development of
belonging to this program I think it's a
great opportunity to get away a little
bit from just like your normal thinking
to you expand or can you guys see me
yeah okay
no but the thing is and Caroline is
mutant know so let's get Caroline you're
matured oh and I think her back no she
feel me
oh you're stimulated okay so maybe I'll
get I'll get Jana as she's she's new
with us okay
answering this question and then I'll
get Caroline back to check the next one
is it okay yeah no no problem at all
and I've also I've been doing the
business associate program since I
started a year and a half ago and one of
the best things about the business
associate program is the the different
classes that or the trainings we guess
during it every quarter we've been
taking we've had at least a day where we
go and have a full day of training and
this is to develop our personal skills
so it's not specifically product
training but it's more about our
leadership skills or presentation skills
or more aspects of personal development
and growth so I find they've been really
useful and a good additional training
so the program is focused on both like
helping you develop hard skills on
digital marketing and online
advertisement and at the same time like
develop some soft skills like those that
you mentioned yes okay in the that's I I
was just wondering here while I was
listening to you you know I telling a
bit about your careers and what you've
been doing here at Google considering
this is the most common nature level
position so whoever has just left school
and want to apply for a job at Google
you know this is one of the most common
positions for non tech professionals why
do you think I mean this this goes for
you why do you think this is a great
place to start your career you know
joining the the global the small medium
business team I think I think one of the
one of the key benefits of starting in
in small medium businesses they get so
much product exposure and so much
customer exposure you really you really
have a lot of interactions and you you
learn continuously and there's so much
support that goes into you know
developing your personal skills but also
your product knowledge and that is
something that's you know I value a lot
and that I I know that all parts of the
organization is also valuing afterwards
when you want to do something else at
some point um and yeah I think I think
that's really the key thing and you get
to work in teams that are sort of very
very much
similar to yourself in a certain way so
you you quite quickly get to feel home
like you have a home and and you know a
safe environment to experiment and try
stuff out and I think that's that's
that's very important when you start
fresh out of university yep
in your career and you know I feel like
I've been here for a year now and my
learning curve has been insane
so yeah I've been very happy with where
I started cool
any mention during during what you said
that you said that like a you gain an
asset like a set of skills that are
quite useful you know for your future
quite often like when I meet students on
campus they ask me like Oh what sort of
you know career advancement or career
paths can we follow and it's I also I
always find it very interesting to
answer this question because it always
depends on you right on what the student
is interested what they want to develop
skills in Google does offer you some
some career paths that are most common
when you look you know about like
history and the numbers that we've had
one of the phrases one one common past
is for you to grow with your clients and
you start looking after you know bigger
accounts and you can even move to your
home country home country's office and
then be working with clients from there
this is one thing that we see quite
often right on their teams so like
people you know working with the Danish
market then moving toward Copenhagen
office or like with the Swedish market
moving to our Stockholm office having
started here in Dublin within this team
so this is something that's important to
highlight like inter mobility something
that's definitely very encouraged
I myself have gone through this as well
I started in another office non based
here in Dublin so I think it's something
that's really it's a it's a great
opportunity there Google offers to
everyone and speaking of Google Dublin
this is the moment that we move and we
we're gonna focus a bit more above life
here so why are we speaking so much
about Google Dublin and and and why is
why others around Ireland so this is
where we have our headquarters for
Europe Middle East and Africa so Google
is not alone here there people claim
that Dublin is the Irish equivalent of
Silicon Valley and the region the
neighborhood where Google is is actually
some people nickname it that's the
silicon docks because it's they are
aware we firmly have our docks here in
Dublin and Google Google's presence here
has been growing a lot lately and it's
not just by chance that we're here
talking to you because we're of course
hiring the teams are growing and this
place is bursting with startups as well
as other European headquarters for lots
of other tech companies if you just do
some research you're going to find in
you're going to be impressed with how
many companies are have their operations
here and dumpling is one of our major
regional sales offices so there is a big
bunch of Googlers here doing like this
job for the whole Europe Middle East and
Africa regions and I wanted to hear from
the three of you so now apparently
Caroline has her audio back so she could
be a good one to start although you're
in Stockholm right now is it just thrown
us if you could tell us a bit of what
you enjoyed the most you know about
working hearing government well first of
all it was so easy to to actually move
there and I moved from Sweden before and
it worked a little bit in the US and I
was a bit worried you know because
there's so many things that you need to
prepare you need to guess like you're a
new apartment and you know so many
things before years settle in but what I
found when I came to Dublin was that
Google has such an experience with
bringing people over here that they
helped me out a lot I felt like in a few
weeks I felt like settle in I know where
I'm going grocery shopping I know where
I'm doing this and I could really focus
on my job and my new friends okay the
transition was really very smooth that's
great to hear
that's very good what about you young
and how was it for you now the same
Dublin is very easy sitting to settle
into
you get very well taken care of by by
your team at work we get a lot of help
finding accommodation and the
environment those like at work and in
Dublin and it's a very international
environment you have a lot of other
people in the same situation as you
coming to Dublin and and starting a new
job or something in there so in that
sense the people moving to Dublin
crosses is is really smooth like
Caroline said mmm cool and then lots of
people like there are lots of myths
around you know the Google working
environments and how Google office is
like where students get the chance to
visit an office they normally get just
like oh they go crazy what are the
features here in our office that you are
personally very very found out yeah and
if you can share a bit of your
experience here I think yeah you know I
first of all agree a lot with what there
was just said but I think to comment on
the facilities I I'm still amazed and
I've been here for a year and I mean one
of the things that I use a lot is of
course the gym but also the pool so I I
try I'm an ambitious wrath like it's
Wesley oh cool so and that's where you
know their working environment is
fantastic here because you have the free
food I don't have to take care of that
myself and then and it's good free food
yeah another thing is that you have the
gym and you have to pull and and you
know it just creates an environment
we're being ambitious in other parts of
life is very easy a lot of things are
taken care of by the company and it's so
gene pool and free food you can balance
them out yes I try that's right and like
I think I think Dublin in itself when it
sort of is outside Google is also
something that has definitely grown on
me I think it's an interesting City and
like there's a lot of international
companies here a lot of interesting
people from all over India which makes
it very exciting but also when you go
outside above them there is a very nice
countryside a lot of mountains and you
know the west coast is so beautiful yeah
I'm glad you mentioned something that I
would mention myself like the
countryside here in Orleans is just like
definitely one of my highlights I love
like it EE is an easy city where you can
you know just
scape wasn't alone and and go and the
countryside is just incredibly beautiful
for hiking like if you're into this sort
of stuff is just amazing but uh well
moving on because that's not just about
tourism that we're gonna be sticking
here we're now gonna focus a bit more on
the moving piece actually so you know
moving to a new place is always exciting
can be a bit can be a bit like you can
bring a lot of nervousness right because
there's so much you have to think of but
Google does offer a revocation support I
was wondering how your experience was
Caroline you just mentioned phrases that
you were you were actually in the United
States when you when you moved into into
Ireland to work for Google here in
Dublin so Swedish citizen in the u.s.
coming to Ireland they're like how how
was this whole process for you and how
Google helped you well and like I said
before it was much easier than I thought
because I was like from the other side
of the world and I felt I need to find
so many things but it wasn't that much
really I had to you know find my flights
obviously but then when I arrived Google
helped me setting up a bank account they
helped him you know finding my way
around and they arranged also you know
trips you can discover the city and
everything was just I don't know I uh I
wondered anything I could always ask
somebody yeah much easier I felt like
yeah this was easier than my move to the
US uh-huh interesting yeah that's any
person to lots of people share with us
that are in the end you know that you
can count on peer support much more than
then you actually expect at first and a
unit when you you just don't you just
sort of said you were joining actually
from home right so right now you're a
home in Bergen tell us a bit like you
know do travel home often how do you
handle this you know being far from from
family and friends being based here in
Dublin and but now you're there so share
a bit of your experience in that sense
with us please yes so being able to
travel home is of course really
important for me so they do the whole
into friends and family and I travel
home about usually I try to do at least
once a quarter and with my job we have
luckily have the flexibility to work
from home if necessary so as long as you
you know give this if you've noticed in
time then it's it's not a problem to
work from home for a couple of days
which makes it possible for me to do a
long weekend at home the homeowner
Wednesday works some home Thursday
Friday and the weekend so so in that
sense it makes it really easy to travel
home security but you can also if you're
from a city where there's a where
there's a Google office and you can
always work from a different Google
office anywhere you want as well so it's
really amazing that we have that
flexibility and it's also very
convenient because then you don't need
to cook right that's definitely one of
my favorite parts to be honest you know
if I'm traveling around and I can just
okay I can pop in here and get the work
done from from this place and besides of
course continual now the attack
resources that we have video conference
rooms and the whole environment I can
hear some footsteps here because we are
being joined by Derek from the Google
staffing programs team so Derek come on
over
so what's happening now is that Derek's
here with us
Derek recruits Google interns so he's
definitely someone who lots of you would
be interested in getting to know a bit
more and also understanding his role in
his job so Derek if you could share a
bit of you know where you're from what
team you're in you know a quick summary
of your job there will be great
absolutely so hi guys my name is Derek
as Cassie says and I'm an intern
recruiter actually I should go back a
bit I'm actually from Dublin I live 20
minutes from here on the train I don't
know if it's already been mentioned but
the train is literally right beside the
office earrings oh yeah we did is really
really convenient and so I mean as I
said I'm an intern recruiter I look
after the Nordics UK and Ireland and
just in terms of the team itself we see
it within the university programs team
along with Cassie and and yes so just
the recruitment sort of things I mean
obviously the majority the role
the equipment but we do actually look
after a lot of programs which is really
really cool we get to meet the the
actual intern to get the new candidates
a lot more face to face it's a really
good sort of job as well
okay cool and when that when I'm on
campus like I'm asked a problem that's
one of the most asked questions is like
how does the selection process work so I
think you would be the best person on
earth to explain us a bit more how it
works
and I see you have some images as well
to share okay so just in terms of the
interview process for an internship okay
because it can slightly changed
obviously between the full time and
internship so we usually have two phone
interviews and for the internship
nothing with the high reminder a
moment's women on the team as well and
and then we usually go straight to offer
stage after so it is quite a not quick
turnaround with the internships and it
can slightly vary I mean team different
teams affair phones other teams some
teams and fair hangouts as well so the
GAC to me face to face so to speak and
they're usually around 30 minutes long
okay so with the with the full time
offers and the actual recruitment stage
as I said it's that bit longer which
isn't surprising obviously for the
permanent offer and so there's usually
two phone interviews like phone screens
at the stats that's yours you've got a
recruiter and the business as well so
someone from the team will do a phone
screen at the start if you're successful
there and we'll move on to on-site
interviews so obviously you'll come over
to Dublin and you'll do three to four
unsub interviews they're usually
back-to-back and so once you're
successful at that stage we move on to
what we call the committee review stage
so this is where we pull all your
information together from the actual
interview feedback we have and we
basically put like it PACA together to
management to try and prove obviously
that that you're at you're the right
person for the role once we get past
that stage we move on to the other stage
as well which is the most exciting
exactly absolutely and just in terms of
the actual and opportunities that we
have you can get more there on the under
links so there's one obviously for just
a general student
rabbit rolls in this moment for the
internships as well there okay cool and
if you miss those links don't panic
because on on the hangouts or on the
YouTube no matter where you're following
us you will find right underneath the
links to apply okay so cool so once
these are here we also want to ask you
about like CDs and you know the
application process you on your road
certainly what you see those in those
CDs on a daily basis and students are
quite curious normally about what are
the most common mistakes are you know
what sort of tips would you share with
them so you know to have a really
flawless application
okay so huffy are there a couple of do's
and there are a couple of Don's maybe so
I definitely encourage you to all
students not only emphasize the role
that you do it's important to emphasize
the accomplished accomplishments as well
so you know if you do work in a sales
role and give us an overview of you know
your targets on a weekly basis a bit
more information there obviously we
ought we can all understand from the
actual CV what you do but I suppose what
your achievements we're in the role as
well is really important and and that
sort of brings me on to the next point
is to use metrics and data as much as
possible so you know if you did hit a
sales target again again just as an
example what was the target you know how
much they hit a boy how often things
like that we love to see that and
something else is it goes without saying
obviously you know even spelling
attention to detail is really really
important for any role here and one
thing I'd say try not to do as much as
when you are giving us an overview of
the actual role that you did and you
know breakdown will be very clear let's
not just have like a paragraph of an
overview we look through so many CVS and
even on a daily basis that we really
just need to see the CVS that get to the
point you know CV is you know the first
impression it makes on us we we don't
have time to sit there for five minute
review lemme CV we just it's we just
don't have capacity it's just not
possible within other applications we
get so you know just get to the point
random paragraphs or some bullet points
as well a few students last week when I
was on campus a few students asked me
like Cassie Google is such an innovative
company I just I just expect that you
expect our applications to be super
creative and colorful like crazy jumping
like doing backflips should students
like worry too much about how you know
the way their application looks or
should they focus much more on you know
the content and the sort of stuff yeah I
mean yeah the content is more important
guys you really and you don't want to I
mean you don't want anything that looks
over too fancy so like we it distracts
from the great work that you've drawn or
the great you know degree or masters you
might be doing and we might miss that
because there's something that's really
distracting us so we prepare just as I
said just to get the point make it clear
exercise okay less is more
yeah good to hear that and what about
the interview so like if there are
Sydney's are good enough you're gonna be
calling them you're gonna be you know
inviting them for an interview
what would you say are like the most
common mistakes that people commit
during the interview or if you have any
you know tips there yeah that's absolute
absolutely so and tips why is what I
would say is it's really important to do
your research and that's really twofold
I think the research of the role of the
team is really important obviously you
accrue or probably provide you you know
with an overview of the role job
description as well of course but you
know it's it's up to you to obviously do
that research and understand me plenty
of information online as well so just
not to forget up as well and not only
research the team and the role
researching our products obviously is
really important as well I'm not really
talking as much about you know Gmail or
our latest phones written like that I'm
really talking about you know the lives
of Edwards Edwards is huge for an awful
lot of roles we like SMB and the
graduate level role so and that's that's
just an example of somewhere else that I
would focus on and in terms of answering
questions I think that the best way to
answer questions is to think about the
the star technique is something though
you know we really try and promote so
you know it's a situation so when you
are providing you know any try and
provide an example as much as possible
when you are asked where
and so again the star technique is the
situation you're in and the task you had
the action you did and the result okay
so it's really good together you know a
background of what you did in a certain
role and how you did it mm-hmm perfectly
I love your answer because that actually
tackles our most voted voted question
from from the participants from Erika
Fredrickson she has how can you best
prepare for interview should you qualify
for an interview stuff so I guess you
answered the question I would and one
thing if that's really the top has a
question practice right practice makes
perfect so what I what I sometimes tell
students like you why not apply them to
a job you're not interested in just to
you know get your muscles flexed and you
get used to you know being asked
questions you were not prepared for you
know what sort of questions are
frequently asked during a an interview
do you done you have any any other tips
for like you know that you would suggest
to your friends and yeah yeah I mean
I've just recently started to do
interviews for the team and I think one
of the things that are always very nice
to see in the candidate is if their aims
to provide a very structured argument
with examples because that that makes it
very easy for us to give feedback
afterwards and so why was this candidate
so good why was the candidate not so
good so so I think definitely a steric
just mentioned those are very like that
that really those those four letters
keep those in mind yeah situation task
action and who sauce custard that that
makes it very easy for us to to
understand what you did and what the
outcome was and that's very important to
Google and of course be yourself this is
something that people sometimes get so
nervous or they're gonna need to real
like what will they expect me to say you
know what am I supposed to do
just be yourself that's definitely the
the best strategy because it's the one
that it's gonna you know channel your
not your energy in the most constructive
manner we have leo asking a question
that was also partially answered but I
believe we can dig deeper if needed
he said I could you provide us with a
little more information about the
application process are there tests and
if there are what can we expect
moreover could you tell us a bit about
how the interviews are structured lastly
what do you look for in a city so you
asked a lot of questions in one question
that's probably why you are uploaded
because I'm pretty sure everyone is
interested you know you know that what I
think it's important here is to
demystify the process because he's
asking about any test so what what
should students expect during an
interview in terms of like will they be
tested will they have to provide a
business case will they have to be doing
something online how does it work
I'm just gonna yeah it's not it's it's a
no for tests okay not not a not an
internship level not MacBride to a level
though there won't be any specific tests
so I mean the the interviews themselves
will focus on four different areas and
we'll have what we call a general
cognitive cognitive ability and you know
it's really there'll be no right or
wrong answers again it comes back to
using those examples as much as possible
it's really how you think and the next
part will be will be looking over a
leadership that will be directed the
second part deadly w test you want
testing in terms of asking questions and
role related knowledge will be another
factor that will be asked so how your
experience actually is relevant to the
role is relevant to you to the team
Google in general I suppose as well and
and then the last part is is the one
that I suppose it's the hardest to
explain its googliness and it's it's
what makes you different you know it's
how you might be a fit to again to the
team and to Google overall you know you
know it's it's it's it's more about your
personality mm-hmm and what makes you
stand out I I normally tell students is
like we're we're very focused on finding
people who have other passions and
pursue passions besides their work
because definitely we're not looking for
the next you know typical workaholic to
be hard to hear by Google definitely not
like so tell us tell us you know what
drives are crazy what makes it go mad
you know what is something that you're
really passionate because that's the
sort of fuel that keeps us going here as
well
nice I will go now with a quest
by Martin he he's asking and I'm gonna
give this out to the girls I hope they
are they are prepared for a question
that was not rehearsed let's see what do
you think is most fun or rewarding about
working at Google should I start yeah
sure go for it
the most fun thing about work I would
say it's there's many things but of
course my colleagues most of all because
I feel like when I'm going to the office
I feel like at home it's not like a bad
feeling it's we're having so much fun
together
which makes they just just fly by and
also I think because I feel like I'm I'm
making a difference since we're not
working with that big companies like
everything you can advise them and you
feel like you're really helping
companies and that's for me that's
really important what about you young it
yep so usually my first something I
would say there is definitely and my
colleagues as well you work with really
incredible people but the other thing
that I then would like to mention is the
variety in the work that we do and like
no day is usually the same you speak to
so many different types of customers
with different types of goals and
business needs and also you get to work
on on different projects depending on
what you're interested in so it makes
the variety and work really really
exciting and there's always a new
challenge so that keeps it going yeah I
could second that oh thank you
I'm going to the last question here
because I'm very cautious of time and
this one comes from Mandy she I'm gonna
take it I'm gonna take this one to
myself so is it seen as an advantage to
have more than English as a spoken
language in your CD for Google Mandy yes
that is for sure
so here during this hangout we're
focusing on the Nordic markets so you
know these folks here are working with
businesses and speaking on a daily basis
either in the region or Danish or
Finnish or Swedish
or Icelandic perhaps and but it's
important to to to consider that just as
much as we have Danish clients we also
have Dutch clients and we have you know
Japanese clients so we need to provide
all of them you know a great level of
service so the more languages you speak
the merrier always in every profession
in the 21st century but definitely
especially here at Google okay so if
people are bilingual among Nordic
countries Nordic languages that's a plus
the definitely we take into
consideration or even if you speak
another language that's not related to
to the Nordics you know this will
definitely be important and this will
definitely count in your application so
don't forget to mention and to highlight
your language skills when you apply for
a job at Google okay Derek and I
sometimes we stumble upon some
applications where students forget to
mention what their language what
language skills are and we are just not
supposed to be guessing you know what
language is fit just based on where you
study there was something like this so
very very good question Mandy definitely
yes that does make a difference
so do highlight that only on your
application perfect so we are we are now
on the last couple of minutes of our
hangout so this is time to wrap up time
flute for me I don't know how it fell
for you
I think it was very formative session so
I want to thank from the bottom of my
heart Danny here caroline connected jana

this guy what is his doing so he's just
helping us with from the technical side
of things to make sure everything runs
smoothly and he did run so thank you
