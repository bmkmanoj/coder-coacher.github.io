and welcome to our freshmen fireside
chat my name is chastity I'm the
university program specialist at google
today I'm actually joined with freshman
from Spelman College and Morehouse
College in our Lana office do you guys
want to say hello I'm also joined by my
colleague Chad Sanders in Washington DC
Chad do you want to introduce yourself
hey guys my name is Chad stickers I'm
also and I'm here in Washington DC
Google office with our our students you
guys want to say hello and we're also
very pleased to meet mr. Drummond
awesome in case you guys didn't hear him
he's Chad he's in Washington DC and
enjoy my students on Howard University
we're super excited to have you guys
here with us today so without further
ado I'd like to introduce you guys to
our SVP of corporate development and our
chief legal officer David Drummond
David's been at Google for about 11
years now that might not seem like a
long time but here at Google that
translates to an eternity for only 14 so
he's been around for a while and a cool
fact about David since the inception of
our internship program for sophomores
and juniors it was participated in our
executive speaker series which means
that one Friday he comes out in the
summer and actually talks to interns in
a really casual setting so that means
that David I'll pass the mic over to you
great well thank you chasity and thank
you chad and hi hello to everybody in
Atlanta and Washington DC it's really
great to have you here and hopefully we
can I'm happy to sort of talk about
Google and talk about what I do around
here and how I got here and maybe then
we can have you know here are some of
your questions and have a little bit of
a conversation about what all of you are
up
to you know it's been an interesting
ride here at Google chastity said I've
been here 11 years which is true but my
association with the company actually
goes back to the full 14 years I was a
partner in a big law firm in Palo Alto
so to the heart of Silicon Valley and I
got a call one day in the summer of
nineteen ninety-eight from it was from
an ex-client of the new line of the firm
and it said there are a couple of
computer science students at stanford
graduate students who have built some
search engine and they're looking for a
lawyer you know you should meet with
them that turned out to be larry page
and sergey brin and so I met with them
and we sort of hit it off and so I set
up the company for them back in
September of 1998 so the the document
that that creates google actually has my
signature on it which has caused our
chairman of our board to when he
introduces me places he often calls me
the real founder of google but so i go
back with the to google when it was two
people the two founders and joined the
company about three years later after
working with them as they're outside
lawyer so I've pretty much seen
everything there is to see at Google in
the history of the company and it's been
interesting you know we I don't think
the only people who thought that Google
might one day go from you know two
people to 30,000 people and and achieve
the things we've achieved are probably
Larry and Sergey because they actually
they if you talk to them now they think
that we're actually still we're actually
underachieving as far as they're
concerned and we can talk about a little
bit more talk about that a little bit
more later but you know I am so if you
in terms of my trajectory here or to get
to Google you know I always wanted to be
a lawyer from when I was very young I'm
not sure where that came from I grew up
in in central California place called
Monterey which is about two hours south
of San Francisco it's right next to an
army base which was a
place where my father was stationed back
in the early in the 60s mid-60s and then
he retired from the army and we stayed
right there near this this army base
because they my parents like California
my father was an army pilot you some of
you may have heard of the Tuskegee
Airmen but he was one of them and then
stayed in the Army for 30 years flying
airplanes and then helicopters and then
wound up on the west coast so didn't
have any lawyers in the family although
my father was very interested in law and
so I wind up you know I just I thought
being a lawyer would be the greatest
thing and I thought basically I thought
lawyers were all like Perry Mason right
who you guys are all too young to know
who that is but it was a it was a lawyer
who was on a TV show and so he was
famous for you know cross-examining
people on the witness stand and getting
them to you know admit that they're
lying and so forth and I thought that
was what was kind of cool so I figured
I'd I want to be a lawyer i also like
politics and was interested in it from a
pretty early age and so forth so i went
that route but when i actually got to to
law school yeah and then had a chance to
spend some time at some law firms in the
summer and that sort of thing i actually
found realized that the lawyers who go
to court make these arguments and go to
trial and do these kinds of things that
that actually didn't seem very fun to me
and because i didn't have i guess i'm
not a nasty enough personality to really
want to fight every day over everything
which is what you do when you're a
litigator so i discovered i went to
undergrad here in Silicon Valley place
called Santa Clara University then I
also stayed here for law school and went
to Stanford so being here in Silicon
Valley I came even though I was a I was
not a technical person I was a history
major political science minor basically
lots of English of a liberal arts kind
of person I I got exposed to what was
going on a silicon valley by the time I
arrived for college in 1981 and that was
back when Silicon Valley was established
but it really was it was called Silicon
Valley because the
semi conductor industry was basically
had been established here it had been
invented here and this is and basically
that was what fueled the economy here so
most people worked in the people who
worked in the tech sector a lot of them
worked for companies like Intel and
advanced micro devices national
semiconductor and so forth so the actual
is for those of you who may not know
this who are technical semiconductors
are principally the basic material from
them is silicon so that's why the the
valley got its its name but the what was
interesting about Silicon Valley is
because of the the infrastructure
structure created because of the
semiconductor industry that business
people investors venture capitalists
financers lawyers and then most
importantly the engineers and the
technical talent all it sort of gathered
here it it gave rise to lots of other
technologies that ultimately became
super important obviously computers
themselves Apple was was founded here
and then the the software industry
started to take off see it companies
like Oracle and others that were founded
here in Silicon Valley the networking
business so putting that computers
together and having them talk to one
another all of the big companies that
did that including cisco systems which
is the biggest one all found it here and
so on and then ultimately led to this
whole internet business that we are all
a part of so they've been you know
successive waves of innovation and new
technologies that have driven Silicon
Valley and made it a really amazing
amazing place so I wound up discovering
that there was a class of lawyer that I
didn't know even existed until I was
probably a second-year law student and
that kind of lawyer never goes to court
but actually works with companies on the
deals that they need to do if they need
to buy another company if they need to
raise money if they need just general
advice about almost anything
intellectual property you know how to
protect their inventions you know how to
work with other companies
all sorts of how to do you know
commercial business deals with them and
then just just to generally provide
advice and I found out that there were
not only lawyers but law firms that
specialize than that and it worked with
these startup companies and so the one
of the amazing things about Silicon
Valley it's one of the few places where
this startup culture this
entrepreneurial culture has really taken
root so whereas you know if you're in
Wall Street or if your other places you
know it's big big companies are in
charge of everything right everybody
cares only about the big companies even
though you know all of them were
probably small at one point so the big
companies that everybody cares about
here in the valley people care about
startups and they really really there's
a lot of focus on them a lot of
attention given to them and assure you
when you become google and you go in Vic
you get your attention to but everybody
cares about what the next startups going
to be and so there was a role for
lawyers to work with those startups and
sort of help them out on and be advisors
to them and i found out that that that
kind of suited me really well and and
became that kind of a lawyer and did it
at a law firm for a number of years
until i met Larry and Sergey that way
and ultimately came over to google so
terms of what I what I do at Google I've
actually have from the beginning had a
somewhat unusual role because its a mix
of legal legal and business roles so I'm
the chief lawyer here to the chief legal
officer so the entire legal department
reports to me as well as government
revelations we have a very really big
group all over the world that works with
governments to make sure that the right
policies are being done as we see it the
right policies are there to protect the
internet and protect Internet freedom
and so forth but i also have have
oversee a number of other groups that
that do some other things for instance
mergers and acquisitions i was kind of a
deal lawyer I did lots and lots of
mergers as a lawyer so the the mergers
group that
when google buys companies and we bought
hundreds of companies now since we went
public that team reports to me as well
as public relations communications
reports to me and then I also have a
group that several hundred people who
kind of manage all of our policies
around what kind of ads you can put up
on Google what kind of content posts you
can put on google+ you know maintains
our product policies and so forth so
it's a sort of a hybrid of legal and
business things I sit on the what we
call the L team the L stands for Larry
Page who's our CEO and it's a group of
people who run all the product groups
and then some of the business groups
like me who kind of run the company on a
day-to-day basis been a lot of things
that you know that I've you know been
working on here obviously you know from
going back to the the early days and
getting started taking our company
public we had probably one of the
biggest IPOs or initial public offerings
back in 2004 but what I spend a lot of
my time doing is really being a bit of
an ambassador for Google and working
with lots of governments around the
world people in industries around the
world it turns out that you know the
internet is an amazing thing right we
all use it it's changed all of our lives
you know you guys are all young and you
think the internet is like been around
forever but I can tell you that you know
I started as a lawyer we didn't even use
email so you know lawyers you know the
fax machine was actually the the cutting
edge technology for for our profession
and so you you know you sent faxes to
people and you're like wow that's
amazing they can get a document right
away so it's a things have changed quite
a quite a bit so I I'd say that some of
the lot of the things I do involve sort
of going to governments and explaining
to them the Internet is actually a good
thing because it turns out that give a
you know despite all of its benefits to
users like all of us
there are a lot of governments that feel
threatened by it they're also a lot of
industries that are threatened by it
yeah you know if you're in the newspaper
industry or maybe traditional media
there a lot of areas that you know even
things like you know taxis right some of
you might might have heard of a company
called uber right where you can you know
on your phone and get a car that comes
and picks you up someplace so they're
all these industries where the internet
comes in and threatens the sort of the
status quo we call that disruption in
our industry and that causes a lot of
friction and a lot of people who get
upset and you know want to figure out
what Google's up to and so I spend a lot
of my time working on some of those
issues there are some governments around
the world that don't like me very much
I'd say the number one when a number one
on that list is China I was pretty
heavily involved in in some of our
decisions we've made to limit our
presence in China because of censorship
there and their denial of free
expression to people and imprisonment of
bloggers and journalists and so forth
which which is against Google's values
and so forth so so let me so just
backing up I think it's great that
you're getting this exposure to a place
like Google you know nothing like Google
existed you know when I was coming up
and I think what we're trying to do here
is combined no a business approach to
things and sort of using the free market
to deliver great services great products
that people really want to use and using
the profit motive to continue to drive
those and build them and make better
better things and innovate and create
you know things that are going to help
the world but doing it not because not
simply because we want to make money and
because we want want the profit you know
the founders when I was are advising
them in the early days you know actually
it came to me and they said you know we
weren't we're not really sure like
whether we want to do this as a company
is a non-profit maybe it should just be
a research project at Stanford and so
forth and they decided on starting a
company because they felt that they
could build something that people would
really want to use
they could build something that could
generate a money generate profit that
could then be reinvested into building
even more things that that people would
use and that people which would would
really help people you know we thought
that you know the ability for someone
anywhere once they're connected to the
Internet to get access to the world's
information that's on the web and we've
done a number of you know we've had a
number of projects to get information
and libraries than and books and so
forth get that out on the web and
digitize that we thought that was a huge
hugely important thing you know we we
actually internationalized Google from
the beginning so very early on you could
search google in almost any language and
that we have a big commitment so that as
a result there are places where you know
in the developing world where we have no
people we have no business right but we
support those those sites and we support
those services because we think it's
really important for the world to get
access to information but we also don't
just see ourselves as an Internet
company and a technology or at least as
a software company and we don't
necessarily think we ought to just do
the things that an Internet company does
I mean we see ourselves as the
technology company and we're out
wherever we can sort of bring
interesting technology to make a big big
change we're trying to do that you may
may have seen some of the devices that
we've come out with you know we do we
work with partners through our Android
ecosystem on phones on tablets we've
built a couple of our own we have our
own machine laptops called Chromebooks
and some even more interesting things
like the Google glass project you know
which is a wearable computer repair
glass I should have brought mine
actually so you could see them so my
apologies but you know you should be
able to do everything that you can do on
your computer in a pair of glasses and
they actually work believe it or not and
we're now developers are able to get
those get their hands on them as of last
week so we're doing lots of things like
that but we also think that their their
their industries that could really use a
lot more technology
like cars you know so you know we
actually have a project for self-driving
cars that he may have heard about and
the cars actually work and they do drive
themselves and we think the future if
you really brought technology to bearing
cars you could also you you know you can
make them go faster and sound good and
so forth but you can also make them a
lot safer and ultimately you could even
you know address a lot of problems like
traffic and and so forth if you had cars
that could actually really drive
themselves and the crazy thing is that
computing has gotten to the point and
some of these technologies have gotten
to the point where that's realistic
right it's not just a crazy science
fiction idea so so a lot of the one of
the things that's most exciting about
being at Google is that their ideas that
you might think of a science fiction or
you would have thought of science
fiction a little while ago are actually
happening here that people Larry likes
to phrase called he likes to say that we
should have a healthy disregard for the
impossible and that's really true in
other words we think you know just
because someone says it can't be done
doesn't mean that if you really work
hard on it and you really aimed but you
know you you went after you thought
really big and when after the big idea
as opposed to just making a small
improvement you might fail but it's
amazing how much progress you can make
if if you just aim for the big thing and
even if you don't get the ultimate thing
along the way you might get something
that's really really amazing and really
really really changes changes a lot you
know we had a big artificial
intelligence program project many years
ago and we were just trying to work on
commuter an artificial to have a
computer try to think like a human being
and that's that's at the core of a lot
of what we do our search engine and so
forth so we continue to work on this
problem but we had a specific project to
do a few things and it didn't really
work out you know the way we had hoped
it would work out but what it what it
delivered to us was our whole ad system
right so we have you know our what
generates all of our revenue most of our
revenue
is this really really intelligent smart
ad system that driven by a bunch of
algorithms that people wrote but that
was that's what we came up with when we
failed at our at our our our artificial
intelligence project and so the result
of that is just something that's you
know been able to generate a company
that's worth you know it's the we're now
the third most valuable company in the
world so that's that's that's an example
of when you aim really really high you
might come up even if you fail you might
come up with something that's really
really important and really really good
so um they'd asked me to talk a little
bit about you know you're saying well
this is all well and good this old guy
is telling us his stories you know what
what what useful what does he have to
say that's useful to me I'm not sure I
have anything but you know I think if I
think about what you guys might be
thinking about in terms of you know
entering the workforce getting prepared
for careers and studying and you know
working hard you know I i I'm ones
people who you know if your freshman in
college you know I'm not one of those
people who thinks you need to start
thinking about when you're 18 19 20 you
know what you're going to do 20 years
from now but you can't start thinking
about the kind of you know I call it the
base of knowledge and wisdom and
experience that you can build on and
because you're going to figure out if
it's unlikely that what you think you
might want to do right now is actually
what you're going to wind up doing right
it for some from people like you know me
I thought I wanted to be a lawyer when I
was like 12 and that's what I ultimately
did but I the kind of lawyer I became
and then the the career that I've had
you know I had no idea that I would be
doing this even you know 15 years ago
maybe 20 years ago certainly had no idea
I'd be doing what I'm doing today and I
been at this for a while so I think they
the advice that I would give to you is
to you know spend
yeah yeah think about what kind of
career you might want think about the
kind of jobs that are out there you know
if you have summers to spend at actual
places whether it's in the public sector
whether it's in you know the public
interest sector whether it's in
companies and get that kind of exposure
but you're in school like most people
the one thing that a lot of people who
get out of school for a while not
everybody but a lot of people sort of
windup saying is like man I wish I could
go back to school all right because it
turns out that was actually a pretty
good time in my life because I was free
to sort of explore anything you know
that I was interested in and that's it
that is a real freedom and something
that you should really take advantage of
and so you know things like you know
language like one of the things i wish i
had done was study a lot more languages
because it turns out especially in this
globalized world that were in now that's
a really important thing it's really
important skill now uh you know you
could say this is good or bad you know
most people around the world are
starting to speak English in business
but I think that if you speak the other
language languages other than English
while you can get by with English you've
got a big advantage in a lot of places
where you can speak other languages and
I think it just makes you a better
person so that's advice that I wish
someone had given me strongly because
i'm i'm i'm sort of the normal American
you can't speak any other language but
that's an example of something where
you've got the time it's easier to do
when you're young and it's something to
sort of establish that kind of base of
of knowledge and experience for later
later on so i would spend as much time
as you can sort of pursuing the
intellectual pursuits that you really
care about and that make you that you're
interested in and it almost doesn't
matter what it is because the deeper you
go the more understanding you're going
to have about yourself about the world
it will apply later on you know I think
the vocational things you can you can do
you know you can probably you can get
that done by you know going to getting
job experience there's graduate school
because graduate school is to teach you
like that kind of stuff if you want to
be a professional you can do that too
this might not apply for technical
people and I'm not one but you know I
think it's really important to get a
real broad base of knowledge and sort of
understanding and what you're up to you
know all of you by the because of the
schools you're attending the
achievements you've you've had so far
the fact that you're you know you're
you're ahead of the game enough to
understand you know that hanging out
with places like Google might be a good
thing although suggests you guys are are
you know leaders in the making as well
they wanted me to talk a little bit
about leadership you know I think you
know there are a lot of people go around
lecturing on leadership and I'm not one
of them so I don't consider myself an
expert here but I do think that it's a
lot of link leadership takes a lot of
you know experience and you know
seniority and all those sorts of things
and to some extent that's true right I
mean experience is very hard to to
substitute for one thing is we've we've
discovered at Google is that people can
be leaders you know at a pretty young
age you know at least the company was
founded by a couple people who are like
25 at the top we've got folks who are
very young or in very senior positions
and we have people like me who are older
or in senior positions but you know I
think that you know a lot of leadership
has a lot more to do with communication
and listening and you know at a place
like Google creativity and being able to
collaborate with people and and get them
going in the same direction because
you know of your example and so forth I
think it helps a lot when you're you
know ultimately you got a lot of
experience under under your belt but you
shouldn't assume that because you're
young you know you can't by taking the
initiative and pushing something that
you care about a lot that you can't get
other folks to go with you so I'd really
like to hear from you guys actually
because I'm even getting tired of
hearing myself so what do you guys
understand there's some prepare
questions and then maybe we'll have some
some other ones little more spontaneous
and have a little more give and take
chasity Chad what have you got thanks
David come on there's actually one
question that comes from a viewer online
it comes from AJ in Vancouver Washington
and he wants to know what's a typical
day in the life of a chief legal officer
yeah well that's a good one there not a
lot of the typical days around here but
you know a lot of times we spend a lot
of time in meetings sort of figuring out
issue you know strategy issues sort of
what we you know in the senior team
trying to figure out what what what's
our next step in in different areas you
know for me many days I arrived to some
sort of crisis so you know arriving
someone says hey there's this video
that's up on YouTube and some people are
writing about it someplace in the world
and we have to decide you know do we
take it down do we leave it up and make
a decision like that or there's a
there's a demonstration outside our
office in in Mumbai in India because
they're upset about some posts that was
on Google+ that was offended
sensibilities or religion or political
persuasion so forth so in my day I a lot
of my days start with some kind of a
crisis that's it that's going on in
somewhere
somewhere around the world involved in
Google and one of our one of our
services but then we spend that we spend
the you know we try to spend a fair
amount of time stepping back and
thinking about you know what we're doing
as a company and you know I've you know
lots of deals that we work on so we
spend a lot of time figuring out who it
is we want to partner with what
companies we might want to think about
buying and so forth but but a lot a lot
of crises for me next question so we're
going to take a few questions over here
from the holler students and we're going
to start with how many more so tell me
well give even everybody my name is Tom
Nick Moore I'm a freshman management
major from Virginia Beach Virginia and
i'm representing our university school
of business today our question was well
we know that you said that you always
wanted to be a lawyer at the age of 12
how has your career choice changed from
your freshman year in college until now
it has a change impact um no it's good
question yet I think as I said I thought
lawyers just went in the courtroom and
you know in did trials that turns out
that most lawyers in private practice
certainly ones that work in big law
firms never go to trial even if they're
litigators i discovered that and that
discovered that that in general the the
litigation stuff wasn't for me and so
what I would i well i still felt you
know I really was interested in the law
and legal topics you know I chose a form
of law law that never causes me to go to
court although I have to supervise the
people who do and in and cause me to
because of that it caused me to go off
in a business sort of track as well
right so I'm sort of a business person
working on issues that have nothing to
do with law and a lot of the a lot of
what I do and so that's that's been
that's been different I think that that
that's not a sort of what I expected
right
expected to sort of be a lawyer my
entire career into sort of advise
clients now I have lawyers advising me
which is a not something that I expected
to happen nice question my question is
what moment in your life had the base
impact on altering your trajectory to
work great work today career-wise
probably meeting Larry and Sergey to be
honest because I they were you know I
worked with a lot of pretty amazing
clients and amazing companies some of
which started up you know very small on
became very big but I don't think any of
them sort of had the ambition that that
Google had from the beginning that the
founders of Google had and I think you
know they people always say you know
it's better to be lucky than good or to
be in the right place at the right time
but you know I well I think I prepared
myself for that moment right I was in
the right place because I had worked
very hard and you know and paid my dues
and you know made partner at a big law
firm and done all those kinds of things
it's still kind of amazing what you know
some of these you know that that that
kind of a chance in some ways chance
encounter could create because i think
that the what what they started and what
we're carrying on here at Google is
truly unique I think it's unique in sort
of not only among you know in terms of
companies that are out there today but
even historically and he's very hard to
find a company that's been driven to the
extent that we are x values around
information about having a positive
impact on the world and you know we you
hear people say this sometimes and you
know you have to be a little bit
skeptical and I'm always skeptical
but I think it's really true that you
know most people at Google don't get up
to sort of come to work because just you
know everybody you know I just got to
eat but um so yeah you know it's good to
get paid but i think a lot you know so
many people come here because we are
doing things that are big we're doing
things that are having a big impact on
the world to the good and we have the
potential to do far far more so i think
in terms of you know what has you know
affected my trajectory the most it's
probably been you know hooking up with
these guys from google and i think that
as a result you know I've had
opportunities to do other things go into
government and so forth you know I
actually think that I have a bigger
impact on the world being at Google
believe it or not because of the things
that were involved in the fact that
we're global and the fact that you know
I think we're still we have so much more
to do no Larry and Sergey I still think
you know if you ask them how good our
you know our search is and how good you
know our services are though they'll
tell you that we have a lot of work to
do like there were only we've only
scratched the surface of what we should
be able to do and so so I think that's
probably my biggest professional moment
sure next question hello mr. Drummond's
hello everybody my name is Lindsay
Burdge oh and I'm a current freshman at
Spelman College that is my name is Blake
bed but another los angeles calif oh and
i was wondering how's your location in
California influence both your work
ethics and diversity of thought um yeah
good question you know a lot of people
studying Silicon Valley of sort of try
to figure out what's the secret sauce
you know why is it that this stuff is
going on in Silicon Valley and and not
else not not to the same extent in some
places and I'm in California I'm you're
a Californian so I mean you you you it
sounds like you've grown up here and you
know what it's it's like but
it has been a it is a more open place
culture culturally in a lot of ways the
this has been a diverse place for you
know since humans have inhabited you
know where the least next to the Native
Americans since it was sort of settled
by by folks other than the Native
Americans it's been a diverse place in
an interesting place you know when it
was part of Spain when it's part of
Mexico and you know I think people have
come here for opportunity for a long
long time right and as cause people to
come from the West from the east and to
all be here looking for something
different and you know when you get here
you don't tend you know the lot of
people have left behind you know the
sort of whatever the social you know
structure was and some of the
restrictions that might have been on
them wherever they came from and while
you know California has never been
perfect and you know everything that
exists everywhere else exists here
whether it's racism whether it's you
know it's bigotry its people being
intolerant and so forth I think there's
been more open sort of mindset about
things a little more tolerance and a
little more creativity and so some
people say it's the weather and you know
when you don't have to worry about the
weather maybe you can think about all
these crazy things I think there's
probably something to that but I think a
lot of it does have to do with the fact
you have people have been attracted here
in part because of the weather but also
because things got established whether
it was you know the tech sector got
built here Hollywood got built here and
it's over so it's just attracted a lot
of creative types who have then made
their mark on everybody else and so you
know even you know boring lawyers like
me can get to participate in some of
these things that potentially our world
changing but it's a it that's not a
question we hear every day but it's
actually really important because I
think that's a big part of why silicon
valley is what it is because it's here
one of the things I do is actually we
have a program where we're trying to
support entrepreneurship and tech
entrepreneurship all around the world
and so we we work with entrepreneurs and
startup companies all around the world
and they often ask this question or
they're trying to figure out how to do
it and I don't think it's you can only
do it in California but I think you're
putting your finger on one of the things
that's that that needs to be there you
know wherever you are in the world
thanks thanks a lot guys those are great
questions and thank you David we're now
going to flip it back over to Atlanta
for some more questions all right
questions from Atlanta good evening mr
Turner hi everybody my name is Cindy
virtual and I'm a current freshman at
Spelman College my question for you is
what's up what's one of the biggest
risks you take it in your career and how
did it end up working out Wow um what's
funny is probably the same answer as as
the other answer about what was a
pivotal moment right and that that that
makes sense because taking risks you
know hopefully that you know risk means
taking greater risk means greater reward
right if it works out and also can you
know it you know a worked out come if it
doesn't work out but i think you know
google at the time was when i when i
joined was still pretty small and it
wasn't clear that you know how we were
going to ultimately make money and I was
you know at a you know a big law firm
that was gonna be no it's always going
to be around right and it's pretty
secure place and decided to join a
company and you know this wasn't Google
by the time I joined it wasn't like a
little bitty startup but it was few you
know about 150 people and and still had
a lot to prove so that was a you know I
think a risk that I took and it's worked
out pretty well good evening mr.
gentleman and night everybody hu my name
is Don Miguel I'm a freshman economics
major at Morehouse from Columbia
Maryland my question is how can we
ensure we aren't afraid to take
advantage
uship opportunities despite our
classification just by your
classification what wrestling freshman
alloys freshman yes sir oh uh well just
don't listen to people who say you can't
do something no I seriously I did you
know look when you're when you're a
freshman there's a lot you know you're
just starting out in college you know I
know there's a lot to learn a lot to
adjust to and so forth but you know you
also you know it's about the quality of
your ideas and you shouldn't I think one
of the things that's important to do is
not be afraid to be wrong right and sort
of be afraid to be told you're asking it
I think that's one of the benefits right
of being young right is you can kind of
like beep be bold and then chalk it up
to well I'm just young right well it
turns out that you're wrong like I can't
do that anymore right I mean that's a i
wish i could but i think there's just a
you know obviously you don't want to be
brash and and and and stupid but you
know I think there's no there's no older
people have no monopoly on fresh
thoughts interesting thoughts important
thoughts and important important ideas
about how to do things and so I think
it's you know just having the courage to
go do it and to go say these things and
not hold back is the most important
thing and I think you'll find that you
know that you're there the ratio of good
things good ideas to not so good ideas
that might come from you might not be
much different than some people who are
older than you so a lot of us have kind
of crazy ideas that don't don't don't
make a lot of sense and I'm sure all of
you do too but you brought you have a
lot of good ones so don't be afraid to
share hey Turk
good evening mr. drunk my name is Ivan
gasps miles college freshman do agree
engineering major from the north end to
Seattle watched my question is okay my
question is in spirit of leadership what
do you think is the person's most
defining characteristic what is
something that you all that Google
really look for as far as personality
traits when when hiring just in general
yeah i mean the great question you know
i think so hard when answer we uh we use
this term around here that I'm not sure
most Googlers can even really define but
it's called googliness and I think we
have 30,000 people and you would
probably get about 30,000 answers about
what it actually it actually means but
you know for me it's it's it comes down
to humility and being collaborative and
being willing to work with other folks
and while at the same time having you
know courage of your convictions rewrite
and being willing to speak up and to
really really being able to challenge
orthodoxies or you know the hierarchy or
the established power so and that might
seem odd but I think what it leaders
that that do well here are people who
aren't threatened by that right so if
you have a culture of people who are
willing to question but who also are
willing to listen and then you have
leaders in people who get in and people
who we think could be leaders are people
get really good at that right who who
don't expect that because they're in a
management position no one's ever going
to question anything that they say and
you know we have a thing every week it
used to be it's called TG tgif thing cuz
friday although we change it to thursday
and it still tgif but it's another topic
but uh you know and at that meeting
Larry and Sergey I stand up before the
company and all the people here in
Mountain View and then we pipe it into
from all the other offices
where people are still awake and you
know people can stand up and first of
all they submit questions online and and
then some in the room and a lot of times
they're very aggressive questions right
and so you're looking at people who know
two people who are about a successful in
the business world that you could
possibly be who stand up and you know
sort of like Prime Minister's question
time in England where you know people
ask them very aggressive questions at
something some some cases and and that's
important so I'd say this you know
googliness has a lot to do with yeah
you're smart yes you know you've you've
shown that you've been able to achieve
things but you're you're still willing
to collaborate with people and you're
still being willing to be to challenge
and to be challenged hey sure hello
Annabelle Flair I'm a freshman at
spelman college or my questions for you
as the chief legal office of someone at
your company what words of wisdoms you
have for students who are on not
necessarily aiming for your position but
who wants to follow in your footsteps
who want to be lawyers lawyers and like
a chief legal officer working with the
company so not necessarily in court but
just having a big yeah yeah no I mean I
think early on it's it's get the best
foundation you you can write and spent
put in the time you know I think that
one of the things i think i did in law
school is I wasn't I don't know either
focused enough or driven enough to sort
of pick you know one single area of law
and then and you know hone in on that
and spend all of my time on that and get
have all of my jobs you know my summer
jobs that all internships all of that be
focused on this one area I was really
more of a generalist and it might have
been just because i was lazy um but it
could have but i but i also think that
there's a real
importance to especially in the world I
live in to being a generalist and the
the world industries tend to try to get
people to specialize nowadays but you
know if you if you want to wind up in a
place where you're being asked and the
value your you hope you're being asked
to add 2 to an enterprise these sort of
judgment about things it helps to have
been exposed to lots of different things
it helps to be to have an understanding
even though it's not super super deep
but an understanding of a lot of
different areas right and a lot of
different perspectives that might come
into making you know particular City and
that's that and that's a lot of what
judgment is about so if you're trying to
you know you're different we are all
kinds of ways to add value right two
places and it could be because you're
the world's best expert in something
right some topic but sometimes it's
because you you can look you can you
know assess a situation get a set of
facts get a set of opinions get some
data on something and sort of put that
together and kind of make a judgment
about it that more often than not turns
out to be right and there's a lot of
value in that too and I think getting
prepared for that kind of a role I think
means trying to be as much as you can a
generalist and being interested in a lot
of things and being knowledgeable about
a lot of things thank you sure all right
well David thank you so much for taking
time out of your really busy schedule to
talk candidly with us and answer our
questions we'd really appreciate it I
also want to thank the students at
Howard who joined chat in the DC office
and the students here in Atlanta ok and
join me tonight and also those of you
who are watching online we really
appreciate it that concludes our hangout
on air tonight until next time thanks
