communications team at Google Anna as a
google start associate last time Toto
interviewed me and I'm going to
interview Jackie who's one of my friends
in the Start program yeah hey everyone
my name is Jackie I was started socially
as well i'm now in sales here in
Mountain View and a little background I
grew up in Macon Georgia and I went to
school at Harvard University now I got
two senators I'm from Kentucky lunch at
Cornell up in New York furby south yeah
cool so our first question is how would
you describe the google Start program so
I kind of waited on this last time I
know you know you did excellent job um
as nexus 8 it basically like an entry
level you know associate program for
four people just exiting college and
looking for entry-level position into a
technology business like Google um it
covers a huge amount of departments on
alert from sales marketing to people
operations and human resources so if
you're looking for any of that none
technical non-engineering work work I'm
sorry career path then Google Start
programs up like some place to start
yeah it's a great community too
absolutely so I'm our next question is
from jazzy and Kolkata and they asked
how and why did you become a google
start associate oh well um how and why I
guess the hell first think I started off
as a poem in the bowl program you know
meg and I were both boulders um 2008
guys right and so after that summer ice
had a great time thanks to the bold
program like phenomenal time and
absolutely love google and i decided
that i wanted to work here and that at
the time i converted you know with legal
process and now i say i'm here yeah yeah
pretty smooth transition there so what
position within the Start program did
you participate in
question from MJ back in Washington oh
great thanks Kim Jae um well I worked
with talent outreach programs which does
two things on one it recruits great
talent for google they've been doing a
great job about that and secondly it is
outreach to find a versatile because we
need you know everyone included Google
and so then tops or talent outreach
programs as it's known um I did a few
projects you know I worked with
University programs which is part of
tops which recruits for universities and
managers relationships with our colleges
around the United States and there you
know I work with in with resumes and our
batch interview days etc etc secondly i
did some facebook work so i helped
launch the facebook com that such Google
students page yeah that's we got your
question so awesome yeah and a couple of
the projects but that gives you you know
the gist of it yeah so sandra and rhode
island asks what was one of the
highlights of your experiences start
associate oh yeah so many yeah there are
a ton Oh Megan I were in this
development series and start program
typically has that his monday wednesdays
right three hours in afternoon but on
one day particularly we went to on the
Boys and Girls Club each Palo Alto and
we have just like field day with the six
seven and eight-year-old errs and it's
just like like I don't hang your own
tips on a normal but I was kind of like
you know shocked about it but we just
had like and now so black like all
starters and all of these like 40 of
these kids running around like on teens
and it was just like absolutely
phenomenal in like it's just a bonding
experience that I haven't see I've had a
long time so that's definitely a
highlight that held up and remember for
a long time that's great so how much
training would you say is
this program is it more like a job or
some work like an educational process is
and that's a question from Amy in
Chicago well Amy I say it's somewhat of
a hybrid of the two um you definitely
had your job that you're expected to do
when they do friday um in addition to
that there's some training where the
developmental series um that I told you
that's like six hours a week and there
um I think we have like workshops and
directors and we had some more senior
people come in and talk to us just about
you know the do's and don'ts of their
past careers right lessons they learned
some really funny stuff came out of it
oh absolutely yeah some very
inspirational things come out of it
definitely steered my career turned to a
new level so aiming for new levels and
aiming for higher achievement but I got
out of it so I'm Brendan in Texas was
asking what the best advice you have is
to get accepted into the Start program
oh well well Brandon I gotta say I'm a
little biased because I come those ills
work and so I definitely say that the
Divas way of getting to Google it's
full-on like selling yourself selling
like your skills you're strong you're
strong appointing so we can says selling
them all and creating this complete
picture of you watch you on what you can
bring an added value to for Google and
so um you know work on that and I'm
pretty sure you can make it through them
nice yeah it's important once you get
into the company as well just to be able
to influence people because everyone has
so much stuff going on that you need to
be able to get people behind your causes
yeah absolutely dead on deck yeah is it
very valuable it's guilty now nice so um
have you ever found yourself and a
totally Andy Sachs from the devil wears
prada situation or river encountered
your own Miranda Priestly here at Google
that's a question from Laura in Italy
Laura oh yeah I saw the movie i guess
the I i I've known a Miranda Priestly
here yeah that's not very googley thing
yeah I'm going back to Brenda that's
another way don't be Miranda Priestly I
gonna find a googliness in yourself and
so um what is good I don't know this is
non auntie miranda I'd say just the
opposite thing open accepting and really
approachable and hard working at the
same time but yeah not over serving
yourself instantly yeah teamwork a
teacher I think being able to work with
people and help each other out when
someone stressed out you know step in
there and help me get the job done
you're good on cool so those are all our
