watching yet don't worry
okay so let's go ahead and get started
hi everyone who's watching my name is
Jessica I help run the Google students
page are found conveniently since you're
watching this hangout and I'm here today
with a few students who in turn is a
part of our summer training engineering
program at some of our offices in Europe
last summer and I'm also joined by the
program manager so each of them are
gonna introduce themselves let them know
let you guys know sort of what they do
and then we'll go through what the
program is all about and you'll be able
to hear first-hand what their
experiences were like so let's start
with Farah who helps run the program hi
everyone my name is Farah I'm based in
the London office
I'm program manager for the step program
this is our second year running it so
we're pretty excited we encourage
everyone to apply and you can do so at
google.com slash students slash DEP okay
and Catalina why don't you kick us off
with hi everyone I'm Catalina I go to
Edinburgh University in Scotland and
this summer I was in London office and
you wanna oh hello my name is Johanna
I'm from pour Technical University from
Bucharest and I was based in rural
London and it was a great experience
great I'm ISA I'm either I study any
regular university in Poland and last
summer I was working in group Krakow in
Poland as well last but not least
Mariana hi everyone I'm Mariana I go to
Polytechnical University of Bucharest
and last year I did an internship in
London office and worked in G+ local
team great so for those who probably
don't know much about the program
because it is relatively new why don't
we hear from Farah who can give us sort
of the ins and outs of what the program
is all about what the eligibility
requirements are when they need to apply
all that fun stuff yeah absolutely so
this program is designed for first and
second year students it's for to
encourage our younger students to apply
to us
you need to be a first or a second year
student studying CS or a related degree
graduating in 2015 and beyond the
criteria is generally that you're
interested and excited and can work with
us between the 1st of July until the
20th of September 2013 the 12-week
internship the locations will be in
London Munich Krakow and Zurich this
year so any of those four locations and
the deadline is the 28th of December so
its upcoming you have three weeks left
just enough time to fill out your
application and for those students who
are wondering about okay I'm a first or
second year student I don't have any
internship experience what sort of
background are you looking for from
these students when they apply since
they are younger in their careers yep
we're looking for basically students who
are really passionate and excited about
computer science you don't have to have
tons of experience so we don't expect
you to have done any internship before
at all but it would be great if you've
got a little bit of outside interests
such as open source projects or maybe
have designed an app want to further
this kind of skill and knowledge and
what that with Google so we don't expect
a lot of experience but we'd love it if
you have the passion and you want to
learn a Google great okay so let's now
talk to some of the step interns
themselves Catalina could you talk a
little bit about maybe why you applied
for the program what made you interested
well when I saw the description of the
program I thought that it will be great
to give be given this opportunity to
work on a project by myself
of course I had a manager and I had all
the Googlers around to help me then I
was also offered a mentor so if I had
something that was not related to my
project I could go to him and then what
finally pushed me it was the fact that I
had nothing to lose only to gain so
that's great advice and anyone also have
insights on maybe what made them
interested in a fine
well um I would say that I always wanted
to work for Google infant from my first
year but I think I never really thought
that I could do it so when I heard about
the the program that was designed for
first and second year students I said
why not I should give it a try
and so I lied and it worked out really
really fine
that's great great advice for both of
you maybe II said could you talk about
what the interview process was like
since I think a lot of students that
would be the one thing that would
probably be really intimidating would be
what is this interview process like if
I'm first or second year student very
early in my education yes many people
worry about it but actually for me it
was more fun you get two phone
interviews and you have to answer the
algorithmic questions and technical
programming questions in real time
writing the answers in an online
document and some people might think
that
there may be two advance but I think it
was very nice it was a nice experience
and wasn't scary at all
and then afterwards after you're done
with this interviews they know what your
strong sights are and they start
matching you with possible hosts and
possible projects so that you will be
happy and the house will be happy and
everyone will be happy and you are ready
to start your adventure with Google cool
so it sounds like it wasn't too scary to
go through no it was amazing
ok so you want to let's say you got
through the interview process you've got
a project you're working with a manager
you have a mentor what sort of things
are you working on during your
internship where there are too many
things that I won't talk about i would i
would like to start talking about my
first day at Google which was very
special for me because in the morning I
do find an induction and then I had
opportunity to meet other interns and
other full timers and take the lunch
together also I found out more
information what what means to be a
Googler and what are the opportunities
but also what are the obligations and I
discover where is the gym in the second
day I in the second day the manager
introduced me to the team and he told me
more about the project and about the
team and he gave me some tutorials to
read tutorials which work which were
regarded to the project and during two
weeks I tried to learn as much as
possible from those tutorials and I try
to get used with all the team with the
office and with other colleagues and
when I thought that I was ready are you
talk with my manager and he gave me the
project and I really liked the idea of
the project and I realized that a simple
problem may have whoo-hooo some as a
small problem can affect the whole
project if I don't take in consideration
and after a few days I semi-major my
first lines of code and he explained me
why my solution
will not work properly and instead being
disappointed I was looking around for
another idea I was talking with other
interns and finally I find a solution
which could fit in my to my problem and
I know with the fact that I can go to
ask other people and to I can ask other
people is very very helpful helpful cool
so basically just to sort of jump in
excuse me I wanna just to say that this
is an internship but it is also a
training program so you will get the
first two weeks or maybe one week to two
weeks of self-study as well so an
opportunity to really kind of learn and
maybe catch up on some of the
technologies that you will use before
the actual you know before you're
expected to kind of dive in and and do
coding straightaway so you will be
expected to code but you will be
supported and have learning materials as
well whilst you're here and it sounds
like from what do you want I was saying
there's a lot of support not only from
your manager but from a mentor that
you're matched up with from other
interns so you're obviously not the only
intern in the office you have other
other interns who are supporting you as
well so you can there's so many
resources that you can and reach out to
you to get support on your projects yes
this actual internship we are trying to
have two interns to one project two or
three so you will get support from
another step intern as well so you can
learn together and be productive
together I think that works well yeah
definitely so I think that leads us to a
good next topic so Mariana could you
talk to us about what do interns do
besides code so we heard that you wanted
did a lot of coding which is great what
else do they get to work on Oh lots lots
of lots of stuff for instance you have
access to a lot of things and all the
code behind Google and that's that was
like really really amazing you also get
to be part of classes tutorials and
training's that teaches you things that
are used inside Google and not only and
as Yana and Farah said in the first days
in first weeks you're like a sponge
absorbing all sorts of information you
also have a mentor and you can ask him
like anything whether it's your project
related or just general Google info that
you want to find out I think you also do
lots of socializing you get to meet
really really interesting people and
find out what projects they're working
on and it was like it was really really
good for me to expand my horizons and
find out lots of stuff lots of learning
it sounds like yeah and what you think
is true for all of the internships at
Google you're thrown in and you get to
learn a lot of stuff while you're here
yep uh so the next question we have is
what did you learn so Catalina can you
talk a bit about this oh we can't hear
you try again okay can you hear now yep
okay I've learned a lot of stuff and
there were a few different levels in
which I expanded so first of all
technical my Java became much stronger
but I also briefly touched with other
technologies such as dependency
injection and HTML and CSS to give my
project a bit of a front for its users I
was working on an internal project so I
won't be telling you what it's about a
semi technical skill that I've learned
is the software engineering side of it
so name your variables right and make
sure your code is readable and comment
your code because it it's very important
to have readable code I was studying
other people's code and it made it so
much easier to have the comments and
last but not least I did expand on a
personal level I've learned to have fun
as well because I tend to
cuz too much of my projects and people
had to literally pull me from my
computer and then I also learned to ask
for help because again I tried to find
the solution by myself but then having
someone to help could get you to the
answer faster doesn't mean you can't get
to the answer yourself but it saves you
a lot of time and you still learn in the
process so yeah that's what I've learned
this summer that's a lot of stuff does
anyone else have I could highlight
something that they learned that maybe
they weren't expecting to learn it's too
much to probably think about in one
sitting
okay what about either when would you
recommend the students apply if they're
interested I would say they should apply
as soon as possible so that they can
have their interviews done as quickly as
possible and then the matching can begin
because if they apply to too late even
if they're really really good at all the
nice projects might be already taken so
don't wait and be brave and apply as
soon as possible that's good advice just
to chip in on that not all the exciting
projects in part we still have plenty
available because I'm looking at them
every single day so one thing that we
didn't have in the list of questions but
I don't know if anyone has insight what
did you do to prepare for your interview
that you could that you could tell
students that maybe would help them even
in just technical interviews in general
where there's certain things you did
that really helped you prepare I think I
could say in a few words I did a mock
interview I found a friend who could
help me and we did a hangout and talked
in English and it it helped me prepare
he gave me like two questions two
technical questions and showed me what I
should improve on before the interview
and I think that that's a good thing to
do and also exercise your algorithm
skills and get a pen and a paper and try
to stuff them don't use the computer yes
because I believe for the interviews
you're rewriting your code down you're
not getting to do shortened
yeah exactly you don't you don't have
fun either or IV or something like that
to autocomplete your code so it's best
if you know exactly what are you going
to write good advice anyone else I would
also like to add to for students I know
that website is a top coder to go and do
problems there there are other resources
and competitions for high school
students which help you prepare to get
creative about your solutions
there's the USA computer Olympiad
website they also have a training
section and they teach to a lot of stuff
in Romania there is something called in
for Anna but I can't recommend you to go
there because everything is in Romanian
but you know what I mean yeah good
advice anyone else if I might ship and I
have some technical pointers yes yes so
because it's a phone interview and you
have to answer and an online document
and a Google document now make sure the
battery on your phone is not dying
because if it's complete disaster so
make sure the battery is full that you
have nice mobile reception so it doesn't
break and maybe get a headset because
it's very useful that you can use your
hands to code and let you hold a mobile
phone next to your ear
very good logistical advice for anyone
interviewing I think ok any other pieces
of wisdom for interviewing for students
are we good I think that was all really
good one more relax
no the interviews are really really fun
I tend to panic like a minute before
anything but then as soon as it started
and there's an icebreaker so yeah they
interviewer I guess it's not wrong for
me to say they'll ask you what are your
interest and then you get to talk about
something you are passionate about maybe
a project you've been working on and it
kind of makes you relaxed so yeah and
that's definitely good to be able to
know what projects you are passionate
about and to be able to speak about them
to an interviewer so that they know sort
of why
you're interested in the internship in
the first place okay so what let's hear
from you guys what are what are your
next plans so you did step last summer
what's what's next for you Catalina what
are you doing well next time I'm going
to Munich to Germany and I'll be working
on an internal tool again so I can't
tell you what I'll be working on but it
will be fun all Googlers will be using
it oh yeah well hey that's huge impact
then you wanna well hi I will return in
London and I will be in the edge team
and for another moment I don't know
exactly what I will do but from what I
thought if my manager will be fine the
important part and is that I'm in the
middle of reputation right now with the
application process
I'm talking with three possible hosts in
Mountain View California so hopefully
one of them will choose me yeah and then
you can visit me in California yes and
Mariana I'm also doing the recruiting
process for New York and I'm also in the
host matching part so I'm waiting also
for a response from the host great so
any before we sign off any last pieces
of advice words of wisdom that you could
share with the broader student
population who might be interested in
this again be brave don't talk yourself
out of it you know worst thing that
could happen is you won't get the
program but the same will happen if you
don't apply exactly Farah do you have
something or do you want to you can
finish up the whole thing we'll let you
save your words of wisdom for last what
about you wanna I want to say them that
to be their self and not to be afraid
because people they are very friendly
and they will have a great experience
and they learn a lot of things and they
will really understand what means to be
part of a team and to to be a piece just
really mad and which really mattering in
this project
so mr. Issa well I would like we say the
same thing as you want to basically we
pray try to apply and even if you don't
succeed it's still a nice adventure
you're going through the reputation
process and everything and if you do
succeed in well the whole world is open
to you you get to do whatever you want
and go go so one way well that's worth
it it's worth drawing Mariana the girls
expanded a little bit I'll be a
sixteenth and I'll just tell the
prospects okay and Farah what about your
last words of wisdom or reminders so I I
don't think I can add to anyone else I
think just hearing it from the horse's
mouth is to make the best advice but
from my perspective I would say just
apply now you've got a few weeks left
I'll be screening all applications I'll
be sure to get in touch with you if I
think you're suitable and I'll help you
through the process
great well thank you for everyone who
joined us today hopefully you all
learned a bit more about the program got
to hear from some of these interns
firsthand and don't forget to apply the
application is available at google.com
slash students slash step and we'll talk
to you soon thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
