that I did I google actually happened in
my first month of the at the company
this was right around the time when
gmail had just launched and one evening
when I came home my wife who was using
gmail showed me a problem that she was
having with her account at the time I
didn't work on the gmail project but the
next day i happened to be speaking to
one of the gmail engineers and i spoke
to them about the problem and he told me
that i can just use my twenty percent
time to actually fix the problem and he
pointed me at their code and within a
few hours i had the gmail server running
on my machine which was kind of exciting
because I'd been in previous companies
and in a lot of places you just don't
have that much flexibility as an
engineer to just go work on something
else while your project is in a
different area within the company so
within a couple of hours I had you know
the problem fixed and I sent it out for
code reviews and it was checked in a day
or two later and a week or so it was out
actually in production and you know I
was quite surprised that you know
someone new to the company could
actually you know make a change in in an
area or a product that's actually not
related to them but I really liked about
that experience was that any engineer
can go and actually work on anything
that he or she may want and since that
time I've actually done things like this
for a few other projects at Google and
it's always been very very rewarding for
me to actually go and do something that
I'm passionate about my name is reza bev
loose and i'm an engineer in the seattle
