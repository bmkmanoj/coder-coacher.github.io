YouTube live session first thing please
go to the RSVP link and fill out the
form if you are watching a recording you
don't need to worry about that just you
know sit back and enjoy the show and we
have a chat make sure you go and engage
in the chat we have chat moderators
which will answer your questions and you
want this to be as interactive as
possible so feel free to use the chat as
we go all right so I am Pierre st. juste
I am a software engineer at Google I've
been at Google for about a year and a
half I work on the Google assistant for
Android so if you have a bit surf on and
you say okay what time is it I help make
that happen and I am here because I do a
lot of recruiting events I've been to
different different schools I do a lot
of interviews and I'm really excited
about you know sharing some of my wisdom
I'm about to process yeah hi my name is
Jonathan Drake I'm also a software
engineer and I work on the search
ranking team I'm also involved in
university recruiting and been in Google
for a little over two and a half years
and for a lot of that I've been doing
about one interview a week interviewing
new candidates and I think this will be
Mike week of my 50th interview so hey
everyone my name is Lauren long and I'm
also a software engineer I work on
firebase as a developer product I've
been in the San Francisco office for
eight months now so I've recently gone
through the recruiting process and
looking forward to talking to you more
about that today all right so um I'm
gonna tell you a little bit about your
interview experience here as a full time
candidate so let me just sort of explain
the way we have this process set up the
first step is to complete a coding
sample and survey your your job is to
send us a of you writing good nice code
this is an online thing that you'll
complete I think you have about an hour
to do it you're not allowed to use
outside resources the point is just to
sort
show us that you can write good coat and
then assuming that goes well then you
have a couple of phone interviews
usually two maybe three and these are
done over at Google Doc and you'll
you'll write code in this Google Doc
fighting a little formatting the point
is to show us that you you know what you
mean well enough to even do it in a
Google Doc and this will be followed up
by coming to a Google office to do
on-site interviews so over the course of
a day starting in the morning having
lunch going to afternoon you'll have
about three to four interviews these are
each about 45 minutes in length you have
a little bit of time between to ask
questions to your interviewers it's as
much a time for you to get to know us as
it it's a time for us to get to know you
and in that process I I'd say try to
have fun
each interview is independent not only
from each other but like from your phone
interviews and your coding and
assessment it's all it's all separate
the idea is to get a bunch of different
opinions to allow no one bad or
especially good experience either just
sort of mess up you know anything
overall we want to have a nice
well-rounded understanding and that's
kind of how the on set process goes
after that your your interview packet
all this information and aggregate goes
to a separate group of people who review
it and this committee decides whether or
not to hire you at which level and
hopefully then you get your offer after
that I think that's all for that
so one thing that we wanted to address
is how you communicate during this
interview and you know you you might be
doing some practice questions might be
learn a lot of technical things but you
also want to focus on ensuring that you
communicate and present during your
yourself effectively during this process
so here's my cover that a bit more so
right so how do you do this the way you
do this is we want to see how the
candidate analyzes the problem and what
this means is one very easy trick is
when you get the question you you give
the naive solution first right so you
said okay this is the problem
one very basic way to do it is to solve
it this way so that way you kind of run
out of the game you give the interviewer
an understanding that you you see how to
approach the problem and you know how to
solve it it's also very important to
talk about edge cases and we talk about
edge cases you're demonstrating that you
have some maturity with with with
writing code so you know are you just
are you gonna get no inputs right empty
strings are whatever the different
corner cases are and that's something
you want to handle first when you start
writing your code you know right at the
very beginning you can do your edge
cases right that's very important and
once again as you as you go through the
process of first having a naive the
naive approach then you can start more
methodically talking about the different
ways to think about the problem to sort
the issue right so we spend a lot of
time looking at making sure you
understand the fundamental programming
concepts do you know the right data
structures to use do you understand
algorithmic complexity right and do you
have you know proficiency in that
particular language that you're using
the main goal of the interview is to get
you to have working code at the end so
the interviewer what the interviewer
tries to do is help you along the way
right make sure you have proper
comprehension and gives you you know the
right guidance to make sure you have
working solution another piece that's
extremely important is is the code easy
to read a lot of the solutions that were
looking for in many cases you can write
in about 34 lines of code and is it
something that
interviewee look I don't understand if
the code is getting too complex and it's
hard to even read a lieutenant a lot of
unnecessary variables and things like
they going on just cluttering the
solution then that's a sign that maybe
you don't have a clear idea of that
distribution could be and finally
whenever as you know as you're writing
code I would say every ten minutes or so
make sure you were iterate what you're
trying to do make sure you say okay this
is the overall idea I'm trying to make
and I'm at step this is the step that I
am and to make sure that the interviewer
is always following you understand how
you're presenting so that is very
important and on that Google students
YouTube channel here there's there's
resources out there to help you for
example there's a video called applying
to Google how to pace the technical
interview and that that's another
resource for you to see how to sort of
go about this process and not not be
intimidated by it and learn lots of good
skills for for doing well I want to talk
a little bit about the phone interviews
in particular so you might be especially
nervous about these these are on the
phone and I have to see your interviewer
but here are some tips to ensure that
you make the most of this interview as
well at first is we do use Google Doc
for you to show your code to your
interviewer so some things we do before
you even hop on the phone is changing
your font to something readable courier
new is one that we would recommend
reduce the size so that you can fit more
code into one screen you also want to be
turning off spell check autocorrect so
that while you're coding you're not
getting your variable names corrected to
a different spellings so that's very
important and some things I always like
to do before phone interviews I like to
have a cup of tea and a cup of water
nearby and that ensures that my voice
stays and smooth and that I'm because I
notice my nervous I tend to crack up to
my voice so that happens - - you don't
want to be sounding like Darth Vader on
the phone so that won't be making for a
very pleasant interview a experience as
I'm sure that you've got what you need
for you to feel relaxed you want to
ensure that you're in a quiet room if
you live with roommates tell them that
you're going on a phone interview make
sure you ever reliable Wi-Fi
I charge your phone charger computer use
a headset if possible and found that was
better than holding up the phone because
my hands were free so those are just
some tips to get you more comfortable
with the setting other things you want
to ensure is because you're on the phone
you're not able to communicate as much
and by by drawing out the board for
example so you want to make use of
things like commenting within the the
code to tell your interviewer exactly
what you're doing you also want to just
for your own sake have some paper and
pen nearby so you can jot down ideas or
going going forward maybe write down
things you want to come back to to
remind yourself and we have one to
appear at using copy and paste and what
we mean by that is sometimes they'll be
asked to a solution and then improve on
it for another iteration don't delete
the previous solution first of all and
don't rewrite it because that takes up
time you are very welcome to just copy
your previous solution into a new page
and improve upon that and finally the
most important thing is to ensure that
you are really thinking out loud and
communicating and if you need a moment
to think make sure you tell your
interviewer because they can't see you
in person and you suddenly go silent on
the phone they might think that
connection has cut off so make sure you
just communicate and a lot more than you
would be if you're in person yeah and a
few more tips I think that are sort of
based on situations that you can easily
avoid are you know when you when you
first walk into the interview or when
you first pick up the phone you're gonna
have a little bit of time to do sort of
an introduction and then you're probably
going to jump right into a question and
your instinct might be to jump straight
into just you know spitting out code try
to instead take a little bit of time to
ask clarifying questions gather
requirements about whatever the problem
is think of you know edge cases think of
test cases try to articulate your plan
and get your interviewers opinion on it
because that way we can prevent you from
going down a path that will lead you
nowhere we can save you some time we can
even offer you in
it could give us the opportunity to do
that and so I try to resist that urge to
sort of jump straight into I don't know
just a quick solution that said it's
okay to start with you know here's
here's a brute-force approach I can say
that to you in five seconds that's great
but when you get to the part of having a
real big algorithm you want to try and
like explain don't just start writing
code because we can we can help you we
can simplify it and that will save you a
lot of time and hopefully make it
definitely go through examples at the
beginning if your interviewer doesn't
give you an example
you should generate one yourself ask
them hey is this is this kind of what
you mean is this one example
representative of all of them or could
it be much more general is this a
reasonable example what do you think ask
them specific questions about what the
problem is talking about more than you
would you know like asking for sort of
just general help ask them something
about what they've said repeat what
they've said to you and your own words
so that you can make sure you've
understood and they can know that -
another thing we'd like to see is real
code in the sense that it could nearly
compile I'm not actually gonna like you
know be mad at you for missing a
semicolon or something especially on a
Google Doc but but that said don't write
purely pseudocode except maybe as an
initial explanation of an algorithm
there's lots of reasons for this one is
that at some point you do actually have
to be able to talk to the computers and
they need real code and so we look for
that in our interviews as that's how we
reflect
that's how we see where your skills
reflected in the interview but beyond
that another reason to write real code
is that you can kind of get away with
with stuff in real code that you can't
with in pseudocode for example you you
can you can say hey is it alright if I
have a subroutine that does this
functionality your interviewer might say
yeah sure you can assume you have a
method that does that and then you can
kind of come back to layer or if you've
run out of time here and every month
said yeah I feel like you could finish
that let's not even bother washing out
that tiny subroutine real quick has real
advantages so is it yeah so another
thing that I think people tend to do is
they go and they do a bunch of practice
questions and they try to fit the energy
question to a practice question that
they've seen before so
they memorized this particular way of
solving this problem and they just hope
and they they help and pray that they
can just you know reuse what they've
done to that particular solution so many
cases that doesn't work doesn't
translate once you run that way
you definitely need to draw from your
previous experiences of writing code and
solving different problems to understand
you know when to use you know in a
hashmap when Jesus said things like that
but don't think okay
this is this exact problem therefore I
need to remember this dynamic
programming approach that I coded last
night so do not try to force fit a
solution that you know very well to to
to that particular problem so some
people for example they study recursion
a lot before the end of here to study
dynamic programming a lot or they study
prefix tree aloud a red-black tree and
they think ok whatever question they ask
me throw in the red bag feels like it's
balanced Robert read let's do it I've
been there try not to do that definitely
practice a lot but whenever you see the
problem try to have a fresh look at it
and try to think of addition components
the other thing that people do a lot is
they tend to write off the right at the
beginning they want to have the most
efficient solution and a lot of times
they try doing this before they even
fully understand the parameters of the
of the question right so that's why it's
always good to first give the naive
approach to make sure you understand the
problem and then from that try to think
of the different components of that
naive approach of how you can solve it
so a lot of you know a lot of times I
have to tell interviewees can you can
you tell me what the nice approach would
be you know because you know they may
try to use a tree search tree or one of
these advanced data structures a dynamic
programming and then they would tell me
one denies
naive approach is and then I would ask
them what is the complexity of this
naive approach they will give me the
complexity then I ask them what is the
complexity of this other solution
internal propose that uses enemy
programming in many cases they would say
oh wow actually the dynamic programming
approach is less efficient then the
brute force solution at that point then
they realize that maybe they're trying
to to do the world
so definitely being able to show us that
you can do dynamic programming or
recursion or are these prefix trees are
important but make sure that you don't
prematurely try to apply them because in
many cases and many problems they're not
necessary right so just search
traditional data structure is a
traditional you know binary search may
be heaps and other data structure is
hash maps that can get you a long way so
definitely do not feel like you have to
pre optimize better okay so now what if
you stopped would a viewer stop first of
all it happens it's happened to me many
times as I was interviewing for
companies eight months ago and it
happened in one of my Google interviews
actually where I was asked to Kodak the
solution as a warm-up to a to print a
food nacho sequence and I was so excited
to code I jumped right in
after I wrote at the interview was very
confused and then I realized I just
coded a factorial so that was definitely
something I was not supposed to do
I took a deep breath explained that I
had wrongly assumed what I was supposed
to do clarify my understanding what if
it Bonacci sequence actually is preceded
to code it and I was obviously
successful in that interview process so
that is to say do not worry if you end
up going down the wrong path and in the
beginning of the interview do not worry
if you completely mess up on your
interviews as you mentioned earlier your
interviews are independent so especially
come on-site you're gonna have five in a
day those interviewers did not talk to
each other before they write feedback on
you so if you really felt like you
messed up on one just take a deep breath
go into the next one with a blank slate
and I hope to do all on that one so
that's the most important thing is to
keep your cool other things that you can
do to help you when you get on stack is
to walk through what we've done so
sometimes I find it helpful to just
reiterate exactly how I get there how I
got there and part of that talking
process sometimes helps me to see a new
direction
or that gives my interviewer a chance to
then jump in and suggest I try something
else I can answer that too I think for
my own personal example of me getting
stuck when my first interview when I
came on site someone gave me a question
and the solution required using a prefix
treat person said have you thought about
using a prefix team and I did not know
how to perfect she was I was stunned and
I said I am not familiar with this data
structure I know
bunch of different data structures in
just a happy night I never going to use
the physics tables Laura and the
interviewer explained what a prefix she
was because I was you know I was
comfortable enough with grass and
different grass and tree based data
structures once it explained what the
prefix she was I was able to get unstuck
so it's okay if you were exposed to a
data structure that you've never heard
before because for the most part data
structures most of them can be modeled
as graphs so one thing I do recommend
make sure you're comfortable with not
just doing this linear linked list or
Ramos type both algorithms make sure you
custom only grass that first search
breadth first search if you can
understand best many data structures
what's explained to you and you realize
as a graph you can't apply that and
that's what I was able to do it I think
I was able to impress the interviewer
because even though I didn't know what a
prefix tree was at the beginning once he
explained it I was able to write a
solution that used a prefix tree so so
the other thing that's very important is
the fact that by the time your package
goes to the end of the committee
you probably want as many different
opinions as possible right so maybe six
I said but it's not me do the fun
interviews it might be six or seven
different inputs and they have and you
wanted to be as independent as possible
because that gives more breath or you
know a better scope of your capabilities
so therefore you know if you mess up
it's kind of when you're taking an exam
right if there's only five questions in
the exam and then you don't know one
question that's automatically getting
into say if it's not twenty questions
you know damn right you know so I like
questions you know that exam or question
so that's the basic way I would approach
the
I would say that a difference between
quizzes and tests and interviews is that
you're not actually supposed to know
already how to do it we're not gonna say
something like what is an ArrayList
necessarily hopefully we're going to
give you a problem that you actually
haven't seen before something you you
don't quite know how to do so prefix for
example it's great because I didn't know
what a prefix tree was until last year
freaking out so this is a perfect
example of how you're supposed to be
able to I would love to see you able to
take something that you don't know and
and kind of wrangle that unknown into
something that you do now and that's
totally what we do every day and so
that's a wonderful thing to see in an
interview okay so now in terms of
resources I highly recommend cracking
the coding interview I went to know that
that textbook just makes you sore less
anxious because you thought like you've
gone through this somewhat comprehensive
it's not a very people but it's you know
covers all the highlights right it makes
you feel like you have a good foundation
for the interview so definitely just to
relieve some anxiety just kind of like
go through the book and skim through it
if you have time to do all the different
questions definitely do that there are
also other guides one of them is top
coder and other different website B code
they can create an account and solve
different types of problems and once
again that just the more practice you do
the better before my interview I
practice almost every day for about a
month just to get at the mode of all
right now we're gonna jump into
answering some questions so as a
reminder you have that chat box in front
of you feel free to type a question in
there okay now it's question time first
question is from Eden greener the
question is how does Google find
encoding abilities versus other
abilities obviously one needs to know
how to code but does Google care about
though because people care about the one
the way the one new way to learn things
thank you because everyone thinks that
is a great question we do value coding a
lot because as a software engineer the
best majority of the job is coding
however we do value communication skills
we do value ability to clearly so as you
communicate with the interviewer and
explain your your approach and your
ability to understand that's something
that has interviewer we assess your
ability to communicate clearly because
what we try to do is envision you in our
team and you've been giving a task and
how you go about addressing that so I
would say through the end of you we try
to assess not just your coding skills
but also communication communications so
we got another question from David he
says I'm nervous about the on-site
interviews it's five interviews that day
seems kind of overwhelming so I agree I
also thought it was a bit crazy my first
heard about five interviews in a day and
there are some tips that I would suggest
for getting through the day and so first
of I won't lie it is a very long day but
we do put a break in between so you will
have a lunch with what's called a lunch
interviewers it will have a current
Google employee pick you up take you 12
hour cafes and this is not evaluated at
all so you're that person that has once
had lunch with you does not write
anything up about you so take that as an
opportunity to get to know the company
to relax a little bit or you can simply
say I don't want to actually say too
much right now I want to have a moment
of silence or I want to take a nap my
lunch interviewer said you want to take
a nap I can take you to a nap Potter so
that is an option as well if you want to
feel like you need that and secondly
hydrate a lot during the day so we've
got a ton of micro kitchens all around
with coffee tea water or all kinds of
juices so make sure you have those in
the room with you at all times and sleep
a lot the day before
and also a question Dana Sande asks are
there some examples of the types of code
activities we will be writing so yes
there's plenty of examples of interview
processes that show the type of
questions we ask even on this YouTube
channel you can also basically just
Google Google interviews and see a bunch
of questions that because they're now
public we've actually banned from the
real interview process but that said
it's still a wonderful way for you to
see the types of questions we ask and
the sort of the I don't know the scope
of a question there's also there's books
out there I think there's one called
cracking the coding interview or
something like that
cracking the technical check out those
links and and definitely there are lots
of resources out there yeah so this next
question is from ünzile Chris what was
the hardest part of the technical
interview to you I would say the hardest
part of the technical interview that's
probably the first five minutes because
you're going to be given oppression and
you just anxious and worried that you
may completely blank and the other thing
that happens is as you during that first
five minutes mentha nice I think you
know you have to get over the hurdle of
thinking oh my gosh I'm completely going
to found this energy so if mentally
you're able to get over that hurdle said
okay I have seen a question I could
think of the naive solution that gives
me a starting point and then I can build
upon that once you get a nice solution
that you and your energy were kind of
see eye to eye on me make sure you
understand the question then you can
iterate over that naive solution and try
to find different projects you can
optimize so just getting to that step is
the most important piece and to add on
to that I wouldn't say this is the
hardest part per se but definitely one
that takes some practice is coding on
the whiteboard and he's wrong for news
decoding like a computer where there's
Nextec nice text editors that help you
do a lot of things magically so I make
sure you get comfortable when you're
practicing I recommend writing it out on
a piece of paper as if you were writing
on a whiteboard and just practice how
you're going to make sure your writing
is legible how you're gonna indent you
know follow the syntax with
that you're in front of you and if you
good if you do get into a situation
where you're like oh my gosh I can't
remember the word for putting something
on to a hash set because it add put or
offer what is just say like I can't
remember what it is
I know I would look it up in the Javadoc
or in the you know C++ reference I just
can't remember what it is
explain to your interviewer what you
mean and that will be 99.9% of the whole
thing okay so next questions from I you
see the question is if okay we do not
have this is it okay to not have the
most optimized solution but the code
works that is perfectly okay it doesn't
have to be the most optimized but it has
to be somewhat efficient right so I
think as long as it's not the naive
solution the most inefficient solution
what the interviewer looks for is your
thought process - the more optimized
solution so don't think the interviewer
is looking for one solution the most
highly optimized solution how to see
they do well on the energy it's more
about what are the different
foundational concepts of computer
science using to get to optimal solution
we're not have to trick you
so also don't don't assume that because
we mask something that you feel like you
know the answer to that you're like you
need to overthink it it could be that
the answer is fairly straightforward and
then then that problem will sort of grow
into something else maybe we'll change
the requirements to make it a little bit
more interesting after you sort of say
the first solution yeah so the next
question said if you haven't used a
specific data structure and you know you
have to use it to solve the problem
because you've heard of it before how do
you proceed to solve the problem this
was like the typical case that I ran
into I did not really understand how
that data structure was used and how to
and I had data viewer and then they said
well this is what the data structure
looks like it's actually more impressive
to me if the person is told but in the
instruction does it looks like you know
it has logarithmic answers or whatever
the case is and they're able to based on
me give them maybe three bullet points
about the data structure they have would
incorporate that into the solution so
so you don't have to remember us every
single data structure like AVL tree
right you don't have to do that okay
great so we have a question from Ling's
young during the interview does the
interviewer evaluate interviewees coding
quality and for example if it's not too
long or too hard to read so you do make
a good point
we do care about how while you code that
being said you do not go out nitpicky on
you so we will not care if they're
missing if you forgot a close bracket if
you're missing a semicolon that doesn't
matter but it does matter that you
structure in a way that is modular so
you break up long functions
you name your variables Wow not just a
PC and and that you use the appropriate
algorithms for the problem that is at
hand again I would practice doing this
writing on the whiteboard make sure that
your entry or connection to read what
you're writing that is also going to
help yeah okay
Martha Cornetto asks how many questions
are asked during each interview this is
Barry's how do you measure what's a
question so sometimes I might ask a
question that starts out you know what
sort of a straightforward thing and then
I complicated by saying well what if
instead of having you know only one
value for key you could have many values
for key what if you could have
duplicates and what I think weren't
sorted that could be considered one
question that has many parts or you
could think of it as like two or three
little questions different interviewers
might have different things they want to
do you could have you can have three
questions that are each just kind of
shortened self-contained or you could
have one moment mm-hmm okay all right so
I guess some final tips would be one
definitely communicate definitely try to
come up with the naive solution as early
as possible just to demonstrate that you
understand the problem and I'd say my
biggest tip is show your interviewer how
you start with what you know and
transform that into something that you
don't know and then figure out over the
course of my tip is keep your calm so
like I said if you screw up one
interview move on to the next slide
is okay and you haven't lost your
chances and finally the interviewers are
trying to help you get to a solution we
want to see you succeed and it's okay to
ask for small hints right that's totally
in for us is just you know trying to
figure it all out by yourself
so definitely understand how to leverage
the entity and we want to see you have a
working solution at the end
