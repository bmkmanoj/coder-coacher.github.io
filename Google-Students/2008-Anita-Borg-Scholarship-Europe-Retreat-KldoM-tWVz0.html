for global diversity and talent
inclusion the Anita Borg scholarship is
Google's global program to recognize
talented computer science women across
the world we have started a few years
ago and two years now it's been running
in the European region Google created
the Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship
Program a few years ago first in the
United States and now it's in Europe in
in Asia as well as well as Canada we try
to recognize women computer scientists
across the world who are doing amazing
things within their countries to advance
computer science and the industry
one of the highlights of the scholarship
aside from the financial grant is also
an opportunity for the women to come
together once a year for treat that we
host in different parts of the world the
Europe scholarship for example brought
together the 63 finalists and scholars
themselves who across Europe and there
were over 20 countries represented it
was the amazing opportunity for them to
get together to meet each other into
network hi I'm Sarah I'm originally from
Germany I'm studying computer science at
the University of Oxford verification at
the red sheet last night this year it
was so very inspiring and encouraging to
see that there's so many out there of us
and we can actually make a change if we
work together at the retreat in Zurich
the women are able to first of all hear
from speakers particularly industry
individuals who have been working in the
computer science field for a while and
hear about how they shape their life
choices in terms of pursuing graduate
degrees and how that benefited their
careers and in terms of what it was like
for them to transition out of the
university setting into a company
setting it's a great opportunity as well
for the students to meet each other a
lot of the retreat is about them
networking with the other women scholars
and finalists so that they can learn
what computer science looks like in
their different
hi I'm Melissa Gandini and I'm Italian
and the at the moment I'm doing a PhD UC
alumna I'm working at the moment on
wireless sensor network so basically how
we managed to integrate like fusion and
collaborative computation in these
networks the scholarship recipients are
actually selected by a group of Google
engineers which is an interesting way
for our own workforce to get involved in
advancing the industry as the women
provide applications provide essays
share a little bit about what they're
doing and what they're studying at the
University and our engineers look
through these application packets and
find the best and most promising
students from across different countries
in Europe
Google cares tremendously about building
diversity in the computer science
industry as a company our products are
used by the world's population and for
us the challenge for that is to have a
computer science industry and engineers
that best reflect our users themselves
in many countries across the world women
continue to be underrepresented
in most programs and in most countries
they tend to be under 20% which is
challenging for them in terms of their
experience as students but also for the
industry as a whole
Becky Stewart I am second year PhD
student at the Marion University of
London
music which is in the Department of
electronic engineering the highlight of
the program so far certainly the panel
for PhD students for a discussion of
whether you want to be an academia after
a PhD or to pursue industry research and
with a four panelists a chance to really
hear soaps and life stories and life
experience and a lot of really excellent
questions we know that particularly in
the IT field
women are one of the representative of
reason so the event is all about them
giving the opportunity for them to build
their network learn from one another
starting to build relationships and
hopefully with that increase their
capabilities to have some impact with
technology
one of the main purposes of the between
is to give these students have a good
perspective of what life in industry
looks like so one of the things that we
do is is give them a few of what is the
development process where is the life of
a product does it get created from
conception to architecture design
elimination delivery and obviously
feedback from from the customers going
through the next cycle because the
Google is extremely part two for us to
remain in the forefront of technology
that the further relationship univille
with universities also compete so as
part of the retreat we also have panels
that allows people from academia to give
their perspective of the industry share
the experiences of spending some time in
their severe sabbaticals or internships
and give Googlers the opportunity to
provide perspective of how they continue
to work but with the way the university
is doing point research activities and
then obviously all the social aspects
that I have mentioned so we do believe
that they leave here with not only a
very good network of other women that
are in similar situations but also with
a good perspective of what - could they
encounter in the industry any particular
company
and if they are very interest in in the
Romanian academia or continued focus on
academia have a view of how that is
possible either within</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
