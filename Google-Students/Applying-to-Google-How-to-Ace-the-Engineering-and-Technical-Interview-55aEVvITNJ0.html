interview hopefully you've already had a
chance to sign in but if you haven't
there's a link on the screen write it
down or take a picture and make sure you
sign in it's a great way to stay in
contact with us today we're going to
talk about what to expect in a Google
interview talked about the types of
questions you might see and how to
prepare for success but before we get
started I want to draw your attention to
the chat feature you should see in the
upper right hand corner of your screen
we've got a few Googlers here Michelle
Katie
Amy Anthony and Jonathan acting as
moderators today on standby to answer
your questions live and we'll also be
taking a few further into the
presentation and with that let's get
started so I'm Matt I'm a Google
software engineer I graduated from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
majored in aerospace engineering in 2006
I joined Google in 2014 my favorite
things about Google or the problems we
solve in the environment we get to do it
in and hi my name is Sarah I graduated
from the University of Tennessee before
that I graduated from the University
with one a motto in Mexico from math and
then computer science related in 2009
and I was trying to be an academic for a
few years I joined Google in 2013 as a
refugee from academia my favorite thing
about Google is the culture of
self-criticism and openness that we have
internally ok so Google interviews are
45 minutes long approximately in general
they can feel kind of brusque you
usually have a very short introduction
of about a minute or two at which point
your engineer will generally give you
the technical question it's not because
we don't want to talk to you or we're
not interested in what you have to say
but that's the most important thing
hiring committee is going to look at is
the outcome of a technical assessment so
we want to give you as much time as
possible to get through that and then in
general we'll close without answering
any questions you might have now there's
no points for asking any kind of
question there's this is strictly for
you because you are interviewing us as
well so please come with any questions
you actually are concerned about you
don't need to come with a fake question
to ask me because it's not going to help
you
case the types of things you're not
going to see we're not going to be
asking you what happens if you fall in a
blender
there's no puzzle or brain teasers the
questions are going to be problems that
will result will revolve around computer
science the engineering skills we're
looking for is we want to see
proficiency in the programming language
you chose that you understand how to use
the core libraries it gives you how you
and that you can basically handle any
performance issues that are coming up we
also want to see that you can use
algorithms and data structures to solve
the problem and we want you to be able
to break down a problem that might not
have been a computer science problem
directly into a computer science problem
so you're going to see a lot of
different categories of questions and
generally we give you a lot of
interviews not so that we hope you screw
one of them up but because this way we
can see you answer problems in a lot of
different categories so obviously we're
going to be expecting to see you two NFC
you code the big language is at Google
or Java C++ and Python but we also have
JavaScript and if you're an expert in
another language feel free to let us
know and we will find somebody to
interview with you and that you can
occasionally see math problems where
they're going to ask you powers of two
you also will generally see something on
the outer rhythm side where you're going
to need to sort something or build me a
data structure you should definitely
know things like stacks queues maps
graphs hashing big one okay obviously
the most important thing that we are
testing for during your technical
interview is your grasp of algorithms
and data structures because these are
kind of like the foundation that
underlies your skills as an engineer so
the types of problems you're going to
see or how would you sort search or
represent something the the trick to
these different types of interviews is
you want to strictly listen carefully to
the problem if a simple plain solution
comes to head go ahead talk about it see
maybe that is actually the best way to
do it otherwise have a conversation with
your interviewer just like we're going
to show you later we're here to help so
we're going to try and offer hints and
suggestions if we think we can help you
along to the right answer this isn't a
test this isn't you're not getting
graded like 80 percent oh you made this
mistake we really want to see how you
solve a problem and how you work
with the other engineer in the room so
while you're coding in general it helps
to verbalize your thoughts we understand
that some people prefer to code in
silence and if that's the case please
say so but if you think out loud and you
explain to me what you're doing I can
catch your mistake and only cost you 30
seconds but if I have no idea what
you're doing and you're just putting
code up on a whiteboard it could be
three or four minutes until I realize
you're off track and that that could be
10% of your interview time spent right
there the other thing is your
interviewer like I said is trying to
help you we're going to give you hints
we're going to try and bound problems
for you we're going to try and keep you
two solving a problem that you should be
able to solve in 40 minutes you know
we're not going to give you something
that requires 10,000 lines of code so
you think that's what you need to do
chances are you need to re-evaluate your
solution yes and matt has explained to
you what is going to be in the interview
itself so what if I want to do now is
tell you how to prepare for it and so
the most important thing that you can do
as you can probably have guessed given
the content of the interview is to
review the fundamentals you need to have
your algorithms and align your data
structures very well in the tip of your
tongue whenever you have something
definitely practice writing code not
pseudocode pseudocode is great to
organize your ideas and to think about a
problem but ultimately you need to
present code and you're going to have to
do that in a language and I would
suggest that you do it in the language
that you're most familiar with because
it's much easier to read code than to
write though don't try to match the code
that you're writing to the interviewer
that that posed that question and
definitely so if you have expertise in
Java C++ or Python those are the major
languages that we use at Google but if
you have a different language it's okay
like Matt was saying just discuss it
with your interviewer I have interviewed
people in Objective C and JavaScript etc
that's that's perfectly fine and
definitely also would suggest very
strongly that you
code in a whiteboard or on a sheet of
paper or something like that
and if you have some friends that you
can practice with that will also help
because it's a different thing to say
that you have solved a problem to
yourself and convinced yourself that you
have done it and it's a different thing
to convince someone else and if you have
people that work at Google or working in
industry ask them about their experience
at work your social network they will be
very good resources from your
preparation so what is the interviewer
thinking so now we have prepared and now
you're in front of a person and you
don't necessarily know what they're
thinking so what we are mostly focused
on is in figuring out what the candidate
is doing with the problem that we post
in particularly how they are analyzing
it are they looking at all of the
special cases are they missing some did
they look at the way of solving and
methodically and logically in particular
where they sort of proposing their
solutions and trying to go back and
improve them on their own do they have a
strong concept understanding of the
concepts in computer science do they
understand well their memory system do
they understand well what trade-offs
they're doing when they propose a data
structure or another do they understand
that the problem can be either solved in
breaking it into smaller pieces or not
these kinds of questions are what we are
trying to evaluate and you also need to
be producing good quality code and in
particular since you're going to be
joining a software engineering company
we want you to be doing good software
engineering crack practices so you
should be testing your code you should
be talking about maintainability
reusability trying to dry clean code and
also you're going to be part of a team
so we expect you to be able to explain
your ideas clearly and the most
important part perhaps is that we want
the candidate to be a pleasant person to
work with we are evaluating whether you
would be a good team work a good person
to having our team
and so in particular for phone
interviews since you have the barrier of
having all of your communication go
through the phone I would definitely
suggest that you have your phone charts
that you have a very good headset
available that you have tried a couple
of times either with a friend or
something to test that the call quality
is good you don't want your phone to die
in the middle of the interview you it
would be a good idea to have a quiet
location but you can hear what the
interviewer is saying and you can speak
without the interviewer having to
struggle to understand what you're
saying
remember to indent your code you're
going to be coding in a Google Doc and
sometimes it can be frustrating the way
those our corrections or things like
that you can prepare for those ahead of
time and yes since you're going to have
the extra problem of being communicating
through the phone think out loud and
communicate throughout the process it's
very very hard to evaluate a candidate
wherein you cannot know what they're
thinking about that is just long periods
of silence so with that we're going to
take some of the questions that you have
been asking in the live stream okay so
the first question came from Tim how
similar are technical interviews for a
PMS and sui's so for folks that don't
know a PM is the product manager and Sui
is a software engineer
so as an APM it will be less technical
right you're not going to have to do as
much coding but you're going to be
expected to understand what code would
be and what solutions would be working
so you'd be much more of like a design
and construction type question as
opposed to a suite where we're expecting
to see very explicit code and very
explicit data structures that's right so
we have another question by Tanisha for
the phone screens is it behavioral
questions so I would say that at the
very beginning you're going to have an
interview with a recruiter which you
will be doing those code samples and
things like that but you will then go
for a full
technical interviewee which you will be
you and an engineer discussing a problem
and there's no difference in terms of
the content between a phone screen like
that and an on-site interview it's going
to be coding is going to be algorithms
it's going to be design it's going to be
software engineering principles okay so
Joydeep asked how does programming in
class vary from programming on the job
um the biggest one and this is actually
one of the things I talked about a lot
is your code has to work more than once
when you write something for class it
has to work once for your professors
limited set of test cases so coding on
the job now imagine the professor after
you handed in the homework told you that
the rules for the homework have now
changed additionally you didn't write
half the code and finally it needs to
work for the next thirty years so you
end up spending more time on the
organization where where when you're
writing code for homework you might use
variable X variable Y variable Z and
that's great because it needs to run
once however nine months from now when
you go look at that code to figure out
what you did wrong you're not going to
understand what you did so you spend
more time you know choosing good
variable names choosing good function
names putting in really nice comments
because nine months from now even if you
wrote it you're going to look back and
be like what was I even thinking mom so
that is that is probably the biggest
difference is that the code needs to
exist longer than a very finite period
of time and the rules for that code are
going to change often so you learn to
not write what's called fragile code
where things are very subject to their
input conditions you start making lots
of little modules which can be
interchanged and moved and if I have to
change one of them I don't have to worry
about breaking the others okay so we
have a question by Arshad do you
recommend reading the cracking decoding
interview to prepare for technical
interview yes I would definitely
recommend that book I used it when I was
when I was preparing for my interviews
here I would say there's all sorts of
interesting resources online there's
practice questions in career cut which
is the website companion of that book
there's also questions in glass or
projectile there's obviously project
Euler there's a top coder there's code
jam there's all sorts of platforms for
training and competitive programming is
a way to prepare but again remember that
in competitive programming you're
targeting a solution that will be run
once what what am I saying
so you also need to prepare for testing
things and making things readable code
modular code good practices I would also
say read and algorithms and data
structures textbook just covered cover
because that is the core of almost all
of these interviews if you come in with
solid data structures and algorithms
knowledge you it's it's like having a
nice big toolbox coming into the
interview you're ready to handle
everything yes so we're going to repeat
the science project Euler career cup top
coder code Jam there's n plaster has
some glass door yeah hired is another
good one they have like this little tax
around high rank as well they have some
good practice okay so we're going to
move on Austin is asking if you follow
mistake during the coding portion of the
interview do you point it out or wait
for the interviewee to notice it
themselves it depends on I would say it
depends on like the level of severity if
it's like a small little glitch that I
can have you catch at the end without
you know totally affecting your
algorithm then I'll kind of leave it
alone but if you're clearly going off
path I'm going to stop you sooner rather
than later right and it also depends on
the interviewer there's some
interviewers that are much more console
and some interviewers that will let you
find yourself it's if it's okay to to
make small mistakes
that's an interviewee and it's even
better if you catch them yourself so
okay and then our last question for now
from Oliver how important are concrete
examples of work for first-year students
are we evaluated more on our portfolio
or your interview your portfolio gets
your foot in the door your interviews
with counts right so if you have some
good concrete examples of your work
great that'll get a recruiters eye and
that will get you an interview but the
interview is what Matt matters it's like
we're expecting to see you be able to
produce and read code assuming you're
saying first-year students you're
probably
in engineering practicum in general you
have a reading code interview and a
writing code interview so those are what
we would be looking to see is more the
interviews but don't don't think you're
getting in the door is still tricky okay
with that I think we're going to go into
the practice question so we're going to
be giving you some flavor of a mock
interview we're going to try to make it
as realistic as possible and it was a
second what we prepared okay here we go
alright perfect so the question that I
would like you to solve is imagine that
you were transported to the Middle Ages
and the print of movable characters by
tooth and Berg has just been invented
and you want to change the future and so
instead of printing Dante's Inferno you
want to give them a copy of the art of
computer programming but like move and
so you want to figure out if you can
print that book keeping the sets of
characters that Gutenberg have already
set aside for printing that fits in
further okay so looking at this problem
I think the first thing is how am I
getting my inputs
am I getting am I getting a string
Dante's Inferno
you know and then I'm going to get a
string of art of computer programming
and I'm going to try and see if I can
match it so if I have like hi my name is
Matt and I am hungry
mm-hm I want to be able to say I can
take an AI I can take an A am I allowed
to reuse letters I can take an H so
that's an interesting question so
so one of the things that I can see is
that case-mate matter again would suck
okay so we can say so assumptions here
are going to be case matters and then
additionally can I read I can't reuse
letters because it's a printing press so
if I use in the AC I kept yeah let's say
you can't reuse letters okay awesome so
now if I think about this I can come up
with a brute force solution which is
basically for every letter I need here I
can go through the previous one and say
okay H I and eliminate the I then the
next one I can go through is a and I'll
read through here and when I find okay I
can cross it out then when I go through
an M so off the top of my head that's
going to be oh of M times M where I've
got write M is my source and n is my
destination okay um yeah I want to yeah
there might be a better way to do this
so I guess primitively I could sort the
letters in each message so I could say
the first one would then be M log M plus
M log M lookups
but I think even better is seeing as I
don't need to I don't need to know where
the letters are right right that's for
so instead I could just simply count the
letters because you said case matters
but one H is the same as any other age
right so I'll have 52 possible buckets
we're assuming English right I gather in
German back now yeah we'll assume
English for our sake
so that's 52 possible situations that's
easy to put in a dictionary so I could
effectively have one uppercase H you
know to lowercase eyes uh-huh and then I
could compute this for the source and
then compute another for the destination
okay so you're building like a histogram
all the letters that you have okay and I
think that one's going to be oh of M
plus n because I have to read through
the first one right and read through the
second right yeah okay so what are the
memory requirements of this three
solutions of you
host the first one would be O of M plus
M or M plus M and then I would say this
one depending upon how you sorted it
would be O of two M plus 2 n if you use
merge sort and let's say additional
memory and all taking into account the
input but what additional memory are you
are you use ah this would be O of one no
at no additional memory this would be O
of M plus M if I use merge sort and this
would be approximately 1 because the
dictionary is going to be very small
compared to the end of it
ok but what would be the difference if
you had more sort of general character
set the larger the character said it
would be order of the size of the
character set ok so this sounds good I
think what I would like you to do is
code the one with the histogram yeah so
now just to break and explain what
happened here we spent about three
minutes going through and analyzing the
problem so we we talked a couple
different solutions you saw how I was
verifying my assumptions against my
interview otherwise him and I could have
been on different pages which could have
led me to spend 10 minutes coding
something that isn't going to be what he
asked me so always try and give a
concrete example showing hey this is
what I think you're really asking for
and then like like we said earlier I
knew a brute force solution right away
but then I had to work my way to the
actual solution now if you know a faster
solution or a good solution
feel free to go straight to it but in
general you know you can work your way
down and say ok I'm here this is the
cost you know can I think of anything to
make this better and try it like can I
divide this in half if I divide the top
string in half is it making my life any
better now you know is there is there a
heuristic I can use like reading method
no you know in this case dynamic
programming and like an indexing
solution were the two best solutions
right and then you can see that it was a
little back and forth the the interview
wasn't just saying me saying the problem
and then going ahead and coding it
it was much more about okay what happens
when this changes what happens if the
character is different what happens if
uppercase or lowercase are different all
of these are questions that I
intentionally left unanswered at the
beginning so that he would have to
verify them and you can see that by
clarifying all of them now all of a
sudden he has a very good grasp of what
the possible situations for the problem
are and how to solve them and what we're
going to do now is going to go to the 7
yes okay
the first thing I'm going to do here is
I'm going to make myself a helper method
so we'll say the first thing I'm going
to do is compute that dictionary so
public this is a Java by the way folks
public map of character to integer let
us call this compute map and that's
going to take in a string of a message
and then I can say my return is going to
be math a character integer equals new
and we said earlier I'm going to use a
hash map because of its cost
characteristics and memory usage so then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
for every character in the string
notice I'm closing my brackets keep in
mind it's a lot easier to do this
because you're not going to have an ID
we can track with you so now we're going
to say if I map that contains key C not
my mom does not contain the character
then we're going to set a my map C right
so in this case I'm saying for the first
letter I find if it's not in the map
then I have one else I need to increment
my count
so I can say my map foot see my map yeah
c plus plus and then once i'm done
building this map I can return it okay
so this will go through and give an a
string turn it into that histogram and
we're talking about where I can have a
count of each of the letters okay so how
convinced you are because some script
I'm pretty comfortable it looks like if
I give it a string ABC a it will go
through and say step 1
initialize a new map for every character
in the message so the first one would be
C would be a and so we'd say it's a my
map would now continue does my map
contain C no so it's going to say add a
1 skip the else next in the loop will be
B so we'll say does my map contain me
know b1 if not it's going to say C it
will do the same thing c1 and then when
I get to a again it's going to say it
does contain it so it's going to say put
C the existing value of a plus 1 so
we'll find a and then put 2 here okay um
I'm just confused about that thing so my
map that gets see in this case we return
1 plus plus X you'd rather plus 1 as
well plus plus is so what is the
difference between plus plus okay so in
that case I plus plus means increment
this by 1 I soups I know it means
increment this by 1 and then return it
the plus plus I means increment their
return the value of the name but in
either case this is clear so this is
this is the more readable solution okay
so this is our function okay and now to
make it a little easier we're now going
to use this helper function to do our
just hopefully we would have enough room
if not you can feel free to raise your
notes like we just did okay now I'm
going to say we wanted to simply know
whether or not it would work
so public boolean check message and
we're going to say string source and
string destination racket start running
this paste there giving myself plenty of
room here so the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to say that of
character to integer source map equals
compute map
source and then I'm going to say Matt
character to integer desk map is equal
to compute math of my destination okay
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to loop through my destination map
and make sure that I have enough values
in my source so for character actually
better way to do this will be for entry
character into there II and best entries
set all right so this is going to get me
a list of tuples in my destination map
I'm now going to say if source if source
map does not contain
if it does not contain the cam looking
for so it'll be et or source that the
gaff e15 is less than e that at Lu
which are false
okay so here now we have I'm going to go
through I'm going to get my histograms
like we talked about and then I'm going
to loop through all the entries in the
destination histogram and then for each
character if the source doesn't have any
of it or the source doesn't have enough
of it
return false means I can't make it if
not return true which means I can sounds
good how would you test this okay
so the easiest way to test this would be
to give it to two input strings right so
we could say like we did earlier hi my
name is Matt and I am gree so this
resource is the test and then what we'll
end up doing is computing the histogram
so we'll have h1 lowercase I to
lowercase M 2 y 1 and M 1 and it will
have gone far enough at this point
because we're going to write we're going
to hit here so then we can say actually
now we need to go all the way to a would
be 2 to 8 and then I'm going to have my
other one is going to be uppercase i1
lowercase a one lowercase M one
uppercase H one lowercase u one so now I
would have had I would have computed
these two maps using this function we
already test it and then I'm going to
say for every character in my
destination I'm going to walk down and
it's going to be uppercase I I don't
have one yeah now if this was a
lowercase I to test a slightly more
positive case lower case I would then
test and I have two of those so I'm good
to go here
lowercase a I have two so it would pass
lowercase M I have two would pass
uppercase H I have one it would pass
and then lowercase e what I don't have
at which point downtown any older this
cases that you would use I may be just
an exact abc2 abc3 ABC right so then
this would compute into a2 b1 c1 unless
you're computed to a2 b1 c1 at which
point it would work because you could go
through and the source map contains the
key source map Valley is you know the
source value is greater than the
destination value therefore it will
eventually return trip sounds good so
you can see that the code was
well-structured having this help helper
function helped a lot for the solution
it was broken up into these pieces that
were easily tested independently there
were like a semicolon that was missing
here and there was a little thing here
those are not important at all that's
that's a good thing right to show those
I don't know if you even yeah we
intentionally make small syntax errors
for these types of things but we want to
show you that those your interviewers
are going to care in terms of they want
to see they want to see clean code they
want to see that that you're making good
efforts and stuff but if you miss the
semicolon not the end of the world
parentheses and brackets are a little
more important because they really
control the flow of the code same thing
if you don't know a function so say you
didn't know entry set but you know that
the feature exists don't get hung up on
it tell your interviewer this is what
I'm looking to do either your
interviewer will give you the syntax for
it or say I'm going to make up a
function called get the entry set which
will do this for me and I will try and
figure it out later right don't don't
spend 10 minutes harping over a piece of
syntax that you don't need to worry
about exactly yeah and also you can see
that there wasn't that many lines of
code written it was one of the things if
you are writing more than 20 lines of
code maybe reevaluate what you're doing
especially if you start writing very
repetitive lines right so if I had to
write this helper function out twice
that would have been a lot of writing
meanwhile
by making the helper function right
spend spend a minute structuring your
program in your head before you go into
coding because otherwise if I was like
oh I need to make a histogram I need to
make another histogram let me just keep
writing the same code the other thing is
you don't have copy and paste on a
whiteboard you don't have none of that
exists so if you make a mistake like try
and leave extra room for things so that
if there was a mistake you can correct
it rather than trying to oh wait I have
to erase six lines and move all six
lines down try and intentionally leave
yourself a little white space between
every line so that you can kind of fill
in the gaps and the test cases same or
they're the same number of things edge
cases like that having them in different
or they're having them so repeated some
missing some in there those those are
all very good educators to move for yeah
I think and I think that's it so let's
go we probably should be taking some of
that let's go to mr. sessions okay we
have a question by row doc which that
instructional algorithms book study
material will you recommend to study
I've read data structures and algorithms
in Java cover-to-cover but that is not a
an endorsement it was a good book but
and most of the good data structures and
algorithms book it doesn't really matter
the language pick one that is that is
good for the language you're working in
and then like look at the preview or go
check it out at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble or
something and see you know you're gonna
want to make sure you go over linked
lists vectors you're going to want to go
over maps hashing graphs you know all of
those different types of things
algorithms you're going to want to know
all the sorting algorithms you're going
to want to know divide and conquer
branch-and-bound
you're going to want to know dynamic
programming greedy method you know just
make sure you're kind of hitting all of
the big topics otherwise there's several
really good ones out there you don't
really need to read something as
esoteric as art of computer programming
you can be a little more on the
practical side but if you really like
assembly and made up
assembly languages then please feel free
yes absolutely I would just add up to
that when I was preparing for my
interview I did myself cheat sheet with
information about all of the main
algorithms and their complexity and
their memory requirement and I got that
from Wikipedia right so there's plenty
of resources online you don't need
necessarily a vote for the information
I recommend coding yourself a copy of
all of the data structures and then
implementing most of the big algorithms
on the data structures you coded because
if you can get through doing that you
know it's solid sounds good okay next
question is from Matthew Crosby how much
does it count against you if the right
way to a solution doesn't come to you
immediately and you might take a bit
longer to think things through on your
own that's fine we were doing it a
little quicker because guess what one
we've seen this question before intent
and two you know we work on this kind of
stuff every day so we were trying to do
it quickly so that we had more time to
answer your questions but normally when
I use when I used to use this interview
question it's now banned none of you
should get this question um which will
go when I used to use this question we
generally take about 30 minutes or so 35
minutes for for a normal person to kind
of get through it and then the advantage
with this question and we didn't really
get into this is that this question can
be made a lot harder right what happens
if your source message is a petabyte
long and your destination message is 10k
right what happens if they're both a
petabyte long like how can I change this
program to work in those cases um so
that's a good Google interview question
is when you know if you finish it in 10
minutes great I can make it a lot harder
for you and if you finish if you're
dragging and taking a while we can we
can make some assumptions that will make
it cleaner right it think like the GRE
is if you ever took it right we're going
to try and tune the question to just to
the point where you'll finish it right
at the end right another thing I want to
mention is that we're not looking for
the perfect answer to a problem the
conversation and the discussion with the
interviewer is the Matt that is the most
important part of it we go back and
forth you understand the trade-offs you
realize that the solution that you're
proposing is important the first
solution that Matt
what's quadratic but had the advantage
of not requiring much memory that's
that's fine even if you don't think of
anything else at least you will be
showing the interviewer that you are
aware of the trade-offs and things like
that that's definitely an important part
of it
yeah and I guess that kind of had some
answers nice questions no while the
optimal algorithm is great if you're
also the kind of person that like okay
we know we can tell if you've seen this
question before yeah so like he says
it's really much more how can you how do
you approach the problem how do you
break it down because we also realize
that in your day to day life right
because this is you know obviously we're
trying to prove whether or not you would
work well in Google you're not going to
be on a 30-minute timetable to solve
this problem on a whiteboard good luck
right you're going to have an infinite
amount of support with all the other
engineers around you and all their tools
and resources we have to come up with
the best possible thing and a lot of
times the optimal space or time
complexity algorithm isn't optimal for a
googled case problem we're really
parallelization
is the optimal case for us yeah
definitely think about large large
problems scale them up that's a very
very Google way of doing things right
okay so we have another question by
Ishita
does the difficulty of interviews get
higher as you do the second or the third
no that would definitely be not your ear
interviewers don't even talk to each
other between interviews they handle
sheet of paper back and forth you'll see
but on that sheet of paper is simply a
list of the questions you've been asked
so that they don't so they don't repeat
it exactly and in general when they
assign the interview they'll say oh Matt
you're good at data structures and
algorithms in Java so you're going to
ask a data structures and algorithms
question but someone else might have
done graph theory or image compression
right they're going to go through your
resume and try and see if they can pick
out the best types of interviews for you
to get through yeah so we have another
question by an unpronounceable handled
woman ah would you generally do the same
thing in a Google Doc would you still
need to write out example input etc or a
phone interviews different that in
person no there no I would do the exact
same exact same thing the only
difference is that in that Google Doc
you can actually
do copy/paste yes so that helps with all
of the brackets character integer you
can and as a hint for that copy and
paste thing
please don't google the question and try
and find yourself an answer on Stack
Overflow it happens we can tell it's not
that hard so another question for
tashera am I going to be asked questions
on topics I haven't learned like
operating systems or networking will I
be asked on what I mentioned I know in
my application so in general you should
have some concept of how operating
systems and networks work right like
like you should know how to use a
computer you should understand that
information can be sent across the
network and that depending upon the
speed of the network and the amount of
information it's a trade-off but for the
most part we're going to kind of tailor
your questions towards what you said you
were good at now if you say you're an
expert in JavaScript I guarantee you
most people watching this video are not
experts in JavaScript so when you say
expert you say I've written a book on
this and people have bought my book and
it has four stars on Amazon right then
you can call yourself an expert but
realize when you do call yourself an
expert that actual JavaScript experts
are going to be there and you're going
to be getting some of the most esoteric
questions you've ever heard of so
there's two aspects of this one is don't
claim that you're an expert right and
yoga yes everybody a guy that wrote
pythons it's down the road for me yes so
everything that you put in your resume
is fair game to ask during an interview
so be mindful of what you put there but
the other thing is that we are going to
be getting interviewers who are able to
evaluate you so if you are a new grad or
if you are a junior or senior who is
trying to go for an interview or if you
are a person who has three years of
experience in the industry the
interviewers and the questions of your
areas are going to be very different so
we try to tailor the interviewers to
your skill level and your and your
competency okay and then last question
from now comes from Alex what are the
concepts to study an ordered pair
specifically for an interview and
engineering practical in general they're
the same just maybe with a little less
depth right so you're going to need to
be able to read code right so maybe find
one of your junior friends to show
you some of their computer science
homework and read through it and say hey
this is what I think your code is doing
the other thing is to practice coding
some things right make sure you can sort
an array make sure you can look up
something in a sorted array we're not
going to expect you to necessarily be
able to implement me a linear hashing
function or you know find the median in
linear time we're not going to expect
that we're going to expect you to be
able to you know give me a good guess of
relatively simple algorithms and be able
to use your data structures right if you
are able to use effectively lists array
lists you know apps hashmaps
things like those that even if you just
treat them as blackbox yes that's great
that's great well okay let's go back to
exercise so yeah so like you saw
interviews are messy we want to sort of
reiterate that small syntax errors are
not important they're not going to be
what decides whether you were hire or
not try to get the details right if you
have one mistake it's not a problem if
you have 15 mistakes in ten lines of
code and starts obviously loop whirring
right as cleanly as you can like Matt
was saying leave extra room draw arrows
to insert it code where it's appropriate
try to be conscious of time speaking out
loud and trying to express all of your
thought process usually takes longer
than you anticipate so be careful with
taking up all of your time with just
expressing the first thing that came to
mind and of course the very important
thing is that we don't have this policy
of one strike and you're out we take the
whole packet of interviews and that's
what goes for review it's not that when
you do badly in one interview then you
are out and I can speak to that for
personal experience one of my interviews
I am pretty sure I bombed it I'm pretty
sure about one tael yeah so that's okay
the whole point of Google isn't that
we're trying to find what you suck at
we're trying to figure out what you're
really good at so that's why you get
five or six interviews it's it has
nothing to do with waiting for you to
fail it has
stay with us waiting for you to knock
one out of the park yeah and some final
tips remember there's no shortcuts you
need to practice practice practice write
code have your data structures well
studied be ready for anything like I was
saying questions related to what you
have in your resume don't say you're an
expert but do highlight the things that
you're most comfortable talking about
because we want to know what are your
skills were your strengths those are the
things that we want to do we want to
talk about and over communication is
better than not communicating at all and
make sure that both your interviewer and
you understand what you're doing right
so explain what you're trying to solve
and ask what the question was keep this
conversation up and back and forth with
your interviewer it's probably the most
important thing that you that you need
to do in an interview and so we have
here some additional resources obviously
we have the tech tip guide Google and we
have the suggested text as we've been
discussing it already at cracking the
coding interview the sixth edition it
keeps growing it keeps getting more in
depth it also has the career cup site
associated with it for practice
questions and we have another couple of
resources here that we also discuss top
coder project Euler for tutorials and
questions and this last one I haven't
personally checked myself the lead code
but it's very good yeah I'll check it
out for the next one okay so obviously
how to apply please go to Gao slash
student careers to find the best rules
for you upload your resume and
transcript we don't you need a cover
letter we get that all the time we don't
actually want one and then click Submit
if you don't apply you'll never get a
chance
so please even if you're even if you're
on the fence spend the twenty minutes
and apply well and with that we thank
you very much
I hope you enjoyed this session I hope
you found it interesting and useful yeah
thanks a lot everybody are we still
doing more questions yeah I believe we
still have a couple more questions here
so we'll go through and try and see if
we can resolve these and if anyone else
has any questions please post them
obviously this time is for you so we
want to make sure we're getting
everything resolved so Steven asks have
you found the types of interview
questions you were asked in your
interviews map well to your day-to-day
tasks as an employee yes and no very
rarely have I ever had to worry about
reshuffling letters but the type of
situation where someone comes to you
with a problem that isn't a computer
science problem like hey how do I hide
comments in G+ that are spammy or how do
I route drones right like all of those
are very real-world problems that you
then need to deconstruct into a computer
science problem and then those those
types of things like coding on a
whiteboard or working with somebody we
you do every day of the week you spend
at least half of your time as a Google
engineer asking another Google engineer
for help
guaranteed because so much of your time
is interfacing your system with their
system or their system with your system
that you generally need to spend a lot
of time making sure two of you are on
the same page because my interface my
end of the interface and your end of the
interface have to be in the middle if
not we're going to have a bridge that
has a gap in it that's not going to make
anybody happy yes and Michelle has a
question could you give an example of
what you was the interviewer I'd like to
see in an interviewee both on the phone
and in person I would I would say that
my ideal candidate would be one that
takes my very nebulous question and
clarifies it until the point where it's
very very obvious what what the code
should look like a candidate that
expresses the trade-offs between
different solutions clearly and
correctly and that writes very clean
very well thought of code agreed the big
thing I basically please clarify those
assumptions sorting a list of integers
right if I ask you to sort a list of
integers your first question shouldn't
be Oh I'll use quicksort
should be what are the integers actually
representing right because sorting a
list of zip codes is a very different
problem than sorting a list of 64-bit
integers right because you simply need
to count the zip codes you know you know
you don't actually need to store each of
them um so so clarifying the question
will often be the trick to a lot of
interviews that a lot of people don't
generally get like it's that first step
of high yeah you gave me something I've
never seen before but I'm going to work
with you to turn it into something I
know how to solve okay we have another
question from Oliver if you go through
one interview round and don't make it
you don't get hired and you get
interviewed again in the future that
your passive temp count should you
reapply and yes yes yes you should
reapply in fact probably Google will go
back and bug you a year after say hey
are you still interested because because
it makes sense right if we have
identified you as a potential employee
you have talent and people grow one year
two years people learn new things people
have different experiences and obviously
we want to bring you back because we
want that talent here so it does count
what you have done in the past but
probably not in the in the direction
that you're worried about it doesn't
count against you it counts for you
well social roles right we won't ask you
the question again it's just like how
your previous interview doesn't count to
the current interview right as you're
going through your four or five
interviews it's simply we're not going
to ask you the same questions again so
that we can see what your new skills are
yes and we have some sort of last-minute
tips yeah so remember practice practice
practice interviewing is a skill that
you can perfect so problem solving is
something that you can get better at
again practice your data structures
practice your algorithms practice
writing code on fYI our practice is
speaking out loud your thought process
over communicate write please if we know
what you're doing like we said this is a
conversation we were going to help you
if you are often left field and you're
not telling us anything we won't know
you're there
so please tell us what you're doing
obviously we understand if you want to
think quietly that's fine just plan like
every five minutes or so to resync with
your interviewer don't just write me 500
lines of code
and expect me they like oh well on line
three you made a mistake but because I
didn't know what you were trying to do I
couldn't tell you you were wrong mm-hmm
and the last thing is pay attention to
your interviewer your interviewer might
want to give you hints and it will not
necessarily aware to tell you hey you
may have got something wrong here but
it'll say something and if he's saying
something or she's saying something
listen and and and figure out why they
were bringing that up right so we try to
give you hints we try to make you
succeed we are interested in getting you
to perform the best you can so listen
listen and keep communicating and I
think with that we're going to close
this thank you very much any or any US I
hope you had fun
