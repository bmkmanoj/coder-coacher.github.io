engineer here at Google and I'm Jesse
I'm on the university programs team here
at Google and welcome to our virtual
career fair this is our video series
where the career fair comes to you
in this video we'll go over lots of
important information about working at
Google including Google's culture the
types of jobs that we hire for how to
apply it with a couple application tips
and then we'll finish it off with an
overview of our interview process
and we also have a separate FAQ video
where we're gonna answer the most
popular questions that we get at career
fair so definitely check that out and to
make things easy we split everything in
the handy dandy chapters with links
below so now let's start talking about a
Google culture when they first started
our founders set out to build something
really useful for people a way to
organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and
useful today we've moved well beyond
search as you can see but we're still
looking for answers to that big question
and many others at the end of the day we
aim to build technology that helps
people live happier in easier lives
being a Googler it's all about wanting
to make a positive impact on users lives
and we aim for big impact we look for
people who are curious who aren't afraid
to challenge the status quo ask the
tough questions or push the boundaries
we found that focusing merely on 10%
improvements while great and then
believes you focused on building upon
existing tools and assumptions instead
Google likes that they get 10x it boils
down to reaching all the users because
all users are important it's not enough
to solve the problem for one type of
user or in one place we're fortunate and
that we are a big company and Google's
resources can help us make that type of
impact I'm talking about things like our
code base and our values and the
incredible people you work with and can
bounce ideas off of these are our most
valuable resources that make Google such
a unique place to innovate alright it is
time to talk about googliness googliness
can be neatly defined but it's what
enables Googlers to thrive and
contribute positively to our culture to
take a stab at it
it means being comfortable with
ambiguity having a certain
dose of intellectual humility being
biased towards action and having a
collaborative nature it also means you
can adapt to change in our fast-paced
environment and that you'll have fun
along the way
yep all right no Googler makes this type
of impact alone in order to build
products and solutions that work for all
users we need diverse perspectives
within our own teams that's why we're
committed to increasing diversity both
inside Google and across the tech
industry we focused our efforts in three
areas
number one expanding the ways we find
and hire our next Googlers number two
bringing computer science education to
more students makers and future Googlers
and number three ensuring that all
communities can access and benefit from
the web and we want to ensure every
Googler can thrive it's important that
every Googler feels included and
supported inside and outside of work we
want Googlers to feel comfortable to
share ideas bring their whole selves to
work their family their hobbies their
interest and their sense of humor one
key pillar is creating an inclusive
environment for Googlers while at work
the other component is supporting our
Googlers and their families outside of
work we're constantly evolving our
benefits to support our growing aging
and multiplying Googlers all over the
world and we work hard to make Google
the best workplace possible we do this
through our benefits workplace design
perks and culture you might not realize
that there's a lot of thought behind all
of our perks but what we really want is
for Googlers to have meaning in their
work and be able to express their voice
we want people who are inspired by our
mission and our culture when hiring new
Googlers we hope they'll join us and
build their careers here careers are
personal there's no one right path and
that's certainly true at Google there
are so many opportunities to pursue an
exciting challenges to tackle across
different teams regardless of which path
you take we are committed to helping you
grow and improve your skills along the
way
here at Google we have a lot more jobs
available than some may think it's true
we have roles in sales engineering
finance technical writing design and
even more than that our career site has
a lot more information
but for now we'll try to help so let's
first talk about full-time jobs of
course engineering roles are going to be
available at Google software engineering
but it's not just that we also have site
reliability engineers tools and
infrastructure engineers product
managers and analysts we also have roles
in user experience as well as some jobs
in hardware and on the business side we
have roles on our sales team where you'd
be working with small and medium
businesses as well as roles on the
global customer experience team GTECH
roles and finance people operations
marketing and more so now let's talk
about our engineering and technical
programs and internships we have
programs whether you're in your first
year of college or you're working
towards your PhD yeah and some specific
programs that we like to mention our
engineering residency program
engineering practicum and our PhD
internship so check those out we also
have programs for interns outside of the
US like our step program as well as
internships in engineering and again on
the business side we also have varied
programs including our bold internship
and in a few locations outside of the US
we have a business internship that's all
about real-world experience our MBA
internship has roles and sales GTECH
corporate finance people operations and
a lot other places and don't forget
we've mentioned it before but our career
site has details on all of our roles
internships and programs so be sure to
head over there
all right let's now dive into our
application process so applying to
Google is pretty simple first you're
going to find the role that's the best
for you
so the qualifications listed in the job
descriptions are there to help you
select the role that best fits both your
background and aspirations so pay close
attention
recruiters review applications with
these in mind once you find the role
make sure your resume is in tip-top
shape and we have some helpful links for
that below you then submit your
application online at our career site
we'll need your resume and if you're a
recent graduate looking for an
internship or if the description asks
for it we'll need your transcript but an
unofficial one is fine there is no need
for cover letters though so take that
time to make sure your resume is zero
errors yeah and after you apply you'll
wait we know waiting isn't the most fun
but it does take time to go through
resumes and we'll reach out to you to
let you know if you've moved forward
generally if you haven't heard from us
in a few months the rule was probably
filled and if you hear from us that
you'll be moving forward in the hiring
process great now you're on to the
interview stage
okay now we're gonna dive into the
interview process so here at Google we
interview a little differently that's
true and the most in-depth resource for
this is the how we hire section of our
career site that is a great resource in
this video we're gonna go over the
basics of the process for you so many of
our roles require one or more phone
interviews these are going to be about
30 to 60 minute calls with someone with
role related knowledge sometimes this
means with a recruiter your recruiter is
going to give you all the details before
you take that first call and in some
cases the next step if you move past the
phone interviews is the on-site
interview around although many
internships don't require this step
on-site interviews arroyo meet Googlers
face-to-face for interviews usually 30
to 45 minutes each if you're going for a
technical or an engineering role we'll
want to see those coding skills and if
you're going for a business role you'll
demonstrate your role related knowledge
and again please make sure to check out
our links for much more in depth
information for interviewing and your
recruiter is also going to give you all
the details about your interviews if you
move past the interview around your
application packet which contains your
resume any other submitted work
information and your interviewer
referral feedback this will go to our
hiring committee and if an offer is to
be extended it'll go through our
executive review and again your
recruiter is the best resource for all
information they're going to make sure
that you're up to date and explain the
process in as much detail as possible
