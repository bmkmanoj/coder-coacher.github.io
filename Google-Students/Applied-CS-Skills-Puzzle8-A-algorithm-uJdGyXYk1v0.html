a-star algorithm is a path finding
algorithm which means it's used to find
a path between two points usually in a
graph a graph can be used to model lots
of things such as roads between cities
or even moves in a game let's say you're
about to start school and you want to
find the shortest path to your new
classroom to do so you decide to do some
exploring
you could try going down every path and
seeing where it leads and eventually
you'll find the classroom but this might
take a long time instead of trying every
path the a-star algorithm tries the most
promising path first this means to use
the a-star algorithm you need to be able
to compare two positions in the graph
and say which of the two is better to
determine this you'll use what's called
a heuristic this should give you the
estimated total cost of taking one path
rather than another in our example the
heuristic might be the straight-line
distance to the classroom and so the
total cost at any point is the distance
taken to get to that point added to the
estimated cost given by our fuel cell
as you look at potential next steps
through the ground you will use the
heuristic or evaluation function to
choose the next node to visit so that
you don't explore nodes you've been to
before the a-star algorithm uses two
lists sometimes known as the open and
closed lists the closed list holds all
the nodes that you've already explored
and don't need to consider and the open
list holds all the nodes left to visit
using these lists you can keep track of
your exploration through the graph until
you find the best path
