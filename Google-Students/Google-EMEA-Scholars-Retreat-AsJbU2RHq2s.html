I'm from Raqqa my name is Katya I come
from Speedy's burg from Russia I'm Igor
I'm recipient of Google European
scholarship for students with
disabilities my name is Chieko
I'm Kenyan iron Fabio from Italy hi I'm
sous hi my name is Wanda I come from
Gothenburg in Sweden I'm a student at
Glasgow University
I am from Israel so it's great to be
here
the scholars retreat is an annual event
that we do here in our Zurich
headquarters for three days every year
we invite the finalists and the winners
of our scholarships both the Anita Borg
scholarships and the European
scholarships for students with
disabilities during the three days they
have an opportunity to listen to
technical talks they attend some
workshops we of course add some fun
events in and they get a chance to
interact with Google engineers it's just
wonderful to have all of the scholars
here in the office this week I'm really
proud that Google is supporting the next
generation of European engineering
talents it's amazing
get to meet all those people we actually
understand each other's fields and each
other's jokes that's not something that
happens very often for me I met this
girl from Qatar never ever met a person
from Qatar in my whole life I met a lot
of new people who are very open and
having lots of interesting discussions
our PhD students there are master
students there are bachelors from here
we leave this place having allies all
over the world
we're looking for students obviously
students who are bright and accomplished
and have done interesting things thus
far in their academic career but we're
also looking for the students who will
be the leaders of the next generation
what led me to apply to the Anita Borg
scholarship is basically to you know
benchmark myself in an international
level project is to help people with
disabilities in their daily life these
students have ambition and that they're
committed to their studies and
furthering their exploration in industry
so it shows employers that they students
have a lot to offer the coolest part
about what the retreat is actually
putting a face on to Google the
processes the ways you need to think
it's a really fun place to work at
everybody's so relaxed there's so many
fun things to do I understood about
working in Google there are companies
which doesn't separate between academia
and and high tech companies makes you
want to come here really really early
and leave really I met an intern this
year that was a scholar here last year
and after her internship she's now
converted to be a full-time Google
employee and I'm looking forward to
working with her
I applied to the scholarship next year
it's solely a win-win situation other
people get to know you and know how
amazing you are
but from a bit of thinking and putting
it down on paper it doesn't cost
anything to apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
