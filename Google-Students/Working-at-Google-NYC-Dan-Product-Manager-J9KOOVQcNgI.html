15 years now and I've never worked
anywhere quite like Google one of the
things that really struck me when I
first joined Google was the amazing
diversity of people there are within the
company you've got people from every
country in the world working in all the
offices we have people straight out of
college we have people who've been in
the industry for 25 years and that
breadth of experience really helps us
become a company that's more than just
about one single thing we're about a
whole broad range of different
technologies different approaches
different ways of thinking about
problems
yeah countr work and I look forward to
the conversations are gonna have during
the day with my colleagues and with
people I haven't met yet within the
company because I know that today I'm
going to find five new great ideas that
I'm going to get excited about and the
opportunity to be part of that
environment where there's so much
passion and energy and excitement and
enthusiasm it's infectious and it's it's
definitely why I enjoy working at Google
I'm Dan Crowe and I'm a product manager
here at Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
