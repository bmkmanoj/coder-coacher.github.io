google i'm a lead recruiter here at
Google and would like to welcome you to
our hangout on the air talking about
Google scholarships which is a really
cool topic a little different than what
we normally talk about on this show I
guess it's a show on this show and we're
very excited to talk about scholarships
actually have three of my colleagues
here and what I wanted to do is just
start off by giving everyone a quick
introduction of their background and
what they do here at Google and then
we'll jump in the content take some live
questions from people out there that are
listening so again my name is Jeff Moore
I'm a lead recruiter here at Google in
our Cambridge Massachusetts office and I
recruit engineers and as souza we'll
start with you sure hi my name is a zoo
salut and I'm a university program
specialist in Mountain View and I work
on student programs namely scholarships
so I run many of our scholarship
programs in North America as well as
some other student events and if you
know the Grace Hopper conference I work
on that as well awesome Stephanie hi
everyone my name is stephanie chan and i
work on the university programs team as
well and i am based out of New York
office I work on recruiting a few
schools as well as the UNCF scholarship
and Asus scholarship specifically and I
also run the intern program in New York
awesome Jenny hey Jenny mekole I work on
the immunity so that's the europe middle
east and africa team at the university
program specialist based in the London
office and responsible for trying to
develop our relationships with students
and faculty for UK ireland denmark and
netherlands and then i also run the
scholarships for me out and it's like
dinner time for you right Jenny fit Oh
Betty lets you guys okay just checking
cool well you know want to thank you
guys for coming it's awesome to have a
little bit of time so basically I want
to really do you know let's talk a bit
about sort of at a high level what some
of our scholarships are what we try to
do now and break it down regionally I
guess and so Jenny if you don't mind
kicking us off and talk just a little
bit about some of the scholarships we
offer in Europe that'll be awesome yes
then we kind of need mine two
scholarships for students in the Emir
region we run the Google Anita Borg
Memorial Scholarship your middle east
and africa a name of this one's to
encourage women
to excel in computing and technology and
to enable them to become active role
models and leaders as well for others
and the second one is the google
european scholarship for students with
disability so again the aim being to
help dismantle some barriers that may
keep students with disabilities from
entering into computing and filling meal
scholarships for both the scholarship
there each scholar will receive seven
thousand euros and that can contribute
towards their education and they also
give a chance to come to the Amir
scholars retreat which we'll talk a
little bit about more detail later and
and just a sudden sorry okay no it's
just an awesome it is to give you a bit
of an idea of sort of numbers as well we
am actually awarded sort of ten for ten
students last year and for the
scholarship of students with
disabilities and 35 the Anita Borg
scholarship just for the memory awesome
and azusa how about you and could you
give us a little bit of sort of
background in context around just Google
scholarship in general the sort of the
philosophy behind it sure um the
scholarship program at google began in
2004 beginning with the UH need aboard
memorial scholarship that Jenny just
talked about it first launched in the US
and now it's pretty much all over the
world and that was in honor of Anita
Borg who is a real visionary and
technology and really did a lot to get
things off the ground for Women in
Technology since then we really saw the
value of providing these kinds of
scholarships for students for
underrepresented the field and so we've
expanded from not just women but to
other groups who are underrepresented in
computer science so in North America we
have several scholarships stuff
mentioned the UNCF and a Civ scholarship
and that's for african american an
american indian student we also have
programs for hispanic students persons
with disabilities and women like we
mentioned possible and Stephanie what
sorts of stuff for you work it up so for
specifically it's uncf anissa
scholarship tribe elaborating on these
head so for the UNCF scholarship um
where
are you know replaced part of the UNCF
organization and providing a scholarship
to african-american students in the US
well as for the first time this year to
blacken adium students in canada and so
they wore specifically is ten thousand
dollars at us student 5,000 to Canadian
students this is just based on tuition
cost differences and all scholarship
award recipients will also be invited to
attend our this year's a Google scholars
retreat in that review of the summer and
then four aces similar so replace the
part of the asus organization and we the
scholarship is for asus members need to
be enrolled in their other player
organization to receive and ten thousand
dollars for us students as well as 5,000
for Canadian students and this is also
the first time this year that we're
awarding offering the scholarship to
comedians I think it's pretty exciting
stuff and again Sasha pacificans will
also be invited to attend our scholars
retreated madly beautiful summer awesome
cool and now I know the reason you guys
are here besides you know your desire to
talk with me not is that there are a lot
of deadlines for these things and the
deadlines are sort of fast approaching
so if Jenny maybe you could quickly jump
through some of the European deadlines
and then Azusa definitely we can break
up the US after yeah definitely well
lifting those knees remember they're
both on the same day so it come here
next week wednesday the first of
February's and specifically fast
approaching and just a FYI for the
students who are applying by this date
it's have you need to have all sort of
material in so that's natural general
application as well as all the
documentation uploaded and to make sure
that their referees have actually added
their recommendation letters swell
attempt to be a little thing where
sometimes they think they've done their
work and by that deadline with each
other all the information in so first
first of febuary okay i know where do
they go to find the stuff so you can
find everything you go to google.com /
students site and then that will direct
you to the scholarship page and then you
can select the region or breakdown for
different options that we have and it's
a little online application so notice no
physical thing clear to the post are
referring for making jokes about mailing
applications
and Stephanie do you want to talk a
little bit about the u.s. deadlines in
the u.s. sort of process as well sure um
okay i can have speaks more specifically
to uncf at a scholarship produces better
to address the other ones i mentioned
earlier just the difference for the UNCF
needs a scholarship in terms of the
deadlines the UNCF scholarship deadline
is mark 18 and then the ace of
scholarship is for februari 29th
returned I thought I sort of have a
little bit of time about ok cool mmm in
azusa what do you got over there yes so
I'm getting to work scholarships for the
US and canada that's due on februari the
six the lime scholarships we partner
with the lime organization for
scholarships for persons with
disabilities that's due on february's
fifth we have a program with the
Hispanic college fund and that one is
due on march first and then i neglected
to talk about this a little earlier but
we just launched the generation Google
scholarship for high school seniors
going into college and that's a new
program that we we just put a blog post
up about last week and that one is do
you want februari 28 and like Jennifer
I'm like that's a sure let me let me
talk about that a little bit it's a
program for high school seniors going
into college and tiny to study CS and
it's a new program different from the
others because um olhar other
scholarships are one-time scholarships
this one is renewable as long as they
made some eligible looters criteria they
can renew it for up to four years around
to go to graduate awesome and this is
brandy this is the first time we've done
it this is the first time that we've
done something like this yeah cool very
very very cool alright so this is all
really cool and what I want to do now
we're about halfway through if you can
leave it our live hangout on the air
talking through the vibe a little
students I talking about Google
scholarships what I'd like to do is get
questions from people who got a lot of
questions before this talk which we can
walk through and we'll get some live as
we go as well and anybody out there
that's listening that wants to fire off
a question just do the hashtag
scholarship question will
find it and try to take it live and so I
think the big question you guys have all
kind of beat around the bush on it but
you haven't talked about it but like
what makes a great scholarship
application very different than the job
application originally not but but what
is it that you guys look for and I don't
know Jenny do you want to start on that
what is there may be two things you look
for in a great great application yes
sure I'm adding some of these might be
similar for sort of a mirror and the US
as well and but I mean this main couple
of main things were looking for and all
of their scholarships in the mirror is
really looking for strong computer
science students so i guess the
technical accomplishment side is bigger
for us we're looking for people really
and have that sort of technical
background and also against a second
where the passion for it it is not
necessarily just a passion for CS
through their academic background but it
actually may be gone out and built
another extracurriculars extracurricular
activities that sort of highlight that
they really are just committed to going
in that career path cool and so that you
know really showing that passion is
important yes scholarship okay stephanie
is there something that you would
recommend what I think like we
definitely definitely also look for just
how involved you are in a community and
so depending on the scholarship I know
their questions based around that so
it's really great to hear you know
different ways you engage with your
community you know it's a baby difficult
to Danube that you're involved in just a
way to show us know in addition to your
passion for CS just how you take these
things that you've learned and apply it
to bed and get back to your community ok
cool so a little bit more about the
bigger picture as opposed to like oh
this is a smart person that we'd like to
help with school it's sort of a bigger
the bigger macro nature okay cool I'm
learning here learning azusa what do you
got by the end of this I'll be ready to
apply for scholarship another big thing
that we look for is leadership and so we
really want to see that these students
are leaders and their in their community
leaders you know just in the
organizations that they're involved with
things like that it doesn't have to be
formal leadership qualities even but we
really like to see that they're they're
proactive and people who and who
exemplify great leadership quality
and I think even more than grades or
technical accomplishments those are
really really important but I think
something that makes somebody stand out
is those that leadership and that
community involvement okay cool very
cool and now you know one of the things
you guys all I'll hint it around to is
was references and letters of
recommendation and that was there you
know I've probably seen in a million
professional references on resumes and
four candidates I've hired but certainly
not on this side of the side of things
so what would you say and you know
Stephanie will put you in spot what's
you know like what's the one you know
best thing you can do from the
recommendation or reference who's it
from what's it look like kind of thing
just so people out there that are
listening can could really be thoughtful
about how they get for recommendations I
definitely think if it's good you can
get a recommendation from a professor
can they be able to seek to your
technical background as well as your me
involvement in the classroom the more
they can speak to you as in terms of
your classroom capabilities as well as
you're honest out of classroom
capability is I think that would be a
great person to go to to ask for a
recommendation and definitely I heard
you to ask your professor early on so
that they have to type to write a
thorough recommendation for you okay I
didn't agree with that point upsetting
last year and notice begins a lot of
applications from sort of and the
recommendations lessons will say how
great a person there another brilliant
we're really pleased but we really want
to know you know what they've done how
they've been made a difference how they
stand out at all you know this would
accomplishments their presence in class
that sort of thing we appreciate that
there's probably some really nice people
as well but we need to see a little bit
more than that in order to do a good
assessment right you really want to meet
right you don't just want the fluffy
this is the best person I love hanging
out migente you want why do you live an
allogenic like let's give us something
here okay cool and now Azusa I'm gonna
flip the question on you because this is
what I do for a student applying for
generation google I'm guessing there's
probably a little different right
they're not going to have a professor is
is a teacher good do they need to have
like community leader what sort of stuff
do we look for their
yeah so for the generations equal
scholarship we require two letters of
recommendations one from a high school
stem teacher science technology
engineering math teacher and another
from anyone who's not related to them
who can really speak to their character
and their their background leadership
qualities like that one thing i know
that some high school students have the
privilege of being able to take a
computer science class in college and if
that's the case then they can ask their
a professor to write a recommendation
letter but if not high school stuff
teacher is we're looking for okay cool
very cool and now i know any other
questions that we've gotten a lot is
what you know what's an eligible maj-gen
you want to start off with that sort of
what sort of backgrounds we look for
we're talking about scholarships your
google yeah I mean we keep it kind of
loose we in terms of both the
scholarship sameer we say a computer
science or closely related technical
field so we're moving on students to at
least have a good proportion of their
modules and that are computing modules
so there's a lot of overlap and that's
why we leave it up to each individual
student because sometimes each
university course or each country might
have variations so we try not to be too
specific on the degree name but just
that the student really makes their own
judgment on whether they count
themselves to be in a technical sort of
degree that relates to a computer
science background Stephanie look for
the same sort of thing for your
scholarships um yes I'd say so this as
long as we generally look for SCS
software engineering but as long as we
seen your transcripts that you take in
coursework thats related to computer
science you are eligible ok cool and now
totally continuing just shuffle the snow
globe over here if you know someone's
working on their their their PhD I don't
have transcripts one of those guys do
that's quite a big question I get asked
a lot as women and definitely happen
that's just a part of the course so feel
free to just upload your masters or your
bachelors or whatever transcripts you
have just your most up-to-date transfer
sleep just gives a way of you know
seeing what you've been doing and how
you've been doing but we appreciate that
your meals do a current transcript okay
cool
they're actually getting a tunnel live
questions which is really cool but
specifically from our friends in mia
Jenny I didn't know you're so popular oh
the questions are really around you know
my my my referrals or my references
having yeah they've gotten a note of
notification but they haven't had of
their letter to my to my app and what do
I do here SI freak out and call them
about your application man it costs me
money he looks busted a this is
definitely something that we're aware of
that's happening and unfortunately it's
not ideal but filters tend to pick up
some of the notification letters from
our system so if you know that you've
put the recommendation emails in that
and they've not if you log in and you'll
see it's what they completed just have a
chat with your referees maybe get them
to check in their spam folder see if
it's come through there but if not and
you really getting worried close to the
deadline and you can go onto the website
get the email addresses and just getting
seven directors okay cool very cool and
now one of the things I am actually
looking to learn while we're on this
call today is about the Google scholars
retreat like what is that what's going
on let souza give me give us the details
almost sounds really cool i'm reading
the brief on it like I sounds really
cool i want to learn about it yeah so
I'm actually I with the feedback that I
get from this is that the small scholars
Archie is one of the reasons why some
people apply but the background on it
everyone who receives a scholarship from
google is invited to attend the scholars
or tree which is basically a three-day
network retreat networking retreat at a
Google office so for North America
scholarships we invite them to the
headquarters here in Mountain View but
we host them usually in san francisco
and i'm bringing to the office they get
a tour of the office they turned talks
by global Googlers they know work with
each other as well as me other Googlers
and then ton of fun social activity that
we plan as well and it really is on the
feedback that I get is that I'm so great
for them to meet other students just
like them people talk connect with each
other
start up opportunities to collaborate
and it really is just just a great time
for them and now is there a European
version of this to Jenny or is a global
event yeah definitely much and some of
them would probably love to go to
mountain view we actually a little bit
place this is York which is our
engineering headquarters in Europe so
it's really similar to the UM symptoms
it's about bringing together all of the
scholarship recipients as well as some
of the finalists to be hated Borg
scholarship and it's two and a half
three days of just getting to me lots or
the similar minded people as themselves
and as well maybe lots of Google
engineers and there's actually a really
cool video that we did from the retreat
amia last year you can see on the Google
YouTube page and which one there's a way
factorable yeah I think it's just the
network and you can see sort of there's
a tram tour and there's lots of
different social activities subscribe
well sort of words out the mouth of the
students in attendance so you can get
their opinion ok cool awesome we've got
an other live question that Stephanie
I'm going to throw at you because you
got off the hook on that last one right
the question is that you know my
application says that I need to provide
a 2012-2013 enrollment confirmation I
only have confirmation for 2011 2012
what do I do that's a good question I
mean generally for our scholarships we
are going to look that you are enrolled
full-time for the next academic year and
so definitely encourage you to try and
go to your school and try and get
confirmation of that because and
especially with the organizations that
we partner with they are going to look
as well ok you can always email our
alias which is posted on the
scholarships websites if you have any
specific questions around that feel free
to email us and we can you can answer
your question there I think sometimes
that can be a problem or in a mirror as
well just because of the different
academic schedules so a lot of people
might have they don't all fall on the
same sort of sep tember to july and so
if you really are struggling we will
accept a letter of support from a
professor as well just confirming that
you are going to still be there studying
for the next year ok cool so there are
ways around it I mean we have to yeah
get that data but cool
awesome this is fun I'm learning a lot
this is good one thing we haven't talked
about and I don't know who to direct
this at so I'm just going to rambly just
sort of randomly throw it out there what
about other regions like you know a pack
Africa I mean what what other do we have
other scholarship started with other
choices in the world besides Europe in
the US and sort of how do people find
out about that sure I can take that one
of scholarship programs are our global
we have scholarships all around the
world and if you go to google.com / jobs
/ students / scholarships scholarships
um you'll you'll come to a page where
it'll direct you to different regions
and wherever you're at just click on the
region that you're in and you'll see
it's all strips that you'll be eligible
to apply for okay awesome cool you
should probably mention as well is it
and imagine is the same for all the
regions the biggest thing that we find
it as scholars retreated when we
actually get into the successful
scholars if they just never thought they
were going to apply they just didn't
think they've been worth applying they
don't think they doesn't have a chance
of getting it so just really it is sort
of worth a shot so I'm just trying to
make sure that I guess students are
aware that there's lots of opportunities
there's lots different scholarships and
ultimately someone's got to get it so
unless you apply you don't have a chance
right absolutely we need to have posted
notes we could hold up a little awesome
so okay so we're just about done with
our live hangout and they are talking
about Google scholarships and I
basically want to end this because what
I like doing with these conversations is
having stuff that people that are
listening or watching the video later
can can really take away so I want each
one of you guys so think fast to give me
one one piece of advice that you would
tell someone who's you know waffling or
thinking about it on how they should you
know what they can do to improve their
chances and get a google scholarship and
Stephanie we'll start with you just to
get your response well again it's kind
of to reiterate what I'm saying earlier
to really just no just take advantage of
this opportunity and apply like the
first step is really to apply you never
know and be reviewed everything on a
case-to-case basis and so definitely
take the chance and apply and then from
there you know just really think about
what would give us a thorough overview
of your passion for CS and then again
your community involvement in your
leadership involvement as well think the
more we can see that you're all over
your overview of what you're involved
with the better your application will
look on our end awesome Jenny what do
you got I guess I'm just a probably
suggest you can take a look again at the
videos i mentioned before and we
actually have to now and one talks a bit
more about the scholarships and one
focuses more natural retreats itself and
i think the combination of bones will be
able to give students a good insight
into what it's actually all about and
get a chance to hear from previous
recipients themselves of what everything
is and just making decisions because I
think sometimes you when you see it from
someone's in your you know same boat as
you it's a bit more realistic rather
than just being a victory and something
just as you know as I've said just give
it a go and I think just take a look at
the application it's not as daunting as
it sounds you have to do three essays
but they're not essays it's more like
sort of a technical report then because
your dog didn't just finish our essays I
said that for me kidding azusa besides
do all of your essays what won't pieces
actually what I was going to give advice
on was was the sec sorry that that
actually is I mean I you know for me and
many of the reviewers who look at that
application I mean you know we look at
everything you know from your
transcripts and your resumes and things
like that but really the essays are
what's going to stand you apart from
other people because that's that
personal voice that you have and it you
know trust me it's really easy to tell
if you put in thought and effort into
your essay it's easy to tell those
people apart from those who just kind of
throw something together and sophie's
put thought into your essay we really
want to get a snapshot or you know just
more in-depth look as to who you are
don't be shy talk about your
accomplishments talk about what the
great thing that you've done it's really
interesting how some people the
references might say gluing things above
the applicant but then in the essay they
like barely touch upon any of that and
so really we want to hear the new one
you are please put on an effort into
your essay is Amon that will really go a
long way awesome cool well I'm going to
add a piece of advice just because have
you any different let's hang out here
right besides mentioning seeing seeing
the scholarship stuff on this hangout
people should definitely mention I
really think is a you nailed it as far
as I feel what I think about is like
this is your time to boast right talk
about those accomplishments get into the
details really sort of show off why why
Google should invest in you right and
help propel your education to get you
started and then when you're you know
when you're a little further on here
comes Jeff the recruiter when you're a
little further on and you're doing that
first resume put on your resume you got
a google scholarship right sounds great
people are going to see that in a while
Google set this person some money maybe
I should talk to them and so I really
think that it's the sort of thing that
it's a short-term win but it's a
long-term win and its really gonna going
to help you help propel your career
especially early on when you're just
getting started so that would be my tip
as well so talk it out I think that's
something we didn't cover as well it's
not related to recruitment process you
know that we don't have tied it together
but a lot of people you are scholars or
finest will go on at some point to have
an internship or a role here if you
think that Google could be a company
that you want to work out it's another
great opportunity to help see inside
absolutely yeah it's huge but open
otherway in the door absolutely cool
well guys we are just about at our end
time thank you so much for coming this
is our biggest hang out by the way
congratulations and again this is jeff
moore signing off from our google
hangout on the air with stephanie Jenny
in azusa and again thank you guys for
coming and hopefully you are flooded
with applications thank you see you guys
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
