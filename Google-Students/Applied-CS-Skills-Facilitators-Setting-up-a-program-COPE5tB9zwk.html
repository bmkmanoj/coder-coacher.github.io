look at what it takes to plan a great
applied CS program for students the most
successful programs are those that have
been designed with the students in mind
as a facilitator you are responsible for
the environment and experience of the
students this will be heavily influenced
by the decisions you make when planning
the program such as the unit or track
selection workshop cadence workshop
facilitation style and so on you can use
our program content in many different
ways to best fit the objectives for you
and your students you can select any
number of units to complete one two or
even six each unit activity is about
five hours of workshop time and covers
topics ranging from beginner to more
advanced concepts within data structures
and algorithms for those looking for a
more comprehensive program we also have
a selection of learning tracks each
consisting of five units and a code
sprint that are arranged by overall
difficulty level you can also choose the
best schedule for your students
workshops can be hosted on weekends or
weekdays during school term or outside
we've seen the program hosted over
consecutive weekends over a week and
even condensed into two days consider
student schedules to find a time to run
the program that suits them for example
scheduling a workshop the day before
finals exams doesn't always work well
before setting up a program be clear
about the CS experience level needed to
join the program knowing this should
allow you as a facilitator to pitch the
content in your program at the right
level and avoid having a group with a
wide variation and experience knowledge
and skills the learning objectives we
provide explain exactly what C
and Android concepts are covered in each
unit in order to help you make your
decision a good tip if you're unsure is
to go with the first level once you know
who your audience is and what the
program content will look like you can
start finding and arranging a space to
run the workshops and thinking about how
to market applied see us to gather
interested students if you're based at a
college or university it's often helpful
to approach faculty or staff to help you
navigate these issues and support your
program while it's totally up to you to
determine how many students should
participate we suggest keeping the
maximum participation under 40 so that
the workshop can be collaborative enough
while still being a manageable size to
facilitate we hope you found this video
on setting up an applied CS program
helpful and if you're interested in
learning more be sure to check out our
videos on tips and tricks for running
workshops and our guide to the resources
