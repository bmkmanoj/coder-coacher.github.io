Jessica I managed the Google students
page on Google+
it's the channel to go to for all news
and updates related to students in
Google so we post about internships
programs scholarships announcements and
one of the coolest things we talk about
is our internship program and today I'm
joined by some of the interns who we
featured this year in our diary of a
summer intern blog series we're gonna
start off by having them introduce
themselves one of them is actually
running late to work so we'll he'll join
us in a little bit but we're gonna start
with those of us who are here now so
we'll have them introduce themselves say
what university they go to and what
they're doing at Google and anything
else they want to share about us so
let's start with Franklin Franklin can
you talk a little bit louder I can't
hear you Google I'm a surf engineer
imagine matrix team imagine markets team
is typically assigned with coming up
with project projects in Africa
great
just like reliability engineering cool
come at you Pablo hi everybody Pablo I'm
now doing MBA at has University of
California Berkeley MIT on approval is
doing product marketing in the mobile
apps team and me mom to be awesome and
Rio last but not least and staying up
the latest for our hangout no hi my name
reowww I'm a second year masters student
at Stanford studying computer science
and yeah I'm going in from the Tokyo
office it's a little like midnight right
here but during my daytime hours I'm
actually an intern in the APM program
which is the associate product
management internship and specifically I
get to work on YouTube and within
YouTube a feature related to caption
very cool so we're gonna start off with
some general questions for each of you
since you all have such unique stories
of what brought you to Google Franklin
do you want to tell us a little bit
about what it's like working in the
Zurich office and maybe how you came to
Google and your experiences so far and
there's also a lot of fun is good and
just why don't you talk a little bit
about what it means to be an SRE and
your experiences as an SRE intern in
Pittsburgh the folks who are making sure
that all the stuff inside of Google is
working if something breaks internally
there who that page at 2:00 in the
morning
so as a consequence most of the stuff
that ya series work on it's not
necessarily user facing so you can't
really say I'm working on YouTube she's
really also but it's been it's a real
important x-ray beam because we've
learned so much about Google internals
because you're a knee deep and you know
fixing any problems that go wrong you
learn a lot about the infrastructure and
the part of the and how did you find out
about the asari internship because I
love the city and I was there already
for school and I wanted to stay for the
summer and one of the teams that
contacted me during the interview
process was the SRE team and I really
loved the project they had tall for me I
also moved people who previously work on
that team and they've outscored on being
really cool which I can say if they're
working for them for three months in
simply teacher so so yeah it was really
just activity cool um Pablo what about
as a grad intern I know we have a lot of
students who ask us about non
engineering roles and especially for
grad students can you talk about sort of
how your internship has been going maybe
how you heard about the job team here we
go
well the good thing about doing gadi
program sometimes is that Google comes
to projects in positions we have so the
process I guess is different from
engineers so basically Google comes to
University they show you how amazing
Google is and they get it everybody
excited to apply to Google and there's
our application application process is
very simple it's through the website and
the only thing that you need to know is
what to look at in there the jobs
website afterwards so it's not it's not
a big deal
and now once you're at Google I don't
think being an the other intern is
different from being an engineering even
your prominent self what I mean with
this is that Google is such a flat
organization that it doesn't matter how
what gives level of education is to say
it's just you talk to everybody
everybody talks to everybody everybody
has access to almost every
I never wasted well that here is taken
care of and you have a lot of speakers
serious engineers have their own we have
our own our own our expectations have
much focused on what we do basically
example but in the end is very really
very flat organization I would say that
they the English ship experience is not
really different from what and what sort
of work have you been doing on your team
the cell number so this time I've been
working on the mobile advertising team
as I said I mean I'm doing marketing so
one of the probe measures in the mobile
ads team wanted to know what's going on
in the local mobile advertisements play
with other companies doing what I'm some
startups doing that is exciting and cool
and my work was one of the four examples
were working on what people are doing
outside in this space and how can Google
to do better space for abs I had and
that's one project and another produce
that in the mobile and the taxing team
we have a huge initiative for this goal
more that helps businesses to go mobile
to have mobile optimized site and I they
want to need to create a dashboard that
could comprehensively measure the
success of this initiative worldwide and
that's huge because there it's already
launched in more than 20 markets there
is a lot of data sequence you're going
to just it's difficult to find the data
that you mean see if the campaign has
been successful so this is having my
team in place sounds exciting
yeah in Rio our Stanford student who is
all the way over in Tokyo how is that
transition to heading to another
continent for your internship and how's
how's your internship been going so far
all right it's been it's been going
really great I think it's it's one of
those privileges that Google provides
both in full-time employees and interns
to be able to work within this sort of
Google
googley sort of the way public talked
about this sort of flat
company structure pretty much anywhere
in the world and Tokyo is no exception I
get to work alongside Japanese engineers
as well as American engineers that
people come in and out a lot from
different offices and so it's really
nice to be able to interact with so many
different people kind of like what
Franklin mentioned working out of the
Zurich office one nice thing about Tokyo
is that there's so much to do outside of
the office as well I'm sure it applies
to a lot of places around the world too
but Tokyo is it has a lot of glamour and
glitz and the Tokyo office itself is
actually located in one of the more
vibrant parts of the city so you just
have to go out of the office and you
have tons and tons of places when I go
II have fun so yeah it's been really
been really fun cool well that's great
timing Luke has decided to join us we
have Luke here hey how's it going guys
bold intern do you want to introduce
yourself and say where you go to school
what you're working on yeah absolutely
hey guys my name is Luke Fernandes I'm a
senior at the University of Texas in
Austin and with double major in finance
and film so lots to choose from I'm
working at a team called interactive
solutions at YouTube they kind of manage
all the large marketing campaigns so all
the live streams for festivals all the
contests and all the aggregate channels
they just kind of oversee the
implementation of all those so it's been
a really great summer and I'm really
excited to talk to everyone cool so we
just went over sort of like what people
have been working on this summer and I
know you just got back from Lollapalooza
yeah you want to tell us a little bit
about how that went and what you were
doing to prepare for that yeah
absolutely so like I said my team runs
all the streams for the big music
festivals and our most recent one was
this past weekend have all lose it so
before the festival there's a lot of
talks that go and pretty much just
coordinating the design for the channel
that the livestream actually runs on so
there's actually a channel through all
who's a youtube.com slash Lollapalooza
where the stream happens and it shows
two different stages at once all
throughout the entire day a bunch of
different artists playing so it's just
working with the sponsor and the partner
just to make sure that that channel's
the
filled for the festival and Thad's and
all the other sponsorships across it
okay and but then when we actually get
to the festival it's all about just kind
of updating the channel and watching the
feed making sure everything's dynamic
and making sure that it's all today on
the second day there was a huge
thunderstorm at Lollapalooza and they
actually had to evacuate everyone from
the festival including us and when we
came back they our production truck was
flooded so we couldn't turn it on or the
entire festival would have blown up so
naturally we didn't so we got it back on
for the very very last song and we were
able to get this stream from Red Hot
Chili Peppers back up the headliner for
that night so everyone was really
excited yeah says a lot of time spent in
the truck but I'm also on my breaks is
really really awesome because we were
like with YouTube and etc we got chief
crew passes which meant we could get
backstage in front shades for any shows
and very cool yeah as the great Sun
awesome talk about some bumps in the
road that you had to not be yeah okay so
we're gonna go with questions that we've
gotten from some of our followers the
first one is asking what the most
challenging part of your internship has
been so we have a lot of questions to go
through we're not gonna have everyone
answer them but let's start with Rio
since I know you have some experiences
you could talk about in terms of
challenges you've encountered well I
think one of the things that's
interesting is the APM program and the
internship program for APM is really it
two throws you into the deep end of a
pool and you're interested with a lot of
responsibility so what a product manager
does is essentially tries to make a
feature or a product that someone comes
up with an idea for they want to make it
usable for four people and in order to
prefer to actually get into the hands of
normal everyday users you need to go
through obviously making the product but
there's all sorts of other things like
how do you publicize it how do you
market it does it make business sense
who is it gonna impact is it going going
I'm tech only a small percentage of
people or is it going to impact the
whole entire world also to the question
and I was given this responsibility of
tackling captions on YouTube and trying
to say okay
captions are great how do we get more
people to use captions and that's a very
broad question to give an intern and it
was really for the first couple weeks I
was like wow this is a big big challenge
how do I go about actually making it and
transforming it into something that I
can show and you know roll out that was
that was probably my biggest challenge
you're really thrown in the deep end
there we kind of like to do that I mean
you only have a few weeks with us we got
to throw you in right away and sink your
spoon but you also you'll be doing
really well that's the goal Jess I think
you said you could also share a bit
about your experiences there's been a
lot of stuff to pick up on a lot of
Google internal tools and infrastructure
and all this stuff that you just get
completely submerged in you know we're
tossing to this giant could basically
you've never seen before so I think the
hardest part about my thinking so far
it's just been getting up to speed and
doing it quickly because the interns are
they're so short it's you know twelve
weeks give or take so you really have to
hit the ground running yeah and Franklin
did you have a story you wanted to share
about something that's been challenging
for you and you want to be just the inch
and who came and that so you want to
come and do something maybe that's a I
want to be the person into the test
coverage from 70% to 100% introduce a
new feature or something you know to
leave a mark for you to be able to come
up with a balance you have to be able to
consume or thing for those enemies
that's love to you oh you're back
sorry I don't know what happened there
can you guys hear me and see me I'm in
here twice now this is yeah one of
them's a cell friend weird
okay sorry continue on yeah so things to
pick up on and like do something maybe
something gentle my biggest challenge
anything to process all the most all the
information given and you'll be able to
make something out of it
be able to be Kentucky's and and do some
maybe do something productive that's the
husband attorneys apart
he's a young student so little time I
like that you don't want to be the
intern who just came in left right want
to make your impact okay let's go on to
the next question
how about Pablo you can tackle this one
how have you been able to find a balance
between work and play google has a lot
of awesome benefits for their employees
how have you been able to sit yourself
down to get work done and then also
meander across the way to a free concert
like we had yesterday
it's not easy that's really a good
question but I think I guess rulers are
people who are responsible and who like
what they do so it's not not so much
about finding him I might say hey I need
to work it's ours I think there's a lot
of flexibility there so it's basically
they expect you to get your work done
and they don't curse so much at least in
my experience is a person works a lot
when you do it how to do it out where
you do it so you can see people working
from the bank benches outside because
it's sunny outside so it's not like the
classical office environment that you
need to see that I'm not both great
hours you can have a lot of time with my
case I've been playing a certain TV
among them you so I go to play soccer
and that's my free time and everybody
knows that I play soccer on Tuesdays at
1:00 p.m. I really like say that they
encourage you to do that so it's not so
much that you need to give me like the
fight for you just you're encouraged to
do stuff outside I mean they expect you
to be responsible and to be just who
believe in that sense though it's not I
don't think it's a big deal so you can
do it everyone can do it if you're
responsible enough and you know where
how we're do find the violence actually
yeah good answer um let's see we have a
we've quite a few questions to get there
so we're gonna move on to the next one
which is what's your favorite part about
working at Google and I know all of you
probably want to answer this but we'll
go to Rio and Tokyo for this okay so I
think my favorite part is being
able to really see sort of highlighting
what public talked about the flat
structure it's really easy to be able to
talk to other people in Google and sort
of say come up to them and say hi I have
a question or here you know I'd like to
get to know you more and what's
interesting here in Tokyo is that you
see a lot of people come from different
cultures and sort of like for example a
lot of Japanese students or students who
lived in the United States come back and
they work for Google and when you talk
to them there's so many ideas so many
different cultures that come up and it's
really a humbling experience in that
regard to be able to talk to people and
be easy you know be able to have a
conversation really easily inside the
office okay Lou can put you on the spot
what's your favorite part about working
at Google yeah it's really tough um you
know this is my second summer here and
when I first came to Google I think my
favorite thing by far was the food I'm
an absolute fatty and just love food and
really really take advantage of all the
food but by the end of last summer I
really found that is the people and
that's honestly what most people will
say who Fortier for a while is just that
there's nothing that beats the people
here everyone's so innovative and smart
but clever and quirky and kind of weird
in their own way every day is like a
really interesting day so it's
definitely on the people that I've had
to work with like I love the content I
work on and I love my function but if it
weren't for the people like my days
wouldn't be as great as they were cool
what about the next question we have is
what skills have you gained at Google
that you plan to take back to school
we'll start with Jess for this one sake
doesn't awesome segue from Luke because
I think the skill I'm going to take just
role of the ability to ask people who
know more than me come see I mentioned
before they look the most challenging
part of my internship has been you know
just learning everything and getting up
to speed and I feel like sometimes
especially I'm like really competitive
school programs there could be a sense
of not running tax for help because one
do you know you're you're competing to
try to get into grants
we'll try to get good dogs but I found
that at Google people are so friendly so
willing to help that one of the things I
really came to terms with was that it's
a really good idea to ask people to
explain things to you and you will
bounce ideas off bug and I think that's
something that a lot of schools try to
foster but it can be harder in that kind
of environment cuz I feel like it's
inherently more competitive so yeah I
think being able to learn when you're
this age you always at a positional
method that lets you talk to people
that's to my eye computer science
background learn how to just generally
and I'm gonna follow up with you on
another question this one came from
Emmanuel and Kenya he's wondering as a
software engineering intern what sort of
skill set did you find useful during
your internship so do you could you
expand upon that
working on watching working with tools
and I we can't really can be able to you
have private and do something innovating
as well you need to medial superior very
to being able to be flexible enough to
manny new stuff able to pick up a new
technologies and yeah you should be able
to be done fast great so let's move on
to a very popular question this is from
michelle in malaysia
we're gonna go to just first answer this
so how did you prepare for your
interview daunting google interview how
did you prepare terrified you're gonna
find it's the same way where if you get
really nervous before a big test you
many other chance of messing up things
that you know for sure so i think of
anything you can do to make yourself
feel more confident in your ability is
whether that's you know reading through
your textbooks or your notes or your
practice problems whatever it is to make
you feel comfortable walking into the
best thing you can do and at least in
terms of coding engineers it's really
helpful to be familiar with coding on
the whiteboard coding at your computer
is way different from coding at a
whiteboard and it's just a completely
different skill and it's something you
really need to practice so i am
fortunate enough to teach during the
semesters I'm a TA so I do lots of code
on the whiteboards when I keep in
situations and during office hours but
it's not something you find yourself
doing get a friend or you can just do it
yourself and try it practice for the
decibel you need to pick up and it's
gonna be really useful if you are
already comfortable with doing and by
the time you get in the run with your
interviewer that's great advice we
always tell students to practice coding
on whiteboards real what about you what
helped you prepare for your interview I
mean just said most of it I was going to
say I became really good friends with
the white board and even for APM program
which is there's a good portion of it is
technical but there's also a portion of
it where you have to think about
products and how you would make
something work in the real world and I'm
a very visual person
for those who want to communicate ideas
in a visual way using a whiteboard is
really essential so I definitely would
encourage that too
ok and let's go to the non-engineering
site so Pablo Luke what did you guys do
to help prepare for your interviews what
was that like well my case I think
they're I would say be things that they
look for for some goals or for an intern
one thing is that you love technology
get passionate about this industry that
you're passionate about this the second
thing is they want to see the geared
good for this for Google standards and
that's something that you need to show
you with a sometimes it needs that
people that are graduate students are
familiar with and the first thing that
they see they they want to see is that
they're your googly so what does that
mean a lot of people ask me that
so googly means that you're someone that
can deliver but as also it's has
integrity is fun to work with but yeah
but even deliver so it's the same thing
that big work work farik's well
understand we talked before you want it
one your while working but also delivers
so the way I would prepare for the
intern or the interviews BP first we all
know that what Google about the products
what they do and what I did I did a list
of cool products I I didn't come and say
hey what do I like how do I like them or
do I another column said why do I like
them why do I hate them
I'm working chains so that got me into
learning a little bit more about all the
products who's going to be you know one
from the chrome team from AdWords you
know so it's good to know a little bit
about everything
good advice what about you look you've
been back this is your second summer at
Google so clearly your interviews have
gone well what have you done to her
I hope they did well I think it's a it's
what like he said like it's it's fit and
knowledge so it's fit like are you
googly are you gonna fit in you know are
are you all these above qualities
these smart but quirky very lot of
integrity but it's also knowledge I mean
you definitely have to know your stuff
if you're interviewing for a certain
team like I did enterprise or YouTube
like you really have to know that
product is in you now you have to expect
questions like what would you do to make
the product better you know what would
you you know what's your favorite part
of something what's your least favorite
part of something etc and you know I
learned that lesson kind of the hard way
my very first interview last year for
enterprise I got a question along the
lines of like what's your favorite
product or what what's the product that
that you that you like a lot with in
enterprise and I gave I was extremely
ready for this question gave like a huge
spiel and you know how much I love this
certain product and how great it was
because of X Y Z and after I was done
the guy was like that was really great
but that wasn't an enterprise product
and it was just kind of really awkward I
mean he gave me he gave me another shot
and you know afterwards he told me like
you know you got it wrong but it's
really well delivered and you obviously
know about the company so do your
research before the next interview and
know that product into now so that's a
good learning story yeah people are
listening in to that okay so the last
thing I want us to go over so you've
already been in for about 30 minutes now
for anyone who just sort of press play
and is watching or hangout we're joined
by some of our awesome Google interns
you guys wait say hello to everyone
who's watching and they're based in time
zones all over the world we have
Franklin and Zurich Jess's in Pittsburgh
Luke's here and San Bruno Pablo's and
Mountain View and Rio is in Tokyo so
we've got all our bases covered across
all of our global offices Lamar not all
of them most of them and we're gonna
finish up by having each of them sort of
give a sh feel on what's a day in the
life like for you so take us through
sort of average day I know at Google
it's very hard to have an average day
because things come up all the time so
let's just try and be like a quick
version of what what's an average day
like for you so Franklin do you want to
kick things off
sounds like a fun day what's your
reading documentation or we need
somebody to bounce ideas off of but I
get some good solid working from 12:00
to 6:00 and then I'll snare for work
sometimes they can follow some things my
co-workers call all right what's your
doing right so in the Bay Area in
Mountain View in San Bruno and all these
offices
google has shuttles that run across the
entire area and pick people up at
different parts of the city and then
bussed them to their respective offices
so I have the option of either either
hopping on an 8 or 10 o'clock bus and
depending on what I do is depending on
if I eat breakfast so get here eat a
warm breakfast sit down at my desk and
you know check my emails and then I'll
probably have a few meetings in the
morning and go to those and then after
the meetings I'll come back and shoot a
few golf balls on the putting green
right in front of my desk and then come
back to my desk and then probably work
on my projects for a few hours and go to
lunch which is
my favorite part of the day always and
then get back from lunch you know check
up on emails again go to a few more
meetings get out of those meetings and
do a few laps around the office on a
scooter and then go upstairs and play a
game of pool I take this like one
30-minute break every day in the
afternoon where I literally take a lap
on the scooter and then play like a game
sometimes to a pool and then come back
and work on my projects sync up with the
want managers get on the shuttle to go
home and have a huge smile on my face
and do it all over again the next day
yeah sometimes we get to see Fitz and
the Tantrums sometimes were you here
yesterday for that uh yeah for a bit of
it yeah that was pretty fun that was a
good good example of work-life balance
here at Google
all right Pablo how about you so you
make is very similar you could in the
morning I get here around 8:30 and a
half a warm breakfast which is great so
some bacon every morning and then yeah I
stopped so you get you have meetings you
check your email you have some meetings
you see how that product is evolving
what the next lunches are gonna be in
the product and organize and teams to
see how I'm marketing it up but I can
help with a lunch in the end and then
you have these people when you work on
your own with your product with your
work on that for a few hours and you go
to lunch and the other thing about
Google is that you can have lunch with
almost anyone so you can contact someone
find someone on the Internet
say hey I want I'm interested in what
you're working on and we don't and talk
about it no easy yes so you go to lunch
with anyone you want funny office and
then you come back give you some more
work and then we take the shuttle back
to Mystic which is where I get very cool
last but not least Rio what's it like in
Tokyo average day um so I I live about
15 minutes away from the office I walk
here get in around 9:00 one of the
interesting things of working in a
remote office is the timezone difference
and so most of my emails actually come
in from Mountain View or San Bruno
which are the two teams that I usually
work with most often they come in while
I'm asleep so from like midnight to 7:00
so when I wake up and check my email
I've got this ton of emails that need
addressing so most of those I you know
try to get out of the way as soon as I
can
I also end up living fairly in advance
of like I'm planning out a week or two
maybe a couple more weeks in advance so
I'm trying to to see what needs to be
scoped out so I do scheduling of
meetings brought in at the same time but
otherwise it's really similar I have
lunch the food here is really good and
they have really good food like special
menu items on the on certain days and
yeah and then afternoons are pretty much
a lot of meetings as well and trying to
do some brainstorms as well so sometimes
I'll ask for other people to join in for
a brainstorm and say okay here's what I
want to do what you think like obviously
I can't be the one only making or
thinking of ideas and so a lot of those
captain and then yeah dinner here is
good too so it's really easy to end up
staying here
fairly late so when I do that I'd that's
the crown for dinner and before that
usually around 4 o'clock I'll pull in
another intern who's worked there's a
couple couple interns here and so I'll
play pool on the on limo floors I still
suck at pool one skills that you have
not developed as much about at all I
mean really bad okay so I'm gonna put
you on the spot with one more question
if you had to sum up your internship at
Google and three words it can be like a
phrase or three different words that
describe your internship what would you
use for those three words and if anyone
wants to go first they can but if not
I'm just gonna put one of you on the
spot and you have to pick your three
words
I could go fast perfect I can see I know
I love it that's a good luck no presure
for the rest of you but that's a good
one
I'll have I have one it's a humbling one
so much impact so much impact that's
another great one I hear that a lot from
interns and I like I like to hear that
okay the last three who's gonna go next
all girls all right look it's um just so
googly just so good at this I didn't
give you this question beforehand I was
interested to see what you came up with
all right Justin Pablo okay
learned so much that encapsulates a lot
okay Pablo no pressure okay
I taste so much different so much a
difference hopefully in a good way I
don't know if that's gonna be like
