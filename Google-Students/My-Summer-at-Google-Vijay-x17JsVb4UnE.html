made an impact at Google I go to Rice
University I major computer science I'm
graduating in 2013 my hometown is Little
Rock Arkansas and the team that I'm
working on this year is the ID
verification I work for the ID
verification team and it's under the
spam abuse team so don't worry we don't
spend sent out the spammage of use we
just ensure that people get the highest
quality service possible whenever they
sign up for google product so it's about
sharing integrity of the products
honestly speaking of my favorite thing
is probably the free food I always think
my school invested like 10 times more
money like this Sofia kind of food but
in general like I love the work
environment there's so many conveniences
that sometimes you don't even feel like
you're working it makes for really great
experience
at Google what I found is you know you
have the opportunity to work on so many
different projects and you know even if
say one doesn't end up to be successful
the next one that you work on can be
truly impactful so in that sense you're
always sort of kept on your toes it's
always excited for the challenge
personally being an intern here I
definitely felt like I have made an
impact my team the true for beauty of
interning at Google is that the
environment is so great that you
naturally work hard and truly make an
impact in whatever it is that you're</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
