problems with binary search trees is
that they can very quickly become
unbalanced this increases the time it
takes to perform operations on the data
structure this problem was recognized in
several strategies were researched to
make sure the binary search trees stayed
balanced in this video we'll focus on
one of these called AVL trees that was
discovered in the 1960s when it comes to
binary trees balanced means that the
height difference between the left
subtree and the right subtree is never
more than one the difference is known as
the balance factor should the balance
factor exceed one then what are more
rotations will need to take place to
address this there are four different
rotations which can occur left rotation
this is used when too many nodes are
larger than the root right rotation this
is used when too many nodes are smaller
than the root the following rotations
make use of the two already shown
rotations to solve more complex
situations left-right rotation this
starts off by performing a left rotation
creating a situation which can be solved
by a right rotation
right left rotation the last rotation
starts off by performing a rotation
which set the tree in a state which can
be solved by a left rotation trees are
recursive structures containing sub
trees these rotations will only be
applied to the unbalanced sub tree in
most situations there will be no need to
restructure the entire tree good luck on
your work with AVL trees
