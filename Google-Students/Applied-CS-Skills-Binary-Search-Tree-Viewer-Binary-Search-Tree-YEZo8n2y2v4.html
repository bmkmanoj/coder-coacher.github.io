have already heard of the tree data
structure it's a way to organize data in
a hierarchical way a tree has a route
with child nodes nodes without any
children are called leaves the main
differentiating characteristic of a
binary tree is that the number of
children a node can have is limited to
two because there's only two children we
classify them as either a left child or
a right child a binary search tree is a
special type of binary tree that follows
this rule the value stored in the left
child and all of its descendants is
always less than the value of the
current node and the value stored in the
right child is always greater than the
value stored in the parent node in this
example five is the parent node seeing
as three is less than five it will be
stored in the left child when we insert
eight it will be stored as the right
child as eight is greater than five
thanks to this hierarchy being enforced
without exception it's possible to
search the tree quickly using a binary
search without ever having to backtrack
let's say we want to find the node
containing 30 in this binary search tree
we start by comparing 30 to 20 30 is
greater than 20 and we therefore look to
the right child we once again make
another comparison this time between 30
and 32 given that 30 is less than 32 we
look to the left child where we find 27
seeing as 30 is greater than 27 we look
to the right child where we find 30 what
about adding value then just as in a
search we trace the tree until we find
the correct position for the new node in
an unbalanced tree the new node will
always be added as a leaf consequently
the average time complexity for a search
or an insertion is o of log n but the
worst case time complexity first search
is o of n where n is the height of a
tree this becomes especially problematic
when the tree is severely unbalanced as
in this example there are several
strategies that can be used to avoid
this problem one of them is called an
AVL watch the video on AVL trees to
