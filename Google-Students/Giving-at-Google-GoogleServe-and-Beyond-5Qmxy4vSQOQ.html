joining us for today's event about
giving at Google Google serve and Beyond
or thrilled today to have Diane and
Megan from Google org joining us and
they're going to be talking to us a
little bit about the culture of giving
it Google our global monthly service
event that we have every year called
Google serve as well as we'll talk about
how you can get involved in your
community and we'll talk also about
student serve and so do you want to go
and introduce yourself Diane Shore hi
everybody I'm Diane Solinger and I have
the privilege of leading the Googler
engagement team here at Google org
google.org is the philanthropic arm of
Google and I work alongside Megan who
can share a little bit about herself and
what her role is on the Google work team
hi everyone I like Diane mentioned we
work on getting Googlers involved with
giving and volunteering in their local
communities in particular I help run our
to global campaigns one which is Google
serve which we'll talk a little bit more
about later on
it's our month of service that we're
currently in now where we get Googlers
all around the world to give back to
local local organizations and then in
December we run a campaign that similar
called giving week which aims to get
Googlers giving money to their favorite
nonprofit organizations I think the
interesting thing about Google is one we
were born a global company so all our
programs are always global global so
that everybody can participate every
Googler should be able to have a
philanthropic outlet and we really
believe in that for google.org our
mission really is to make sure that
we're bringing the power of Google's
people products and our resources to
have significant impact on critical
problems around the world and internally
we really want to create this culture
and fuel this movement of giving and
volunteering among Googlers because I
actually believe that most people want
to do great things in the world and so
we want to give people that outlet and
we believe that the company has a role
in making sure that people have that
platform to do so so that's what Megan
and I spend our days trying to do
finding great ways for people to get
involved in their local communities and
to solve big problems with their
skills and talent absolutely and we do
want to keep this session really
interactive so be sure to submit any
questions you have for Diana and Megan
in the comments section below
and at the end of the session we'll go
ahead and go through those answers as
many questions as we can before we jump
in even further I'd love to know a
little bit about your backgrounds before
coming to google.org or even within
google.org how did you come into these
roles and really find your passion to
empower Googlers and people all over the
world to give back yeah go ahead yeah
I'll start with that um so I have been
at Google for about six years now and
prior to joining Google I worked for a
legal nonprofit where I helped run the
volunteer recruitment program there and
that was my first job out of college
when I started college I actually wanted
to go into sports broadcasting and after
taking a couple of social justice
courses I quickly learned that my
interest in passioned were really more
than nonprofit world and wanting to help
others kind of realize their passions as
well and so after being at the nonprofit
for about three years I started looking
for other opportunities and just
stumbled upon Google and I first joined
thinking I would maybe just stay at
Google for about a year it was a
recruiting position so something
completely outside of the nonprofit
realm and as soon as I joined Google I
realized that the company really cares
about helping Googler x' work on
whatever they're passionate about and so
I quickly met Diane and Diane's team who
was helping Googlers get involved in all
of these different areas and after being
here for about a year helped to run
Google serve I wasn't all into yes it
was not my day job um and after about
four and a half years of working with
Diane and her team not as a day job I
finally was able to join the team
full-time and
it's been really great yeah it didn't
interesting journey a lot of people
within Google start somewhere else and
they migrate towards something else
within the company I came in as a
referral from someone who is on my team
so someone on my team met at Glenelg
managed actually referred me and he's
actually the founder of Google serve so
Seth Marvin referred me into Google I
was giving him and another woman on our
team a little bit of advice as a
consultant on the outside but I was in
the not-for-profit or the NGO sector for
over 25 years Wow and was consulting
with companies to help them build these
types of programs mostly tech companies
so I was lucky that Google was not only
a client but became my new employer just
about five years ago next week will be
five years for me hope congratulations
yeah that's exciting I mean the mobility
within the company to pursue your
passions and then having external
expertise and bringing that to Google
those are two very common themes that we
see with careers at Google so wonderful
hear your story yeah fantastic so I
guess I can pick it back up and we can
talk a little bit about the the way
Google org makes our investments as I
mentioned where the we're the
philanthropic arm of the charitable arm
of the company and so we say investment
because we really think of this like
social investment we have a large budget
where we donate to charities NGOs
nonprofits around the world really with
this approach of trying to look at
technology as a game changer looking at
really disruptive innovation within the
space it's not just a grant but it's
really where can technology move that
organization further on their social
mission we are like Google so our
criteria is very much around data and
scale and for us because we are the
charitable arm really look at you know
who are the people being left out where
are the most disadvantaged populations
we want to bridge that gap through a
tech data-driven strategy and then be
also because we're the gen worm we look
at the NGO sector the nonprofit sector
is where we're going to make those
investments so we bring capital but we
also bring our people Googlers skills
can really help an organization move
forward and then other expertise as well
to kind of wrap our arms around these
investments
give them the best of Google and we try
to focus just like most companies we've
gone through this internal process of
just trying to figure out where can we
have the most impact and so we've landed
on four key areas where we think that
Google can move the needle the most and
from place to place around the world
education looks very different for what
the tech I we're trying to look at
investments in technology for education
to democratize education around the
world economic opportunity is another
key focus area for us because jobs of
the future are going to be technology
jobs and so we want to make sure that
people understand those opportunities
and as a company what our
responsibilities might be around that
inclusion particularly on the areas of
racial justice very important to Google
we've made some very public investments
in this space and continue to do so this
should be a world for everyone and
crisis response when there's a crisis
people turn to Google we need to be
there for them so we really focus on
crisis response as an area particularly
when there's something gone awry or
something tragic in a community um so
really to kind of take it from our
investment strategy down to our people
strategy Google our engagement for
google.org means we're going to get
behind these pillars that I just
mentioned these focus areas and our
grantees and give them that big hug with
our people and the other thing that we
do is because we want to make sure that
this is a continued you know wonderful
place to work where we have a culture
where people care about each other and
care about the world no trick nurturing
a culture of volunteering and giving is
really important as well and that's
where the big campaigns that Megan leads
come in so I'm going to hand it over to
her to talk about the big one that we're
in right now which is Google serve a
month of service all of June Google
serve think so before before I jump in
and talk about Google service
specifically as Diane mentioned we care
a lot about the culture here at Google
and making sure people feel like they
have an outlet to give back in the
community and so um the campaigns are
just one way to get involved they're
sort of our biggest like at scale
giving in volunteering moment but
outside of that we encourage Googlers to
to get involved throughout the year with
personal organizations that they care
about so whether that's volunteering at
their kids school or helping out at a
local food bank and we want Google serve
and giving week our to pinnacle
campaigns to sort of be a springboard
for ongoing volunteering and giving we
also really encourage Google Earth to
get involved on a board if they want to
kind of go the extra mile and and kind
of reach their their next step in their
philanthropic journey but have really a
ton of different opportunities for for
Googlers to to give back and so as Diane
mentioned Seth Marvin who is part of our
team ten years ago had an idea for this
amazing cultural event at Google he
thought it would be a really great way
for Googlers to all join together
globally with a day of service and he
wanted to call it Google server Palooza
and just this gives a great example of
Google's culture and how really you know
if you have an idea if there's something
that you're really passionate about that
you want to work on you can really make
it happen and the idea gained a lot of
traction and quickly they realized that
they would need more than a day and so
they organized our first-ever Google
serve was a week of service back then
and where I think it was 30 offices at
the time participated in different
volunteering opportunities to get
Googlers engaged that year we had 3,000
Googlers participate and now as we're
celebrating our tenth anniversary of the
program we have over 20,000 Googlers
that are signed up and it's taking place
in over 100 offices around the world
and so it really is a special time where
not only we can encourage Googlers to
get involved in in some cases it might
be their first time ever volunteering
for other Googlers there they've been
doing Google server for a long time they
found kind of their their philanthropic
passions and they are helping lead
projects now and get others involved but
really we have we have opportunities at
every end of this
spectrum as Diane mentioned we have our
new social impact pillars that we're
trying to closely closely align with and
so it's really this balance of you know
letting Googlers volunteer with
organizations that they're passionate
about and for those that maybe don't
know what they want to do and providing
suggestions that align in these areas of
impact because we believe that like
Diane mentioned when Googlers give their
skills to an organization that that is
really the most beneficial use for for
these charities and nonprofits and I
think what's really cool about is the
grassroots nature of it not just that
stuff has had this idea and it started
there but that Googlers around the world
are creating their own projects we can't
possibly as a small core team create all
these projects for twenty thousand and
more Googlers to do in a month so
there's a lot of grassroots efforts and
ownership and I think you know we like
to think as owners here at Google this
is one way that people can step up and
take a leadership role and run a project
and get people involved and it's great
for that team culture you know as
someone who is newer to a team say one
of their teammates is really passionate
says let's all get together and spend a
day you know instead of our normal
meetings and working on our projects
instead you know get out in the
community and do something together it's
great for small teams large teams and to
be able to share your passions you know
Google we bring our whole selves to work
so sharing your you know philanthropic
passions you know as your co-workers is
a huge part of it yeah I think you know
it totally is I think that being able to
give back to the community is great but
I think being able to sort of foster
that relationship with your teammates
and and do it together is a really
important part of not only Google serve
but team volunteering throughout the
year and I think to Diane's point about
Googlers just really coming together and
helping to pull this off like I
mentioned earlier I started out as a as
a Google server volunteer helping with
Diane's team and and we have over a
hundred Googlers you spend 20 percent of
their time working totally outside of
their day job helping to to pull off
this campaign
and that's you know mobilizing other
Googlers to create projects and making
sure that we have all of the appropriate
marketing material and communications
and so we're really useable utilizing
Googlers from all over the company to
help pull off a campaign like this so
it's really pretty special really is
it's a great time my favorite time of
the year Google for sugar did you make
it like it's the most and again in
November we're giving away so we thought
it might be helpful to end by talking
about how you might be able to create
your own volunteering opportunity and so
I think the most important thing is
being able to identify a non-profit and
identify what that nonprofit needs and
once you've done that you know you can
figure out how much time the nonprofit
is needing is it something that you can
organize you know in one afternoon
by bringing 10 10 others with you to to
the nonprofit is it something that they
need a little bit of extra love and
support you know maybe a week or maybe
it's an ongoing and ongoing opportunity
that they need help with
so really identifying where that
nonprofit could use your your help and
then you know what particular challenges
are they trying to address and then how
can you make sure you get the right
people there who have the skills to to
help out with that and so you can see on
the sign that we put together just a
couple of examples if you know a
non-profit for example is looking for
fundraising support and you might find a
few folks you can help put together a
marketing plan for them and you know
this would be ideally people that have
skills or experience working in in
marketing or working in sales and then
can really help sort of identify you
know what the nonprofit is is looking
for and how to kind of craft that
personal fundraising plan for for the
nonprofit and I think you know there are
a lot of different ways that that you
can work together to to come up with
projects that that folks can get
involved but the biggest thing is really
kind
like Diane mentioned matching together
what the nonprofit needs and matching it
with with the right skills and that's
really where the magic happens for the
nonprofit absolutely that's wonderful
and I think you know the first step is
really just to try something right it's
to just to say what's something that I
know about in my community that I can
try see how it goes and then you know
you can take the next step from there to
try different types of for three
different types of giving different you
know lengths of service and things like
that and bringing in the right people to
help you - I think is is a really
important thing because we all have
different different skills and different
passions and I think in particular when
we can bring we can bring folks together
who have a different set of skills and
work directly with one nonprofit that's
where we see a lot of a lot of great
things happen as well reminds me of a
friend of ours his name is Chris Jarvis
and he and Angela Parker run an
organization called realized Wars and
they talk about the volunteer journey
and there's three stages and some people
start at different stages but a lot of
people start at the first stage which he
calls the trout the tourist there's a
tourist there's a traveler and there's a
guide and the tourist is someone who
goes in once and just kind of looks at
things and like does the thing and
leaves the traveler is the one that
comes back and start visualizing that
like could be better organized maybe we
need to remove the chairs maybe you
don't recognize the room and comes back
and repeats and then the guide is the
one that steps up and brings others
along with them and goes back with
others and I think some people start as
a guide very rarely so if your starting
is that tourist you do have to just
start somewhere but ask those questions
in that and that charitable organization
or that knockoff or NGO like what is
keeping you guys up at night and like
yeah I really love that we came here and
planted this garden or did this project
but is this like the most critical thing
for your organization how can how can I
bring others that to make this better
for you and start that journey to get
maybe to having more guides out in the
world that would be great and speaking
of you know your journeys we also want
to talk about how you can get involved
in the month of June as Googler
all over the world are giving back
Google serve you can get involved with
student serve so you can volunteer all
over the world and go ahead and share
with us exactly how you're doing it so
you can take action as a participant in
the project so you can help spread the
word about a project because really you
know a huge part of giving is not just
giving your individual time or effort or
expertise but it's helping that
organization you know expand their reach
expand their resources you may tap into
you know groups of people that are
really interested in helping but didn't
know it existed so spreading the word
and really finding out about related
activities as well so you know not just
giving in the month of June for Google
serve or students serve but you know
seeing if you can make that a part of
you're a part of your routine
I think one thing I would add to that
too is we find you know if you're really
excited about this and you're wanting to
get involved with more ways to give back
to the community um but you don't know
how you want you don't want to do it
alone or you want to bring others with
you really the best way to get people
involved is to invite them we've just
had the most success getting Googlers
all around the world giving back by
asking them to join us and so um
especially with with the social
environment that we live in in social
media really leveraging that to to get
others to join here as well absolutely
starting to lead a project you know
making sure that you know people that
you're participating with know how to
share and know how share what they're
doing in the world it's great so as you
are getting out in your local
communities and participating in this
service we love for you to share your
experiences with the hashtag student
serve be sure to tag Google students as
well and you know share it across all
your social media platforms we'd love to
see as Googlers are doing service all
over the world in June and Beyond we'd
love to see what you all are doing in
your local communities with the hashtag
student serve so do be sure to share
that and I think next we'll go ahead and
jump into some of the live questions
that are coming in from our audience so
that we can get straight to those so the
first question is and this is really
starting it's kind of square one how do
I first get involved to the project and
find the first thing to try for
student serve well I'll start you at on
that we may be similar who knows Oh
start with yourself first what do I care
about and then yeah Google search maybe
that's a place to start and look for
organizations in your community that are
focused on that issue ask your friends
like what do they support what are they
interested in today know a good
organization because socials really
important I think for finding something
that validates an organization and then
there are some organizations out in the
world that actually help matchmake so
there's the points of light Institute
which has hands-on affiliates hands-on
affiliates all around the world and they
broke our volunteer opportunities and
local communities so you can just plug
into something volunteer match is a
portal that you can go and look and
actually look within like a certain mile
radius of where you live or work and go
to school and find a place to volunteer
maybe there's a project there that would
tap your interest and speaking of tap
there's an organization called tap root
so tapper actually is really much like
using consulting skills relying on
people to bring their strengths and
their skills to help nonprofits and
charities with big like business issues
that they might be having and so it's a
cohort so you end up with a group of
people all trying to solve maybe
something like Megan saying like like a
marketing plan and bring people around
with their skills to do that so those
are just a couple organizations that can
help on the ground if you're looking for
like a gateway but Google search will
work for you do that's great all right
next question is what are some examples
of projects that have been done at
Google serve it could be fun if we
shared maybe one that we've done or one
that you know of it do you think is
particularly fun yeah I think one that's
been going on for all ten years actually
is called our help a hero get hired
program and this actually takes place in
offices all across the US where we bring
in veterans and we help them work on
their resumes job skill training and and
it's it's really a great opportunity
again about that skill base volunteering
where Google Earth can
and share their experiences with the
veterans but it's something that we've
also heard from a lot of Googlers it's
often their first first time
volunteering and they have such a good
experience with the program that they
not only come back year after year for
that particular project but also have
gone in to continue volunteering with
veterans and a lot of a lot of cases I
think another idea that's really blown
up over the past few years is all around
human centered design so we have our own
acronym for it we call it CSI labs but
they're basically human centered design
workshops and a lot of our grantee
partners we've been working with them on
specific problems where Googlers will go
in a room with them for a half-day and
work on understanding their issues kind
of getting in their shoes and then
coming out the end with a variety of
prototypes that the nonprofit or charity
partner can go back and work on so right
now there's several going around in
London New York and here in the San
Francisco Bay Area
with an organization called Mercy Corps
they're focusing on trying to help
Syrian refugees with their career paths
and figuring out how to help them build
their skills for their next job wherever
they end up and it's a huge problem to
think about you think of so many people
being displaced because of this crisis
and the creativity of having our
employees in the room with the Mercy
Corps staff who work with the Syrian
refugees to come to maybe to some ideas
that could help these people further so
I get excited about that kind of work -
in addition to the quirky stuff like
diving the bottom of Lake Zurich which
happens almost every year by our
engineers answer um helping the fish up
in Waterloo Canada like moving the fish
they jump they stalk a lake they put all
the fish in the same place and guess
what they become prey so people go out
canoes very Canadian with a bucket and
they move the fish so we have very
skilled projects like I'll be retired in
these design workshops and then we've
got people in lakes
both in Canada and I know that there's a
lot of beautification projects as well
which is really satisfying and I know in
the past a lot of people have you know
created murals or gardens and to see
those murals and Gardens you know year
after year to say well I helped create
that is something that's really touching
here you see next question coming in is
how has technology and data played a
role in Google serve and it may have
evolved over you know the 10th we're
celebrating 10 years now it's probably
evolved there's much more data now than
there was you know year one how is that
evolved yeah it absolutely has and I'd
say you're starting with the technology
piece actually my first year when I
started working on Google serve we were
actually using VolunteerMatch
as a way to register to Bullards for
projects and since then we've built our
own internal platform which has a way
for Googlers not only during Google
serve to get involved in fine projects
but throughout the year as well and so
just seeing the way that our internal
tools have evolved and grown and will
continue to over the next few years is
really cool and then I think data of
course is is always helping our program
grow because we can see particularly
what what Googlers care about during
Google sort of where our Googlers
volunteering um you know do we see any
trends with a you know folks that
volunteer for the first time for Google
serve and then are continuing to either
stay with that organization or go with a
new one and so I think um we definitely
we definitely use data all the time not
just for Google serve but with all the
programs but we're really using to try
to leverage Googlers left because as
Google serve grows Google was growing
too so there's new blurs every year who
have never participated in Google serve
before and a lot of their you know more
tenured teammates are probably showing
them the ropes that also to have the
data to understand you people who are
newer to Google sort of what kind of
projects are they pursuing are they
interested in yeah and one thing that
we're measuring this year that we
haven't measured before is to see
Googlers that are creating their own
project during Google serve will they
create another opportunity after Google
serve and so really looking at that and
sort of the
is now as I an mentioned seeing if this
is just something about their doing
during Google servers it's something
that they really do continue on
throughout the year
we suspect that it'll be the latter but
I'm excited to measure that and I think
we have time for one more question and
that is our all interns and employees
allowed to do these projects so who at
Google is participating we mentioned
that it's all over the world every
single Google office but kind of can you
tell us a little bit about all the
Googlers work yeah well every every
Googler has 20 hours of work time off to
volunteer so and then people volunteer
on top of that and with Pat your
discretion often times but um and then
for interns absolutely during Google
serve interns are included and
throughout the year in terms are
included but the biggest flux of interns
is this time leader absolutely the whole
er summer interns all over the world who
are yet to participate in this exciting
month I have a feeling it was planned
for June so that you know specifically
with our interns in mind so thank you I
don't know if it was that thought about
what ended up working out so work out
yeah absolutely
I would say to the one cool thing about
Google serve we have a lot of projects
on the weekend as well and so we
encourage Googlers to bring their
friends and family to those projects
that happen outside of business hours
kind of what this is do like let's get
everybody serving absolutely we one more
question coming in and this is our last
question and it says me and my team are
planning for renewable energy form it
includes all university students here in
our city how can we incorporate Google
serve in our event it's a great question
Wow there's um what it's the
organization that does the solar
installations
that's a cool grid alternatives I don't
know what city you're in but and if
you're in the u.s. there's an
organization called grid like power grid
alternatives and that would be a neat
project where you could go out and
actually do a project with them and do a
clean energy project as for student
serve absolutely into hashtag students
are with your experience you know take
photos share with us exactly you know
what you're doing in
planning stages and see if we can get
involved so just be sure to let us know
to tag Google students and use the
hashtag and let us know kind of as
you're working on the project how things
are going we can see how we can get
involved great well thank you all so
much for joining us thank you Diana and
Megan for being here go student sir yes
go student sir we are so glad you could
join us today and be sure to get out
there and serve your local community in
