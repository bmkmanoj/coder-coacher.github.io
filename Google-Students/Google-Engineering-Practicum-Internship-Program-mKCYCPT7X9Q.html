presentations for engineering practicum
and this is where engineering practicum
interns will present their projects to
full-time engineers host mentors as well
as other interns at Google well I looked
at the program and it had Google in the
top and I said okay I'm not going to get
it it's Google I shouldn't even bother
applying but I was talking to a friend
and the decision was you should really
go for it because you don't have
anything to lose and this is an
incredible internship program there's
going to be a lot more support than your
traditional internship so not only will
they code for twelve weeks but they're
also going to attend classes and those
classes were really good at bridging
that gap between CS in school and CS at
Google you're going to have a mentor
who's there for you you're going to have
two hosts rather than just one host and
all of these things just made it such a
special experience in this one project
she was able to do mathematics
statistics as well as programming as
well as systems engineering actually see
pictures coming out of production chain
now that's something that people don't
quite realize that breadth of experience
that you get with company like Google
she has complete access to all Google
infrastructure Google systems good build
hierarchies and so on our overall goal
is to find and identify groups of
related Google+ posts where the G+
intern those clusters social ranking in
social right oh yeah we're social
ranking each cluster has a unique ID
identifying it and this way we can see
outliers and we can see trend very
easily I was really surprised by how
relevant our project was actually so
like you know like I thought it was
going to be relevant but not super
relevant like we'd be working on a cool
feature that wasn't necessarily
important but this is this is actually a
real person project that may one day go
into production and become an actual
feature which i think is fantastic you
get off of the nice project to work on
but then you have to own it
we have to own both its success and its
data right and it also helps them
develop much more than if we gave them a
project and guided them very closely
throughout the codebase is so huge if
you need anything it's pretty much
already there it's like really
surprising just how much is already here
I've literally never done anything like
this before so it's really just great to
see how it all works I think it'd be
really awesome to see you know future
Google products and say hey I know how
the backend for that work I built it
we're very happy with the way the
project progressed and definitely when
thinking about the initial changes that
they were making when they were getting
accustomed to the project like all of
them have made tremendous progress and
they also evolved very much as a
software developers as engineers from
from their initial work in the end we
ended up with a nicely polished product
and some very good code that that will
be extremely useful for us 24 was the
connections that you'll make at the
company and with your hosts and with
your team members and with the other
teams that you talk to while you're
working on your project with the other
people you meet in presentations with
what you get to learn about being here
it's an incredible experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
