and I work on the Google students page
and I'm here today talking to some folks
about the Google computer science Summer
Institute so I'm going to go ahead and
let them introduce themselves starting
with Jack who's sitting right next to me
hi I'm Jack de Cicco I work on the
engineering university programs team
here at Google my role is I'm
responsible for computer science student
outreach in the u.s. mainly to schools
on the East Coast including historically
black colleges and universities and I am
one of the program managers for computer
science Summer Institute
how about Liz my name is Liz Arnold I
actually also am a university program
specialist working out at a Cambridge
office so I focused on a lot of the
schools in the New England area working
with a computer science student outreach
and also am another program manager for
the computer science Summer Institute hi
I'm Robin Ryan I am a software engineer
on Google search and I work on CSS I a
designing curriculum deciding and
relevant for students so I look forward
to seeing you guys great we had a little
bit of a technical issue there I'm not
sure what happened but we're back on now
so I just wanted to start off by asking
you know a little bit about what is CSS
I so Jack maybe you can talk a little
bit about what the program is yeah sure
so we call it CSS I short it stands for
computer science Summer Institute and
CSSI is a summer program it's a three
week program for students who are
currently high school seniors who plan
to enroll in a computer science program
in the US or Canada come fall of their
freshman year so that would be fall of
2012 so in a sense the program is
intended to enrich the computer science
skills of students who participate so
throughout your three weeks at Google
you will actually take
various introductory classes to computer
science
you'll get mentorship from Google
engineers you'll meet other interns at
Google who are software engineer interns
and you'll get a lot of development - so
you'll really understand what it means
to be an engineer at Google but at the
same time be needing students from other
universities and also have a lot of fun
and just get to live the Google life for
three weeks great so a lot of the
questions that we got over Google Plus
from Google Plus over the last couple
days and thank you all for submitting
questions we're about the application
process so I figured we could start
there and maybe Liz you can talk a
little bit about the application process
in general like what happens after the
deadline what can students expect as far
as next steps or when to hear back
whether or not they're still considered
etc sure so as many of you know or hope
hopefully you know this Friday is our
application deadline so Friday April
20th 11:59 p.m. and at that point the
following week we'll start reviewing the
applications and it's our hope that
towards the end of next week
or a little bit after that we will start
reaching out the students for interviews
and the interview is not a coding
interview there's it's not anything
scary what we hope to find out is more
about your interest in computer science
kind of telling us about your passion as
well as your you know kind of technical
skills like what is it that you've
already been doing and and why are you
interested in computer science and once
we go through the interview process then
hopefully in mid-may we'll be moving to
the next stage to select students to
participate in the SSI this summer great
righto one of the questions that we got
from Logan Lawrence on Google+ is Logan
would like to know what kind of
experience we're looking for with lots
of experience with computer science to
be preferred over someone with good
basic computer skills but an interest in
computer science hi Logan I said this
answers for you and for anyone else
who's applying
and know someone with experience will
not be lured over someone who has basic
skills but is really interested what we
are trying to do is find people who have
the passion for computer science and
technology but haven't necessarily found
the experience or the program that
caters to their interests and we want to
make sure that we give you guys the
relevant skills that you will need both
in your university career and whatever
you do afterwards so it is very likely
that the class that we see this summer
will be much like the class we saw last
summer where there's a wide range of
skills and a wide range of experience
and we make the class interesting and
accessible to people regardless of their
level great so Jack maybe you can take
this next question from Steve Bucci me
who hopefully I did not butcher his name
but Steve would like to know about the
competitiveness competitiveness of the
program how many students apply and how
many slots are available sure a good
question
so last year we had about 400 applicants
to CSSI for about 60 participants total
so we envision the competitiveness to be
really similar this year we will have
about 60 students over two sessions so
30 students in session one which takes
place June 24th through July 12 here in
Mountain View California and then 30
students in our second session which
takes place July 22nd to August 10 in
Cambridge Massachusetts so it's really
competitive but at the same time we
definitely encourage you to apply if you
fit all the criteria and even if you
don't don't be don't be upset there are
many other ways in which we can keep in
touch as you enter into your freshman
year of college and enroll in CS because
we have lots of opportunities for
students regardless of year and so there
are other internships and programs that
Google does but certainly apply by the
and of this week if you are interested
and then since you did talk about the
sessions this question is also from
Steve he wants to know that if he's
accepted is there a way to select which
session he will attend yes definitely
our goal would be for students who are
accepted into CSS I that we do give you
the option of which session you'd like
to attend but of course that will be
based upon availability of seats in each
session too so we would ask that you
sort of be open-minded but if you do
have vacation plans or other things on
the calendar already we'll try to be as
flexible as possible I'm Liz hoping that
you can help us answer this question
from Patricia as she wants to know she
quoted from the website that it says I
students need to intend to enroll or be
accepted for enrollment at a university
with computer science computer
engineering software engineering or
related Department for the 2012 to 2013
academic year and Patricia would like to
know does this mean that she needs to be
entering one of the above departments or
just entering a university that has one
of those departments so the goal is that
you're yes entering a university that
has one of those departments but that it
is also your stated interests to major
in one of those areas when you reach
that university we do recognize that
many universities don't allow you to
state your major until you're a
sophomore so but we want to hope is that
your intent is to major in a computer
science field or related area so we got
a number of questions about the essay
questions specifically about what some
of them means so I'm hoping that we can
answer some of those questions for folks
starting with Kevin cow would like to
know for the essay question that is
quoted as Google is committed to
encouraging underrepresented students to
seek degrees in computer science which
specific action would you take to
increase diversity in the field of
technology
Kevin would like to know for this essay
question I'm unsure of whether the
question is asking how I as a person
would be contributing to the diversity
or if the question is asking what
actions I would carry out to promote
more underrepresented students to delve
into computers
it's maybe Jack you can answer that yeah
sure so sorry our question was a little
vague there um I think there is room for
interpretation so if you read the
question one way and you really want to
answer it one way please do that I think
when we wrote the question we were
hoping to get a better sense of what you
as a student might do to encourage
diversity within your field so would you
start let's say a club for women in
computer science the last few months of
your high school experience or how am I
you inspire others to get more exposure
to computer science or technology or
what might you participate in in college
once you get there to promote the study
of computer science to underrepresented
groups so in a sense just kind of be I
guess be inspired to take the question
in in the direction that you're most
interested in most passionate about and
then Nicolas Suarez has a follow
question about the same essay question
he would like to know if the question is
asking what action he would take as an
individual or what action he would take
if he was the executive team at Google
oh wow that I mean it would be pretty
cool to know what you would want to do
if you were on the executive team at
Google um so I guess again we could be
open with that question there's no right
or wrong answer to any of the questions
that we've given you so certainly some
creativity and again where you are
inspired to take this open-ended
question is is recommended I don't think
it was intended to for you to tell us
what what we might do here at Google but
sort of what you on your own might do as
you explore computer science a little
bit further and then the last question
about the essays I'll direct this one
towards Liz uh Logan Lawrence again
would like to know how much he'll be
marked down if he goes over through the
300 word limit on the essays he really
has a lot to say about the third essay
question and fills it would be very
difficult to fit within the 300 words do
you care if my essay is over 600 words
if it is well-written or very
relevant informative and important or
should I be wary of going over that 300
word limit well while I would love to
say um you know right as long as you can
you know as we mentioned earlier we do
have a lot of applications we're looking
through we want to make sure that we
give everyone you know as much time as
we can so obviously if 350 is you know
it completes that thought and completes
your essays and that's okay but I think
trying to keep to the word limit will
really help us to make sure that we you
know process and read every application
as fast as we can to kind of move to the
interview process um so Radha let's
switch gears a little bit to talking
about the program itself once a student
is selected to attend the program do
they need to do any preparatory work
before coming to Google um no they don't
it would be cool if they were doing a
work on their own just because you know
I love knowing what people are doing in
their high schools and in their
communities in the field of technology
and what inspires them
there is no pre studying or something
like that and so we definitely don't I
mean I think basically you're free to do
whatever you want and I look forward to
hearing about it but there is no pre
studying required and another question
for you what can students expect from
the technical curriculum what will they
be doing during the three weeks at
Google well that's a very good question
and basically it goes into what I would
like to achieve with the curriculum
which is always changing and we tried a
few things last year and we made the
curriculum web architecture based so
that it was suited for the world of the
internet and what it means to be a web
developer so we found some successes and
a few things we can work on and we are
changing the curriculum to make it both
more relevant and more exciting and the
field of technology changes very very
fast by the time we teach you or learn
how to teach you
specific technology it's already old and
outdated and so basically we'll have to
see we have some ideas and we'll be
working on them and perfecting them and
we look forward to also known your input
what worked what didn't and I hope that
once you're done with GSSI you'll go
back to college and come back to us with
feedback and let us know what worked and
what didn't and what interested you
great um so this is a question that we
often get either from students or from
their parents at least can you tell us
what the living arrangements are for
students while they're at CSSI sure for
both sessions we actually will be
staying at local universities that are
near to the Google office and at this
time we're working on whether you may
end up having your own room or you may
have a roommate of the same gender and
it will be supervised so one of us will
be will be staying on campus and serving
kind of like as an RA similar to many
colleges to make sure that that
everything goes well but we also have
many activities that we've planned for
the time that you're not in your courses
at Google and Radha since you were
involved last year maybe you can talk a
little bit about what the typical day
looks like for a CSSI participant on the
typical day well usually it involves um
well we don't really do lectures in the
lecture sense I you'll notice that
that's one of the things that we are
trying to change because we've found
that the lecture format doesn't
necessarily work well or hold people's
interest so we do a lot of hands-on work
you will be sitting in a classroom but
with a computer at your desk and you'll
be writing code and talking about it in
groups and with your teachers and your
teachers our software engineers at
Google so you will essentially be living
the life of a Google engineer you'll be
writing code talking to people about
code asking people for help on if you
run into a problem and that's what
you'll do usually until lunch and then
after lunch
the CSSI team will have some fantastic
activities planned for you those are
either educational fun or both and then
we continue with more stuff and we try
to keep the material engaging so it is a
long work day and you will be studying
well into until dinnertime so and then
after dinner people go back to their
dorm and usually end up socializing but
as the program progresses and the groups
start to realize how interested they are
they tend to go back and work more and
that's very interesting for us and it
also encourages us to know that you guys
find the curriculum so engaging um and
you brought this up a little bit so I
was hoping to follow up can you talk a
little bit more about the the group work
dynamic and how students will be working
together during the program yes you will
have two working groups I think there is
a misconception that the engineers life
is a solitary one and you are not going
to be stuck behind a desk inside a
cubicle with nobody talking to you
that's just not how engineers at Google
work in fact if you know anything about
how the Google campus is structured the
there are no real single person offices
we all socialize in large cubes and talk
to each other pretty loudly um sometimes
we throw a little foam darts at each
other if we want someone's attention and
so it is a very social work life and
it's important that it's that way
because the best project the best
projects tend to be difficulty and the
lights went out um but yes so we
basically encourage people to work in
groups right um so I check maybe you can
talk a little bit about one of the
aspects of the program that is talked
about on the website which is the
mentorship piece you tell us a little
bit about the mentors if the students
will receive while they're
Google yeah sure so every student that
participates in the program will benefit
from a mentor and your mentor will
actually be a Google software engineer
so you'll be able to really understand
what it is that they do at Google and
maybe what they studied in their
undergrad or masters or even PhD program
courses that were maybe integral to
their success what they did in their
internships so basically free rein you
can ask them anything that you would
like to know that helped them get to
Google but then also certainly they want
to share their experiences in in
computer science with you
and maybe what what got them excited
about computer science what made them
passionate about computer science who
their idols in the tech space for things
like that so hope is that you have an
ongoing relationship with your mentor
while at CSSI but then even beyond CSSI
so we want you to have a meaningful
relationship with this person that
really sort of carries you through your
undergrad and potentially even beyond
your undergrad degree great so we've
covered the application process and we
talked a bit about what students can
expect or while they're at Google so for
our last question I wanted to talk about
what happens after CSSI so Liz maybe you
can help us with this CSSI is now in its
fifth year can you talk a little bit
more about some of the alumni of our
program and what at what's happened
after CSSI sure so one of the things we
try to do is to continue to keep that
relationship with students who are in
CSSI and invite them to consider other
internship programs as they move through
we have a freshman engineering practicum
program an engineering practicum for
sophomores and so we actually have
Googlers who are here now who have
started in CSS I you know a few years
ago have continued to do internships and
kind of progress through and now they
are full-time software engineers here
and we think that's a really great
testament
to the way that this program was able to
help build their skills and kind of help
support them throughout their
development great all right so that
exhausted all the questions that we had
so I just wanted to remind everybody
that the application deadline for CSSI
is this Friday April 20th at midnight
so if you are considering applying we
hope that you do if you've started your
application but haven't yet completed it
yet we hope that you do well before
Friday and we look forward to seeing our
applications and maybe seeing you at
Google this summer I want to thank Jack
Liz and Radha for joining us for this
chat and hope you guys got all your
questions answered thanks thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
