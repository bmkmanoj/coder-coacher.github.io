together hearing from over 10 teams
across Google learning about Google's
products culture it's been a really
great experience for them to get to work
together and get to know each other and
get to know Googlers across the board as
well
this year I think the program has really
kind of grown up a little bit the goal
of the program is really to engage
product teams with our student
ambassadors so that we can continue to
promote our products and programs the
chrome team is looking to engage student
ambassadors and the faculty to really
drive to me benefits of Chrome browser
and Chrome OS which are speed simplicity
and security being able to see that
small things like things
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious into
the phone and the phone automatically
picks it up spells it and Google
searches it for you pulls up all these
webpages associated with it was pretty
amazing I really love the ambassador
summit because it brings students from
over a hundred different colleges around
the country together to learn some lead
together so we have the chance to
collaborate with one another and learn
about our experiences and that's
fantastic opportunities if you look
around right now they're having an
amazing time and they're acting like
kids almost but they're all close to
them so it's just really fun you can see
what the Google brand kind of put into
people and I think that they're making
friends with each other very quickly
which is nice like they clearly like
form friendships within the day ideally
we'd love to send someone from Google to
every campus but physically it's just
not possible
and so these student ambassadors know
their students their campus and their
university is better than we ever could
and are able to be Google's eyes and
ears there I'm really happy to be here
I'm very excited about this one looking
forward to what I can do in the future
like who can do first and what we can do
for Google - I'm really excited about
Google Plus and sharing that with all my
classmates I'm really involved in the
performing arts community on campus so
I'm really excited about starting like
some sort of flash mob or getting the
arts communities together for some sort
of like big arts performance and hooking
it up on to Google+ and just getting
everybody really excited about that
