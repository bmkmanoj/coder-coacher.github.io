for life as a PhD Googler my name is
Brendan Collins
hi I'm joined by Peter Norfolk as you
can see right and we are going to spend
today's session going over the ins and
outs of what it's like to work at Google
as a PhD employee so the kind of overall
agenda for today is Peter is going to
talk about sort of the philosophy of PhD
engineering here especially as it
pertains to software engineering we're
gonna talk a little bit about the hiring
process for a couple minutes and then
we'll spend a lot of time at the end to
answer some of your questions so as you
can see to the right over there I think
is a chat window which is being
moderated by a few of my colleagues
they're happy to answer questions as
they as you asked them throughout the
session today and also we will save some
of the kind of best and most relevant
questions for this group to answer at
the end for Peter and myself where I can
help out as well so without further ado
I'm gonna pass it over to Peter great
thanks Ben
okay let me just introduce myself Peter
Norvig
a title is director of research at
Google I used to be the director of
research now it's a company has grown
I'm a director of research because we
have several but it's a little confusing
because we have research as a
organization within the company but we
also have research that goes on
throughout the company I came to Google
in 2001
I ran the search team for five years and
then moved over over to research my
field has been in artificial
intelligence and information retrieval
and machine learning and done a lot of
things throughout Google let me try to
tell you a little bit about what it's
like so this is what we're going to go
over we're gonna say what it's like to
be PhD Google how Google does research
what's it what's it really look like
talk about publishing and then talk
about the hiring process so overall
what's it like to be PhD Googler well
the answer is it's totally awesome
okay that's it we're done goodbye any
questions just kidding I could say a
little bit more about it so I think
there's a lot of things that contribute
to to what it's like I think one of the
most important things is the impact you
can have on the world
so as a PhD you have a lot of choices
you can go into academia you can go to a
startup you can go to an established
company but at Google there's you know
we've got a billion customers out there
that you can help and we have a pipeline
and sort of a set up within the company
where it's very easy to go from PhD
research into production I think that's
great is the team that we have the
people you get to work with and the
autonomy right so the Google is still
kind of a bottom-up company and people
get to decide what it is they want to
work on there's a lot of fluidity and
flexibility in how you manage your time
and what you work on now Google's
approach to research so I wrote a paper
with Alfred Spector and slaw Petrov in
which we tried to describe that and
mainly the idea is that we want to have
a close connection between research and
development and engineering and delivery
and we want to look for places where
we're doing cutting-edge research but we
can apply that into into products
I think there's there's four things that
make it great to be at Google and why I
said it was awesome
so one is the amount of data that we
have and I remember when I came to
Google it's in 2001 so it was a small
startup company
some people had heard of it some hadn't
and people were asking me well why would
you leave your established organization
that you're at or this tiny little
startup and is it's not really safe and
is that a good move and and my answer
for why I wanted to come to Google I
said well remember Willie Sutton really
something was a bank robber in the 1920s
or so and they wanted to ask him Willie
why do you play rob banks and he said
because that's where the money is and
when people ask me why did you come to
Google I said because that's where the
data is and we didn't have the word big
data then but I knew that's what I
wanted to do and I knew Google was the
place to do it now on top of having the
data you also need the infrastructure so
that's the hardware the data center as
you see here to process that data and
the software it's I think it's pretty
important that the software is easy
enough to use that even the PhD can do
it right so in some companies you know
there's a separation between the
production engineers that run the
complicated stuff and the PhD
researchers that play on their laptop
using R or MATLAB or something with
smaller data sets at Google you know
some people do that at the very
beginning but then you quickly get to
the point where you say you know I can
do a lot better if I used all this data
that we have and it's easy enough to use
that I can do that I can use the same
production systems that are used for for
our production applications I can use
that as a researcher and I can get that
a copy of the web or all the data I need
for whatever it is I'm trying to do and
the software makes it very easy to do
that so that's great and then the other
thing we talked about impact before
there's a billion users out there and so
you can build something and get the
satisfaction of knowing that you're
really helping people
and finally is the incredible colleagues
that there's other great people working
here and you get to work with them so
those are the four things that are
important that's what it's like now what
can you do well here's all the research
areas and I won't read through them but
basically you know anything you do you
see in an academic CS department we're
probably doing it so when is research at
Google actually look like so here's a
diagram of the intersection of basic
research so striving for fundamental
understanding of the world and Applied
Research trying to build something
that's actually going to help people and
Google research is kind of right there
in the mail and we talked about that in
our paper there's another book out by
ben shneiderman the professor at
university of maryland forget the title
of the book is but is something about
ABCs which is applied and basic research
combined so he has a very similar idea
that you know he says that there was
kind of a myth that the key to doing
good research is to fund basic research
but he said but never really true that
all the best research has always been
this combination of applied and basic
and that rings true to me so I would
recommend an immense book and so this
hybrid approach combining the the basic
and applied we're focused on technology
transfer so our goal is not to prove
theorems or write papers our goal is to
make it a new product in a you know
either improve an existing product or
invent something entirely new and get
that out in the hands of users we
usually do that in small steps right so
we don't say I got a plan and I'm gonna
deliver something 10 years from now we
say I you can still have a 10 year plan
but you can say along the way this year
here's what I'm gonna ship
and then next year I'm gonna do the next
step and so on
we can use all this infrastructure that
we have in order to do experiments right
so we don't have to just think about
things we can actually try them out and
we're allowed to think about hard
problems but we're evaluated by does it
actually work in the end now another
aspect that sometimes confusing is that
we have an organization within Google
that's whose title is research so you
look on the org chart and there is
research but there's research going
everywhere throughout engineering and a
lot of the well-known
researchers that you may be aware of
people like Jeff Dean and Sanjay
Ghemawat their title is not researcher
their title is software engineer because
it just happened where they sit within
the organization we go more you know
your title of whether your research or
engineer doesn't really depend on how
academic you are doesn't really depend
on whether your projects are shorter
term or long term depends more on the
area that you're in so if you're in an
area of something we're already doing
like systems programming that Jeff and
Sanjay we're doing then your title is
engineer if you're in an area of
something brand new then your title
might be researcher but in the end it
doesn't matter what your tighter title
is what matters is what you work on and
we have a couple different models for
how teams work together so if here's one
example where an engineering team comes
up with research results and do products
an example a month of that might be the
MapReduce or the BigTable system that
Jeff and Sanjay and others worked on
where they're officially engineers they
invented something new and they ship
that as a product here's another example
where a research group comes up with
research results and chips the new
products as well so examples of that
might be the machine translation and the
speech recognition systems which started
with
the small team just a couple people in
research saying hey let's pursue this
they got some good results but rather
than handing that off to an engineering
team because we wanted to keep
developing it especially with examples
like that where you know every month or
so we were adding a new language we
didn't want there to be one research
system and one engineering system and
have to keep the two synchronized one of
them to be one system so we kept the
whole development within research and we
just added engineering support to be
able to ship the product and develop the
system as we went isn't another example
is a research group might come up with a
result that an engineering team who they
aren't working directly with then sees
picks up and says hey this is exactly
what I need so example of that might be
the fingerprinting techniques for audio
and visual that was done by Michelle
Cavell and she meet Volusia so they have
this technique for saying is this
YouTube video is a match for something
else
and of course if it's a bit 4-bit match
that's easy anybody can do that but what
if it's you know somebody with a
camcorder who sneaks into a movie and
records off the screen and it's a noisy
copy and in the middle there's somebody
with a box of popcorn who walks across
the screen but that's still we want to
detect that as copyrighted material for
whoever owns a movie so it's an
approximate match they came up with
techniques for doing that approximate
match publish the research results and
then the YouTube team picked that up and
said that was important and the the
music team also said we want that to to
to match against the audio tracks and
those teams were able to work from the
basic research to develop a product and
finally they're examples where we have
research group and engineering teams
coming together to form one team and
work on new products
example of that might be the ads
optimization where we had experts in
machine learning from the research team
go and join with the engineering team
and say we're gonna figure out what's
the right ad to show so that users get
better more interesting less annoying
ads to good luck yeah okay
what about publishing at Google so first
of all there's a big difference between
industry and academia and in that
academia it's published or perish
it's an important part of what you do
you get evaluated on it if you don't
publish you don't get tenure that's the
end of the story at Google you're
evaluated by the products that you
produce right so we said it was we had
this applied focused and we want you to
develop something and of course we
looked at all those different models you
can be at success in any one of those
models so you don't have to always
deliver the product yourself right so
some of these wares
I came up with a good research result
that was important and it was used by
somebody else
you still get credit for that so there's
lots of ways to get credit but you're
not gonna get credit for publishing
alone
if those publications aren't interesting
to anybody don't lead to any products
you do get credit for publishing as
addendum to everything else that you do
so it's something we value very much and
we encourage you to do it but it's not
the primary thing you're evaluated on as
it is in academia and despite it not
being our number one focus we still do a
lot of publication and here's a bunch of
different areas and this all on our
website see so you can go look at them
and then beyond publishing there's other
ways to be involved with the community
so we're involved with a lot of open
source projects people here's spend time
on that work with the open source
community develop and release these
systems maintain them
lead the community I had a great
experience with the google Summer of
Code where we get some students to help
work on an open-source project and I
managed a couple of them over the summer
that would that worked out great we also
have people working on defining industry
standards we have our own internal api's
for things like object recognition API
where you say give me a picture and I'll
give you back labels for that picture we
collaborate with colleagues and academia
through visiting faculty through a
research grant program through inviting
people in for Tech Talks through going
through conferences so lots of
opportunities to stay up to date with
the academic community ok and now let's
go to Brendan talk about the hiring
process sure thanks Peter
so a little bit about a sausage-making
of hiring this is the big fall hiring
season we're in the midst of it so thank
you to everyone who's watching right now
because I'm sure that's of interest to
probably most of you so as Peter
mentioned you know PhDs are embedded
sort of within every major engineering
team and so it shouldn't surprise you as
well that we have PhD Googlers working
at and most of the main engineering
offices in North America and there and
they're listed here so let's talk about
how to apply
drumroll please it's the easiest thing
in the world google.com slash students
that is your one-stop-shop for finding
information about internships that's
where you can find info about full-time
roles that's where you can find
resources about how to interview that's
where you can find more information
about scholarships it really is kind of
the only address you need to know if you
want to talk to Google about possibly
working here or getting more involved
with the company to apply and you have
to apply online it's it's insufficient
to you know hand off your resume to
someone at a career fair you do in fact
have to go onto the under the student
job site here to apply what all you need
to get the party started is just upload
your resume and unofficial
we have your transcript and then click
Submit so a few of the deadlines and
things to note about the software
engineering roles for PhD students that
we have here if you are going to be
graduating anytime between now and next
May or June with the PhD you do not need
to apply at any particular time there is
no deadline we hire throughout the year
and it's not even like there's rolling
admission it really is no deadline you
know if you want to take some time and
practice doing technical interviews we
strongly encourage that because you know
in the midst of research and sort of
finishing up your dissertation it can
get lost that you do in fact need to do
a coding interview at least one to work
at Google as a software engineer and
we'll talk a little bit more about the
interview process in just a bit but if
you are looking for an internship as a
software engineer with us next summer
the application is open and it closes on
January 31st of next year so that
internship application is in fact it's
kind of much more of a rolling admission
so we encourage you to apply as soon as
you feel ready to get started with the
with the interview process and once you
do apply you'll get an automatic email
from Google recruiting saying hey thanks
so much we really appreciate you
signalling your interest if we want to
move forward we'll be in touch and so if
the recruiter reaches out and says hey
you know thanks so much for flying we'd
like to interview you for a software
engineering internship for PhD students
next summer at that point you have a
little bit of you know flexibility to
say okay here's my availability or I
have to go to this conference on this
date so that tape won't work the
recruiting team is really flexible so
just be as honest and transparent with
them as you can and they'll treat you
well so a little bit more about the
actual interview process it differs for
interns and full-time more of in in
tactics than in strategy though so for
an internship
the only interviews you'll do are over
the phone and these are technical coding
interviews so if you haven't had a lot
of experience doing coding interviews I
strongly recommend
practicing the best way to do that is to
get your hands on some you know mock
interview questions such as those that
you can find in the magnum opus of Tec
interviewing called cracking the coding
interview vol 6 just came out for the
sixth edition scuse me came out last
year the fifth edition is still just as
good the questions are a little older
but that's no really no real difference
and doing tech interviews is it can be
it can be tough if you haven't had
experience which is why there there is
no shortcut to getting better you do
have to practice after the phone
interviews if the engineering sort of
hiring committee things that things look
good
they will put you into the hosts
matching process where your interests
will be you know shot the rounds to the
different teams at Google throughout the
company that are looking for folks who
have experience such as the kind that
you have so Google approach to
internships is incredibly curated and
manicured we don't just hire interns for
the sake of hiring interns we hire
interns to do very specific work that is
a great business need and you are not
just working on some project that is
gonna gather dust as the second you
leave the office every internship at
Google every engineering intern you work
on production level code and so you're
right there in the trenches with the
rest of the teams working on the stuff
that keeps the lights on here so after
that host matching process if they find
a match that works for you and that also
you know if you work for the team your
application is put to that hiring
committee and if they think it all looks
good then they extend an offer for a
full time it's similar but it's a little
bit different the first step of the
process is also one or two interviews
over the phone but it's a little bit
more robust after that if the committee
decides to move forward and the
recruiting team as well they will fly
you out most likely to our Mountain View
headquarters where Peter and I are right
now and you will do four or five
interviews on-site it's more than likely
that four of those interviews will be
technical coding interviews similar to
the ones you did on the phone but
there's also a research interview and
that is usually tailored
to your particular focus area and the
interviewer will be someone who is also
pretty experienced in the field that
your that you're working in in the field
that you're you know sort of hoping to
continue working at once you join us
here at Google
after those interviews are finished up
they're all sort of calibrated against
each other by that same sort of
committee type approach where you know
if you do really well in one interview
that's not gonna guarantee you a job
here but this on the same flip side of
that coin if you feel like you didn't do
very well in one of the interviews
that's not gonna necessarily really
about it's designed to be as fair and
and you know an approval as as we can
make it so if the committee decides that
it looks good
that's when we hand out the offer so at
this point we are gonna move on to the
Q&amp;amp;A portion so my colleagues have been
diligently answering the questions in
the chat window thank you very much to
colleagues who are in the another
conference room around the corner from
us but we have some questions that they
have kala lated from the chat window
that would be really good to have
answered in front of everyone watching
today so the first one is all research
at Google focused on production or as
any research specifically for the
purpose of licensing we don't really do
much in terms of licensing I think we
want to take advantage of the scale that
Google has and say we've got those
billion customers out there we want to
go direct to them and if you put
something behind a license that just
kind of mutes the impact I guess there
probably are a few cases where we do
stuff to help out some of our partners
so I'm thinking things like phones so
yesterday we released our own phone but
we also there's Android phones from lots
of different manufacturers and sometimes
we do work to help them out the problems
that they're having so you might think
of that as licensing although I don't
know if that's exactly what you want but
mostly we want to go to our customers
okay here's a good question and this
comes up a lot with with recruiters is
will you focus on the published papers
of an applicant more than their
engineering skills when considering them
especially for students who are maybe in
the first two or three years of a ph.d
program right so so it's not a
competition to see who has the most
publications what we want is we want you
to demonstrate that you can do the job
and there's lots of different ways that
you can do that so one way to do it is
to have a strong publication record now
we know you can take an assignment and
you could do a good job on that you can
write it up and you can finish it and
move on to the next thing
so you've proven yourself that way but
there's lots of other ways you can prove
yourself without doing publications so
if you've done an open source project
and contributed to that or done your own
software project and finished it even if
it's not written up as a publication if
you've shown you can do the job then
that's great
okay and you touched on this a little
bit during during the slides but what's
the main difference between a software
engineer and a research scientist so in
terms of day to day I think there's not
that much difference right so
everybody's working together and you
pitch in and you do what you have to do
one time I answered that and that the
main difference is not when you're on a
job but when you're done with the job
right so if I as a manager have a talk
with my employee if that employee is a
software engineer then we usually start
out the conversation with me saying hey
I have an idea for what you should do
next but if it's a researcher then maybe
when I'd start with the researchers
saying that he or she has an idea for
what she wants to do next and then I'll
agree to that so that's a little bit
more flexibility in choosing your own
direction if you're a researcher you've
shown that you you have the ability to
do that but once you're on the job a lot
of times you can't tell the difference
who has what title
that's refreshing to hear yeah titles
don't matter that much once you're in
the door okay another question are there
specific research or applied research
teams at Google focusing on large scale
machine learning you know distributed
optimization or you know will will be
will we be absorbed into specific
machine learning learning teams that
already exist right so that's a great
question so so we we do it kind of at
all levels right so there there are
tools that we work on tensorflow is
probably the biggest tool and they're a
big part of that is the distributed
systems type part and other parts is
sort of the core machine learning
algorithms part and that's you know
building the tools and it's across the
board then there are teams whose main
job is to do machine learning to solve a
specific problem to do speech
recognition image recognition whatever
and I guess that's the second part of
your question and then there's also
teams where their main focus is
something else you write sure they're
trying to to ship a piece of software
and they've got ten major problems
before they can get it out the door and
maybe you know machine learning is
number nine on that list but they need
still need somebody to help out it and
get that part done okay what is what is
a recommendation for someone in their
first year of a ph.d program may not
have a lot of publications and it's a
similar from a earlier question but I
think that first year of being PhD
student what what what are you looking
for yeah so then I guess the good thing
is for first year we're comparing you to
other first years right so we're not
expecting you to have a lot of
publications again we're looking for
somebody who can do the job and so
somebody who's flexible in terms of
their ability to to be able to program
up something new to be able to read and
understand be able to work with other
people on the job to know how to use the
tools source control systems and so on
if you can demonstrate you can do that
then you're well on your way to saying
you can be a valuable member of the team
even if you don't have a lot of
publications yet okay um so here's a
question and I hear this one a lot from
students is I'm concerned about taking a
software engineering role because I'll
just be coding all day instead of
solving big problems how do you respond
to that right so again the titles don't
matter right
and everybody solving big problems but
everybody has to code in it in order to
get there so I think you should you
should look at the the group you're
gonna be with and you know talk to them
talk to your your manager talk to the
other people on the team try to
understand what the project gonna be
like and don't pay any attention to the
titles because as I said a lot of our
well-known people like Jeff and Sanjay
their title is software engineer they
didn't bother them but I gotta say you
know I wish we didn't have these two
different titles and I'm envious of
places like Bell Labs in the old days
where they had one title number of
technical staff and I wish we had that
because then I wouldn't have to answer
these questions because it comes up a
lot in hires and some of the irons are
disappointed that they got one title or
another now I'm in research so the
people I hire as a title researcher but
when I was doing search people I hired
had the title a software engineer even
though they were doing research in how
to get right answers for Google so they
were the core of researching everything
that Google did but every one of the
people that I hired at the title
operation you write a lot of them fresh
PhDs complained and I said this is just
the way we do it and then you know a
month later they come back to be it and
say oh I'm sorry I complained about that
now I understand that it makes no
difference whatsoever such a it's a
definite first world problem pressure um
okay this is a good question especially
coming off of yesterday's launch with
the new hardware devices that we have
given the machine learning is such an
enormous focus for the company for the
short and long term do you need to have
machine
experience in order to work on machine
learning problems right so so again I
said there's multiple ways in which
machine learning fits in and there's a
lot of teams for which it's not their
main focus but they need to do a little
bit of it and for that you know you
might be the person on the team that
gets gets to sign that and that's fine
we certainly hire people that have the
mathematical skills but not necessarily
the experience and so you know a lot of
the machine learning that's common now
is really just manipulating matrices so
if you can do linear algebra then you
can do machine learning and the rest you
can learn on the job and that's kind of
a recurring theme of hiring at Google
and large is we don't necessarily hire
people who are you know pigeon-holed as
being really really strong in one area
we hire folks who are incredibly good at
learning on the job because we know that
when we hire that way we are making a
bet on the future of the company and not
necessarily on that one team that needs
that one person who's good at that one
thing right at any given time yeah okay
so related to that actually there's a
perception that at Google you might not
have a lot of choice when it comes to
the project you're working on how true
is that so when you come in you're
usually assigned to a project and there
may not be that much choice there
although we are able to do some
accommodation but then you're very free
and in fact encouraged to switch over
time once you get here we have internal
tools and marketplace where new jobs are
advertised and people look at that and
they move and in fact the main problem
we have is that people don't move enough
okay so we want them to go on to the
next project and people say oh yeah I
will but first I want to finish up what
I'm doing here and I'll take another
quarter or so because we want that
experience to spread throughout the
company we want connections both
personal and technical to be made and to
do have that diversity and we don't get
that when people just stay on one thing
so you know you'll move on around a lot
you'll have a lot of choice in weight
where you go what you want to do and it
shouldn't surprise anyone on this call
especially that there are a lot of
extremely talented behavioral science
PhDs working on Google's HR team and the
sciences is clear about the benefits of
internal mobility because not only to
your point of does the company benefit
from having new people in to stir the
pot but also you want to have employees
happy at work you want to have them in a
charge of their own careers and Google
does a fantastic job of facilitating
that conversation with your manager with
your HR representative you know there is
an internal jobs board that you know if
teams are short-handed they could say oh
we're looking for this one person and
kind of related to the idea of a 20%
project at Google a lot of times you
know 20% is it's not like codified and
in stone it's it's it's pretty flexible
as far as as a principle of work sharing
and kind of focusing on individual
projects versus team projects but the
core idea of doing stuff that makes you
happy
is baked into the DNA of the company
from its culture from day one and that
has not changed at all in fact in the
six years that I've been at Google I
personally have switched teams four
times and I've gone from one or two
entire other organ in the company and
you know it's it's one of those
situations where everyone is scratching
everybody else's back because the team
is happier to have new people on it who
come with a breadth of experience from
another department or another division
and then the people moving are also they
know that they are sort of driving the
bus of their work of their careers in
their lives and it's really important to
Google that people are happy yeah ok um
another question oh here's a logistical
question when should we apply for
internships should we wait to pass
qualifications or wait until after we
defend to apply so there's there's two
answers for this I can take the first
one is internships at Google for every
part of the company are only open to
people who are going to be returning to
school so you have to do at least a
couple more months of school I know for
PhD
you can often be difficult to plan out
when exactly or you know graduation day
is but you can you know if you do want
to have an internship here you have to
go back to school for at least a
preordained amount of time and your
recruiter can if you have questions
about that and you apply it your and
you're moving through the process the
recruiters can enter those questions on
a case-by-case basis
but the window for applying for
internships is only open until January
31st so you have to apply at some point
between now and then if you do want to
get an internship here next summer I
mentioned it is kind of a rolling
admission so the sooner you apply the
better position you put yourself in to
to be sort of you know have your
application on the top of the pile once
in theory a really good fit for you
comes online and the recruiting managers
can say oh hey this great internship
kind of just it you fit the mold
perfectly you good thing you applied
earlier you're through the interview
process and we can start that host match
so the sooner you apply I think the
better your better position you put
yourself in for sure okay so this is
this is a cool question what drives
research projects at Google what is the
kind of starting spark like what is the
kernel of ideation then how does that
happen so it's sometimes it's improving
an existing product that we have saying
you know we have search results we want
better ones we have speech recognition
we want that to be better and let's look
at the current state of the art say what
can we do and sometimes it's something
entirely new where we say we think
there's a new technology that we're not
doing yet that could be really
transformative and one way to think
about it is that a good research project
is something that you should be able to
go to a product manager and in 30
seconds say here's a technology that I
have do you want that and to have the
product manager be really excited right
so things like machine translation you
could say well I have the ability to
have pee
we'll understand stuff that's not in
their language would that be useful
that's fantastic I want that and so we
look for those types of opportunities
where we can apply the skills that we
have we look at the current state of the
art you know throughout the world as
well as internal to the company and we
say where can we make a difference yeah
and I think it was on display in a
wonderful way yesterday with the big
product launch that we had and I was
talking to one of your colleagues
yesterday who said that
it's amazing the how Google went from
you know starting Android phones you
know 2008 2009 to today where the amount
of patience that the company had for
that great idea of how do we just have
it we you know design and build the best
phone that we can it took Google a long
time to get from them to now and if the
company was driven by short-term returns
on investment we never would have gotten
as far as we have on that front okay
here's another cool question does
research at Google need to go through a
sanitation process before it can be
published if so how difficult is this
right so we do have a review process for
every publication and we're looking for
a couple different things so one is
don't say anything that's so bad it will
embarrass Google I know that anything
you'd want to publish wouldn't have that
problem so that's so that's fine another
is you know are there copyright type
issues did you steal some photographs
you don't have the proper right to do
this we have to clear all that up and
then the third is and is there anything
proprietary that you're talking about
that you shouldn't be talking about and
that sometimes comes up it's usually
pretty minimal and it comes up in a
couple ways sometimes we can talk about
a technology without saying exactly how
we do it and I remember sometimes we
would talk about short text segments
right so we're talking about English
language and we're talking about a
couple word segments and here's some
interesting result that we advanced the
state-of-the-art on those segments
but we didn't quite say are those are
those short words number of words is
that a search query that we're dealing
with or is that you know the underlined
part of a hypertext link or where did
that come from for strategic reasons we
might not want to reveal something like
that and you know we might not want to
say exactly how many computers we have
in our data center so we would just take
that number out and say it in terms of
percentages or say you know we had this
much data and this is twice as much so
for the reader of the paper nothing has
changed for you as the author you still
get the paper out there it still has all
the important ideas it could still be
reproduced by your academic colleagues
but it doesn't give Google's competitors
like up in certain cases for things that
we don't want to share but yet okay I
think we have time for one or two more
questions here's an here's a good one
how can having PhD experience benefit
both Google and me in doing a job or an
internship so let's say a PhD and an
undergraduate both have strong linear
algebra experience mm maybe applying for
a machine learning position of some kind
what is the difference between having
that PhD experience versus either that
undergrad experience or that kind of
self-taught yeah so I guess what we see
in PhD is it is the ability to take a
project over the long run right so as an
undergraduate you're kind of going one
course at a time and the biggest thing
you work on is the final project for a
class as a PhD you've shown you can
stick with a problem over a number of
years and that's a great attribute
because we have hard problems so we want
people that can work on them and so
having a PhD or being well on your way
towards getting a PhD is a great way for
you to demonstrate that you can do that
and I guess about a quarter of
engineering staff it's PhDs so we like
PhDs
we like what they can do and we hire
them on the other hand if you can do
that without getting a PhD then that's
fine too if what we're looking for is
that capability
surely the piece of paper right okay and
one last question is is there a
difference in the application for either
jobs or internships to do different
kinds of software engineering so for
instance front end versus back
infrastructure versus you know whatever
right I can answer this one actually it
comes up a lot and it's it's interesting
there is for a software engineering at
Google there's usually that one
application for either a full-time or an
internship that is the one door into the
whole company so when you apply for a
software engineer PhD as a full-time
position that is the one job of
application that you need to fill out
what will happen then is the recruiters
will look at your qualifications they'll
look at your background your focus area
your research area and then as you go
through the interview process as I
mentioned you'll have to go through
those technical interviews that's when
they'll start to say okay let's really
start to focus and sharpen your you know
your marketing within the company as far
as which team you're gonna be placed on
same kind of thing goes for internships
if you apply for that one internship
application on the student job site
that's your one key that you need to the
whole kingdom similarly you'll do the
technical interviews and then in a host
matching process that's where they
market you around and shop you around
and say okay this team works great for
that person so it just kind of that's
where the matches are made I think
that's that's it
so Peter I want to thank you once again
