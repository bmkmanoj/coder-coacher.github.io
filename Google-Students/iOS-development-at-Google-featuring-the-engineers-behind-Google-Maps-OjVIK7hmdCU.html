series in which we talk to engineers and
various other people both within Google
and outside of Google about things that
are of interest to our audience and
today I'm really thrilled to have a
couple of engineers who are part of the
Google Maps iOS app development team and
in case you haven't heard the reviews
most people have
they've been outrageously positive for
this amazing app the New York Times as
soon as it was released and they had a
chance to use it called it free fast and
fantastic and it's it's right near or at
the top of the App Store downloads and
as I mentioned we have a couple of
engineers from that team with us today
I'd like to introduce Dave who's up in
Kirkland Washington hey Dave okay so
have Greg who is here in Mountain View
California Lou hey Greg so um so the
topic of this is really to hear a little
bit about these guys kind of how people
have ended up on this team maybe a
little bit about about the team and some
of its work and then this is for the
Google students page we're also going to
talk a little bit about how a person
might end up being able to join this
team and ways to prepare for things like
that so I'm so first off Dave I'm
wondering if you could introduce
yourself a little bit and talk some
about your background okay sure so yeah
as you mentioned I'm up here in Kirkland
Washington we've got a Kirkland and
we've got a Kirkland in Seattle office
we've actually got both the Kirkland and
a Seattle office so it's right near
Seattle and I've been working at Google
now for about seven years and spent five
years down to Mountain View and then
moved up here about two years ago and so
yeah I've been working at Google mainly
when I got hired at Google it was
specifically to work on Macintosh
applications once upon a time
and did a variety of bits and pieces for
several of our Matic apps did some open
source software with the what we call
the Google tool box for Mac and got into
eventually working on Chrome and worked
with the chrome team as part of the
initial chrome port to Mac and it didn't
that for a while and then eventually
ended up working on iOS apps which was a
pretty easy easy transition for Google
Maps app my only other app that I
officially released as my own was this
thing called Google Authenticator which
is our two-factor authentication app
which certainly had nowhere near the
feedback of Google Maps yeah and then
eventually ended up starting up the
Google Maps for iOS team and after a bit
of work here we are that's great yeah
and I understand yesterday I was here
seven year anniversary great Google yes
as of yesterday I've been here for
longer than any other job I've ever had
Wow great you must you must enjoy it so
it sounds from your background that they
really you have pretty strong ties to
Apple and an understanding of its
products and and you know really that's
a lot of what you've brought to Google
over the last seven years ya know when I
was hired I was tired specifically as a
Mac developer I had a lot of experience
doing cross-platform work before I
joined Google but my job previous to
this was specifically focused on doing
graphics work on the Mac row so great
ok Larry and Sergey had the foresight to
bring that Mac knowledge on board so
thanks for sharing that so so Greg we'd
love to hear more about you I understand
that your path to Google eight years ago
was a little bit different you joins us
as a regular software engineer kind of
like a lot of Engineers joined Google
and that your your path towards this
type of work is a little bit different
yeah definitely um so I actually joined
Google straight out a call
so for all the new grads out there there
is hope of getting into Google as a new
grad we definitely my reluctant new
grads so yeah I mean I started and I I
first started working actually a little
bit in the ads world doing basically
internal web applications kind of doing
full front-end and back-end kind of
after that after a few years of that
moved on and did worked on a couple
external web applications specifically
Google page creator and Google Sites so
kind of took that background and then
about three years ago now made the
transition to mobile development
specifically on iOS I moved into kind of
doing latitude and places originally on
iOS and that was actually the first time
that I had done any objective-c and
mobile development period
so definitely you know the kind of
strong foundation of just computer
science and then transitioning into kind
of new spaces and being being part of
that kind of the mobile revolution which
has happened over the past few years
it's been really exciting yeah your your
path is interesting one of the things
that well sometimes hear from engineers
at Google that they really love about
Google besides the great culture here
generally is the ability to try
different things over time and to
transfer from product to product in you
know various projects and one of the
things that that does is that actually
brings different perspectives different
types of technologies all together and
from my understanding there were a
number of different different Google
products that kind of all came together
to make this amazing app and and you
might have some perspective on that
having worked on some of those other
teams yeah so I mean definitely when I
joined geo about three years ago
I mean geo as an organization is is huge
and and everything even back then when
we were working on Places and latitude I
mean we were doing we're hitting local
search and we were using all this great
both search infrastructure but then also
kind of
you know local places ratings all these
things and I mean the the GMM app itself
I mean obviously we're using a lot of
the same data and we're working closely
with you know all the learnings that the
folks on Android have had you know after
doing all their work so you know it's a
common thing to say you know it's one
application but it actually hits you
know ten plus backends also applying
different things from directions to you
know geolocation all these sorts of
things and you know really I think the
one of the reasons that the app has been
so well-received is you know it wasn't
an application that was just created
from scratch with no prior experience
you know you know however long ago it
was you know Google has been working in
the Geo space and maps for you know
eight plus years and we were really kind
of leveraged all that experience to not
only have a great application experience
but also have great data that's terrific
yeah and one of the things that some
people might not put together with this
is the fact that we've had an iOS math
on iOS earn that on the App Store for a
really long time that's been consistent
over time so really great you know great
experience and understanding learn from
that that I'm sure helps make this
amazing apps iOS app definitely it's
great so so so Dave um as we talked
about you have a really strong Apple
background and and of course a lot of
people associate Google with Android and
may not realize how passionate people
here at Google are about iOS development
um how have you seen things shift over
time in terms of of Google's commitment
to really best-in-class iOS development
and you know what are some of the things
that you're saying in that field right
now that's actually pretty cool so when
I started like seven years ago I was
hired as the as a Mac developer and I
think was because either Larry or Sergey
got their first mac and decided that
Google needed
more mac software and at the time you I
had to special-order my first Mac
hardware
you did not see Apple hardware anywhere
in Google your standard developer was
working mainly in Linux and and other I
mean there's other machines around but
certainly Apple hardware was rare
fast-forward to now and I think we've
got one of the larger Apple deployments
probably anywhere I mean the standard
issue these days is is an Apple is an
Apple based machine as well as a Linux
box and that I mean that goes for almost
all developers and Google whether
they're doing Mac stuff or not so it's
been an incredible incredible change as
far as just apples hardware and the
support when we when I first started
there was virtually notes internal tools
available for doing Mac development and
now we've got a whole team devoted
specifically to doing Mac development
tools and making it easier on everybody
certainly I mean we now have we when we
started there is virtually nothing and
then chrome was actually a big shift for
us we did it but the chrome team did a
lot of work focusing specifically on
making sure that chrome was a best-of
class citizen on the Mac to begin with
and then we've taken a lot of that
knowledge and put it forward into our
iOS apps and I mean some of our first
iOS apps sir I wouldn't have considered
the best of class at the time but you
can certainly see from some of our more
recent releases I mean the Google Search
app and YouTube and Gmail and Google
Glasses iOS and Google Maps we've I
think we've really started to focus on
getting on for getting it on iOS and you
know there's been a lot of focus from
our UI team and our UX teams
specifically on making sure that our
apps look and work well on iOS and I
mean we've got a lot of developers who
are focused specifically on
we have internal discussion we have
internal groups focusing specifically on
iOS development and and how to do it
better at Google and that's extended
even out into the open source fear I
mean there's lots of Google open source
initiatives that are iOS or Mac specific
we've got developers we're working on
clang which is the compiler that we're
all using certainly chrome is I mean
probably one of the biggest open source
projects out there and is just a wealth
of knowledge about how to program for
the Mac in objective-c
for anybody that's great well I'd also
like to put a plug in for the Google
Plus app I use that a lot yes and I'm
dialing into this hangout on air on my
macbook air and I'd imagine the two of
you are on Macs as well so definitely a
culture here at Google and support of
that so so I know that Tom that you've
had a number of people join your team
right out of college over the last year
or two and I'd imagine you've been
seeing a lot of them who have already
developed apps maybe while they're in
college you know it's just something you
know a simple app of some sort and and
so today's students have a whole
different experience around app
development and this is being published
to the broadcast to the the student
Google+ page as you talk to a student
audience what are some things that you
would encourage them to consider if they
were interested in working at Google um
so I mean like definitely one of the
things that I would say is maybe some of
it's just because of my kind of path but
I mean I think software engineering just
here at Google in general whether it be
for mobile or for you know server-side
the fundamentals are actually really
important you know for you know a
standard application you know knowing
the runtime complexity of a certain
algorithm for a small thing might not be
that big of a deal but
when your data set start increasing and
the complexity of your application like
knowing those fundamentals and and
really studying up on them um it is
really important um but that said like
also the de passion for developing on on
the platform itself is also really
important because I mean I think a lot
of people come to iOS development
specifically or are interested in it is
because it there is a very strong focus
on the user and making sure the
experience for the user is a really
strong one so you know I personally like
that I think that's probably one of the
things that drew me to it is in addition
to a lot of the core software
engineering classes that I took coming
into it I've always had a strong
interest and you know human-computer
interaction UX and just kind of the
overall design aspect of it so really I
think having a a good base is really
important but then also you know having
passion and interest in the platform
itself is definitely a plus great ya
know I'd agree i come from a very
similar background in the strict you
know computer science degree with a
focus on UX and human interaction and
certainly I mean there's I mean the
thing that Google is known for is is our
data
I mean presenting our presenting these
massive data sets in a way that way that
people can grasp and easily use and once
you start trying to sort and sift
through that data those basic algorithms
come roaring back pretty quickly and you
need to know how to deal with data sets
of that size and certainly when you're
talking I mean we with Google Maps we
interact with several different groups
internally that Greg was talking about
and you certainly have to be able to
discuss you know server back-end
architecture with the server guys and
protocols and all these things that are
traditionally iOS development but at the
same time you have to be you have to be
able to sit down with the UX folks and
discuss you know UI views and all the
standard iOS tools that you have to
available to you mm-hmm
yeah when I when I've spoken to a hiring
manager
who are looking for mobile developers
here at Google they'll often say you
know give me a really strong computer
scientist who has maybe a little bit of
exposure to mobile app development in
the mobile space but a real passion for
and that's desire2learn and I would love
people like that yeah yeah
noise so hiring if we're looking at
folks right here yeah we'll start off I
mean our dream candidate would be you
know computer science Brad who's got
objective-c experience who knows OpenGL
the overlap of those three is pretty
darn rare so definitely having the
objectors definitely having the computer
science part the rest can be learned
significantly faster okay so we have a
question from one of the people who's
watching this hangout and this person is
really asking you know as you know in
computer science there are all sorts of
different choices that people can make
in terms of you know C++ Java you know
different different types of classes
they can take and so this person asks or
says I'm a 19 year old computer science
student and I love the mobile area I'd
like to know what I should focus on to
have a chance to work in mobile
development at Google
I mean Python Java Android iOS
development what should specifically be
the focus of my study I mean I can take
a shot at this I guess um so my again my
background I actually saw the primary
language that I studied in school was
Java and when I came to Google I
actually started programming in Python
then moved back to Java and then moved
to Objective C once I went to iOS
development on and I think the common
thing again to get back to the kind of
fundamentals things is an
object-oriented like being strong in
your object-oriented language skills is
really important on in terms of
specifically focusing on mobile
development I think get the M&amp;amp;A
any additional exposure that you can get
to doing the actual app development is a
learning process like the the first time
even with any prior like core background
that you have you know the more
experience you have the more things that
you're gonna learn and you're always you
know hopefully you're not gonna make the
same mistake over and over again
so I mean definitely you know I would
say if you have classes in in Android
and that's one of the things that you
can focus on since it's Java that's you
know definitely a good thing but it's
not like it's necessarily a make or
break you know if you don't do it like
you know pick it up in your spare time
you can do that play around with it
yourself like a lot of it I think in
general here is at least my background
has been just kind of one of learnt kind
of learning as you're going and and kind
of just consume as much information as
possible mm-hmm I think one of the
things that I would emphasize as I'm
always amazed when I'm interviewing
candidates here at Google when I say
especially new grads and I say you know
have you ever worked on any open source
stuff and some of them go oh yeah I got
this I got this
lalala and they haven't mentioned it on
their resume at all and you know me
being able as an interviewer if it was
mentioned on their resume it gives me
something to go look at and get more of
a feel about the person that or at least
they're coding then I'm gonna get you
know for the 60 minutes that we
hopefully get to spend together briefly
chatting you know and and when they were
writing that code they probably were
sitting here nervous and up at a
whiteboard and panicky and you know in
some cases jet-lagged cuz they got flown
in for an interview yep and I can really
you can really see how what they've
contributed and what they know by taking
a look at what they've really done so
that would be something I would
emphasize you know there's tons of cool
open-source projects that people are
gumming that they're looking for
developers for if you can get involved
in one of those and you know have
something that you can show and say I
did this then I can look at that's great
I mean as
and degree with Greg you know picking up
your first computer language takes a
couple years your second one takes a
little less your third one takes a
little less at a certain point I mean
hopefully after a week or two you should
be I mean no no fluid but at least able
to do the basics so yeah Reforma it's
far more interested again in having a
good and a desire to learn than anything
else yeah and I think one of the things
that really jumped out thank you for
sharing that in addition to the open
source people maybe providing a link or
the name of their you know what their
apps are if they've maybe developed a
small app or something that doesn't have
to be obviously as sophisticated as as
Google Maps but you know just something
that we can look at and play with and
have questions about during the
interview oh yeah one of the best
interviews I ever had was a guy who
brought in his iPad for me and sat there
in gushed over the app that he'd written
Wow I mean we talked about for the
entire interview it was really cool and
I I think one of the things also jumped
out to me about what Greg said is the
things that he learned once he came to
Google is I think that there can be a
perception that you know people need to
come to Google fully-formed in terms of
knowing a whole suite of languages or
knowing certain types of technology and
certainly we want people who have have
taken great advantage of their learning
opportunities but you know Google as
much as any place is aware that people
you know technology is always changing
and so you know just you know develop
the the fundamental knowledge understand
that your that during the interview
process we might focus more on how you
think then other factors and and and
that if we if we get an understanding
that you have have learned a lot and are
capable of learning more and and growing
while at the company that that you're
going to be able to learn new things and
move into new areas and maybe things
that you never even envisioned before
you apply to Google
so so we're just about done Dave any any
final thoughts that you'd say to the
students who are out there Oh put me on
the spot yeah you're next
no yeah I I mean we keep keep coming
back to this just having the
fundamentals of computer science down
and I mean I we've been focusing on that
but I really think that I mean the big
key thing for a lot of the folks around
here is a passion for the technology and
wanting to use it and figuring out new
ways of using it which is key as I said
the guy who brought in his iPad and
gushed over the app that he'd written it
wasn't an it wasn't an important app it
wasn't something he was ever gonna sell
but he was so happy that he figured out
this little trick for doing exactly what
he wanted to do it that he put it
together himself and I mean I could tell
immediately that we could throw him into
anything and he would be just overjoyed
to do it and you know I mean certainly
alright to come into an interview
nervous and scared cuz you know
everybody does it but just try to make
sure that you show off that you really
are interested in learning and doing
stuff I think that'll cover half of it
that's right I mean it definitely to
kind of expand on that like the one
thing that I was gonna say is obviously
beyond kind of like passion for you know
the space or the application and you
know focusing on the user I would
definitely say you know the the
willingness to like learn and experiment
like I would say that the one of the big
culture things here at Google that I
found is you know there's this constant
kind of wanting to do things better but
also like trying new things out because
you don't necessarily always know you
know what the ideal either algorithm or
you know application or use case or
whatever you're working on is until you
go
and try it and and I think that's part
of the process especially you know
especially when when you're a new grad
or kind of new to the field but I mean
it keeps on going because computer
science it not only has the the breadth
of all these different things that you
can work on but you know there's a
extreme depth to it to where you can
drill in further and further if there's
you know a certain field that you really
are passionate about there's oftentimes
you can find all that my nudity you know
like all those minut details that like
really make you know either the
application that much better the
algorithm that much faster all these
like little things and it's really comes
back to like you know the passion and
the the excitement around pinnable
learning and exploring those new things
well thank you guys thank you for
sharing your passion and thanks for
developing a fantastic app Thanks okay
well thanks everybody and and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
