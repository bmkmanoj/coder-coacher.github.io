rising junior at University of
Pennsylvania and currently I'm working
on the payments team within Adsense
which is the division of online sales
and operations if there's one thing I'd
want other students to know it be to
just go for it to not be apprehensive I
was a bit apprehensive about even
applying I didn't think I had a shot I
mean I just told myself that there are
thousands and thousands of people
applying what are the odds that they
choose me and lo and behold they did so
I would definitely say go for it it's a
phenomenal experience you learn so much
not only through the program but through
all the people you meet and all the
people you work with there's a wealth of
knowledge and intelligence here and it's
just great to be part of that so
definitely don't think twice about it be
bold and go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
