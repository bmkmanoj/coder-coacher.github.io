and I have made an impact so I'm a
rising senior at the University of Texas
in Austin which is a fantastic school
and I'm studying computer science doing
a thesis and computer science education
and the summer after marking on the
Google
this is actually my second internship
here at Google was lucky enough to have
ever to come back and last summer I
worked on systems which is completely
different from the front and social
product that I working on now I'm just
really great because not only did I get
two different teams to hang out with and
two different experiences we asked them
to do two very different things and I
think that that's really any
a transition from from met systems
background to the front and the work
that I'm doing right now and I've had
such a great support system for my team
assigned an actress I had no front end
experience
they really work with me to teach middle
languages and the frameworks and so now
I feel much more uniquely qualified to
our home almost anything because I know
that I can I don't just have to keep
them the same
graduate so my relationship with my team
has been really amazing and I think the
main reason for that it's just because
I'm so extroverted and so getting to
work on a social project product we've
actually created a social team and it's
really fantastic and we don't get to
hang out together do things together go
to the movies eat lunch you'd lunch
together go to dinner after work and
being a part of that is great we came up
with something called formal Friday here
at Google which is quite the opposite of
every other companies casual Fridays so
we're dressing up in banquet dresses
together and I think that that's really
a unique experience feeling so connected
to my team like that it's just making
internship amazing and not only do I
have a team but I also have the entire
support google+ for me so Vic is
actually the senior VP of the product
and he and Bradley boss it immediately
behind me as an intern to be so close to
such as
people is actually nerve-racking ly
awesome and my second day here at Google
I had my people plus a test account made
before we had launched and Vic came up
to my desk and asked me as a mentor I
was a college student what do you think
do we have a shot are we gonna be able
to do this and being asked that by that
senior VP of my product before we'd ever
launched was it just made me feel really
included unlikely things actually matter
that being on a team like this is just
such a great experience
so one of the best things about
interning at Google is that you're
actually working on something that
matters you're doing things that are
visible
far-reaching implications Google is a
company that's constantly innovating
getting to be a part approval means
you're part of an innovation and I think
that having the resources of a large one
who will actually mean that
tastic opportunity to do something into
in such a short period of time that will
really mean something at the end of
myself at the summer my product is going
to be launched on google+ I'm going to
get to see it and last summer I built a
product that was internal but it's still
got used and I only built it in 10 weeks
but I had time to create something that
mattered
and I think that Google is large enough
to support a detectives that actually
allow you to be involved as one of us
and as an intern I actually helped out
by doing do I polishes so I was making
the stream look cleaner and fixing the
colors and the pixels and lining
everything up so that it's all perfectly
aligned and ready to go so that by the
time actually launched my codes and
they're helping make it look like the
sparkling product that it is now and I
wish like will be a partner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
