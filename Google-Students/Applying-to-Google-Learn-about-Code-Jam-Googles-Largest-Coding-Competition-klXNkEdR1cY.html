with us there I met you I'm Pablo hi and
believe it or not we do actually make
sound when we move our lips so hopefully
that'll work out fine this time so let
me just tell you a little bit about what
code Jam is it's a contest where we
write tough algorithmic problems and
then you write solutions to them and one
neat thing about code Jam is you can
write these solutions in just about any
language you want a lot of contestants
use things like steeples Plus and Python
but we also get submissions in like wall
code and white space and even
Shakespeare so that's a variety so a
code Jam is actually 14 years old it's
even older than Android believe it or
not and it's really important to Google
not just as a way to attract new talent
but also as a way to just share the joy
of thinking about these tough
algorithmic questions and I keep saying
tough but rest assured you can dive
right into code Jam there's a whole
bunch of different rounds of increasing
difficulty and when I started first
started competing in 2011 I'd only just
learned to program I had never done a
programming contest yeah it was still
able to have a great time so a few stats
about code Jam every year we have tens
of thousands of participants we hope
that if you haven't done it before
you'll help us increase those numbers
it's a worldwide contest most of it is
online and then the final round is
actually like on-site at a different
world location every time we've done
Dublin Dublin before London New York
Tokyo this year we're returning to
Dublin and we're excited about that and
then as of 2015 we have a parallel track
called distributed code Jam where you
write code that runs on a hundred
different nodes at a time and like those
nodes are communicating with each other
and you can break up a problem and solve
something that you couldn't solve in a
non distributed way so that's all fun
and let me also say a little bit about
20% time at Google so we have this
notion that 80% of the time you can work
on your primary project and 20% of the
time you can do something completely
different so we have lots of people at
Google who work on all kinds of
different things who also help with code
Jam they submit problem ideas they help
us review problems they help us prepare
them and that kind of keeps the contest
more diverse than it would be if just
the full timers we're writing it so I'm
going to talk about one of my favorite
problems from last year it was written
by Pablo who you'll hear more from in a
second and it's called slides
the exclamation point and it's about
using giant slides to slide between
buildings and we don't have this
technology yet at Google but who knows
maybe someday so the problem is about a
thinly disguised version of Google
called ghuli that has a total of be
different buildings here there are six
of them in this illustration and the CEO
of Ghoulie likes to get to her favorite
cafe and walking there would be boring
so she's going to get there by giant
slides that connect the buildings and go
one way so there's lots of ways we could
build slides between buildings this is
one of them for instance and what makes
this problem a little more difficult is
so like when I was a kid and my mom was
driving me home from school I'd be like
let's go a different way it's got a
different way like I like variety and so
does the CEO the CEO wants to have a
particular number of ways to get from
her office to her favorite cafe so for
instance here there are three paths
there's the red arrows connecting like
the top three buildings the yellow is
like go through the top two and down and
so on so there are three different ways
for her to get to the cafe there so in
this problem what we do is we give you I
two pieces of data we give you the
number of buildings and the number of
paths the CEO once you have to have
exactly that many paths and there are
two different levels of which you can
solve this problem like in many cogent
problems either there's only six
buildings and the number of paths is
only up to 20 or there could be 50
buildings and up to 10 to the 18th
different paths so the large one is
quite a bit harder than the small to
talk us through this problem I'm going
to hand it over to Pablo thanks yen
um so now that you had some time to
think about it and in if you actually
compete yoga you'll have a little bit
more I will talk about the solution and
like the thought process that someone
will need to go through to actually get
it um so we start with our with our
drawings of buildings and slides and the
the key thing we need to notice to solve
this problem is that we can't really
have paths that go from the office to
the cafe that go through a cycle like in
this illustration you can see that we've
added a slide that makes a cycle marked
with a yellow arrow and there's the
possible
and the problem with this is that if you
have that then you'll have like one path
that goes directly from the office to
the cafe an iPad that goes from the
office goes one through the cycle and
goes to the cafe another pair that goes
from the office goes twice through the
cycle and to a cafe and so on and so
forth so we'll you will end up with
infinitely many paths and since the
input asks for a particular integer
number M of paths infinity will never be
equal and will always be greater to that
number so as long as we have that cycle
we are never going to comply to what the
input is asking so after we made this
key observation in the problem um and we
know there will be no cycles that can go
through a pad we know that there's
something called a topological sort of
the buildings which means that we can
put the buildings in order such that
every slide goes forward as you can see
in the example in the picture so
basically if we number the buildings
from left to right every slide grows
from a lower number building to a large
number building um and this is really
neat because half the possible slides
are gone once we we established this
direction and and this is more or less
enough to solve the small by brute
forcing the possibilities even though we
only have six buildings this this fixed
direction leave us with only 15 possible
slides we have five possible slices out
of the office only for that started at
the second building from the left and so
on and so forth not accounts for 15
possible sites in total and that means
there's only two to the 15 combinations
of lights right because each of those
slides could be present or not
repressing um so we can't because to to
a 15 is not a large number for computer
is only is less than 50,000 we can try
all of those for each of those we need
to count how many paths it will resolve
from the office to a cafe and again
since there are so few buildings and
everybody has to has to include both the
office and the cafe the only thing we
need to check here is which ones of the
other buildings will be including since
again we know in which order there will
be transverse
so again there's up to 2 to a 4 because
it's 6 minus the two that are forced to
be in the path and then for each of
those combinations of buildings we can
check whether
that's a path or not depending on which
lights we've included intentions for all
those possibilities of slides that we
are checking if if any of those has
exactly n path then we just output that
combination um and then we have solved a
small version of the problem now there
are several ways of course to think
about problems but one thing I would
like to introduce here is that you can
use data especially when once you have
the small solution or any solution of a
smaller version to try to inspire you or
actually hint you into what to do next
so in this case since we solve the small
we can check what happens and for all
combinations B and M that comply with
the small limits in this case we have
each row represents a different value of
B and each column represent a different
value for M and we have painted in green
the combinations that result in a
possible solution that means there's
some combination of slides that achieve
that combination of values and red is
when there's none and we can immediately
two things here the first thing that's
important to notice is that all of the
values that are possible are together
and all of the values that are
impossible arctic are also together so
it seems like all the there but
everything is possible up to some value
of M and then what that value gets too
big for the number of buildings then
it's impossible and the other thing that
we can notice is that there's a
particular well-known shape and for how
this maximum number increases there is
the maximum is one for two buildings two
for three buildings four and then eight
and n is 16 which is a simple
exponential with base two and this makes
sense right because if we think that the
maximum for a maximum possible M is 2 to
the B minus 2 for any given B and that
makes sense because the maximum will be
accomplished whenever we use all the
possible slides that the more slides we
put the more paths that are possible
we'll never including a slide will never
decrease the number of possible paths
and if we include all slides it's not
hard to prove that there will be 2 to be
minus 2 paths of course when I say all
possible slides are only referring to
the slides ago in the upper video
action according to the key observation
we talk about intervening so then um we
can use this the the fact that this is
the obvious that the powers of two
combine nicely to fully solve the
problem so if we put all possible slides
between every node except the office and
then we add a slide from building one
which is the office to building B which
is the cafe that will include only one
path but then since we put all the other
slides starting with starting a building
B minus one there will be a single path
to the up to the cafe if we start up
building B minus 2 there will be two
paths if we start our building B minus 3
there will be four paths and so on and
so forth every time multiplying by 2 so
we can just use the slides that start at
the first build in the office to write
the M minus 1 paths that we are missing
in binary and just pick and choose which
powers of 2 we want to include um and if
we do that we can construct any graph
with any number of paths between 1 and
to the -2 and we already shown that
there can be more so that gives a full
solution if M is larger than to the B
minus 2 then we output impossible and
otherwise we use this procedure to build
the output graph to see this more
visually an example here we have B equal
for buildings and we know that M
lectures are greater than 4 it's
impossible because 2 to the 4 minus 2 is
4 and then here are the 4 possible
answer for the possible cases um in case
M equals 1 then we already have the one
path going directly from the office to
the cafe illustrated here by buildings 1
2 4 and it's M equal equals 2 then
that's 0 1 in binary so we only need to
include one slide from building one to
building three if M equals 3 that's 1 0
in binary so we don't include one slide
from 1 to 2 and if M equals 4 then M
minus 1 in binary is 1 1 and then we
have to include both sides and we won't
do that now because it will take too
much time but you can check in all these
drawings that the number of parts that
are possible between building 1 &amp;amp; 4 is
always the required
and so that concludes the account of the
solution um before diving into questions
I would like to invite you to join us on
our social channels in Google+ Twitter
and Facebook and also visit our website
at Chico's last cochon where you can
already register for the 2017 season of
cochon so now we'll go read some
questions that we received do any
strange everyone so one question we get
a lot is like how to prepare for Coach
gym and for other similar contests the
only there's no real substitute for just
trying a bunch of previous problems
there's a list of past problems on our
past contest page that was some
particularly accessible ones you kind of
want to start off with some easier ones
in the work your way up um I would
recommend like working on a problem for
maybe an hour and then if you can't see
what to do you can maybe look around
look at our analysis where we explain
how you would approach such a problem or
look at some past competitors code which
you can download and see how they
approached it yes yes um so of course
there's some topics that you can study
that will help like knowing math or
knowing algorithms or a bunch of
different computer science topics will
help you with the contest and but yeah
there's no substitute for practice and
also if you start by practicing it will
motivate you to study what you really
need instead of just selling some random
topic and then hoping it will help and
also I'd like to ask that practice in
this type of contests is not only useful
to develop them but also to be a better
programmer a better scientist and
possibly get a shot of injury and then
we also get asked a fair bit about the
qualification around the first round of
the contest and it works a little
differently from the others so let me
just say a bit about that it runs for 27
hours but don't worry you're not going
to be like coding for 27 hours straight
like sometimes that happens at work who
knows but like you only need to get a
certain number of points to advance in
the qualification round and you'll know
exactly how many points that is so you
can just keep solving problems until you
hit that total and you can keep going if
you want we always put in some problems
in the qual round
are pretty tricky and might not work as
well under time pressure and other
rounds but are fun to think about for a
while so if you can solve all the
problems in the qual rad then like
you're in really good shape for the
contest but you don't need to solve all
of them yeah we're really 27 we give you
27 hours such that you can choose when
to start especially since this is a
global contest that spans all time zones
in the world and you you're free that
you don't you don't need to feel
pressure to start at the very beginning
of the qualification round if that
happens to be a really bad time for you
in your time zone or for whatever reason
especially because the the penalty so
the time it takes for you to solve
problems doesn't matter in the
qualification round the only thing that
matters is achieving some specific
number of points and it doesn't matter
if you solve all the problems in the
last hour in the first hour or sometimes
in the middle and then let's look we
have another question about like what
are some good resources for learning
algorithms and data stuff like this um
gosh like how much time do you have is
kind of a question that there's some
great like well-known books like
introduction to algorithms the one that
people probably abbreviate as CLRS
Donald Knuth is written like a whole
library of different algorithm
techniques but I would say like for
coding contest purposes you can look
around at different contests and like
we've written explanations for all our
problems other sites have written
tutorials on common things that show up
Pablo has a lot of experience with this
too so do you think yeah so I agree that
there's the like media resources and
there's more than any one person can
ever read or try um and as I said I
think the best the best advice is to
just practice and try to go find
whatever you need for instance if you
practice with caution problems and then
there's some problem that you can solve
a but you read the analysis and maybe in
the analysis there's some technical
terms or algorithms or mathematical
theorems or something that you don't
know and then you can go look it up and
that will help you build some body of
knowledge that will be helpful in the
future without having to first get go
get a pile of books your introduction to
algorithms is usually like the go-to
book for beginners empowerment contests
um but there's also all kinds of
resources and there's right now there's
a lot of
programming contest going so you can
practice with all of them and with your
format you find best um yeah so we have
another question so be Williams is
saying some of these problems are rather
hard I don't think you'll see these in
interviews like how does this help with
interviews or prep for sweet rolls
that's a great question
I would say that the problems that
appear in like round one of code Jam are
often at the same level as interview
questions you might be asked and some of
the same techniques tend to show up so
code jam can be really good practice for
interviews it's certainly like helped me
out when I was personally for an
interview um and like just kind of my
nature there's overlap between the sorts
of questions that get asked in on-site
interviews and the sorts of questions
that come up in code Jam so certainly
you can't it's not a waste of time to do
this or any other programming contest if
you're working on your use yeah well the
coach on programming contest yeah will
definitely help you because even if the
questions are harder the techniques and
the the things you practice and the
coding and debugging that you have to go
through will help you even program
things to the bone appear in the priming
contest like most of the development
shops out there you will know you will
usually not directly use the algorithms
or data structures or the mathematical
theorems but still like learning to
combine them and to and to debug your
code and to write code bug-free code is
great help for job interviews and for
work later and and all the stuff and so
so yeah the practice is good and if you
are practicing for interviews at Google
or elsewhere remember that it's not just
about programming and or calculating
complexity there there might be other
topics that interviewers might be
interesting so don't restrict yourself
to just one particular topic and also
when you're coding in an interview like
make sure that your code style is good
in code jam when you're just like
writing some code like to solve
something locally you might like fall
into bad habits of like not giving clear
variable names or like having kind of
opaque hard to understand stuff as long
as it works fast enough
but when you're showing your code to
another human like in an interview make
sure that you keep that in mind so we
have a question for Pablo in particular
saying how do you practice ball the
problem-solving so how do you how do I
I have practiced directly in a while
because I didn't compete for several
years but I've completed a lot when I
was studying Anna lipid after um at that
time I was just so I read a couple of
books and I also like I did the computer
science in my undergrad so I had a lot
of classes and when I had electives I
always pick the ones that were mostly
picked the ones that were related and I
also used to train for Math Olympiad in
high school and stuff um and I will say
like again the the the finger I think
got me from one level to the highest
level which is not the highest in the
war but it it's listen for me um it's
practice a lot she's the register for
all contests that are out there do them
and when you don't have the time because
it's it's a time that you have to be at
work or class or sleeping just do them
afterwards but do them seriously as if
you were really competing right not to
go read the analysis or ask for the
solution until you really try your best
and when you do as for the solution go
and implement it even though if you
already have the idea because
implementing is usually the thing that
that stops us from doing really good oh
yeah I've had plenty of cases where I'm
like oh yeah I know how to solve this
and then you actually like sit down to
try to do it in like an hour and a half
later it's not working so yeah make sure
you actually turn your ideas in the code
so we have another question here about
how many people participate in each
round which I'll field real quick in the
qual round we have about 60,000
registrants but then the number of
people advancing to like the round ones
is usually I think on the order of
twenty or thirty thousand and then after
that point it's actually kind of
predetermined how many people advance
the top 1,000 from each of the round
ones will go through so that's three
thousand that makes me round - and then
it narrows down to five hundred for
round three and by the time in the world
finals it's only 26 people including our
previous year's champion so all of those
people actually the world finals have
their own like desk set up and that's
live and in person in on camera and so
on and then let me say a little about
distributed code Jam if you make it to
round 2 of code Jam you automatically
qualify for distributed that's the only
way to get in in fact and then that has
its own track that leads to its own
World Finals yeah the numbers for you
are the same Sen just mentioned so 3,000
go through the first online round and
500 go through the second or background
of distributed and then 16 will make it
to or 21 this year will I be 21 I think
this year for the finals and so that's
two ways you can make it to Dublin and
join us for the finals so we have how
are the solutions that we come up with
submitted do they need to be in a
specific format someone solving the
problem using our like JavaScript or
Excel so you can solve in any language
allowed by the rules which is virtually
everything you can I won't quote the
terms and conditions like on there or
anything but just about anything you'll
run it locally and you can submit your
source code the general principle is
that like some other hypothetical
competitor needs to be able to run your
code after the contest and get the same
answers that you did that's what we're
really looking for otherwise like style
choices etc are all up to you but to
summarize you will run the code in your
own computer and get and get the correct
up you will download the input from our
site run the code in your own computer
that calculates the output and then
upload the output so we don't really
need to run your code you still need to
upload it so we can check that you
didn't cheat but learn that the code
will run in your own computer so you
know how much how much you can run in
four minutes right minutes
oh speaking of cheating we actually a
question about that so let's tackle that
real quick basically a very small
minority of people cheat in these
contests this is a general problem for
like academic computer science - it
doesn't just happen in code gym and we
don't want to tip our hand by saying
exactly how we do cheating detection but
we do it we take this seriously we the
integrity of the contest is at stake and
we've even had like last year we had two
interns who were working on improving
our tuning detector the for instance so
it's something we take seriously yeah
and you if you cheat you will be
disqualified from participation so don't
do it
just remember the cheating is not fun
and we have how do you get a code gem
shirt yes so we're like modeling this
for you right now I just has a quick fun
fact I don't know if you can see it but
on the back of every shirt it's
different every year
wearing the one for Seattle today
depends on where the World Finals is and
those pictures are actually made of code
that contestants have submitted from the
contests kind of a neat design to wear
around so to get to to answer the
question to get the shirt you need to
make it to round 2 of Coach am so being
the top 3,000 right no no you need to be
the top 1,000 I'm sorry what happened so
you could know this I know it's from
bitter painful personal experience when
I was like 1046 there's something to
isn't so you have to do kind of well in
run to to to get the share than this
that's the first price you can aspire to
and I think we'll have to be rounding a
brow because we're running out of time
please keep asking questions in our
social channels and this will be on
youtube if you want to review it or
remember what we said and remember to
register go to shit go slash cochon man
register for the 2017 contest that will
start on April 7 so you have plenty of
time but just go do it so we can send
you an e-mail or even remind you and you
don't miss it
right yeah give it a try if I can do it
so can you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
