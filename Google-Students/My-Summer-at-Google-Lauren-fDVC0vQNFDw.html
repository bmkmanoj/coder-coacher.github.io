intern and i am from Chicago Illinois I
go to Northwestern University majoring
in performance sighs this summer I
worked with the technical university
programs team in the people operations
the bolt program is a ten week
internship for non-technical students
and it helps them ever see in the bowl
program is really fostering growth for
students of all majors and all
backgrounds so one of my favorite parts
about the bold whole program is that
every Friday we got to come together all
of our interns and sit down and listen
to some of the executives of the company
speak we've got to ask them personal
questions questions about the projects
that they're working on and I feel like
that was an awesome learning opportunity
for all of us because we're developing
our careers and being able to hear from
these people will have been through a
lot and I've been really successful what
they're doing has was a really great
learning
this summer I help coordinate the
computer science Summer Institute
computer science summer Institute's
three-week program and it is for rising
college freshman or interested in
computer science I also worked on a
video series that would be placed on
YouTube about engineering interns week
and impractical
I feel like I made an impact on google
in two different ways the first impact I
feel like I made was with the students
of the computer science Summer Institute
I really got a chance to sit down with
them talk to them and kind of be a
mentor and a guide because they're going
into their freshman year of college and
it was really great to be able to give
them advice because i know i didn't have
someone like that going into college and
just be able to talk to them about the
things that really scary and that they
were nervous about I think that it's
great and being able to foster those
relationships and keep them going if
they ever need because I'm very close in
age with them I think that that is an
awesome opportunity for them it's also
also an awesome opportunity
to see them grow also it was really
great to be able to work with the
engineering interns and get to hear
about their experiences this summer
during their internships being able to
highlight the great things that they
worked on this summer and being able to
know that that'll be seen by people all
around the world is really awesome I
love to spread the message that these
interns are trying to convey it was a
really great learning experience for me
to be able to understand and and hear
what they have to say
I think my favorite part about working
at Google is the people that I get to
meet not only do I get to meet other
interns that are here to the bold
internship but I also get to meet all
these great people on different teams
I've had meetings with directors on my
department it's really great to be able
to sit down and talk with them about
life and get advice from them it's
really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
so the summer I got to work on a lot of
different projects that I never thought
I would be able to do I gotta learn how
to edit videos I got to make a website
those kind of small things are really
important if I could talk to a student
who is interested in interning for
Google out so I'm gonna go for it I was
really nervous coming here being a plum
Studies major and I got to learn so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
