I've made an impact at Google was born
and raised in Texas i go to school at
rentschler Polytechnic in Troy New York
and I'm pursuing an undergraduate degree
in bachelor science studying computer
science and computer systems engineering
and for this summer I got to intern at
Google in the ads back end
my project as part of the ads back end
has been to create a web user interface
to help other engineers increase the
amount of tests that they can run at a
time so it helps manage and also launch
other tests to improve productivity
apart from the free food and the amazing
opportunities you have just on campus
whether it's plain involved it's or
taking a break to play piano there are
many other things such as all the great
people and intelligent mine didn't
gifted people you have that you can meet
here on all levels so people that have
been here for years to your fellow
interns and so a group of our interns
even get together weekly just to have
lunches together to be able to talk
about all sorts of fun topics and I
think you know the growth at community
just you know awesome people hanging out
with where you can have a really great
time just that's a lot of cool technical
or anything it's just a blast although
the project i work on isn't visible to
everyone outside of Google I know it
makes a big impact on the inside of
Google for my hosts another one else on
my team the opportunity to be part of
this team just allows you to have any
larger impact on everyone you work with
and makes it that much more fun though
my project is invisible outside of
Google I know that during my summer here
I've gained so much experience and so
much knowledge just for my host and
other interns and and just from being
part of a large company like Google has
really helped me kind of decide where I
want to go in the future and really help
to clarify a lot of questions I've had
from everything from life to protein
styles and also just things about going
outside and how wonderful the weather is
here so overall interning here google
has just a huge impact on my life and
hopefully in the future I'll be opening
a larger impact on others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
