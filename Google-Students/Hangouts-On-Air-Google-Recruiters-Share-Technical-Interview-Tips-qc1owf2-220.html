I'm a lead recruiter here at Google and
wanted to welcome you all to our second
Google hangout on air to talk about
technical interviews and give you guys a
chance to gauge a little bit here what
some Google engineers have to say about
technical interviews and so to start
things off I'd like to just introduce
Rachel and Eddie I'll give you guys just
a quick second to introduce yourself
Rachel won't you go first and then we'll
start jumping into some of the content
sure so I'm Rachel and I'm an engineer
on the chrome team and work on front-end
features for that and I've been at
Google for about three years in detail
and doing interviews almost as long
email that's great well my name is Eddie
I am an engineer on the Google platforms
team specifically I do need some
software development mostly a lot of
back-end work dealing with our days and
infrastructures and in a strange
coincidence that Rachel and I were
actually in the same interview training
and she was the sample interviewee and I
was sample energy were just kind of
madly worked out this way and you both
got hired amazing cool um well yeah I
mean you know what I was hoping we could
talk about is getting them back in the
fall we did a blog series and one of the
things we talked about was you know
preparing for a technical interview and
there were a few things that I really
harped on hot dogs from not the right
description but I really focused on you
know having candidates need to do their
homework going back through brushing up
on what they've done looking out finding
sample questions on things that they
might hear really making sure they know
know what's coming and be as prepared as
they possibly can and then also looks
like we lost Rachel trouble can get her
back you know then also go and Ennio
basically go back and you know brush up
on your algorithms and sort of your
or CS stuff like that one of the
examples I put out there Eddy is the you
know MIT opens OpenCourseWare which you
know basically allows people to take
free courses or mighty and I'm not
saying I need to go take a free course
in orti but give you the option to go
back and take that basic algorithms
course to brush up and then you know the
one that I sort of laugh at the most is
to basically know your resume right
don't put on your resume that you're an
expert in Java and doing X Y &amp;amp; Z and
walk into this technical interview and
have someone go hey you know Java we'll
talk about this and that and find
yourself starting your interview on your
on your heels from the get-go
and so those were sort of my you know my
quick things I joke around on the block
you know sort of rinse and repeat until
if we get desired results but you know
would love to hear just a quick few
thoughts on you know what you look for
and how you would prepare for a
technical interview and I'll reinvent
while you're talking
look at that well I mean mine I mean
just little background on my interview
experience when I've interviewed
approximately 120 candidates at this
point and I've had a lot of experience
dealing with university students
recruiting it for the university
community of Texas Carnegie Mellon so
I've seen a lot of these student
candidates a typical interview with me
and pretty much any other Google
engineer it's going to be very different
from what you probably read about and
let's say your tie or the Wall Street
Journal that they always they only post
these trivia questions about oh you've
got an egg off the building and I could
drop it from or how do you gotta have a
blender or whatever and the thing is
that we I mean we haven't been asking
pose since I've been here and in fact
hiring committee knows that we should be
asking those so you didn't got asked one
side even in the world like that they're
just going to disregard the question but
a typical interview with me is going to
cover three facets coding algorithms
consistent design and the thing is is
that I expect you to be good at all of
it you don't have to be a superstar at
all of them but I expect you to be able
to do of I mean each of these areas I
don't care about your language choice
but whichever one you choose I expect
you to be familiar with it that that you
chose this language you're comfortable
with it so if you say I'm gonna do it in
Java then it should be proper Java
syntax it shouldn't be Java with a bit a
bit of Python mix then like obvious
other things you can do it only applies
across class number okay and that's a
mistake that actually happens as far as
number of phones in general though I try
to make all my coding questions easy
enough that you could solve it in see
without library then you're somewhat
limited in what you can ask an interview
if it is a format you have a short
period of time to meet with someone if
you want to make sure a lot about but
you don't have conversations you want to
deal with the simple coding question but
also if you able to get into some more
complicated algorithms and you can't
implement complicated I mean like trying
to figure out how to do different types
of graph algorithms for example and you
can't code that yeah but I mean I want
you to succeed in an interview so don't
go don't think that we're out to get you
when you're doing you definitely want to
have talented coworkers
people who are capable of conversing
freely level values or so so we are on
your side please
cool so did you want me to go more or
less key I was going to ask you it's
sort of a bit of a tangent question but
one way for Rachel I was thinking you
know how do you and I know we've gotten
some questions off the moderator page -
you know when you run into a candidate's
an interview in an in an interview
excuse me I've had too much coffee today
and and they struggle or they they get
stuck you know I always counsel
candidates you know communicate
communicate communicate would love sort
of you know just your thoughts as it you
know it's one thing for the recruiter to
say it's a very different thing for the
actual engineering who's interview the
person say it so I look just your
thoughts on that well honestly I expect
some back-and-forth in an interview that
generally speaking to the other notes I
had here is the worst candidates in
terms of scoring and performance to the
ones who don't talk through the problems
you guys what will often happen is
they'll misunderstand the question of a
bit stuck and then they just stare
blankly at a whiteboard or whatever and
then when they do this I mean I can't
help if they don't know where they're at
I mean I'd like to oftentimes I mean
just if you get stuck to say I'm stuck I
don't know what I'm doing or I think
that it could be this start with a
simple solution and then optimize it for
a better solution that you want to keep
making some progress and if you get
stuck that's fine quite frankly a lot of
my more complicated questions I don't
expect you enough I expect to have a
nice conversation about the relative
benefits and disadvantages of different
solutions to the problem so it's okay to
get stuff it's okay
just to just say to your stuff but just
talk about what you're thinking and why
you're out it's a perfectly valid way of
an interview and most candidate students
even successful candidates right
absolutely think Rachel's having some
technical difficulties well keep going
you and I can do this okay
you know one of the one of the questions
that they would get as you know what to
the and this is from from Jason and
Singapore you know what what are the
interviews really look for when they're
conducting an independent I know we
talked a little bit about you know the
high level
coding design algorithms because they're
sort of like the the one thing that
makes you go that's right that's that's
what I was looking for well it's not to
say because honestly I mean from my
perspective I mean I want a complete
candidate there's no one thing I'm
looking for that I mean I said there are
often conversations will see on Packard
news for example talking about I'm
looking for us ninja in SQL I'm looking
for a design guru I agree we want to
have people who are generalist so I
expect people to be conversant in a
variety of topics now I certainly
appreciate when someone's an expert in a
given area that I mean they're kind of
the we're having all kind of problem
rachemurphy but basically my my PhD
advisor I think from he said of the best
it's that a great engineer is someone
who knows a little about a lot and a lot
about it so that's pretty much what I'm
going for
um so I mean the three areas that I do
look for our coding algorithms in system
design and they need to be able to be
confident in all three right but the big
one that I think a lot of people make is
they try to give a very insular but
that's why the best thing I can say that
they the things that don't work well you
know candidates were very quiet who
aren't good at conveying technical
concepts clearly because the law can
happen is that because they can't convey
the concept clearly I misunderstand what
it is they're going for we can sometimes
go off on tangents ever the wrong way
the problem can go that they can get
stuck and I can't give the heck people
can get unstuck that sort of thing so we
have a question from Waterloo Canada
from Arthur from Waterloo it's actually
really funny I I support our Waterloo
office night when I grabbed my t-shirt
this morning and I know we were talking
our t-shirt show off earlier if you want
to go show yours off at any
Razorback pride the only Razorback in
engineering that I can follow but I was
trying to decide between a sort of
standard Google t-shirt and I'll just
you know sort through my nothing and in
a Waterloo t-shirt so Arthur Waterloo I
apologize for not one of my Waterloo
t-shirt but your your question Arthur is
how
can you tell is there way to tell and
you're ready for a technical interview
at Google now I have some opinions on
this because I have my opinion on it as
well
you know I kind of feel like if you've
done your prep right and you go out and
you look at you know sites like top
coder or you know different competitions
and things like Co Jim and you know all
of these different things that are out
there for or sort of coding and you know
software
I don't want competency I guess is what
I'm looking for so that you know when
you're really comfortable in that kind
of an environment it's not going to be a
one-to-one perfect match but you're
gonna have a gut feel and how you're
feeling about the interview okay hi
Rachel
we've been doing a really good job not
teasing you while you've been having
technical difficulties we'll make up for
it by teasing you know and love so so
the question that we're answering is is
what would be a good way to tell if
you're ready for the technical interview
at Google Jeff just gave his response I
have to agree with gentleness but I feel
like you're ready for a technical
interview when you feel comfortable in
the knowledge of computer science and
engineering I think that that there's a
lot of timidity associated with it that
people are afraid of the process which I
guess goes into each of questions but
quite frankly the process of Google is
not that different from other places
that it's a fairly typical process that
software engineer without the umpires so
I mean like I would be no more afraid
afraid of applying for a job here with
the Navy I close by me I would so I mean
I would agree that for the most part for
me it's kind of like an exam almost I
mean when when you were in college when
did you feel ready for an exam and I
mean there's always something more you
can study there's always something more
you've read about but at some point you
know say alright I'm confident is what I
know and go in there and get
hey Rachel just to sort of chime back to
when we lost you the first time I pick
on you um is there anything that you
sort of look for in an interview when
you're doing interview or technical
interviews someone is there stuff that
sort of jumps off the page and sort of
like this is what I really was looking
for today but you know you've got a
great candidate in the room with you um
it's a hard question it's a hard
question
so one of the things I definitely look
for so I guess I tend to take a lot in
addition to looking for technical skills
I'm also looking at how they handle the
situation because it does there are
situations that we have at work where
you know you're working on a problem
with other people so I'm looking one of
the things that I look for is how
relaxed are they are they going in there
you know are they freaking out the
entire time or is you know it's just you
know coding up something answering
technical question is that something
that is you know commonplace for them so
they are okay with it um when I'm doing
the technical what another thing I'm
looking for is the way they're thinking
about things so even if they have
something if I'm going off topic but
even if they even if they have no idea
what the answer to the problem is I want
to know where their thinking is going I
want to know what thought processes
they're having so I'm looking for
somebody who's going to tell me that as
well and I can get into that more we
talk about details of that but they say
I'm looking for someone for the way
someone thinks and I'm looking for
someone who's not going to stress me out
with their stress yeah I also just to
sort of pile onto that common type you
know one thing that I hear a lot from
candidates and from people doing
interviews they really you know the
interview is sort of you know simulating
the work environment right and so when
you ask you know the question is
something to the effect of you know do
that faster do that better and and you
know the candidates like no no you could
do that faster
you know other person chatting with and
I'm going to totally expose myself as
not being my technical but you know says
all you can do that yeah oh log or
whatever you know so whatever the
complexity thing is you guys both laugh
at me now um you know that kind of back
and forth communication is really key to
the interview it really is a big part of
a good interview because it will just
not in agreement yes I can verbalize I
guess I would agree yeah I mean I also
mean part of what I was talking about my
responses they want to talk don't don't
just be silent and that part of that is
because we can see what you're feeling
and if you make a small mistake but you
had the process right about how you got
there I mean that is in my opinion
pretty much almost as good now other
opinions vary I mean that's why we have
so we have a panel of energy is that
wide range of things about that you and
you take note of things like that but
from my perspective I really care more
to see if the approach it needs to like
approach rather than whether they
remember to add a semicolon there at the
end of that line or something yeah just
to put in there the approach and the way
some a is doing it is even more
important on a phone interview than it
is on in many ways than in person just
because that's the only thing you have
to go on there if you if somebody goes
silent on a phone interview for five
minutes thinking that that tells me
nothing
but I can't get anything from that as an
as an interviewer right absolutely um
cool so we've got a few have a bunch of
questions coming through the moderator I
just want to we're about the halfway
point and would just like to remind
anybody out there that's chiming in late
that you are joining the Google hangout
on the air about acing the technical
interview and we're about halfway
through I'm going to try and do a bunch
of more questions the what actually it's
funny you mentioned the phone back to
have a question for Marian in France so
we're getting all international here you
know can some technical interviews
happen over the phone if so how would
that go
have you guys done a lot of phone
interviews how do they go I mean I know
my opinion of the phone but you know up
well I probably do more phone interviews
than I do actual interviews um I have
almost a phone interview a week actually
nice now I'm doing that do you want more
do I want more up to you I'm doing okay
I'm doing okay thank you
so the serious bone inner dancer that
Mary's question for interviews
definitely happened and I personally
prefer the the in-person ones but with
the phone interview it's very similar
it's you're going to be asked technical
questions you're going to end you
actually very similar to when you are in
person and have to might have to write
something on a whiteboard we use a
Google Doc in order to simulate a
whiteboard and so candidates will be
asked to type something in and that's
how we see it yeah it's a standard
classroom at this point um I just got a
couple of tips with respect to the phone
interview or versus creative person as
to a subtle difference between the way
to think work we Rachel mentioned that
don't go silent that it's tough to tell
whether you disconnected a book or
whether you just don't you know what's
going on but I think that that the home
screen is typically the first interview
you're going to wind up getting with
Google unless you're doing it on campus
interviews and I think that they require
a little bit of support from the
candidate on the other side of the phone
as well I think that then on our side we
try to be more engaging so we can know
keep contact and make sure people are I
feel like having embers of suffocation
of this from the candidate that it is
you know a little bit more verbose and
it would normally be that they make sure
to speak more clearly as opposed to kind
of mumbling who sell that sort of thing
we might do it on the blackboard only
because the audio quality of the phone
generally isn't as good a lot of people
will put on speakerphone on a cell phone
compounds problem so yeah just jump into
the same interview basically ask the
same questions
I mean aside from the nicknames applause
now I think a lot of candidates and a
lot of people's are listening to this
this conversation or probably never had
to use a you know Google Doc for a phone
interview and I know it's I mean it's we
do tons of them right is there are there
any tips on that that little tiny piece
because I know that you know having
those kinds of things go off the rails
and may be really stressful and is there
anything you guys can think of for that
guy or that gal who's got a phone
interview next week so what I would love
to jump in here is so happy run through
your whole set up with a friend have
your friends jump on the interview jump
on the phone in another room even and be
on the Google Doc and ask you some
questions and let you know is your
connection clear can they understand the
things you were saying can they see what
your type you know at a reasonable rate
of age their internet connection is now
up to par run through the entire
scenario have you have your friend ask
you a question or two and so that you
can see like oh wow you were silent for
five minutes there your friend can tell
you that and you may not even notice
because you know if you were standing
there at a whiteboard you would just be
thinking it would be clear to your
interviewer that you were thinking right
but yeah it's very different so yeah
please run through it just just five
minutes is all it takes really Eddie I
think you just said everything you
needed to say that was awesome um too
funny
okay so we have another question from
Arthur up a water loop and it's actually
we've kicked around a little bit but I
think it's a good question is you know
he asks you know given limited prep time
what it makes sense to concentrate more
on programming in algorithm design
skills over CS theory and specific
language any put quote quote trivia and
now I'm going to say yes and like what
you guys expand on that pixel I think
I'll start with this one first I have no
interest in language trivia first I
really don't I'll be dead if I look at
it I
I know that there are tons of people who
know more about the languages I use
every day but I'm able to do my job in a
very effective attic I really do care
quite a bit more about your
understanding of algorithms and data
structures and ability to actualize
those in code then about whether you can
draw fine on atomic on the board and you
know I really don't need that person
like Rachel I would agree in general
most trivia about a language I mean if
you are at a real you know working in
the real world you can just look that up
on the Internet
so I mean google it sorry exactly this
is like and so I don't consider that a
very useful skill per se
I mean if needed I can him let me google
that for you but the algorithms or
something that is that you're going to
use every day during your job and so
that I totally focused more on
algorithms than I do about trivia I
didn't know if I've ever asked a trivia
question
yeah and I'm popular though never comes
to a point where oh man I need I wish I
knew what this library was oh I know
there's just one thing that I thought I
could use in this language my journal
responses just assume you have it and
describe to me how it works and then
they go ahead and keep going with
protein question I mean oftentimes
they'll be using some some language and
the second to have this particular
strength parsing function or some party
to have this this hash table
representation something that it's this
hash function thing I can use what they
find is to imagine it exists today right
cool okay so we've got about about seven
minutes left in our hangout in the air
time over in technical interview prep
we've actually still got tons of
questions coming in which is awesome I
like this one not because it's from New
Hampshire like I am but I'm going to be
totally shameless and say it's because
it's from New Hampshire and the
questions from section 311 where that is
welcome
and it's do do technical interviewers
often test candidates for specific
technical knowledge for general
technical problem solving skills or for
grace under pressure when tackling
problems and Isis ORS on all of these
Rachel you had a big smile and smirk but
just it's quite a comprehensive question
yeah totally absolutely I mean I think
it's a little bit of all of those as I
mentioned before I mean we're looking
for somebody comfortable answering
technical questions we're looking for
somebody who's you know got logical
thought process that or at least
creative thought processes that's going
to be able to answer you know questions
to some extent I forget what the other
ones you listed they were great summary
crushed sure sure yeah that's what that
better taste the relaxed part but you
know you're not on edge well I really
look at that part of it as my job so
when I'm meeting a candidate to like I'm
going to get you comfortable and get you
in a place where you're ready to roll
when Eddie and Rachel come in and start
talking about crazy algorithms right so
I'm going to ask you if you'd like a
drink if you need to take it you know
biology break whatever it is you need to
get relaxed get settled down and then be
ready to roll so I really look at part
of this as my job is to sort of set the
emotional state so then that you guys
can always have a really good technical
conversation yeah but I would get it I
mean I I feel like I try to target my
questions to things that pretty much any
edited should know III don't try to go
off on esoteric details so I see
something on their resume that sounds
interesting like my normal first
question and attempt to kind of calm
something that as well I'll look budge
man close can you describe your
technical contributions to this project
and then when they and then basically I
didn't you know it's interesting that
like things they talk about I'm looking
more that we could calm down can they
explain themselves clearly when they're
describing something that they they
should know because they work out and
then beyond that there's their standard
general questions I don't expect I try
not to cater them but I have this kind
of knack that someone says they're graph
here is oh I'll ask them a graphing
algorithm questions see if they really
meant it so they're not hard but I mean
you have to have it Rachel is actually
familiar with this one
during our training um but anyway is a
but in general I mean I I look to put
the exceptional candidates by what they
provide beyond question but the simple
the question itself is fairly simple but
there are subtleties in the designs
there are subtleties in the mist
structures and algorithms choices and
the strongest candidates I mean the rock
star is that you hear about or whatever
that they're the ones who will go beyond
what I asked and explain why they chose
this and there were these three other
competing alternatives but then you
would use case a for this type of data
type and case beep this type of data
type of case see if you were dealing
with a massively distributed system that
had scale it's something like that right
one caveat I would add to that is
there's a high likelihood that you will
be asked to code up something so if you
say that you code and see your C++ but
you actually only code in Java it's not
going to go well so just be honest no
it's funny we had a question from from
Elena there was what languages can I use
during an interview in na and we're
talking about earlier which is any
language you want just make sure that
it's the language you've said that you
can use um but we'll of you know I mean
I guess that's sort of what you're
saying Rachel this you know well I
basically we are we are signed
interviews we are assigned based on what
languages that we're familiar with so
for because I mean you know the way
memory is handle is going to be
different C versus Java and so if we're
asking a question that's relating to
that you may get to having somebody
who's an expert in C versus somebody's
an expert in Java and if you haven't
been you know fully honest about what
language you prefer to code in it's only
going to hurt you as an interviewee
rather than um you know affect us in any
way right
no absolutely we have a bunch more
questions coming through I'm going to
try and quickly knock off a couple
because there's sort of more HR
procedural I think so I'm going to knock
these ones off real quick and then just
just want to wrap up our time together
during this hangout on the air I thought
maybe we just get sort of if you guys
had one
magic tips so why don't you guys think
about that and I'll just knock off these
couple of quick and quick questions and
I'll sink right back to you so we've got
one question is how many rounds of
interviews can one expect you know I
think that it varies a little bit
generally speaking when you're
interviewing with a place like will you
meet with about five people it might all
be in one day it might be broken over
two days it really can vary a little bit
but typically speaking you'll talk to me
or four or five people through the
course of an interview and then the
other question we got from aw in the UK
again keeping ourselves international
after going to Hampshire well is how
technical is an initial phone interview
for a technical internship likely to be
and I actually got kind of a trick
question because your initial phone
interview is probably going to be with a
recruiter and it will probably not be
super technical be more about where do
you want to work what kinds of stuff do
you like to do sort of laying the
groundwork for that second phone
interview which will then be someone
like Rachel or Eddie that's going to
basically ask you the same question I
was in person so a very technical
question the first time you speak to an
engineer that you job with you guys has
experiences awesome all right so we've
got about a minute left here Eddie one
tip that you would give to people for
technical interviews besides we're a
Razorback Jersey sadly my one tip I
think is to nice I it's amazing we want
you to succeed and yo being polite and
friendly and sociable goes a long way
towards that and quite frankly culture
this is one of those things that we look
for and you don't like working with
turrets and arrogant people Rachel
that's a good one I figured um I think
my one tip I'm we already touched on I'm
speaking when you during phone
interviews that sort of thing but I just
I can't reinforce that enough how if
that's the best thing you can do is just
explain where you're going with a
problem and explain your thought process
and just keep the interviewer is there
to help you they want like any side we
want you to succeed and the only way we
can do that is if we know what you're
thinking
so just talk that's my dick yeah no
I I think that's great not you know I
really appreciate you guys being on here
today these are kind of fun they're
still pretty new I'm not used to being a
game show host over here but you know I
I want to just double down and stress
that communication point of emphasis and
that it's really key to everything that
we've talked about it can be as
technical as can be if you can't
articulate it through the Google Doc or
on the phone all of those things it's
just so critical to make sure you're
communicating good bad and ugly right
I'm stuck help I know this cold let me
show you communicate communicate
communicate so I you know and with that
we are at one minute late so I would
just like to thank you guys again for
coming on and doing this chat about
technical interviews you are hanging on
the air and next week we'll be doing
more so anybody listening that's
interested can come back next week and
catch a few more and I'll talk to you
guys later
