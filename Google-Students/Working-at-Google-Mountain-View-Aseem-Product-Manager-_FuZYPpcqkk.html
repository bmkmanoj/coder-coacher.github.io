worked for for a product that is used by
tens of millions of people the
opportunity you get to represent that
product internally and externally in the
company is just an amazing opportunity
so you get to do everything about our
product I go design it I design the next
version so currently I'm working on tool
bar that's my product and I get to pick
the features that going in and get to
present them to to our VPS to go up to
Larry and Sergey get their approval on
and sell them on the features and then
roll it out to all of our users and then
see the feedback and then do it all over
again I never thought that I would get
to do all of this so quickly out of
college just imagine that you're making
the decision all the decisions around a
huge product how should the features be
designed you think outside of Google
that you know somebody is spending a lot
of time thinking about this and somebody
who has a lot of experience but you come
in here and you find that it's you who
has to make the decision so you go out
and figure out well how you market the
product how do you design a feature how
do you work with engineers how do you
work with people who are you know
sometimes twice your age one of these at
a time is is challenging and you do put
all of them together and you suddenly
find that Wow
you know you're doing what somebody
would be doing ten years from now in any
other company
my name is a steam suit I'm an associate
product manager in Mountain View
