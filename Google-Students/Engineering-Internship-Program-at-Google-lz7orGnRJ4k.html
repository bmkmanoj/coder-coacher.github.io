accessibility team here at Google we do
work with both the Chrome OS and the
Android operating system accessibility
should really be a byproduct of good
design you don't want to think about low
vision and blind users is being
decoupled from fully sighted users and
Android the project she has been working
on is a music player that's optimized
for use when you're not looking at the
screen she's built a very full-featured
music player interface and it's all
drivable with a very very simple UI one
of the best things about internet Google
is that you get to learn by doing that's
the best way to learn you get really
used to in a classroom scenario writing
something that's very isolated and as
soon as you get into the world of mobile
programming it's impossible there are
these subtle nuances that you run into
when you're building an application
that's trying to share memory and share
the user experience with an entire
operating system on a phone what I found
in working here is that the thing that's
been a constant you know with all the
different projects you can work on in
computer science I think has been
constant for me is a love of learning
there's a lot of technical work at
Google both in the project area that you
would come to work at and in the
periphery so you're not going to just
learn one thing the spec talks there's a
huge amount of learning and available
every piece of code I write goes out
into the public domain
people can expand upon it people can use
it to it when developing their own
applications and especially when you're
developing applications for blind users
you want there to be as much content out
there as humanly possible so being able
to release that code is a privilege
almost every intern I had has actually
shipped code more than 60% of my team
with actually grown from interns I
always the biggest smile on my face when
I
coming to the cube and my boss is seeing
Izod it immediately jumps on video he's
completely adorable - did you shootin
boba I've had the opportunity to meet
the computer scientists who used to be
just the names on your textbook you know
these these people that you admire their
work and then all of a sudden they're
standing next to you in line at
long-life right and and that's
incredible and then you can just strike
up conversations and realize they're
incredibly down-to-earth people every
Google engineer impacts millions of
users and because interns work on real
projects here as opposed to some toy
being that's there to get thrown away
every intern here in those three months
ends up having an enormous impact on the
target user base it's that's very
satisfying and rewarding I know that an
internship is always supposed to be
about building skills but a lot of times
you find that when you go a place for
three months you leave and maybe
everything you've learned stays with the
company when you leave I don't think
that I can name a single skill that I've
built while working at Google as an
intern that I never used again it's
really rewarding to to be able to put
something in the hands of somebody who
you know is going to have an important
impact on their life and feeling that
excitement
