YouTube live session today I'm Noelle
I'm on our recruiting team for our
software engineering internship and
today I'm joined by two of our awesome
engineers who are here to run through
some interview tips and tricks and also
run through a few mock interview
questions with you guys during this
session so as a first step as you can
see on your screen now if you're able to
go to this link to mark your attendance
we'd love to know that you joined us
here today
and throughout this session myself and
my teammate Andy will be answering your
questions in the chat box so feel free
to use this to be as interactive as
possible we'll be answering as best as
we can and then any technical questions
we'll turn it over to the experts when
we get a chance in the program so that
is all I have for us today I'm excited
to turn it over to our engineers for
them to get started with you guys thank
you hello everybody my name is Seon very
excited to be here with you so I am a
software engineer here at Google I've
been here about a year I work on the
Android partner engineering team I love
it and I hope I can be useful today and
hi everyone my name is Edgar I'm a
software engineer here at Google I from
Mexico and I went to the University of
Tennessee for my graduate studies before
joining Google I was trying to be a
scientist and I currently work in search
infrastructure in index election for web
and images so the technical interview um
what can you expect most technical
interviews are consist of the first
couple of minutes which are short
introduction where the engineer asked
you a little bit about yourself but a
majority of the time is going to be
spent doing a technical assessment and
whatever language you prefer and the C
Java Python after which there's
hopefully a little bit of time at the
end that they'll leave so that you can
ask any other questions that you have
yeah and what the engineer is going to
be looking for when you are
your question is basically assessing
your technical skills figuring out how
well you code how well you know your
data structures your algorithms and the
most important thing that we're going to
be looking for is for assessing your
analytical skills and your
problem-solving skills those are
definitely the most important things we
try to hire generalists and as such we
don't care so much into the solution
itself we care about good design
principles we care about how you are
thinking through problems and Sione is
going to go into a little bit more
detail on that yeah so what is the
actual interview like well what we
really want to know is how do you think
that's the what the engineer is there to
assess like what are what problem do you
have the right problem-solving skills so
that means we want you to think out loud
just try to always be talking expressing
all the thoughts that are coming into
your mind during the interview and ask
as many questions as you can to make
sure you have a full understanding of
the question before diving in so I mean
uh sometimes the questions will be a
little bit in depth but that's really
just because we want to know how you
handle complicated problems so finding
the right solution is nice but it's
really not the point of it it's mostly
just to make sure that we can evaluate
how you think and how you solve problems
yeah and so I'm going to be sort of
walking you through the timeline of how
you should be approaching roughly a
coding question so the first thing that
an interviewer is going to do is going
to propose a question for you to solve
and the question can be very ambiguous
and your first job is to clarify
everything that that question is so you
need to make sure that you understand
what inputs you have make sure that you
have the right data structures that are
the right data types that you understand
what all of the requirements are and if
you have any assumptions stating up out
loud this sort of clarification part is
definitely the most important make sure
that you keep a good communication with
your interviewer throughout ask a lot of
questions and listen to the answers
sometimes there's hints hidden in the
answers that
interviewer is giving you after that
basically you can start sort of defining
what you're going to be doing what kind
of data structures you might be using
and what kind of approach and from there
you kind of go into the actual proposing
that solution you start saying okay so
the first thing that comes to mind is to
solve it using this or another type of
solution and it's okay to start with the
simplest solution and discuss it but
then again it's important to state
everything because your interviewer
might change the requirements of the
question are you as you are proposing
solutions to make it more interesting or
to explore a different area and so this
refinement process in which you're
proposing alternatives leads ultimately
to your interviewer and yourself sort of
agreeing that you both know what you're
going to be solving and then it goes
into the coding and we'll we're going to
see this in the mock so what we're going
to try to do next is demonstrate the
technical assessment of the interview
where Edgar will be playing the role of
my interviewer and I will be the
interviewee and we'll try to break it up
throughout the question for questa for
to clarify like what an ideal candidate
should be doing right so the question
that I want you to solve is given a
collection of numbers determine whether
there are two distinct elements in that
collection that have a sum equal to a
target value okay so I should make sure
I understand the question so is it okay
if I make some note just write down
inputs all right so for my understanding
I'm given some input can I make the
assumption that it's an integer array or
how am I being given these sure yeah for
now you can assume that it's that it's
an interior integer array okay okay so
I'm giving some into rank and if you say
that I have to some people to a target
value so probably also some
and okay and then you want me to return
some true if in my array I find some two
pair if I find pair which sums to end
that what we're looking for
yeah that sounds good for now we can
later figure out if we want to return
the actual pair or something yeah can I
make a pass a couple nights I'm sure why
you so will always be positive or not
necessarily yeah it can be arbitrary
okay so and can be any integer and then
am I always guaranteed to have a fixed
in like into a length of an array or do
I have to account for streaming I see
yeah that's that's an interesting
question
um let's get it so that you have a fixed
array okay so it's a fixed array
okay um all right I think I have an idea
of the questions but just to make sure
could I let me write a few examples so I
think the question already have fun so
if I was given input equals your
examples two four five five nine one I
should be outputting because n N equals
seven I should output true because two
and five sounds that's correct yes okay
all right I think I have a good idea I'm
ready to start discussing some
approaches okay so let's bring character
here so you can see that she did very
well in stating her assumptions in
particular sort of asking whether the
input was bounded completely here versus
whether it was streaming and so it's got
a very poor
plant at Google obviously we do things
at scale so very likely a follow-up
question could always be what happens if
the input is to talk about to be also
figuring out whether it was integers and
what the return type was I mean the
question was very purposefully
underspecified so whether we want the
pair whether we want a boolean or not
that's very important and sort of the
edge cases of what happens with
negatives and all of that is very good
yeah do you want to add anything to this
I think this is the way that I normally
go and try to break down a problem in a
technical interview even when I don't
know how to solve it at that point in
time it really helps me to start by
restating the question in a way that
could be written into a method so that
means I'm giving some input arguments
and I have two outputs something so at
the very least I know what should be
given so yeah and then staining some
assumptions because there's all they
could always be some tricks given so
before assuming anything I want to pass
that by the interviewer make sure they
know how I'm thinking of what other what
case I'm considering before even writing
out some approaches then we have a
question from the audience um Deborah
licious asks is better readable code
more important than performance oriented
code both are important yeah very
readable code it's definitely a big plus
in terms of optimality we don't care it
like about the absolute optimal question
but again discuss with your interviewer
but if you are having a solution and the
interviewer is asking you for a better
solution then it's probably going to be
a hint that there's something that you
could be doing better and if you do
believe that you have one of your
approaches that you're going to be
implementing is suboptimal you express
that to your interviewer and let them
know that hey I understand that the
runtime on this might not be the best
but I can't really figure out how to
improve it so is it okay just to
implement this so that we can assess my
coding abilities so um and by expressing
that you thought through that that helps
that interviewer know that these are
things you're considering before
implementing a solution absolutely so if
we're ready let's start discussing some
of the solutions
all right um I think I'm okay starting
to discuss and approaches now I'll just
job in gas so we can over them so um I'm
initially looking at this I think I
could solve it without really
considering anything else I could
probably loop through this array compare
every single element to every subsequent
and see if these come up to seven so
that would be you know 2 to 4 to 2 to 5
to 9 to 1 and then eventually go through
it and output true whenever I run into
something that equals and sounds good so
what would be the complexity of that
solution
um well since I'm doing the steps of
every subsequent array for every single
element in the array it would probably
be quadratic so I'm thinking oh Ben
squared I think that there could be a
better touch about I'll write that down
which one I is compare every alum to a
we subsequently won
and let me link before I start into
nothing that I kind of want to see if
there's something a little bit more
optimal mom turns at one time um so um
let me see
what I really want to know is if I have
a two in my array
I want to make see if I have if I'm
going to run into a fly and - I um so
how could I do that
by one or two passes to improve this
well I guess what I could do is save
each elements into another data
structure and check each one toward that
data structure to see if that would
improve the run time and - it wouldn't
it couldn't be an ArrayList because then
the run time wouldn't improve yeah so
what kind of things structurally do you
see um either a hashmap
hash set Y a hash map we need key value
so in hash set is probably a better
solution for this so maybe I could save
every element into the hash set and then
compare it on the second pass but then
that would give me false positives
because I I could I could be comparing
for one for when I nico state and that
wouldn't work so I what I guess what I
could do is save the elements as I'm
going through it and see if it already
has and - my current element inside
sounds good yeah what would be the
complexity of that solution well um I'm
only passing through it once so it'd
just be the size of the array so event
okay so that would be this is a square
in terms of time and this is and in my
second approach would be save LM
in hash sad if n - Elam is not already
in the set so yeah and that that has a
better time complexity than this once I
think I would probably go with this
approach over that one okay but let's
discuss um so in this one you write that
the running time is o n so let's this is
time complexity what about the space
complexity the memory okay so how much
space is it taking bad yeah well this
one I'm not really initializing anything
any additional data structure is okay um
so that's that that's just often okay
sure but I guess this one doesn't
perform as well alternative space
complexity is it would be O of n because
I have to yeah I have to save each
element could be a maximum of the full
length of the array that's right the
worst case is that every all yeah to the
other that's that's good so you can see
that there's kind of a trade-off between
running time and space and I wonder if
there's any other approach that could
improve on any of these constrains well
if I'm trying to improve time I probably
if I that's quadratic and that's linear
something in the middle would probably
be walk with Nik currents so if I'm just
going to UM most one that ethnic
solutions are some sort of surge by new
surge sounds good so okay yeah so so
we're just just to clarify so we're
saying that hopefully there is an N log
and solution
that has some sort of space complexity
okay
so if I'm trying to get that long and I
how do I turn this into like a binary
search problem well that would be if I
would be assuming that they're sorted
because I would either be searching the
left or right side so maybe if I sort
them and then I try to find and minus
current elements either on the left or
the right now that could work
okay yeah so if it's if it's sorted
sorting it's n log N and then you can do
it find it also in n log N and our worst
cool so we come actually what would be
the memory requirement though of sorting
sorting algorithm are we the most
efficient um well if you do quicksort my
short na so do you know the memory
requirement or quicksort mergesort so
because we want to be yeah we'll be
comparing either side of the array so
they're reversed recursive algorithms
and we'll recursion itself it's a stack
memory so yeah cool so now we have three
solution that kind of have explored the
trade-off between space and time but for
implementation I think we should stick
with this approach to that we have here
that that's what I would like to see
some code for and again we're going to
break character here and sort of point
out so very good very well organized
talking about the first approach the
second approach making sure that
everything is clearly spelled out the
interviewer has a perfectly clear idea
of what would be the solution if I were
to ask her to code this or this I have a
pretty good idea of what would be the
discussion of space and time obviously
she knows our algorithms obviously she
knows heard their structures and
you can see sort of the back and forth
that the solution itself wasn't I mean
the fact that she gave me a good
solution didn't mean that the
conversation ended right so we were
actually now discussing the trade-off of
one thing or another and data structures
and algorithms and all of that yeah um
so I I've started doing this in my
technical interviews and I was intern
interviewing for internship and it just
helped make sure that the interview the
interviewer the engineer always knew
what I was thinking so even before I
started coding I wasn't going to be
stuck halfway through the middle
changing my mind because we kind of come
to a consensus that this was the
implementation that was the most optimal
so yeah it even in most scenarios just
kind of riding out one or two approaches
discussing a little bit of the runtime
is just as important as actually coding
it out right and another point that I
want to make is that so
getting the perfect optimal solution
isn't required in fact there is a
sorting algorithm heapsort that actually
has all of one space complexity but the
fact that the candidate didn't know that
it's not a big problem
we are still sort of exploring all of
this and that's kind of a trivia
question in a sense knowing the right
kind of algorithm to do it so what I did
when I was preparing for my interviews
was made myself a cheat sheet right when
I was always spelling out all of the
sorting algorithms and all of the data
structures that I could fit in one page
and studying them before an interview
it's it's ok you don't need to know
everything perfectly it's absolutely
fine and so I think now we're going to
go into the into the coding but oh we
know we have questions we have a few
questions from the audience so when
you're first asked the question would
you suggest that the candidate restates
the question before solving it every
time it's not necessarily restate but
probably for the purpose of
clarification you want to it helps to
kind of break it down into making sure
you understand what exactly is expected
like what what is the problem rather
because sometimes it comes in a
paragraph format similar to this one and
so by just clarifying ok well the
general idea
what I'm supposed to be doing is given
these things I need to produce this
result Franco okay Thank You Erica for
asking that then we have one from M say
how important is perfect syntax while
coding the solution I would like to say
absolutely not important at all just
make sure that you don't have ten
mistakes right so missing a semicolon
not remembering exactly the name of a
function not closing a parenthesis these
things don't really matter it's again
it's the approach of problem solving
that that's most important yeah and I've
run into situations where the engineer
might not necessarily be the most fluent
in that language so I've primarily did
most of mine in Java but they might have
done only C so they're not themselves
very picky about oh you have to make
sure all your brackets are open and
closed so it's more of a general idea
you kind of know how to implement it
rather than making sure your stomach
colons and your eyes are dotted and
everything great and then we've got one
from Kevin so if you are working through
your thoughts and you notice that you
actually made a mistake and went back
and fixed it would that count against
you in the interview that would come
that would count for you if you catch a
mistake and you go back and fix it
that's fantastic that's great because
that means that you will be doing those
things when you are in the job you're
going to be looking at yourself
second-guessing whether you're right or
not it the worst thing that could happen
is a person who believes they're right
and they're not right so actually going
back and checking your work and
backtracking it's very important in fact
I did that in one of my interviews I was
halfway through it and the interviewer
sort of what's known telling me much and
I said you know what could I just
restart this I don't think I have the
right solution and the interviewers are
like yeah yeah it's not very elegant is
it
yeah and I mean it work right I was
hired time here and so it I think it
actually counted for me and that's kind
of the one of the points of expressing
your thought process is that they get to
see you evaluating your own solution and
catching your mistakes and what we're
going to demonstrate during the
implementation stage is testing it out
and talking it through before you know I
go until the
I'm done this is it this is going to
work great it's more I'm going to try to
be critical of Milan solution make sure
it you know I catch as many edge case as
possible before turning it over or their
eyes great and then just one more before
we get back into the next section from
Annabella do you suggest you the
candidate gives more than one approach
if you only have one approach or does
that count against you in any way I
don't think you need to have sometimes
there has been situations where I've
only ever had one and I will tell the
interviewer of the engineer okay look
this is this is kind of what I'm
thinking right now
and I don't really see another more
optimal way to do it and discussing the
trade-offs for this and if they're like
okay this is you know this kind of works
fine for me you can proceed that's why
communication is so key because you want
to make a clear engineer I bought them
everything and this is the approach that
I think that I want to continue
implementing great okay okay perfect
all right I'm gonna work on a position
now so I think what I'm going to do is
write a method that does all of this
just name it
alright so this question is really just
a method that returns a boolean if I
understand correctly and it should all
just meaning um some in hair or hair
with fun
and if you discussed it takes it into
rent and it takes them another into ten
and I'll be returning a boolean if I
ever wanted to appear inside of myarray
desktops to end so okay and well which
I'm going to be going with is I'm going
to save this each element as I'm moving
through it into my hash tag and then
return true if I do run into an element
already in there that's n minus the car
now so it's great that down I guess I
will just start off by initializing the
hash tag so I'll just I'll just call it
up integers
good idea and then I'm going to I know I
have to move through every element in
here so I'll just I'll have some for
loop that kind of gives me a reference
to the current element I'll just leave
that curve in array and then what I want
to do is if if you mums my hash that
already contains and then minus her I
mean by having in my eyeball run into
this a pair I'm going to just return
true else I'm going to save my current
element into my current element into my
hash tag so let me kind of make sure I
have this right oh I guess I after I
finish I'll have to return false because
that means I've ran through all my
elements and I didn't run into any pairs
so let me walk through let me make sure
this is going to work for our example so
I think we had an input of 2 4 5 91 so
by going here I'm moving through my
array here I have nothing in my hash set
yet I check that my hash second page 2 I
mean it contains I think I see the
contains 5 it does not so I put 2 inside
of there
and then I do this all the way until I
get to five I see if my hashtag contains
7 minus 5 which is 2 it does so I would
turn true and then I'm done
because um can I assume that I can
return at the first one or do you want
to adieu I just need to look for one
page about spring okay so I'll just Matt
get this works and then this should also
work for MZ arrays because it will
return false and it should work for all
integers sounds good what other test
cases would you use I yeah I definitely
would test with empty array um I would
test with 0 n equals 0
um just to make sure it works there and
then I would um duplicates I would make
sure if I have multiple of these numbers
so if I had four and for N equals eight
that it works done yeah I think those
are the test case that comes to mind
initially okay and finally we're
breaking character again so again you
can see she was explaining what she was
coding she was telling me every single
thing that she was doing and she didn't
need to finish up every single thing
like saying integer again I mean we know
the syntax it can be verbose it's okay
to sort of say okay that's that's that's
understood what's going to be there
right the fact that she started with if
and then put that it's one very
important part because if you flip this
if then you get a bug in which you can
be putting something in and then
checking if you have it that for
instance in the other case the eight
would have caught that bug with N equals
eight before if you put it first and
then you check then that could give you
a false positive very well-structured
very tight code again if usually the the
problems that we're going to be asking
if you need more than
a few lines of code more than like 20
maybe think about whether there's a
better way of approaching the solution
we don't try to ask questions that
require a huge amount of code so that's
that that's very good yeah I think I
think this is obviously very very good
question sense and yeah so I am at least
for me I do like to talk while I'm
solving out because um you know keeping
that communication with your engineer is
really key and you know when you do go
off track then they can catch it very
early before you're you know 15 lines in
15 lines deep into your solution you
can't turn back so yeah and then at the
end it really helps
that's why initially you want to have a
couple examples of making sure that I
know what how should be behaving I know
that when I'm given this sort of integer
that it should return true or ball true
or false and so um yeah like after
you're done make sure to just go back
and walk through it a couple times like
I know that at this point this is what
my hash step looks like I know that
halfway through this is when it was
returned
so yeah just walking through it make
sure you catch your edge cases before
the engineer does it's not the three of
the most crucial thing but it really
helps us know that you you care about
catching all everything that could go
wrong with your solution okay weakly
right yes so we're going to break for a
few questions
so from Lin is that okay T's built-in
library functions in the solution
absolutely yes yeah I think it's okay
but it's depending on the interviewer
and the role you're interviewing for um
maybe if you're going to be for a much
lower level role they might ask you okay
pretend you didn't have this library how
would you do it or can you describe a
little bit of how it's actually
implemented a little bit under the hood
but that's more of if you're not doing
for a general rule so for general roles
if you know your language and you know
that there's a function that does this
you can say hey can I use this function
and they'll let you know what
how if they're okay with it yes to
comments on that on that part if you use
something make sure that you understand
how it works or at least its complexity
or something and in rough in rough sense
and the reusing of other components it's
very important it's over engineering
right Europe you're going to be part of
a team you're going to be working with
other people you can't reinvent the
wheel every time so it's very very
important to reuse pieces yes great okay
and then from NSA should our solution
always account for a null value I mean
hello very wrong with no so it's good to
just in the very beginning when you're
doing those clear clarifying questions
that probably a really good ones have
asked was can I assume then I'm always
given an array and not a null value so
that's actually a really good clarifying
question or a test case to account for
um so and by just saying that your
interviewer will let you know okay you
know don't worry about that or yes
that's actually a really good point
thanks for pointing that out yeah many
many times you asking the question from
the interviewer to say yeah don't worry
about it
but the fact that you asked it only took
you like five seconds but it was it was
good enough to give a signal to the
interviewer yes great pain then from
Carlos and Annabella would it be wise to
propose a design of your code or foil
your program before starting to write
the actual code in front of the engineer
yeah I think I think that works I've
done that a few times when I haven't
been completely set on an implementation
where I've just walked through okay loop
through all of this and just in words so
that all they have left evaluating on is
your coding abilities so um it might
just depend on how much time you have or
how unclear you still are whether your
implementation but that that works too
great
and then from Davin ah if you do a phone
and Google Docs interview would you
suggest emphasizing normal programming
and not giving too much time to coding
by hand mmm coding on a on a Google Doc
it's almost like coding by hand
in a whiteboard you don't get or any of
the nice other completions or anything
like that and again we're not asking too
bright very sophisticated code with
special libraries or special things so
it's probably a good idea to still
practice doing that again we're going
for the problem solving skills rather
than for the purity of the code and it
um and that being said from Renee is
this on par with the difficulty of
questions in these types of interviews
or does it just vary based on the
interviewer that's a really good
question um I have gotten this problem a
few times actually more than once from
different companies and I depending on
how long your interview is um usually
within a one hour time period you can
get something like this as like a
warm-up question followed by a
subsequent question if there's time so I
I would say that this is comparable to
of the level of difficulty that you can
expect about a warm-up question or um
and if there's time depending on like
how long it takes to solve they might
want to ask a follow-up question yeah
and also you can make the discussion
very open-ended by for instance here we
were discussing algorithms and
trade-offs between memory and running
time and we didn't even touch the
possibility of having a stream instead
of an array what happens if you have a
trillion elements that you need to be
checking for what happens if they don't
fit in a you know hash said things like
I mean a question that is deceptively
simple can still be extended with
follow-up questions into something that
there's basically no right answer right
so you could you could definitely do
that so I personally like starting with
very simple questions that build up into
a research problem but some people do
this this other part of having a simple
warm up and then a more meteor part
second part question and it varies by
interviewer great and then one more
before we move on this one's from Chen
Adam how do you approach getting stuck
on a question and not having a
breakthrough moment or alternative
solutions so getting stumped that does
happen um so I
I think this is why communicating with
your in like that the engineer the
interviewer really helps because it's
supposed to flow like a conversation so
if you're stuck you want to be
expressing exactly what's going through
your mind like why are you stuck you
can't figure out how to make it more
efficient you can't really understand
how what is supposed to output so
there's a reason that you're not able to
move on and when the engineer knows
exactly at what point you're kind of
hitting a wall
they're there to also give you a little
bit of hint to move you along so that
they can better it much better evaluate
you what she said great okay
so we'll pause there and ask a few more
at the end so we're going to show you a
second practice problem and we're going
to discuss it we're not going to go
through the whole interview but we'll
we'll show you this and so basically the
idea is that you could be asked this one
right so implement a set like data
structure with three methods insert an
element remove an element by value and
return an element chosen uniformly at
random right and again this this
question has multiple solutions some of
which are simple and some of which are
more complicated right so you want to
sort of start yeah so um similarly to
how we approach the first question in
the mock interview I would probably
start off by doing a couple of
clarifying questions like all right so
you just want me to create a data
structure and I need to support you know
probably insert remove and return or
maybe that's probably kind of like a get
um and then um you know kind of it kind
of it has the it seems like the trick is
that it's at random so maybe if I was
like dropping things into a bag
I would have to perform some sort of way
like that yeah this data structure
basically behaves like a bag which you
drop marbles and you can sort of pull
them out so so that kind of insight is
important right and and so the
underlying data structure let's discuss
a couple of alternatives of which
underlying data structure we could use
okay so it seems like instead of these
marbles of what we're actually inserting
is integers so in the example it looks
like one three seven two and nine and we
just want to have the art get a function
of this structure kind of just pick one
at random so I probably have to store
these things somewhere so I'm thinking
my data structure along with having the
three methods would probably need to
store these values somewhere so I mean I
could do I could do a list I could do a
set and both of the solutions have some
like a hash set versus an ArrayList have
like a constant complexity for two of
those of the methods and linear time for
the third one
so if you have removed with an ArrayList
implemented in a trivial way then it's a
linear solution if you have a get random
from a hash set then it's also again
linear because you need to iterate but
there's there's better solutions perhaps
um well so the trick seems to be that
might get which needs to return
something at random the way I have to do
that is I probably just want to choose a
random index um so um a list might be
better than a set because then I can
kind of choose random index in my my
data structure um so I think what I
probably do is I inside of my data
structure I would initialize some
ArrayList
on my insert would be adding to the end
of the ArrayList my remove would be um
removing an element in the array list
and then my get would be getting a
random integer from the length of the
array and then removing that that's
right yeah
so the optimal solution in terms of
running time for the three is a
combination of the hash set with the
ArrayList and
you don't actually have to do that in an
interview again discussing the
trade-offs and everything is part of the
part of the solution basically the idea
is having a hash map of the values where
their index is within an ArrayList so
that the remove can be by index very
easily and you still have all of the
benefits of having the array list for
the get random and for the insertion in
the very first time
but anyway again it can be extended
there's also a logarithmic solution for
the three for the three for three
operations that can actually support
even a fourth operation for a follow-up
but again so this discussion this kind
of approach of going through things is
the right way yeah let's see how are we
doing for time yeah another question we
have questions perfect so how many
questions would typically be asked in a
single phone screen and what an
interviewer ah creepy concerned that the
candidate is not coding quickly enough
so I would I think it varies um because
it's definitely candidate to candidate
and however the engineer likes to prep
for it so we do like to prepare you know
as perp dependent engineers like to
prepare quite a few questions just in
case we have a candidate that goes
through all of them very fast but
sometimes one question can take up the
whole interview just from you know
discussing a lot of trade-offs or if you
know it the candidate took a little bit
more time writing their implementation
out but it's definitely not the deciding
factor or whether or not you'll move
forward it's just going to be like it
just took more time so it's a you can
expect that the engineer will happen to
like questions prep for you all the way
till the end of time but it's okay to
just take a little bit longer not go
through all of them yeah 1 1 &amp;amp; 2
interview questions is typical I would
say especially for a phones
or an on-site and they yeah that's
that's kind of what we were discussing a
warm-up on a more sophisticated question
later or just one that gets keeps
getting extended that's typical in terms
of the speed I would say don't worry too
much about it if you are expressing
yourself very clearly and you're
expressing what what your thought
process is of course there is a limited
amount of time the only problem with
having a slow coding candidate is that
we get less time to evaluate what the
skills are and I would say that's it our
goal is to figure out how you're
thinking how you're approaching and so
there's no there's not really like a
time limit on that it's more of if we
can't really get that much out of a
candidate then we don't know how well
they perform in turf area settings yes I
stole from Rachel but most interviewers
hint at the optimal solution or data
structure or just not a candidate to run
with their instinct I don't think they
would sabotage you I would say that it
varies from from from interviewer -
interviewer definitely but but most
interviewers want to give you hints
because they're very excited about the
question they ask the question because
they like it right so and if you're
almost there they would give you like a
hint of saying oh but but what what if
things were sorted or something I mean
they just just sort of to get to get the
ball rolling again that doesn't mean
that you need to have the best solution
but but be very very careful listen very
carefully to what the interviewer is
saying because sometimes there's hints
where you don't expect them I remember
one person was asking me so how do you
feel about destructors and I'm like well
they're nice and then like after the
interviews like oh of course that's what
they meant argh
it's okay great and then from Raghavan
what do you expect in a dynamic
programming question for the candidate
to solve it or go through it goodness I
would say dynamic programming is not a
solution that you are expected to come
up with on the spot if you can well all
the better for you that's that's great
but I would
yeah I don't think we ask questions with
a specific solution in mind mm-hmm
because it's an an ideal question that
an engineer gives is multiple ways of
solving it and it shouldn't have a
gotcha factor where you run into it I
want like point in your life and you
know that there's a really trick
solution to it that's not a very good
question and so if that is a question
you've gotten it's not a very well
thought than one a question should be
able to like you know you should be able
to talk through it and come up with some
some way of solving it so if I if you I
put like a lot of Engineers prefer not
to give those if they's do seem like oh
it's gotcha like I know the exact
algorithm that you have to do to solve
this okay then we have a last question
from truth before we move on anything
you recommend the candidates do not do
so count in the States
things to avoid don't be absolutely
silent that's a definite no-no we cannot
evaluate if you're completely stuck or
if you're thinking about the absolute
best solution that there's just nothing
we can we can it process and down from
decades don't be rude to your to your
interviewer okay definitely don't do
that yeah um I think for me uh I run
into a lot of candidates just starting a
solution being don't preemptively just
start coding because it's you'll catch a
lot of these things that could go wrong
if you had just asked a few more
questions in the beginning and really
stressed like you I I could tell that
sometimes they might have not really
fully understood the question or if they
just ask one more one or two more
questions to make sure that they knew
what they were doing maybe discuss their
approach in a little bit more detail
before coding that they could have
avoided you know starting a solution and
going to the end and using up a lot of
time don't assume a magical function
that solves the problem automatically
right so if you're going to say oh
they're very celebrity that does this
make sure that you understand what's
going on there
usually assuming that something magical
to solve the things for you will not
help you much yeah well we can go for
Christmas
yes Oh Malik you asshole no more
questions that's good
how much expertise do I need and
algorithms um I would say I don't know
how to quantify it other than about like
signals of data structures algorithms
course so you know you'd want to know
your search algorithms treat reversals
things like that but about about like
the if you do enough of these practice
problems I think you'll get an idea of
the areas that maybe you need a little
bit more practice in um but yeah I think
if I had to point fighter to view about
the same as like a data structures
algorithms course yeah I mean it depends
on obviously your your seniority right
if you're going for an internship
you're not going to expect you to be
like a algorithms and data structures
expert that's okay
and even if you are like seasoned Co
there may be data structures it's not
your your thing so as long as you know
sort of arraylists vectors hash maps and
sorting algorithms do something like
divide and conquer and a little bit like
binary search tree traversal basic trees
beyond that not very
yeah the fundamentals because most of
that the more complex things can be
derived from the fundamentals
yeah yeah definitely hashmaps is
something that you should know but if
you start getting into more
sophisticated data structures does
that's probably not perfect all right so
we're going to be talking a little bit
about resume tips so before you get the
technical interview you have to you know
get the actual interview so what should
you have on your resume so this is a
pretty good guide for um what probably
stands like should stand out the most on
your resume and I like to think of your
resume as sort of conveying the
these four kind of information very
clearly so it can be as fancy as you
want but just make sure that at the end
of the day it's conveying the
fundamental information that they need
so that could be like your school major
GPA expected graduation date if you you
know had internships before or you've
worked on research projects that's also
really good right if you have also
technical projects on your hobbies like
you have open source contributions you
have been in hackathons or or things
like that that's also very important it
shows initiative it it gives us some
flavor of what kind of code you write as
well in a more sort of realistic
environment than in a an online coding
session with a with an interviewer
definitely if you have activities that
you want to highlight the involvement in
clubs or associations if they're
technical if they're relevant that's
great
try not to pad too much the the the
resume less is more
definitely try to keep it very clean
with a lot of white space bullet points
with phrase fragments rather than actual
walls of text we receive like millions
of literally millions of resumes per
year and we have people looking at all
of them and so they don't have a lot of
time to do it so a good practice way of
doing this is if you give it to a friend
and take it away one minute after ask
them what they got out of it right so
real state in the page keep it to one
page but if it needs to be very clean
and if you are going to be putting
something important put it on the left
of the page dates and things like that
you can just leave on the right where
they're not obstructing anything else so
name of the University degree that
you're pursuing important projects with
two bullet points that's kind of the
thing that we're talking about yeah and
yeah just last thing about the resume if
you do if you don't have the work
experience it may be this is the first
internship you have a open source and
you know personal projects maybe if you
were setting up your own small website
portfolio
the site though and hackathon projects
that also works comparable well yeah and
one thing that I forgot to mention is
that it's okay to say which skills we
have right so like C++ and Java and sort
of some sort of other part like
development of drivers or something
anything anything that can be sort of
bullet pointed like that is good
don't put ten thousand languages if you
say oh well I know Java C++ CSS HTML SQL
yeah that's the thing everything that
you put in your resume it's fair game
for someone to be asking you in an
interview right so don't say that you're
an expert in C++ because then you can
get an expert in C++ asking you
questions so yeah that I think basically
the most important part just be factual
don't boast just just state the things
that there are no questions
we just have one question um for someone
who's a junior in college is it okay for
them to have a resume the longer than
one page or would you suggest it to bid
at that one um that was me I was a
junior in college and I had a resume
that was a page and a half
and um the comment the feedback I got
from every single recruiter at career
fairs was I really liked your resume but
you have to cut it down to a page and so
I I think one of the really good way to
get feedback on that is when you do go
to career fairs ask the recruiters you
know if you'll you'll get a general
consensus of what they like by just
asking them do you have any to end up
speaking to them you have any more
feedback for me like what how could I
improve this and they'll more than
likely like you can you don't usually
have enough experience by your third
year in college that can't be cut out
and fit into a page yeah I feel you it's
very very difficult to cut those things
that you're so attached to out of your
your resume but think about it this way
you don't want to dilute your skills you
don't want to dilute your your
achievements if you put everything that
you have done then it's very difficult
for a person casually looking at the
resume to know which ones are the most
important
which ones aren't right so if you have a
PhD or three or four years experience in
industry two pages might be okay if you
don't then stick to one page at all
costs and even if you have two pages
make sure that whatever you put in the
second page could be skipped yeah so the
first page should be standing on its own
basically and then from critical asks I
used a language in one school project
should I listed on my resume I know the
basics but not anything advanced um so
the question is should they include a
language that they've only mildly had
experience with one way that I've seen
students kind of present that on their
resume is by saying I'm fluent
I hate proficient or I kind of have a
little bit of experience and so that
they know that if they're getting an
interviewer that they can only they
don't they wouldn't know all the nuances
of that language yeah my suggestion
would be don't put it in the skills but
put it in a bullet point of the projects
that you worked on right all right make
sure to mark your attendance um thank
you so much for you know making it
through with us we had a really great
time and hope we helped ya thank you
very much and join us tomorrow at 5:00
for another session goodbye everyone I
hope you found this it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
