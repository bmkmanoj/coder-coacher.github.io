about Google's computer science Summer
Institute also known as CSS I my name is
Chelsea and I am this year's program
manager for CSSI 2013 and I am based in
Google's Boston office but this week I
happen to be enjoying the sunshine here
in our Mountain View California
headquarters and I am joined by some
lovely folks today and we're going to
spend the next 15 minutes or so
discussing what CSSI is all about what
you know students who've been in the
program before have done what
prospective students are interested in
and hopefully answer people's questions
all about CSSI and with that said we're
gonna start off with some introductions
so Matthew do you want to introduce
yourself sure hi I'm Matthew I am a
engineer here in the Google Mountain
View headquarters I work on the user
experience team for Google+ and I've
been an instructor for CSSI for three
years running so I've been at Google for
about four years altogether and I'm
really excited about the coming program
this summer Alice how about you hi my
name is Alice I am a freshman studying
computer science i UC Berkeley and I
attended the second session of CSS I in
Cambridge this past summer thanks and
ratio hello my name is Fernandez I'm
currently a senior at Cypress woods high
school at Houston Texas very interested
in studying computer science in which I
believe branches down basically
everything today society I feel that CSS
is what I need to learn of the
connections of applicable computer
science and ever-evolving world
hi I'm Isabel I'm a senior at pomfrit
school in Connecticut and I'm interested
in computer science because I'm actually
interested in neuroscience and there's a
lot of computer technology involved in
that well and Quinn hi my name is Quinn
I'm a senior at collegiate school in New
York City
and I'm in this hangout today because I
I had my first experience with computer
science from actually from my uncle he
actually designs apps and creates like
little video games every now and then so
ever since I've seen him doing his thing
on computers I've been interested in
computer science as well awesome thanks
guys
and I know that there might be some new
people who've just dialed in to this
hangout so I just wanted to send a quick
reminder out there that you are dialed
into the hangout on air all about
computer science Summer Institute at
Google for 2013 and we just did some
introductions and now we're gonna move
into the question and answer portion of
today's hangout so some of our
perspectives CSSI ours have have
prepared some questions that they have
in mind and we're gonna go through the
questions and either myself or Matthew
or Alice will try to answer them as best
we can so why don't we start then why do
we start with you I think you have a
question prepared okay so a question
actually from Matthew and I have some
exposure to computer science but not
much so I was wondering how the CSSI
curriculum works and like where you
start and what are the angles after the
three weeks really good question Quinn
so computers the CSSI program is really
designed for people of all skill levels
we have people come in with almost no
experience at all and we have some
people come in who have taken a class or
two and who already know a little bit
about programming and building building
websites building apps that sort of
thing though in CSSI we really try to
make it as practical as possible and
take you from as little experience as
you has you might have to building a
fully featured web application by the
end of the year three weeks
that means we teach you all the core
technologies that power the web it's
HTML CSS JavaScript we also teach you
some Python we teach you App Engine so
you can get a web application online
pretty easily and we we teach you all of
that basically from the ground up so if
you need any help if you're not as
familiar with
computer science and some of the other
students might be then we have a lot of
support there for you a lot of Google
engineers mentors are on hand and you
can also rely on the other students in
the program the goals by the end of the
by the end of the three weeks are
they're really sort of three goals that
we have in mind one is to give you the
opportunity to build a final project
which is a fully featured web
application that you build in a group
that you actually get online and it's a
great portfolio piece to have so you
have something real that you can show
people when you go and start your
college career the the second goal that
we have in mind is to really give you a
grounding in the fundamentals of
computer science so by the time you're
done with the program you should have
everything you need to know to get a
really good start when you take a
computer science class your freshman
year or you take other classes at school
that are related to computer science and
the third goal that we have in mind is
is to really build a sense of community
you know when when you're going off to a
new phase in life when you're starting
at university it's really helpful to
have a group of students that are going
through similar things that you can rely
on for shared experiences and continue
to share with as you as you get started
so that's that's really what we have in
mind with the CSSI program that's great
so how about Isabel did you have a
question yeah I had a question for Alice
I'm not sure computer science is right
for me so I was wondering if before
attending CSSI were you confident that
you would major in computer science or
did you have doubts no I had no idea
what I wanted to major in even the
minutes before CSS I began and also I
was interested in learning about
computer science I had a lot of doubts
about majoring in the field just because
I didn't know anything about it
I had never programmed before CSS I not
even hello world and I didn't affiliate
with my own perception of a computer
scientist which was this expert hacker
who looked at matrices and play video
games all day by the way that's not
really
what most computer scientists are like
in real life but I didn't know that and
so one of the reasons why I apply for
CSSI was to see what computer science
was really like and whether it's right
for me and I'm still thankful that I had
the opportunity to attend CSSI because
not only did the program teach me what
computer science really is it convinced
me to pursue it at my major like the
minute the program ended I just knew I
wanted to do CS for the rest of my life
and it's just an amazing feeling to have
when even know what you want to do and
you have a direction in life so don't
worry if you aren't sure if CS is right
for you right now because you will find
out how much you loves yes after
attending CSS I like it's a life
changing program and even if you have
the slightest interest in computer
science you should definitely apply ok I
think you wanna I just want to add one
other thing to that which is that
another thing that we do in the program
one of the unique parts of it is that in
addition to learning so many different
facets of computer science they're also
opportunities to meet all sorts of
people who work within the field of
Technology whether they're software
engineers themselves product managers
you know they might be patent lawyers
you can get a sense of all the different
variety that that falls under the
umbrella term of computer science and
really see where you could potentially
see yourself fitting someday great ok
ratio yeah Atlas so what was your
greatest memory or great accomplishments
while attending CSSI my greatest
accomplishment is just going from having
no experience in computer science to
building a web application like that's
just amazing and the project that I
worked on
so when we're brainstorming for a
project we went on Google just do like
check other other projects and we it was
during the Olympics and we saw that
there was a Google Doodle honoring the
Olympics and we wouldn't it be cool if
the Google Doodle was a game that was a
game that we could play and so that's
where our product idea for our project
came from and so we just still in in one
week we built a Google doodle that
allowed user to play and our shrieking
and the cool thing was that afterward
after we came up with the idea the
Google doodle itself became filled with
games that you could play so it was
really cool thank you yeah I remember
that it was a great great funded project
Thank You Alice I'm just curious were
there any another component of the
program in addition to the technical
component there are like Matthew
mentioned it's also about building a
peer Network building a community of
peers who have shared interests with you
and that you can you know share ideas
with lean on those types of things
after the program and so I was just
wondering you know can you talk maybe a
little bit about maybe some of the
friendships that you've made or some of
the fond memories that you have from
CSSI outside of the classroom yeah
definitely so um the people will go to
CSS I are going to one of the most
amazing people you ever meet because
they just they're how they're passionate
about the same things as you and they're
just super smart and they know like they
know so much about computer science and
you learn so much from them and even
after the program I stay close with the
people I met at CSS I and this past
month I actually did a programming
competition with two other former CSSI
participants and we had a lot of fun
just coding together and talk
Abbasi SSI great thanks so much so we
have a couple of minutes left on the
Hangout and so I wanted to take some of
the questions that viewers who are
tuning in have posted that they're
curious about so the first question is
from Julian and um perhaps this is a
good question for Alice and that maybe
Matthew can chime in as well to answer
Julian is wondering what advice would
you give to a high school student who is
planning to apply to CSSI in the future
so perhaps someone who's maybe a
freshman or a sophomore not ready to
apply to CSSI now but interested in
maybe applying in the future and how can
a high schooler at that level start
preparing to be a CSS ire or you know
participating in other programs at
Google so my advice would be just to get
exposed to computer science there are a
lot of resources online that you can try
such as Codecademy just to learn program
II like even if you don't have a
computer science class in your school
you can still learn computer science by
taking use of these online great
resources um yeah and I I think it's
actually really good advice there's not
only are there a lot of things that you
can learn online I'd also recommend that
if this is a sort of thing that
interests you you can get started
building your own stuff early on in high
school or whenever and that's certainly
going to help if you come to CSS I it
will certainly always help to have a
little bit of experience with this as
well that said I you know it you you can
potentially if you're if you're already
at that stage and you're interested in
this stuff there are many routes other
than CSS I to to kind of get you up to
speed with building web applications and
yeah I would say that JavaScript and
Python as well as HTML and CSS in
particular are great things to start to
get some experience with early on and
Alice you mentioned code Academy and I
just wanted to briefly mention some of
organizations that offer free computer
science related classes so in addition
to code Academy there's also Udacity and
there's oh yeah Lou Gossett is great
yeah I'm doing one of the courses on
right now actually Oh fantastic
it's the one it's someone on Google
building a search engine faster yeah any
others that you can think of as well
treehouse is another really good
resource for more on the website yes
and there's also edx not sure which is
which is valuable too so I hope that
helps answer a Julien's question the
last question we have for today is what
does a typical Google CSSI students day
look like and this question is coming
from Anisha so a typical day in the life
of a CSS Iyer and Alice I guess you're
the best person to answer this question
I think so
I don't know much about the first
session but for the second session I I
would say so for the first two weeks it
was mainly focused focused on just
learning the material and basically we
would wake up at 8:00 to get breakfast I
know it's 8:00 but it's okay because
everyone's just excited to learn you
will you would learn programming from
Matthew and some other programmers for a
few hours and then you have lunch and
then in the afternoon you will usually
have some related programming activities
to help you learn programming and also
sometimes it's also just continual
learning and then you have dinner and
then it would go go back to MIT dorm and
usually when I go back I just continue
coding because like the things were
learning is so interesting and they're
just always problems yourself like Radha
would give us all these emails of
problems for us yourself and it just
keeps me which is coding and after the
first
two weeks oh yeah and during weekends we
have social activities and one of my
favorites was going to the doctor
because I've never been on a doctor and
it was just so awesome like when you're
on the road and all of sudden you were
in water and continue and then you go
back to the road again and yeah I will
watch movies and its really great
because not only do you learn you also
have fun and for the third week it's
when you start doing the project and
basically you would just spend 24 hours
working on your project and you will
continue and you will get help from from
some of the full timers or interns at
Google and it's great - it's great for
you to both learn from them and network
with them and after the third week you
will present your project to the whole
world and it was one of my favorite
moments just to showcase what to
showcase what me and my group we're
working on as well as to see what other
people have worked them because it's
just great to realize that you've a pop
if you've learned so much and
accomplished so much in just three weeks
thanks so much Alice that was really
helpful um so we're unfortunately out of
time but Horatio Isabelle Quinn Alice we
want to thank you so much for
participating that in this and we also
want to thank everyone who is tuning in
watching this live and all the people
who will hopefully watch the recording
later on again this was a hangout all
about Google's computer science Summer
Institute in preparation for CSSI 2013
just a quick reminder about dates to
look out for so applications for summer
2013 open on March 4th and they closed
on April 7th and we're hoping to give
out final decisions around May 1st or
there abouts approximately
and where you can apply starting on
March 4th is our website you can also
find more information about the program
there as well and that URL is google.com
slash students slash CSSI again
google.com slash students slash CSSI so
I hope everyone has a fantastic rest of
the day and thanks for your interesting
computer science Summer Institute at
Google so bye guys
