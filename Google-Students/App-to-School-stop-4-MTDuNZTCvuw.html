here at Vanderbilt University it was one
of my big points to tana work with a lot
of administrative teams and a lot of
departments to get google apps to campus
and I'm really excited to the Google
boss is here today who looks awesome
google chat are pretty sweet for keeping
in touch with people we're still trying
to work on getting my mom up to speed
with google talk but once we get that
going we're gonna end up saving a lot of
money on the long distance minutes for
calling her whenever she wants to talk
to me my favorite part about it is the
calendar I work in research at
Vanderbilt we have to coordinate like 12
calendars at once and so we all have
been shared it's really easy just to pop
in there and see when someone's free to
do whatever we need to do i use calendar
to keep track of all my class schedules
and I update my calendar with events so
they have like the football games I had
it under there so whatever plug in my
phone I get everything that's going on
around on campus
my favorite part of Google Docs reforms
application needed to consolidate
results for my friends when I'm trying
to like to plan an event or anything
like that I found it's really easy to
make them you just click a thing at a
question you just put in what the
question is it creates the form for you
you incorporate it into an email
sometimes you get e-mails back sometimes
you don't book with a form they can do
it 10 seconds send it back one of the
main things that we've done is set up a
spreadsheet to help my daughter with the
college search we've created a number of
fields in that spreadsheet to enter the
names of the schools that she's
interested in their student populations
deadlines tuition financial aid my
daughter can enter information from her
computer I can enter information from my
computer we're not transferring the
document back and forth we're able to
work on it simultaneously that's
tremendously helpful
we just heard the fun and exciting ways
Vanderbilt students are using google
apps for education we'd love to hear
your story upload them today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
