I've made an impact you google I'm a
fourth year computer science major at
the Georgia Institute of Technology and
Atlanta Georgia and I'm originally from
a very small town of Kentucky called
Baghdad and I'm currently a corporate
operations engineer at Google
as a corporate operations engineer it's
our job to increase the efficiency of
our internal resources that are
engineers and sales numbers and HR team
views we want to make sure that for no
reason are they sitting there doing
nothing because some computer doesn't
work or because one of the
the network systems they need to use to
get their job done are not functional
shortly after I was making the decisions
are starting the process of making
decisions about where I wanted to work
Google came to my campus in Atlanta and
they they offered some presentations
about what the engineers do on a
day-to-day basis and some of the
products that they were releasing and
what they were used for I did a little
bit more research in the company and and
I started to realize that Google isn't
here just to to make money they're here
to provide a service for people even
even the executives of the company are
seem to be unlike those of many others
and that they're they're really here to
provide a service to people and that
goal is seen throughout the employees of
the company and the company's mission
Google is really outside of the scope of
a start-up at this point but we've done
a really good job of maintaining our
culture here of the company so we sort
of have the feel of a start-up but with
many many more resources than a normal
startup would have it's really great to
be able to have the benefit of have the
culture benefit of being in a start-up
but having the resources of being a very
large company
I'm unlike many interns because I can't
point to you I can't point to a page
that lives on cool calm and say this is
what I did many interns can do that
however my impact is more behind the
scenes and the things that I'm doing I
was being a very global company changes
that I make here in Mountain View could
could affect people in in Zurich order
Dublin or Sydney or Japan there there
are many impacts that I make that I see
on a day-to-day basis but may not be
completely understood or recognized from
the outside world but I know those
impacts are there because I see it when
I walk around my building
something that I really like to note is
that here at Google we don't have
interns that are just out getting coffee
for their managers or doing the work
that no one else wants to do in terms of
giving very meaningful and very defined
projects and also have the flexibility
to to make suggestions on how to improve
those projects interns go to the staff
meetings just like anyone else interns
are treated like a full-time employer
and even though not everyone at the
company may know your interns name we
still have so many opportunities to make
an impact here even though there are so
many
my favorite thing about interning at
Google is definitely that just as soon
as I start here I'm welcomed and treated
just like a full-time employed as as are
all the other interns we're seen as a
member of the team we go out to continue
outings if the entire team besides they
want to go to Santa Cruz for the weekend
you're automatically invited this is a
really really great cultural impact for
us because I actually as an intern get
to see exactly what it's like to work
here as a full-time engineer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
