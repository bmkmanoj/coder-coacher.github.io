programs operations team here at Google
and I'm talking today with Melanie one
of our start associates here at Google
about her experience in the Start
program we're going to talk a little bit
about her background and also answer
some questions from our followers on
twitter com and facebook com so first
Melanie we'd like to introduce yourself
sure hi I'm Melanie I'm from the
University of Texas at Austin and I was
majoring in history and now I'm here
great well let's get into the questions
so first how would you describe the
google Start program well the google
Start program is a program for new grads
non-technical new grads you join as a
class you go to training together you
work on a project together or alone and
then you branch off into sales or keep
operations a jar okay and how and why
did you become a google start associate
well why is I love google how I was able
to intern in 2008 and I went to a career
fair I met a recruiter I told her I was
interested in internships and she told
me to continuously check the website
which I did apply came here converted
amounting here great um and what
positions in the Start program did you
participate in and what are you doing
now at Google okay I was in I was
working on a project job analysis
specifically engineering and we have to
conduct focus groups interview software
engineers figure out what they're doing
on a day-to-day basis and now I'm in
analytics okay great um and would you
say there's a typical day in the life of
a start associate kind of um well some
days you have trainings and you learn
how to write business emails how to give
a speech you get to hear executives
great people talk to you about how they
what they learned here at Google then i
would say on a tip
day you would come to work have a
meeting with your manager talk about
your project have meetings with your
teammates to figure out how to solve the
problem that you're having have lunch
with your friends and the most amazing
food you can think of then spend the
rest of the day working that make sense
so in this would you say or something
that was your favorite part of the
program sure I would say the people the
people here are amazing they're super
smart she was my mentor and she helped
me grow here at Google pretty much
helpful thanks Laura from Italy wants to
know if there are opportunities for
humanities majors people who are
non-technical at Google of course I'm in
history major and I think Google
appreciates people who are learning
something that they're really passionate
about and excelling in that and working
hard okay um Amy from Chicago wants to
know a little bit about what your
recruiting process was like mine would
be different for than anybody else's I
guess I was an intern so I had an
internship for three months I had two
interviews on the phone for that
internship then I came here I had two
on-site interviews and then two months
later I had a call thing we want you to
come back great um clearly that worked
out for you so do you have any advice
for people that are looking to be
accepted into the google Start program
sure i would say have fun be yourself
have humility work hard and be a little
quirky great well thanks Melanie and if
