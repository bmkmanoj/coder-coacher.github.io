of college graduates are women yet again
there's this huge gap between the number
of people who are pursuing computer
science and we at Google are interested
in understanding what is causing that
gap to place for people who have varied
backgrounds who have varied ideas and
it's a safe place to have those ideas we
brought together a group of women in
technology from lots of different
backgrounds creating a forum for them to
come together and understand what some
of their challenges are as a group and
solve problems that they face as a
community it's basically perception it's
about the feeling that computer science
is a bloke's word that's not true I
think we're going to need a lot of help
in thinking about what the right
solutions are but i hope you will become
part of that dialogue and i hope there's
some similarities that can be drawn with
other women in tech outreach we've
kicked off the week with koda a
mentorship program encouraging women in
coding and giving them a great place to
learn and succeed during the rest of
this week we brought together women from
the apac region who are the Anita Borg
finalists they're going to get career
advice they're going to go through
panels and they're going to interact
with other senior women who are already
intact the experience is also get to
meet lots of different people from all
sorts of background which is great China
kanpur ages you excite you to you know
to go forward and maybe
pursue your career and companies like
these when you develop a product it's
for an end user so why not get on
thirteen fifty percent of males and
fifty percent of females to create an
equal representation of your end users
you want people who are disruptive you
want people who have a different
perspective you guys are the future
leaders and we can learn a ton from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
