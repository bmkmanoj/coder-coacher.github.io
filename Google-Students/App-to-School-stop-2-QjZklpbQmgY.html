at Arizona State University the first
and biggest deployment of google apps
for education it's really the heart of
the way that ASU keeps its student
population involved so welcome the box
I use gmail for my personal email and
school email you know it's free it has a
lot of space like you keep things on I
can access it from any personal computer
I've been using google talk ever since
it came out I used to use all the other
messenger clients but most of my
contacts are now on google talk it's a
great way to get in touch with all your
professors and keep in contact with all
the people that you have behind
I am
we're first-year students we use Google
Docs to collaborate on a strategy paper
that we are working on we sort of used
it to work together at the same time we
were actually in the same room but we
projected google docs on to monitor and
so edits were updating on the monitor
from different people
I've installed that computer literacy
180 and for that class to actually have
to make a website instead of making an
own HTML I can just go to google and
make my own website and make it look
cool and design it and it's easy to do
i use a google calendar it helps me
organize my time i'm able to have my
appointment sent to my cell phones I'll
be wandering the class and forget the
room number and I'll put the location in
so the text message that comes you do
that 10 minutes before my class really
is helping actually find the glass a
couple of time
we loved hearing from students today
about how they're using apps and
interesting and fun ways do you have a
cool story to share if you do upload it
here we can't wait to hear from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
