everyone from the AdWords team in the
first of three parts of the Google
online marketing challenge learning
series we wanted to host this series to
give student teams ideas on how to
effectively manage their AdWords
accounts and on how do you utilize their
Google+ pages to help you all become
successful online marketers today we
have Emily here to talk with us about
how to use Google+ in our online
advertising strategy so I want to hand
it off to Emily great thanks friend hi
everyone I'm wait I'm from the small
business marketing team and I focus on
class pages and I'm really excited to be
here today to help you get running on
google+ pages and start engaging and
getting a following so we can begin next
slide so what is google glass google+ is
a project that makes sharing on the web
more like sharing in the real world and
it works that way so that you can share
the right things with the right people
meaning i can send one message to my mom
and one message to my co-workers at
Google and then one message to my
college friends and maybe some photos
with some people and some to another and
then if I'm a business I can share
certain messages to stiffer and groups
of customers so maybe I just want to
share some things with and the people
that come into my business in the
morning or some things like for the
people that come in late during the
afternoon or girls boys whatever maybe
it also lets us chat face-to-face with
an with multiple people at the same time
just like we're doing now and that's a
really great tool for businesses and it
also lets people follow businesses
brands that they love next slide so
there are ready over 100 million users
on Google class today and billions of
items are shared every day such as
photos leagues videos whatever and
there's also over 1 million sites across
the web that have installed the +1
button and we'll talk more about that
later on and also thousands of Google+
pages have been created for small
businesses and they've approved
feel really really useful tool next so
now let's talk a little bit more
specifically about why google+ faders
are great for businesses and how they
can help so just right off the bat you
know it helps you get online a lot of
businesses a lot of small businesses
don't have an online presence and this
is a really great super simple way for
them to get online you can also post
status updates pictures videos and its
really really easy to stay in touch with
customers through this platform sharing
is really easy as we talked about it
earlier you can say that your audiences
so that you don't have to share the same
message with everyone hangouts are great
like we talked out you can talk to your
customers even if your they're not there
in the store with you or if you have a
website either or not you it's hard to
communicate so this that's a great tool
and again circles lets you organize and
then lastly it makes all the marketing
you do with Google even better and we'll
get into details about that shortly next
slide great so I wanted to give you a
few examples of some really great last
pages you can get a feeling of what the
successful pages are doing so be
creative that's the key being creative
and posting about new and innovative
things and cool things that you know
that your customers will really enjoy
since then thanks is a great example
they do lots of cool things just to give
you one example of something that
they've posts that I think is really
awesome really useful and it's a really
good example of how to target your
audience so then Mike's will often posts
the best route they're based in you
record all posts the best migrants in
New York so depending on the weather or
the traffic on a certain day they'll
give the tips about which route to take
and that's the thing that's really
useful to the people that would be
following a page like theirs next slide
another great example of a small
business that using Google+ pages is
King Arthur Flour they host hangouts all
the time and post recipes all the time
and one of the hangouts that they that
they've done is they'll host a hangout
where they'll cook something with other
people so with their customers so they
can easily help them if they have
challenges or have questions so it's
kind of like you you're on the food
network or something that you were
actually there with them and the
customers get a really unique experience
and I think um getting more out of it
than they would if they were just
following recipe you straight from a
book or from now let's talk a little bit
about how to promote your page so we're
starting this we're starting off
assuming that you've created a page so
that if you're participating the and
Google online marketing challenge for
the social media work that you've
created your page and now that you're
you're looking to find out how you get
more followers and how you get people
aware that you so you're competing in
this competition and that you have a
plus page for your business and to get
more customers for your business so the
simplest thing to do just right off the
bat is to reach out friends and say can
let them know that you created this page
and then and ask them to start following
you and plus one of your page once
they've done that encourage them to
start commenting on your post so
anything that you post ask them to
really engage and ask questions now it's
the easiest and simplest way to get up
and ready and so that means ask your
professors ask your friend whoever may
be another another really easy great way
to start getting flowers is by sharing
your page on Google+ so on that under
private page or your start your personal
page rather for your personal profile so
you can take the link from your Google+
page and then post it on your personal
profile to let people know and then it's
really easy to click and follow right in
there another good thing to do is to
share the page and let your businesses
loyal customers know that
have they have a page and that they're
doing lots of cool things with paige
offering emotions and whatnot and that
they should start following the page and
we'll talk a little bit more about how
to do that in just a second another good
thing to do is to follow other pages I'm
sorry I should have mentioned before but
the reason it's really important to get
others to follow you is that a plus page
cannot add followers to their circle do
not follow other people until they're
being followed by them so I cannot
follow Brian last page unless he am
website I cannot follow Brian unless he
is following me so but you can follow
other + stages so if I want to follow
King Arthur Flour I can do that but I
can't follow Brian unless I'm in his
circle so again you have you should
reach out to friends and family post a
link to your Google+ page from on your
personal profile and also share the fact
that you have a page with loyal
customers and follow other pages so
following other pages would be if you're
a bakery you might want to follow maybe
a cookware store not somebody that's
directly competition with your business
but somebody that has a related interest
because it's likely that they will have
some more followers if they have
followers and you start commenting on
their page that their followers to see
you and are likely to become new
customers for your business it's also
great to follow larger companies if
you're a small business that might have
a lot of traffic to their page next
slide so I just wanted to point out but
this is a really great resource for
remembering how to gain followers and
for navigating and kind of the beginning
of gaining a following and promoting
your page anyway I'll not get started
page there's it you'll you can get there
by clicking the link on the left hand
side of your page it says get started
and this is useful where it says tell
the word you can copy that link and that
makes it super easy for you to share
that link on honor different marketing
material send an email to friends and
family and and that's where you're going
to get done
information next slide so to get even
more followers once you have an initial
following it's great to promote your
page in all your marketing materials so
this means in this if you have a store
then you should promote in this store so
on business cards on flyers posters and
you can even have printed all your
receipts and anywhere you can think of
you want to post you want to tell the
world that you have a Google+ page and
to start following your page it's also
really important that you create great
content the better the content the more
likely you are to have a following
because as soon as you create something
that's really really engaging your
followers will start reposting it and
then their friends and anybody that's in
their circles will see that post and
then circle you if it's interesting
engaging so we'll talk about some things
you can do in just a second to make to
create some really engaging content it's
also a good idea to create exclusive
deals on your page so maybe say for
example I'm a bagel store I can post
something that says use xcode when you
come into my store to get twenty percent
off and they only get this if they have
followed your page if you only post this
specific deal on your page and that way
your customers will then have a reason
to start following your page because you
offer these exclusive deals only on your
Google+ page and maybe you can have a
signed by your register or posters up in
your store that says follow our page for
exclusive deals another important thing
to do is posting the Google+ page of
your website this links your Google+
page to your website and this is really
important because it a grits the number
of the Plus Ones you get on your website
and the plus ones you get in your page
and we'll talk more about that in a
second also turning on social extensions
is another super important things to
important thing to do and this increases
the click-through rate of have your ads
next buyers
so we call this the social 123 and this
helps improve the click-through rate of
your search ads in Google there's three
steps first you create your Plus page
which many of you have already done if
you haven't done that yet you should go
ahead and do that the next thing to do
is take the Google+ badge and post it on
your website this connects your Plus
page and your website then you go into
Adwords and turn on social extensions
and that then connects your Plus page
your website and your ads and all the
Plus Ones from all three sources will
get aggregated to make one big number
the more plus ones you get the more
likely it is that your ads will search
social invitation next slide please next
slide sorry think good great thank you
so the plus so you can get the badge a
couple of different ways one of the
easiest ways to access the badge is then
going to that get started page that we
talked about earlier again you can get
that page by clicking the get started
link on the right hands I'm sorry on the
left hand side of your page and budget
if you click the get the badge the blue
link under connect your website then
will direct you to a place where it
makes it super easy and you just have to
add a snippet of code to your website
and and then you're all set it connects
your badge and your website it's also
really great to put your website in the
About section of your Plus page and this
also let's Google know that to connect
your website and your life it helps but
you this is the badge is all final so
you really need to make sure that you
have that stupid of code to your website
if you have one next I'll eclipse
so just to talk a little bit about what
the plus one is and what it means so
adding the plus one to your site allows
people to endorse endorse your site and
say are your business and say this is a
really great business love it want to
share with my friends let all my friends
and followers know that this is a
business that I think is really really
cool and useful and that will encourage
your friends to go and visit that place
for example I'm much rather if I'm going
on a vacation and know that my friend
stated this routine hotel and they had a
great experience because I see that they
have plus one did insert then a much
more likely to go there that if I was
recommended to me just in some you know
travel magazine and we see this
happening all the time and this is what
really increases then those ABS when
they have social invitations and the
other thing that Plus Ones do is really
show up sorry they show up in search and
they also show up and on your Google+
page and they strove on your badge and
you can share direct phone from the +1
button on your gun in the batch you can
share directly to your stream so if i
wanted to share the site right from
there with my stream then i could do
that next slide is enabling social
annotations so we talked briefly about
this in the social one two three and
this was the last step so in even social
annotations and again combines is kind
of full package it combines your ads
your Plus page and your plus one and it
makes one huge number of plus once again
increasing the likelihood that your that
social annotations so show up on your
ads insert just hugely important both if
you're competing in the social justice
social component of the challenge or the
overall challenge and I know that I keep
repeating this and this one two three
but this is super super super important
so that's why we keep reiterating it and
now let's talk a little bit about how
you act
go in and enable social annotations next
slide so to enable social annotations
log into your AdWords account and go to
the ad extensions tab then select social
annotations from the drop-down menu and
click new extension then you can go back
into your Google+ page and copy the URL
again just to make sure that you're
getting the right URL you can go back to
the get started page and copy it from
there or just copy it from the regular
do just at the top the regular you out
there and you paste that end and then
hit save it's that easy that's all you
have to do once you've created a page
and install the badge of your site you
just go into social annotations turn it
on and hold off they're all combined
into one and you've just improved the
chances of people clicking on your ass
next slide so now let's talk a little
bit about sharing and engaging and some
great ways you can do this next silence
so we talked about the bike shop posting
routes route to the city really cool
idea and the bakery posting recipes and
pictures another really cool thing that
somebody is that a lot of people are
actually doing on Google+ is a hosting
the personal training sessions and
hangouts an electronic store will post
reviews but just in general you can use
hangouts in a lot of really cool ways
and not only in the examples here but
you can also use them for customer
service so your business is a business
that could that be that has a business
that could use customer service this is
a great way of doing it and since you
can talk directly face to face with your
customers to answer questions it's also
just a great way to get to know who your
customers are so hangouts are really
cool in that way and other things that
you can do we talked about as posting
promotions and anything that's new and
different that you know that your
customers are like so just really think
about your customers and what might
interest them and one more thing about a
great constant there's something
interesting you could do right within
Google+ it's called a saved search so
you can save a search about any kind of
interest categories so some of bakery
maybe I'll save a search on cooking and
it will create a stream of all the
information that's going on on google
plaza and in search that's cool about
cooking and so it's kind of a great way
to carve asst some ideas about what you
might want to post so once you have this
enormous following you can segment in
two different in two different circles
so that you're only showing the right
message of this with the right people we
talked about a little bit about this
before but I would love to give you an
example of how this might work next
slide please great so for example if I'm
a coffee shop you can imagine a
situation where I have my early risers
all the people that come in right before
work and then i have my study group in
the afternoon well it might be that i
only want to share specific deals with
specific people or specific articles so
i might want to give tips to my study
group about you know maybe like study
tips or something and then great drinks
with extra caffeine and twelve twenty
percent deals after 5pm but that
wouldn't be of any interest to my early
risers so i don't have to share that
kind of information with them and things
with all the early site for all the
early risers do one group and all of my
the people that come in late at night
the study groups in another and share
specific deals offers links whatever it
may be that specific group of people
that's just one idea but you can decide
what makes sense for your business it
might be by gender by age it doesn't
matter whatever works for you next
flatus
so yes and then I can hope to hang out
and this is if I were a coffee shop I
can post great hang out maybe about how
to make the perfect cup of expresso so
there's so many cool things you can do
and just a more creative you can get
with it the better next slide please so
if you start a hangout just want to give
you tips on how this works so you'll
find the Hangout link on the right hand
side of the page you might already know
this since you're viewing or hang out
and you're on google+ you can see it
it's always there and if you click start
a hangout you can hang out specific
circles or you can have a public hang
out with and let everybody on google+ to
know that you're hanging next slide and
so how other people know they're hanging
out so for example I just wanted to hang
out with if I'm still the coffee shop
and I just want to hang out with early
risers then I can only post my early
riser circle so they'll see in their
stream that their favorite coffee shop
is hanging out and they can join and
we're talking about study tips or
something and they'll be able to see
that will show up in their stream which
is if you click I think we should get an
arrow oh actually the wrong one but and
will also show up on the right hand side
and they're letting them know that one
hang out it's live and again if you
click again you'll see it there in the
stream so two places it's really clear
where if you're hanging out so I hope
this was helpful we just want to give
you a few more resources so that if you
have any other questions you can look
and see if we have answered your
questions are ready or feel free to post
questions on the last page and a student
Plus page and let us let us know but if
you click again I'm going to the next
slide there are a couple of different
places you can visit for advice and tips
on how to engage your page and how to
get more followers and Plus Ones the
Google+ your business Plus page is a
great
nice to go and posting lots of tips and
product updates all the time and feel
free to ask questions there as well
there's the Google+ your business
website which has a lot of educational
material and a getting started guide and
then of course the Google online
marketing challenge website which has
information about running competing in
the social media or running app last
page the different product prices and
deadlines that you'll need to adhere do
to be eligible for the award so if
that's it I hope you found that useful
so Emily and we did get a few questions
so um is it okay if we go ahead and ask
you a few sure okay so one of the
questions was related to your
recommendations to get customers to
create Google+ pages and then add their
business to their circles so I know you
mentioned this but maybe if you could
give us some like the top three
recommended steps that the student team
should take to get those customers to
add their businesses sure so I think
number one is to tell your friends and
family and professors and classmates to
follow your page so when once they
follow your page that's a great start
you already have a lot of followers but
then you also want to encourage them to
start commenting on your posts until we
sharing your folks when they do that
then everybody that's following them
will see those see that they've
commented or that they have reshared a
post which is great and that lets them
know that they're interested in your
business and encourages them to follow
another great thing to do like you
mentioned is since you can't follow
people but you can follow pages is to
add other Google+ pages to your circles
so you should add pages that either
interest you or interest the business
that you're working on behalf of or
things that are in this you that you
know that your customers would be in
so again if I'm a coffee shop I don't
want to add another coffee shop maybe
because they're in direct competition
with me but maybe I want to add the
bakery next door and and follow that
this is their next door and probably
have similar customers that might be a
great way to do it and look for plus
pages that have a big following that way
and also comment on whatever they post
so that those followers see that you're
commenting and then will be inclined to
follow you and yeah so those are they oh
and then of course the social 123 that
is super important and that is a great
way to get more followers adding the bad
we've we've actually found that adding
the badge has over thirty percent
increase in followers that sign those
pages that have added the badge their
website has over thirty percent more
followers than those who don't and so
it's huge you really need to add the
batch to do your website if you have one
again just pasting that snippet of code
on your site and then also turning on
social extensions and AdWords helps
increase the chances of social
annotations showing up in search which
we know increases on average
click-through rate by five to ten
percent so really important to do that
as well and that's another great way to
get followers because if you see that
your friends supporting something you're
more likely to be interested in and want
to click on it and that's why we see
that increased in English degree okay
there is another question that we have
so you mentioned a lot about posting on
your Google+ page and we know that's
really important the students are
running a six-week challenge so do you
have any ideas of how often they should
post to their page and just you know how
today keep the customers engaged yeah
that's a great question so I think a lot
of it depends on who your audiences but
in general we recommend posting it five
times a week so pretty often the more
often you post well not you don't want
to spam your audience but you want to
keep things relevant so you don't want
to post if you don't have anything
you're soon to say any kind of cool
content but if you can post interesting
things five times a week that would be
ideal okay um so we do have another
question um it's related to Adwords so
you didn't mention using social
extensions to kind of drive traffic to
the Google+ page but are you are we
allowed to have ads that direct users to
the Google+ page without social
extensions yes that's a great question
absolutely you can use your google+ URL
for the Google+ page just like you use a
website URL and you can drive all of
your traffic if you wish to your Google+
page if instead of a website and that's
a great way to get followers and gays
get traffic there too so it's definitely
a possibility all right brian is there
anything else that any other questions
or anything else you wanted to add I
think um on my end I don't I didn't see
any other questions did anybody else see
any no I don't think so so I before we
close out I just want to make sure that
i mentioned the social media award and
what you can win by participating in
this are the challenge so the winning
team every member will receive a
certificate a tablet device they're
going to be able to participate in the

Asia Pacific you'll also win a trip to a
