was the most rewarding experience of my
academic career my team and I won the
Americas Regional Business Award my
senior year at James Madison University
Lindsay and her team were just amazing
they were professional they worked hard
and they developed a campaign that met
the clients objectives dr. Clark had
brought up Lindsay on a few instances
talking about how successful she and her
team had been and how she'd gone off to
work for Google and how the challenge
had prepared her I think that she's
definitely kind of a poster child for
success and for what can happen if you
take the challenge seriously and do you
know what you want out of it the Google
online marketing challenge is in
international competition for students
and academics which annually attracts
participants from over 1,000
universities and nearly 100 countries
students get to select a business or a
non-profit organization in the local
community or anywhere in the world and
we create an online advertising campaign
for them using Google Adwords and Google
Plus students get to run an AdWords
campaign for a real client using an
actual budget over a three-week period
it's a contest but it gives an
opportunity to build up a skill set
through hands-on experience we worked
with a local business that's old
customizable promotional products the
company had never had a single online
sale before and after running an AdWords
campaign for just three weeks that was
no longer the case I learned a lot about
understanding how to use Adwords and how
to capitalize on different campaigns
that we wanted to use and employers are
looking for students that have that
experience based on the performance of
our students and the recognition to the
Google challenge we've had more and more
recruiters coming to campus and
specifically because they know our
students are getting these kinds of
experiences here at the University I was
able to leverage the skill set that I
developed while participating in a
challenge to get a job in the online
advertising industry ultimately it led
to a job at Google
where I'm currently an account
strategist helping small to medium size
businesses if I didn't do the challenge
I think it would be a lot harder to
stand out from everyone else and
applying for jobs after school and
interviews you can always talk about
what you've learned in a class because I
had that kind of experience on my resume
I think that helped me really stand out
and get the job that I have today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
