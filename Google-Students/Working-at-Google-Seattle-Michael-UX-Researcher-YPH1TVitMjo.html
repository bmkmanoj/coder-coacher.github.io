of being able to work on brand-new
things is pretty exciting my backgrounds
as an anthropologist so what I like to
do is understand what are people doing
the kind of etiquette that they use to
interact and how do they bring that
online when they're writing emails with
Gmail or when they're blogging things or
sharing photos with their friends or
with their families we tend to think
about big problems and try to solve big
problems so there are a lot of small
problems that we deal with on a day to
day basis the little features changing
the labels of a button this thing or
that thing but we're also basically the
team that I'm working on trying to
figure out how do we help people
collaborate communicate and build
communities online so what we're doing
is working across a variety of different
products but trying to figure out how do
those all integrate together how do we
make the experience consistent how do we
help people understand how to do those
things so they can move from product to
product and so to me to be able to
understand and dig into that from a
research standpoint is very exciting to
know that I can take that and translate
that into brand-new products that will
help people do all those things in new
ways I'm Michael Margolis and I'm a tech
lead for the user experience research
