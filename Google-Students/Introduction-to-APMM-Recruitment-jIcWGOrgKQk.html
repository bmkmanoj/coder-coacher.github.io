is yeah yeah I welcome everyone welcome
to the YouTube livestream in Singapore
so I'm Jocelyn and with me - Allen over
here so I know we have a global audience
today so you know let us know where you
come from by leaving a comment let's see
we have Jackie hi jack
so we have people coming in from the US
Wow everyone's dialing in at such a late
time thank you so much for for joining
us today
yeah so maybe let us walk you through
the agenda today so today we will be
focusing on the APM program which will
have challenges what you guys through
this whole program so that you know what
to expect and I'll be walking you guys
through the whole hiring process before
we have a quick Q&amp;amp;A session and after
the session is just gonna be a very
short survey all right so right now I
guess over to you Shelly wonderful hi
everyone I'm very excited today to talk
to you guys about the APM M program um
so um so my name is Charlene I'm a
product marketing manager here at Google
I've been with Google for two and a half
years I started um in San Francisco and
moved over to Singapore about a year and
a half ago and so I'm really excited
today to talk to you guys about my
experience in the program and also and
talk to you a little bit more about what
I've learned so it's going to start it
so the APM Emmett program stands for the
associate product marketing manager
program and I'd say I want to walk you
through a little bit about how the
program is structured and different
things you should know about it great so
the mission of the MM program is really
to hire and really the best the best
people with an interest in technology
really early on in their careers and it
is to help kind of develop them and to
become them
generation of marketers at Google and
then how I'll educate these these ATMs
and have them become the next stewards
of our brands and the great aspect of it
is that the program is structured to
allow a lot of flexibility give a lot of
responsibility quickly to young people
straight out of school and so they can
develop and grow to become some of
Google's strongest marketers today I
want to talk to you a little bit about
some of the example rules that you can
have a lot of the roles can span across
brand across actual product marketing of
googles and you know some of our oldest
products like Google search all the way
to some of the newest innovations coming
out of machine learning
ai one other aspect of some of the roles
here at APM program is that you can also
be in growth marketing and this is one
of the kind of stewards of Google's
digital marketing as we are constantly
building new tools to help help develop
our own our own ad ad products and we
use those internally here at Google so
related APM program have gives you the
breadth of so many different products
across Google and also across our
consumer products as well as our b2b
products and one aspect of the the
program is that it's actually an
incredibly global program and you know
we have a PMS across 25 countries around
the world in regions you know in South
America in the Americas Europe as well
as here in Asia and more than half of
all ATMs now work outside of the US was
really showing kind of the growth and
expansion of Google's APM program around
the world and one of the key aspects
that allows this global aspect is that
it's um there's part it's not a
rotational program so now you know it's
a it's a two-and-a-half year program
where you're in your first rotation your
first roll for a year and a half and
then um kind of after after that then
you move out into your next rotation and
so here are some examples of
different people and a lot of these
actually my close friends of the
different places they've started off and
moved from so as I mentioned before I'm
from San Francisco and our headquarters
for Mountain View out here to Singapore
but you know we see kind of these
transcontinental rotations happening
very regularly um so I wanted to talk a
little bit about my my own personal
rotation and so I started in one of our
b2b products called Google cloud and in
my second rotation now I moved out to
Asia and I look after the the Android
platform business here across across the
region and we also have examples of
another another friend of mine named
Britt who also eventually became and
after her first rotation that went on to
go start her own company and so a lot of
it is Lena looking back at the APM
program there are so many different
opportunities to kind of learn and grow
and explore what you're really
interested in um and so in some parts of
the program is really heavily in the
learning and development so for example
one of the biggest things is around
digital marketing and as I mentioned
before um you know Google's at bread and
butter is being one of the best
companies out there to learn and develop
cutting edge tactics and how to do
growth marketing digital marketing
across you know incise brand measurement
and storytelling and kind of the second
part of the kind of learning within the
program is also just deep technical
knowledge and skills and so we develop
these these kinds of program learning
opportunities through things like boot
camps that are held in your region so
you can meet marketers across the
different products and it also allows
you to have these unique opportunities
to really develop and deepen your
understanding in certain areas and with
external agencies as well um next I
wanted to kind of walk you guys a little
bit through one of my favorite personal
things about it which is around
mentoring ship and
networking and so um one of the best
parts of the program is this really a
great opportunity to meet a PMS kind of
around the world and some of my favorite
memories have been developing um and I
don't like to use a word network as much
because I really just see them now as
friends exactly yeah people who I've
gotten to know through through trainings
through traveling together and then
actually problem-solving so um one of um
one of the best parts of the program is
we go on a a global trip for about one
and a half weeks to another region in in
the world and we meet with all the APM's
in your program I'm cool fly-in and we
spend we can have meeting Googlers from
other offices meeting a lot of different
companies to learn about how Google is
tackling kind of problems globally and
outside of your own your own home
country and then there is a great time
also just to learn about how other other
APM is and what our kind of dealing with
in other countries and then second part
is also this great opportunity to also
get exposure to senior leaders and this
is probably one of the biggest learning
areas in the program because you are
meeting and constantly interacting with
people senior execs I'm getting that
kind of mentorship one-on-one which is
truly just a super invaluable experience
so I touched a little bit a little on
the AP mmm trip I mentioned it's a ten
days out traveling around basically
around the world with your floor yeah
all before by usual and I don't think
you back to my my or if we actually um I
wasn't asking you at the time and we all
flew started in Belgium learned a lot
about how we're dealing with brand trust
issues then we went to Norway to learned
about how Norway's country that is
constantly trying to innovate through
digital technology and trying to learn
how Google is also innovating as a
company there and then we went to Tel
Aviv in Israel to learn about the
startup culture and how Google is
helping develop that that startup
innovation innovative type of thinking
and in that region of the world so as
you can see it was very um comprehensive
in type in in terms of Education and the
the knowledge sharing that happens on
the trip and of course a ton of APM
bonding as well cool next I wanted to
touch on some of the alumni that we've
had come through the program and there
isn't really a set path that ends up
happening when you go through through
the two-year program and you know we
have Googlers who started at a PMS and
they continue to stay within Google you
can then become directors and great um
trusted people within the company but
then you also have people who leave and
go externally to you know startups like
Airbnb and Netflix we also have the
founder of Instagram having gone through
the program as well feel also doing
their own their own startups so honestly
there's so many different things that
you can do we can within the program and
beyond um so quickly just to kind of
recap what I've shared so program as I
mentioned there's two rotations first
one is a year and a half and then
followed by a second one for another
year and that is probably one of the
best aspects is to really get that kind
of comprehensive kind of a comprehensive
and experienced learning so many
different parts of Google it can be like
most regional cross-functional anything
right exactly yeah so um do you switch
products basically to get more exposure
to different em to different parts of
Google and then also different different
countries as well um another I'm as I
mentioned before then you have the
international trip and we learn more
about the regional markets and there is
intense third intense focus on learning
and career development
Rozlyn is really the opportunities that
you get to meet kind of ventures alumni
and other APM who eventually your
friends it's exactly yeah um so I wanted
to touch a little bit also on the types
of candidates that the APM program looks
for um and so things like demonstrating
your ability to think analytically and
critically and having a strong passion
as well for for technology and in
digital marketing and the key one here
is on the also the entrepreneurial
spirit I've seen that time and time
again with so many of my friends have
gone through the program is that
everyone solves problems differently and
it's all about thinking in your own
style in your own way of how to kind of
solve this problem and that's what comes
out of the entrepreneurial spirit um
that kind of seeps into as well as
strong leadership skills and being able
to UM you know believe in what you think
is right and being able to get others to
believe that with you is that something
that we're looking for as well and the
last one is the the truly like the
global outlook and being passionate
about what you are interested in and
what makes you unique and those are all
things that we look born what I've seen
in many people kind of across the
program um and so last night I just
wanted to touch on some of my learnings
I've come and gone through the program
and some personal highlights one is just
it's amazing to see kind of the
diversity in ideas and people that I met
and seeing also just how many ways that
we can think about problems that we
launched products here at Google and how
to market them into all these consumers
all of that comes from everyone's
individual experiences and what I've
seen and come alive throughout my my
time here and then also the really
amazing autonomy we've had in leading
projects I have really rarely seen
anywhere else the kind of freedom and
trust that they have in
EMM to to lead project so for myself in
my second rotation out here in Asia and
we decided to launch a new product
called Android pay out here and that was
my task to then launch that across five
different markets or on a shoe and
that's everywhere from building the
strategy doing consumer insights
learning about what it's like to launch
this in Japan versus launching this you
know in Hong Kong very separate markets
but all of that kind of responsibility
is in an AP mmm so and that is probably
what I truly value and then also the
immense trust that people have in AP
MEMS to kind of go forward with these
ideas um the last one it's kind of the
flexibility and exposure so you know
flexibility to carve your own projects
to pursue what you're really interested
in and then also having the exposure to
see um kind of across across the region
across globally how Google is tackling
bringing these products to life and
usually you kind of don't get that kind
of exposure and so so young in your
career but honestly I've been constantly
amazed at the types of things that I see
rolling out every day um so that's
didn't yeah
kind of a recapping my thoughts on the
program um and I'm very excited LC for
how the program will grow and develop as
the years go on and I'll continue to
always be a part of it too
definitely thank you so much yeah great
so I guess um right I'll be taking on
NEX um
so hi again I'm Jocelyn so I'm a
recruiter based in Singapore but mainly
I take care of sales and marketing roles
across Southeast Asia and Greater China
so right now let me walk you through the
hiring process because if you actually
go up anyone who interview at Google I
guess some of the most common comments
would be the whole process takes so long
but it's only for good there's only good
reasons right so we want to make sure
that we are hiring people who are not
just able to you know
well in the role that you hide into but
at the same time also able to value it
across the different teams throughout
Korea in Google because we want to make
sure that it's a long fulfilling career
for them as well right so on the slide
you can see that inside a few stages of
the whole hiring process so if you were
to apply for a role with us so your
profile is shortlisted you will first
receive a phone call from a recruiter so
that would take maybe just about 30
minutes on screen and if you clear the
phone screen this is where you move on
to the on sites with the hiring team
right so for APM m in particular there's
going to be four rounds of interviews
and written assessment after all the
interviews so you can imagine that
itself is going to take about three to
four weeks alone right so after you
clear everything and everything is great
will then prove an offer packet for you
and kind of from summited tod hiring
committee for review so this current
committee they are formed by a very
independent group of people and there
are many senior leaders within Google so
the idea is that we want to have a very
subjective and unbiased view of every
candidate and we want to make sure that
you know every candidate that comes
through they're just some review
currently to make sure that we are
hiring the right people into Google so
this review process again takes maybe
about another one to two weeks before we
are able to extend your offer to you and
then you join us as a Googler so the
whole process takes about I think I was
saying maybe just six to eight weeks at
least and you came here you can try
other interviews you know how long it is
but it's always got good reasons all
right so make some write on how do we
hire so what exactly do we look for in
our candidates right so when we are
finding our next generation of Googlers
so we look out for a few areas we want
to know how the candidate things how is
he saw her leadership and then also
googliness you mean I've heard about
this term very frequently and of course
last but not least will be you know the
wrong related knowledge right so first
on how do you think what we call like
your problem-solving skills right
against on during interview there are
two types of questions that they're
usually asked so one will be behavior
and the other one more hypothetical so
behavioral is about you know how you
react respond in a past situation so
that is a good predictor of how you're
gonna you know respond in a similar
situation in the future and for
hypothetical questions is just assess
how quickly are able to think on your
feet right so there's really no right or
wrong answers do these tough questions
usually what the interviewer is looking
for is to see logical thinking and they
want to understand your thought process
right so it's just about working the
interview were true like what would be
the factors that you need to consider
will be mostly factors or data they can
you look into because in Google most of
the time the big decisions they are all
based on like data right there are
data-driven decisions over here so we
want to know whether you have the type
will look into data before making into
jumping into a solution so this will be
some of the things that can we'll be
looking out for right on the second area
leadership so it's really about just
sharing some examples about how you need
a team or even how you manage conflicts
within a team setting so it doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to make
people because sometimes we also talking
about emerging leadership so for example
when a situation calls for it where
you'll be willing to step up to lead
getting right in the tech area what we
call googliness so you may have heard
about this now but yeah that's really no
one fix definition for this term I have
a lot of candidates asking me so how do
I be googly like how do I become a real
life I don't have a good answer for you
because you can really mean anything if
I were to summarize it I would say it's
really just doing the right thing right
especially under pressure right and it
could be you caring for your team
members or you strive in ambiguity um
even that you appreciate diversity net
between your very googley as well so my
advice to all my candidates is always
you know just be yourself
that's after all this is just a very
general assessment of a culture fit all
right and the last area rule related
knowledge on this is more in relation to
what system roles are you applying for
just for example if it's an APM enrolled
and this is where you may need to read
up about like you to be modeling on
you see marketing but if it's some other
positions you may need to view them more
about a Google product like Google
AdWords Adsense for example right so for
this area usually the recruiter who is
your point of contact will be preparing
you for an interview
prior to that so you don't have to worry
about this your recruiter will be able
to give you some tips cool yeah so I
guess that's a lot of formal and so -
and a feel free to leave your comments
let us know what questions you may have
so that we are able to address them in
this session as much as we can
Wow
so many questions yeah sorry just give
it a second okay so I think because the
questions here there we go okay take a
look we have a question from Ali so
what's the minimum knowledge I should
have to be considered for the role
I'm guessing it's for this API Munro
well minimum knowledge ending of our APM
because it's meant to be an early career
development program so we do take in
people even without like marketing
experience and I think Shia and you do
not come from a market - no yeah so I
would say the beauty of the Employment
Program is that there isn't this minimum
set of requirements um or um yeah
standards or requirements for example I
studied history and computer science in
university and I don't never said never
took a marketing class in my in my life
or even a business class um and yeah you
know the doesn't they're not they're not
certain course requirements in order to
be I'm an AP mmm and don't necessarily
use either the things I studied in
university in my current role but it's
more about the skills you develop why
in university of being a strong
communicator being a strong critical
thinker and having just basic business
savviness
i think are all kind of things that are
common themes around everyone I know in
the program yeah exactly because for
this program there's also going to be
like training involved as well
throughout this program so it's really
just about looking at your potential by
whether you're able to grow into a
marketer within Google and not that much
of you know how much of our arcade you
have at a point in time like apply for
the room yeah absolutely and there's
also yeah these are the trainings the
boot camps different marketing tools and
academies that you you do learn and your
requirements once you're in the program
to take I think that's when you start
building up a lot of the hard market
skills in the role yeah sounds good I
hope that answers your question I'm it
and next up Kevin so how many a PMS are
we going to hire and a future for the
Southeast Asia region good question but
unfortunately we are not able to share
the actual number with you but we are
definitely expanding this program into
effect for this year so keep a lookout
so all the openings are on our career
site so go on to go slash on Google
curious and you'll be able to see one of
the openings that we have right now all
right cool another question from Kelly
well the final placement be a global
position away in a home country yep so
your first placement um is usually in
your home country or country as yeah and
so wherever you're applying usually
you'll be placed in a position in that
country and it's actually assigned and
then in your second rotation that's when
it's a lot more in your control and you
go out and find the next rotation that
you want so personally for myself I
wanted to move to hit to Asia so I
looked for a lot of different rotations
I could do out here I'm and landed in a
roll in Singapore
one thing to note is that this is
something that the previous head of the
program shared is that just because
you're done with the program does
and you cannot rotate again what let's
do what that means is that in after your
second rotation if you want to move
again you're more than welcome to after
another year in the role and you will
graduate out of the program and then you
can move into whatever role you want
next so by all means nothing is ever
final and just for me it's like for
example for myself I finished the
program and I was working in a role here
in Singapore on and repay marketing and
then after that it was a natural
transition that moved on to the next
project now I look after Android
platforms marketing for partnerships so
you're always constantly changing at
Google and you can always be rotating
and then being around to do whatever you
want and that goes into that flexibility
aspect of the role that's true and it's
not just weird in marketing so internal
mobility within Google is like highly
encouraged as well so even if you know
you feel like you're done with marketing
you can still go annika you know rotate
outside of marketing altogether so into
a sales role for example if you're
interested so this is something you know
how flexible it is over here yes um next
question
so how can a fresh graduate prepare for
this program or prepare and so from this
even without working experience so I
think we touch a little bit on that
earlier on so um what do you have to
prepare I guess for this position we
don't really expect you to have a road
related knowledge Posse especially if
you are a fresh graduate right so some
of the things that we'll be looking out
for will be more on like your soft
skills we definitely need a strong
communicator
we definitely need like shall we mention
a critical thinker so all this um I
don't know how you can prepare maybe
have some thoughts um yeah I think
honestly a lot of this preparation also
happens outside the classroom um with or
your actually your personal interest or
extracurricular interests I think always
um what how you're developing yourself
outside of academics is super important
and that really shows why you personally
I'm excited for and how are you
developing that um and so I always think
that's always really important to show
how your
you know you're a leader in your own
community or in your school and how you
are adding value to whatever it is you
care about and definitely showcase your
passion for marketing or for the tech
industry in general yeah yeah hope that
answers your question
so until next one all mr. Joshi so being
a ap mmm sounds like an extremely
exciting experience that is it possible
to share some of the challenges faced
yeah absolutely
um challenges everyday which honestly is
like half of it it's which is the fun
part um some of the challenges Nina just
today um in the in a marketing role you
are in a cross-functional role because
you are working with product managers to
help develop products or launch products
you're working with the business
development partnerships team and guys
making external external partnerships
happen so that we can always be doing
Cobar getting with really exciting
companies and so some of the challenges
is how do you align with everyone but
everyone has their own ideas their own
agendas and their goals and so some of a
lot of the challenges it's it's bringing
everyone together to be able to work
toward one goal and to UM bring um make
make things happen with so many
different people involved for example
just in cross-functional calls alone
it's you know about twelve different
people from around the globe um just
yesterday I was in a call with someone
from two people from San Francisco one
person from New York one person from New
India and is even that Majan that
timezone is crazy but it's all about how
do you you know you have one hour with
everyone you have you know 17 things to
cover how do you get through all of that
and then efficiently um get the projects
will get everyone aligned focus and a
way to go and so that's kind of the
challenges I deal with everyday daily
daily basis yeah and no matter what it's
always about doing what's right for the
user and so um you know they're gonna
bring out a lot of
untraceable though does this make sense
this is resonate for the people we're
trying to reach it's good right yeah
what if we do not have a very strong IT
background yeah only a strong marketing
background yeah this is like question
I still go up yeah month acknowledged
marketing skills they are transferable
but yeah what do you yeah yeah so it's
awesome that it can only help you um and
on the strong I team around I think you
know that all environments but I make
sure people know that there's there is
not this um one formula of being a good
ap mmm I think you know when you look at
a group of us um everyone is so
different everyone's backgrounds are so
different um honestly it's about showing
your your actual passion your interest
in technology you know reading up on
what are the latest is happening with
Google Trends
how does Google kind of um think about
certain um certain topics so I would say
you know read as much as you can um
online news sources and know what's kind
of what's coming to happening within not
just Google but also just the tech world
hmm alright so onto the next question so
thanks for making time for the session
question for Charlene what do you think
of doing a year or less and consulting
before applying or joining an Employment
Program this is funny because I actually
was in that situation where either I wa
I was I would either do consulting or
join the APM M program um so this I
honestly think it's a very personal
decision what I thought about was the
advice I people told me which I'm not
sure if I'm say this the answer was um
it was a lot easier to go from um uh to
go from Google into consulting and after
rather than going from consulting into
Google and that was that that was the
advice that I won and then the sec
one was just that it was also like what
was I clearly just interested in doing I
hunt that I already knew I wanted to
work in tag and I wanted to do a lot of
the a lot of them kind of get my hands
dirty inside a company first and then if
I still wanted to then I could always go
into consulting after but at the same
time I have ton of friends who came from
you know top consulting firms after
doing two or three years there and then
they came to join Google and you know
they also don't regret their experience
so I think that is in like you know
feast route that you should be taking
it's very you know basically a passion
right if right now you're doing medicine
and you feel like you know I just feel
like doing marketing right apply to us
all right I hope I will you know ease
all your concerns and yeah next question
from timely Wong
hi I would like to ask when is the
application period for the program so
anything right now if you go onto those
edge Google Korea's it would be think
some ATM openings that are ready opening
right in so we are hiring
so go on to our careers page and take a
look and apply if you're interested I
just wanted to highlight given that is
an AP mmm program right it's the early
career development program so it's open
to like people with 3.5 years or less
over experience alright so just as Midea
okay so well another question from Jay
yo do a pms get 20% innovation time if
so what have you guys been working on
yeah um yep so APM M's and Googlers
everywhere um everyone gets the
opportunity to do what we call 20%
projects um and so what I always like to
think is that it's not unnecessarily you
get to spend 20% of your time 80% of
your time doing your job is more like
you do your job at 100% and then on top
of that eight hundred twenty percent yes
not like a yeah but yeah Google also
makes it incredibly easy for you to
pursue a lot of these 20% projects like
for example my friend
he was very interested in exploring VR
and it's just tinkering on what would it
be like to build a platform with VR and
then what ended up happening from his
20% project actually got picked up by
Google and it's in this special program
called area when xx which is an internal
program and not basically there it's
kind of serving like an incubator so
he's pursuing he left his his PM role to
go work on this platform project now
within Google so it's super cool about
different things you can do I've had
friends who use a 20% time to start
community projects and to go volunteer
and also to do you know simple things
like things that just matter to them and
so for example another friend of mine is
trying to figure out bring more one
online in India and then that 20%
project eventually became a project that
Google marketing then picked up to
become something so honestly there's no
limit to what you can do with your 20%
it's it's your time yeah I guess a lot
of it is just about time management if
you feel like you can do it then take on
more projects right and you like Gmail
is set up as a 20% project but look at
what it is now so it's really about what
you're passionate and if you have the
time go ahead and just self you know
can't do it all right
ah great we only have time for one last
question so this is an olive oil ice
cream before we want to get your
feedback first all right so see you on
the my dream after section because we
need to get your feedback and we will
leave a link to the feedback in the live
chat box okay so a lot of questions a
quick one um from Kevin so are there any
specific language sales requirements for
the AP mmm oh um some of the room yes
because they're slashing dependent on
the marketer you're talking so Frank for
example if you are supporting a
non-emotional you need to speak
Vietnamese or Japan than you in Japanese
so we have a few rules that are open
right now some of them with language
requirement but
and don't just yesterday really and and
I might be the one that was last week
you cool so right now we prepared Elena
and I'll come and and just you can see
that this is in fact our first session
so let us know how we can improve or
what would you like to hear more from us
and then also thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
