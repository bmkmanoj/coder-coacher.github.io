today I'm Sookie I'm Travis and this is
Sookie and we're gonna kind of be
running through what kickstart is and
we're gonna jump into the wonderful
world that is kickstart so yeah to get
things started quick introduction my
name is Tavis I've been at Google for
about four years now I work on the
Google home in the chromecast team more
generally any of our hardware products I
may have had a hand in so um like many
of you I'm actually pretty new to the
kickstart project is a whole so so keep
here is actually a kickstart veteran is
what we call it
so um saqib if you could introduce
yourself and kind of give us an
introduction of what is kickstart I am
Stuckey I'm a software engineer at
Google I work at the absurd quality and
intensity so code Jam is Erika annual
competition that happens in a code Jam
area so where the participant can test
their coding ability have a team sir
what does the real technical problem at
Google decline and get acquainted with a
bit of this stuff sonic konjam initially
was not in 70 was happen for some part
of the world but now from this year the
tipster is going like over so people of
all part of the world from the in part
of the world can participate on
Kickstarter so this year kick step is
business like starting from 18 months we
will have a proud and because it's
global so here we are gonna have like
eight different rounds in big different
time zones so that people can find the
round which is convenient for their time
alone so if you hear three our contest
and from everyone many of the top
participant maybe we call for an
interview at Google i/o is let's
participate between the first version of
yeah yeah it's awesome yeah so for all
the coders out there how would you
prepare what are the steps to do stuff
to prepare when you first start yeah so
before we do that that the kickstart
problems are suitable for everybody so
there are many introductory problem so
like people like start you can can
obviously participate here and charge
its position in there and another good
thing about the keatster is there this
is very much language agnostic so it
doesn't matter in each language code
like you can solve it in any language
and like that's fun and the problem is
quality or very high design is like so
kickstart is very fun place to learn so
for the prac is unser this GUI to like
any data structure algorithm these
sources pull you through any programming
contests and stuff but the best place is
to like practice for material content so
the give it kick-starts if the previous
problems of kickstarter already there
the resources and here you can see
anybody solution and yeah so the good
thing you mentioned so practicing really
is the best way to get prepared not only
for just kickstart but also any career
in software or programming because these
are very similar to the skills that we
use that can help you succeed so we're
gonna start with kind of how you can
prepare so as seqid mentioned the danger
structures and algorithms really are
going to be the bread and butter the
things that you really need to know like
the back of your hand so there's the
simpler data structures things like stat
excuse lists all those sort of things
and then ramping on up to the more
complex data structures so things like
hash tables graphs trees and a mix of
them often the most complex problems are
actually mixing multiple data structures
that work well together
also there's a lot of very common
algorithms like you need to know how to
sort lots of things but also graph
traversal you know DFS BFS all these
things will be always helpful they're
just tools in your tool
and ESIC you mentioned any programming
language that you're comfortable with
you can use the most common one that we
usually see is C++ Java and Python those
are the most popular and even within
Google those ones are the most popular
that you'll run across a lot of Google
this is what most of our code is rated
and lastly you're testing your ability
to actually run through a problem find
corner cases and test it before you
submit this is very important as to keep
we'll go over in the next slide is for
the large data set it you only have one
opportunity so you need to make sure
that it really you have the solution
nailed down and you've thought through
every corner case before you go on to
submit yes so I'll just go through how
to like solve problems at kick start so
obviously you have to read the problem
understand write the solution and submit
it but the one important thing in kick
start is that you actually have to solve
the problem in your local machine so you
have to download the input run that
input in your local machine produce the
output and submit both to the output and
your code so and when you download the
input the timer starts so like you have
to like first solve the problem then
actually download the input so there are
two data sets small dataset and large
dataset did for the small data set the
timer time is for four minutes and for
the large data set the times for eight
minutes so one thing I'm also want to
mention here like for each of the
problem if you write a correct solution
to produce the output it will take like
at most one or two seconds so the four
minutes or eight minutes that you are
given data mostly for like downloading
the input like moving it to your
preferred directory and then producing
and then uploading the output and and
for the small data set and one other
difference between the small data set
and alerts data set is that for small
data set after you submit you
immediately get the verdict whether it
was right or wrong and if it was wrong
then you can submit again you will get
some penalty but you can submit it again
but for the large data set you get only
one shot so you submit it you will know
that okay it has been submitted but you
won't know the score you only know the
score after the contest ends so like now
we're going to go through some of the
practice problems
if you have participate in the practice
round some mill this menu that media so
Davis will go to the first problem yeah
so the first problem that we're gonna
look at today is called scrambled
itinerary and there's the link if you
want to follow along this is a previous
problem so the overview of the problem
is that you want to get from City a to
city B and you have several transfer
flights in between so in this example
someone wants to go from San Francisco
to Dallas Dallas to JFK JFK to Toronto
so ultimately you want to get from SFO
to Toronto but there's several hops in
between so the question is if this list
of flight tickets somehow it gets
shuffled can you recreate the original
itinerary so here's a better example
actually Illustrated so we want to fly
from SFO which we'll call the start
location to Toronto which will be the
finish location and these are airport
codes so and there's two stops in
between so with the original list of
flight tickets in the proper sequence so
you can see that you fly from one city
to the next and then you fly from that
city to the novel to the next one until
you reach the final destination
so the assumed they did it get dropped
right and they get shuffled into a
random order
can you recreate the original sequence
so the first way to approach this
problem is to find the high-level
algorithm what approach are you gonna
take and this is probably the same
approach that you use for any sort of
technical question like if you're doing
an interview at Google kickstart is
pretty much the same so the first thing
that we need to do is we need to figure
out this starting location this isn't
given to you and the scrambled tickets
means it could be anywhere so the start
ticket could actually be at the very end
you have no idea then once you know the
start location you want to fly from city
to city using tickets until you reach
the final destination and the actual
output that you need to generate is kind
of like a printed version of each ticket
in the proper order so essentially what
we're gonna do is once you know the
start we're gonna walk the flights all
the way into the end so here's kind of
when you when you hear that problem you
know that each Airport is unique this is
explicitly stated in the problem so you
won't visit them more than once and we
know from the way the problem is laid
out that we need a quick way to look up
which Airport connects to which and so
this day this
problems should kind of immediately
bring to mind a hashmap because this
this is kind of a very common data
structure that you will use in a lot of
problems and this one is a very natural
fit for this problem in particular so
it's very easy to map from a source to a
destination city giving you a constant
lookup when you want to reference you
know the source city to the destination
city when you're actually traveling and
as we'll see in the next slide is also
useful for finding the starting location
and again this is just a possible
solution that we came up with there's
actually many solutions to the problem
and one isn't necessarily better than
the other it may be more efficient but
if the other solution solves it then
that's still fine so for finding the
starting location we want to do this in
linear time so if we create a hash map
from the airport code to the arrival
count then we'll iterate the ticket list
in every single time we find a ticket
we'll increment the city count that
appears as the destination so at the end
you'll see that this starting location
is the only entry in the list with zero
arrivals so this is a way where we can
scan over the ticket list and then scan
it again and we find the one entry and
that's your starting location so that
would be linear time and then for
actually walking the ticket list again
we kind of want to do this in linear
time and we're gonna use another hash
map or you could use the same one and
just store both of these it's up to you
so if we have shown that we have a hash
map from the source to the destination
for each of the flights and we know the
starting location which is in red so
we'll start at SFO and then we look up
what is the current destination we're
flying to Dallas
so we print that ticket the San
Francisco to Dallas and then we move the
current city to Dallas and then we
repeat step two so now Dallas is the
current city we see where we're flying
to JFK we print that and we go all the
way onto the end and at the very last
one when we're in Toronto there is no
entry in the hash map so we know we've
finished so at this point you've printed
the full itinerary and you're done so
here's an example solution it's not the
best I wrote it so there's many
different solutions that exist again
this solution is nice because it's
fairly efficient it runs in linear time
but if you actually read the problem the
large data set and the small data set
aren't terribly large so you can
actually probably get away with an N
square
solution ultimately any solution that
works can still get you points this is
just an example solution so that problem
was fairly straightforward right just a
hashmap so saqib is actually gonna run
through a more complex problem something
that will be worth more points skip yeah
so for this problem I'll expose give you
the expansion of the problem so for this
problem an infinite sequence of binary
strings are given binary means the
character are either 0 or 1 so the first
string s1 that's a string which has only
the character 0 then and for all the
later stream we can produce debt from
the previous screen so the rule is
something like this this n equal please
is n minus 1 plus 0 and plus switch and
reverse of SN minus 1 I'll go to more
detail what the sweet and reverse means
so this infinite sequence is given like
from this rule we can produce s 2 s 3 S
5 and all now we have to find a ket
character of the is Google so Google is
a number which is 10 to the power
hundred it's such a large number it's
hard to imagine so we have to find the
ket character of Google K will be given
as input for the small data set K is
less than equal to 10 to the power 5 and
for the large data set case let me
conduct into deeper it game so I will
just explain the rule a bit more here so
suppose s 2 is 0 0 1 now how can we
produce is 3 so 4 is 3 it will be x2
then we're gonna add 0 then we are going
to switch inverse s 2 so reversing is to
means reverse single 0 0 1 so if we
reverse 0 0 1 that becomes 1 0 0 then we
have to switch 1 0 0 switching means is
flipping here so we will just turn every
0 to 1 and every one to 0 so switching
of 1 0 0 becomes 0 1 1 so adding double
we get the s 3 is 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 so this
is pretty basic simulation and pretty
basic basic coding to generate but even
for the small data set solution we have
to find a kid school of the is Google so
that's a huge number so we can just
simulated everything we
to have an observation the first of the
reason is dead the prefix of the string
never changes
so from s 3 to s 4 suppose we just add
some strings at the little clasp at the
letter positions the initial things are
like the same so the initial part of the
string they actually never changes so if
we need to find something suppose if you
need to find the 6 character of is
Google we don't need to produce is
Google even if you just look at the 6
character of is 3 then that's on for us
because suppose the 6 character of s 3
is same as in the sixth character of s
for 6 character of s 5 and that's all so
the observation is dead we actually the
first part of the string always remains
same so for the small data set solution
where K is less than equal to 10 to the
power 5 so we can continue to generate
the string and terminate whenever this
tree has reached the length K suppose if
we need to find a sixth character we
just we at first we assume we have a s
which is 0 then we produce the next
guess then we produce the next s we
don't need to take actual which index of
the spring that is just whenever the
stream reaches K we just terminate and
output it s K is less than 10 to the
power 5 this the problems complexity is
also 10 to the power 5 which is like
fine
you can easily run it in way less than 1
seconds now to solve it for the large
data set solution for the Nerds data set
the K is 10 to the power 8 so that's a
huge number so if we run a solution like
the previous one that will not give us
the answer in like 8 minutes or in one
hour so for this problem for this
version of this problem we need another
observation these observation is that
see the length grows very rapidly the
length is actually grows exponentially
here so length is 2 into the previous
length plus 1 so if you calculate it you
can easily calculate it writing at least
one or two thank or the S 64 is larger
than 10 to the power 18 so if we need to
find any ket character of his Google we
can just search for s 64 to get
character is 64 because K is less than
equal to 10 to the power 18 and
sixty-four that is already 10 to the
power 18 and then there is another very
important observation like each
character of SN directly depends on a
previous character so even if we need to
find any kit of is 64 we cannot generate
that is 64 because that's also huge 10
to the power 18 so we have to have this
idea that every character of this tree
is directly dependent on another
character of the previous clip so I'll
just talk a bit more about it suppose is
2 is 0 0 1 then how can we generate
history the initial part of history is
also 0 0 1 so the first character is 3
comes directly from the first character
of s 2 and the same as for the second
and third character then for the fourth
character the middle character that's
always 0 then for the letter 3 character
they also come directly from the another
character of these two and just by
switching it so they are all directly
depend on a previous character so from
this relation we can actually write a
recursive function to find the cat
character we don't need to actually
generate the screen because K is 10 to
the power 18 we can generate the whole
string but from this idea we can get a
recursive function which will find us
the cat character of the string so I'll
just write the pseudocode here this is
just giving the glimpse of the solution
there are obviously other way to write
it
suppose we can write up like a function
get value which will find a ket
character of SN and after reading the
input we will call this get value
function with parameter as 64 and K now
when n is equal to 1 that's the
terminating condition we return 0 if K
is the middle element of SN because we
know the length of we can easily
calculate it we also return 0 and if K
is less than half of the length just we
just find this value from the previous
string so we can call get value n minus
1 and K and we can also write another
equation for the for the part of the
later part of the string because in
every call you know you see that n is
decreasing by 1 so even for colleague 64
and K this function will be called
most six to four times so the main part
of this code is pretty small the input
looks huge but the solution of this
problem is like one of the smallest
solution you can ever find so yeah so
we've run through a couple of example
problems and those are actually pretty
good represent representations for what
you would find of kind of like a middle
of the line question leading up to a
more advanced question so when to wrap
things up before we take questions again
why would you want to participate in
kickstart and the first and most
important one is that it's a very good
glimpse into the actual skills that you
need for not only a technical career at
Google but a lot of other companies or
other competitions it's just a very core
set of skills that you can use as for
any sort of software thing that you want
to do second you get acquainted with
coding competitions I highly recommend
getting involved in coding competitions
they're a lot of fun and they do a
really good job of giving you questions
that you may have not seen before or
stressing you to you know come up with a
really clever solution in a short and a
short amount of time and so that's
something that you don't always run into
in day-to-day work and so it's pretty
exciting and I think it's worthwhile and
then the last and most important thing
is that it's a fun way to develop your
coding skills and ultimately we want
everyone to have fun and as Sookie
mentioned this is open for everyone and
we have a lot of questions ranging from
a lot of difficulties so anyone can kind
of get started and I highly recommend it
okay so now we're gonna actually jump to
questions so if you have a question
please just comment in the chat and
we'll we'll take it up and we'll read it
so the first question that we have how
related is actual software engineering
at Google to these kind of contests the
actual engineering itself isn't quite
the exact same but the tools and the
skills that you use during these
competitions are actively used at Google
so you know in that previous question it
was about like a recursive solution yeah
that problem doesn't make sense within
Google I'm not gonna run into that but
that's skill that recursion or you know
properly using hash maps at the right
time that's something we'll run into
almost every day Google yeah
like and also to add more like for these
competitions you have to write the
optimal solution you have to think about
that time and the memory complexity and
you have to like test the code which is
this exact same thing we also need to be
here in Google so yeah these types of
problems are really basic ground for
like ap engineering Computer Engineering
problems yeah so um good question second
question what are the best books to me
to prepare for kick study we were
actually discussing this right before I
think again it is I mentioned in my
slide earlier the bread and butter that
you'll run into not only in kick start
but also just in any sort of technical
interview is data structure and
algorithm and so I believe it's the the
data structure and algorithm by with a
corner yeah yeah and so I mean they've
got it the CLRS yeah I don't know right
there's the area so that's a really good
book and I highly recommend you read it
a lot of university programs or any sort
of classes that you may take usually in
like freshmen or sophomore will use this
book as a resource and I highly
recommend it for the data search can
help also more about it
so for the kick start all the problems
are like just completely basic algorithm
in data structures you need so kick
start problems and design feature for
any computer enthusiasts it's not that
you have to be a comparison spirits this
you have to know some basic data
structure and fill them so you can go to
any basic or introductory data structure
and go in boots that you love this we
think you okay yeah or the extra edges
so next question our programs also
judged on space complexity so not
directly it's not like we're gonna crack
open your code and look at it and be
like oh you had a N squared solution
instead of mine and solution minus 10
points that doesn't really matter but
the pro but implicitly it does matter
because if your program or if your final
code is inefficient or it starts blowing
up and taking all the RAM that you
possibly have on your machine then you
may not be able to actually get a
solution so we don't grade you on you
know space complexity but it is
something that you need to keep in mind
it's very important next question what
graph algorithms should I know that
would help me during the contest
um I think really busy plotting rhythms
like I keep doing the DFS Beerfest and
wind on the shortest paths
I like enough like they're a pretty
complicated graph I'm going to but I
think you need it for keep study yeah at
least not for most of the problems there
may be one where it is like the perfect
solution but again you don't have to
find the perfect solution you just have
to find a solution that works in the
time allotted and gives you a question
another question what is the best
solution for problem deep sum of sums
for a large data set I can talk a bit
about them so this is a I like an like
an advanced questioned advanced kind of
question they communicate in like
kickstart so like for this problem like
because this expense will be so long
that's what we didn't give you see here
but for this problem you need to have
some knowledge about like some binary
search you have to some idea about like
a continuous some and you take a query
and sub where is some kind of stuff so
the one thing that you can go through
that problem and see honest people
solution whether like this is suitable
for you or maybe you need to pass up
more about some basic calculations like
binary search and other stuff yeah
infrareds I believe that question was
referring to question D in the yeah
practice round D and the APAC so if
there is a link in the description if
you follow that you can find really
useful resources like that so next
question is there a way to know who is
gonna be similar to other coding
competitions yeah obviously like in your
like
contest homepage in the bottom left you
see the top 10 school but of the top 10
performer you can see and there is also
another leaf on this scoreboard going
here you can see the all the details
coordinates is obviously you know like
who is in the top and they are in the
top you going through which questions
one more thing I want to mention here
that when segment somebody submit alerts
in dataset solution the scoreboard
assumes that the solution is correct and
create a score good based on them but
that question can be wrong and so that's
called what can change after the contest
please but here but generally you get an
the thought and solve problems are
solved more than others
so next question how do you keep up
motivation and competitive program I
have been dabbling with it for the past
year but many times lose motivation to
keep going on I guess this is just in
general you need to find ways to kind of
make it fun for you you know what do you
like what part of it do you enjoy is it
you really love to to be only to that
time crunch to be able to like try and
solve these problems is it that you just
love finding new problems and you love
doing it a lot of Engineers at Google we
really enjoy just sometimes sitting down
and being like I have a new interview
problem or a new interview question that
I just came up with can you all test it
out for me
before I put it on an actual candidate
so I think it's kind of trying and find
what you enjoy about the competition and
really focusing on that
you know the most motivating part is the
fun activity that yeah but if you are
not getting the fun at the beginning
that's the most difficult part but once
you get the fun fun easily yeah you
don't have to think about it the world
you love to me to be motivated so next
question how do you develop the skills
for finding the corner test cases this
one's more of like an acquired skill I
always tell people that programming is
just years and years of experience so
the more problems that you do you kind
of figure out natural corner faces you
know you see a problem and you're like
oh if you pass an empty string that's
gonna blink right so practice is one and
again highly recommend just practicing
all the time in doing problems but then
also just actually delving into like
what are the odd cases imagine there's a
user who can do absolutely anything what
would they do and kind of run through
that yes up wasn't it in the wrong way
you will do a mistake and after the
contest ends you find out that was a
mistake and you would go down in the
scoreboard and from then you will learn
that you never forget it yeah practice
practice and practice gets down d3 yeah
what graph algorithms should I know it
would help me turn the contest so we
kind of covered this a bit with the
keeps previous answer that first search
breadth first search shortest paths are
the three core ones then you'll really
need to use there are more complex ones
and they're really interesting
I only read them just for fun if nothing
else but as for the actual problems
usually it'll only trust those today so
next question any website you would like
to suggest us to occur at the data
structure I well one we do have the link
in the description to kickstart and from
there you can actually go to a bunch of
example problems and you can actually
look at people's example solutions and
that can give you a really Meccan
bootstrap you for liking what kind of
solutions are people actually using as
far as data structures I think just
searching for data structures into
Google yeah
is it kind of a really good first up
there's a lot of really great resources
out there they even Wikipedia is a very
good resource for just going into the
data structure the logic behind it why
it's chosen what are the trade-offs all
these works appendix B okay so on the
next question what is the difference and
difficulty regarding cogent competition
are the problems similar to those asked
in round three or other rounds so I
think that the problems at Kickstarter
and like more introductory level until
if you compare with code Jam it's able
and the qualification round on the first
few problems of the round one I don't
think you will see me down three problem
approach German kids fair yeah so they
are more like introductory level if you
completely culture okay and so we have
our last question before you leave ah so
what are common libraries data
structures and algorithms are used so
again we keep on hitting it but it
really is important that any fraction
algorithms are the toolkits that you'll
use in any sort of programming tasks so
the basic data structure is like hash
sites maps moving all the way up to
graphs and trees those are just very
common and you should be able to use
them pretty fluent as for libraries
there are a couple of actually
Kickstarter coding competition libraries
that people will recommend that kind of
give you like a core base set of things
that you do all the time in the coding
competitions yeah I can gradually make
really like on more and more really like
create a set of libraries for your only
personal use that will be like reference
from
there is one big popular stand for like
doing there lots of cones and stuff so
you will go out one library of your own
yeah yeah and it's a good thing you
mentioned collecting your own so I like
me personally I have a whole directory
full of just code snippets that I keep
all the time and it's a really good
resource for saving things that you that
you've learned and kind of building up
your own library of life these are
questions that I've solved can I apply
them to you guys
yeah maybe you would suddenly you like
download some other participant solution
from the kickstart and maybe you love
that code so much you like including you
