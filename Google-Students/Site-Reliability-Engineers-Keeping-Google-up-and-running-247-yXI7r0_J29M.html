Google students hangout on air about
site reliability engineering my name is
Andrew Widdowson I've worked here at
Google as an SRE for the last six years
specializing in web search and I came to
here from Carnegie Mellon University I'm
joined by a panel of sres who are very
excited to share with you a little bit
about what sre is all about we'll start
off with introductions from Leslie hi my
name is Leslie Cheung I've been an s3 at
Google for over three years now I work
on the main web server it's the front
end for all of your search results and
your home page and my alma mater was
from UCLA Thank You Leslie Nina hi
everyone I'm Tina bet sir I'm an ads
quality sre in the Pittsburgh office I
actually work on the system that
automatically decides which ads should
be shown to users and this is one of the
largest machine learning deployments in
production I've been a full time as a
recent I graduated MIT in July and I've
been the software engineering intern at
Google before that very cool and last
but not least Karen hi my name is Erin
Joyner I come to Google from a less
traditional computer science background
more from a music performance background
at the IT industry writ large I've been
here for about seven and a half years
now and I work down in the bowels of the
Google infrastructure working on the
building blocks that keep all of the
wonderful services we run able to scale
to the size they do very cool indeed all
right so what we're going to do today is
we're going to talk about some of the
most common questions and answer those
questions that we get about SRE
let's go ahead and start off site
reliability engineering what the heck
does that mean I think it means
different things to different folks so
I'd like to get a take from let's start
with Leslie yeah so site reliability
engineering is about balance so so a big
production service has the kind of two
things that are going on there's the
reliability aspect you don't want this
service to go down you want to be
available to your users at all times and
at the same time you also want to be
able to push out new features you know
that that newfangled feature that is
going to serve our users better and the
thing is these are sometimes seen as
two forces that are colliding and the
SOE role is about trying to make those
things work together that way we can
push out you know new features in a
reliable way
you know we want to be able to make
changes but make sure that we're still
serving our users absolutely right
Leslie I think that site reliability
engineering is definitely a it enables
both agility and stability in our
approach right so these are these are
not two sides of the same coin they are
in fact constructive positives right so
for another take then on what site
reliability engineering is Deena Thanks
I also think of being an SRO Ria's being
a paramedic for production issues as a
person who carries the pager were the
first responders when something goes
wrong in the system so part of that is
being responsible for triaging the issue
seeing how severe it is is it actually
something that's harming live users or
is it something that we can deal with on
our own that users will never see so
being able to see how serious an issue
is and getting in touch with the right
people who can solve an issue is really
important absolutely you know I like to
think of site reliability engineering
kind of as a as a fun mix I I think of
it as equal parts cloud mechanic and
system scientists but that's just my own
hyperbole we'll find out more about this
as we go so next up let me just go ahead
and take care of the elephant in the
room a lot of folks assume that site
reliability engineering is just some
fancy-pants term for a heavy duty
operations role but the reality is it's
quite different than that it is both
operations and it's also software
engineering development and planet-scale
science and engineering so let's get a
little bit more of a sense for that I'm
going to send this over to Aaron who has
some points to make yeah so I guess
essentially we're we're trying to fear
at you know what what do we do in terms
of being able to scale the systems we
run so clarify again for me I'm sorry
yeah sure so is SRA just some fancy ops
role or how do we
right sorry so essentially my background
is in the ops world so I spent many
years in the operational trenches if you
will and the nice thing about being here
at Google is that we we really don't
just run around and push buttons in
production that it's our job to figure
out how to find those issues that we
have yeah on those issues that we run
across from time to time and ultimately
as we were saying earlier automate
ourselves out of a job
so the ability to take whatever the new
exciting thing that's happened today is
and turn that into a way that we can
prevent that from ever happening again
absolutely Thank You Erin and Leslie
what's your take on this yeah as Erin
was saying you know we were not
interested in handling the burning
building that you know sometimes if a
service is were burdened down by a lot
of things that are going on like let's
say we have to move jobs from the
machine or restart a machine and that's
not what we're interested in at all
you know that may come up come about
from time to time but the real interest
that we have in is identifying ways that
failure scenarios things that can go
wrong and figure out how you can design
solutions that either fix themselves so
we don't even get woken up in the middle
of night for these problems or just
handle themselves transparently you know
they're by design if something fails
they'll still continue working and and
we don't have to worry so much about it
and that's where the real kind of
engineering part of the sisters there's
a reason why it's called site
reliability engineering because we're
actually engineering solutions in the
long term to to make our own lives
easier and whether that frees up our own
time you know we say automate ourselves
out of a job but that doesn't mean that
you know we're not going to have a job
because there's always a longer term you
know big picture things that we have to
think about and new features that we
need to work with in order to make sure
they roll out reliably absolutely you
know I like to think of the fact that
this automate ourselves out of a job
thing as being able to do more with even
more right to use to use a silly analogy
right in a lot of Ops work it's a lot of
repetitive kind of banal barnacle
scrubbing and who wants to just scrub
barnacles on the ship you want to be
able to steer that ship right
so we at Google we are lucky enough to
have some fantastic infrastructure that
takes care of a lot of the mundane and
the repetitive and we build from that so
some pretty good stuff right and we're
using our own science and engineering
principles to to go levels beyond that
so cool all right now of course we have
the traditional software engineering
role here at Google
many s eries and software engineers are
working together every day so what I
want to know is is there a crossover
between the two roles
what sort of collaborations exist and
will will send this right back to you
Leslie yeah so I mean just to kind of
preface this I was hired as a software
engineer at Google and then you know
before just before I started s series
the they called me and said hey would
you like to join our organization and
this kind of shows that s3 is pulling in
software engineering talent in order to
make sure that they've got the the
knowledge there in order to design the
solutions that make our systems reliable
we definitely will do consultations with
software dev groups on new features
making sure that you know we've seen the
failures that have occurred in
production before we've learned from a
lot of mistakes and there's always still
new mistakes to be made new learning
things and s-series are right there
responding on these incidents so we have
a lot of knowledge and we also
understand the software systems that are
being deployed and we can work with
developers to make sure that these
things get rolled out in a good fashion
absolutely and you know what's your take
yeah absolutely everything that Leslie
says is a hundred percent true I think
that srvs work with software engineers
along every step of the way and that
includes when they're working on a new
push of a new binary and an example of
this is just last week when I was on
call one of the developers on that as
quality infrastructure team was making
an improvement to the system to support
and replacing a component and as the on
call I was responsible for making sure
that as he was doing the push that
everything was proceeding smoothly and
there was no unexpected alerts this
whole time we're working very closely
together and making
sure that the push is a success so I
like to think of this as the sres and
the squeeze are working together just
like Mario and Luigi work together to
save princess that's absolutely what
we're doing here now thank you for that
Lesley and inna I'd like to just mention
for all of those of you who are
following along through our Google+
hangout on air if you have questions
about the site reliability engineering
role which we're discussing today here
at Google students you can tag a
question to us use the hash tag sre
hangout
that's no dashes no spaces hag s re
hangout okay we'll take some questions a
little bit later on all right so I'd
like to to mention some of the the ways
that I feel S aureus and software
engineers engage with each other so I
spend a lot of my time for Google web
search doing proactive sorts of things
right sre roles are often an equal mix
of proactive and reactive work what I'm
trying to do is kind of get out ahead of
new exciting features in web search and
so one of the perks of the job is I get
to see where web search is going next I
know you're going to enjoy the next
several months of Google's search
evolution but so when I'm meeting with
software engineers who are excited to
deploy these features right I'm having
conversations with them to make sure
that their designs are the best they can
be so that they'll scale to the sort of
challenges that we have right you know a
common conversation between myself and
another developer might be something
like well how many users do you think
your feature can support on our
infrastructure 100,000 users okay well
what if you have 10 million users right
where are the bottlenecks where are the
slowdowns where are the things that
you'll need to scale and how can we make
sure that we do this right the first
time so that on opening day you have the
least eventful infrastructurally sort of
launch that you can have so having seen
the different failures in the different
sorts of ways that software can explode
here at Google in our very
fault-tolerant systems I'm able to share
that experience with folks who are maybe
writing a feature for the first time or
writing a feature that's ten times as
large as they've ever written right
that's the sort of value that sre can
bring to the software engineering
organization working in tandem with them
okay so that was kind of my parting
comment for that question so um let's
let's see if we've established then how
SaaS and
software engineers work together how did
the scope of sre work and software
engineering work differ let's go back to
you Dina right so Sree is our software
engineers they're working on our live
production software so one thing that s
eries focus on is that everything they
work on has to do with production code
so they might be working on monitoring
code or instrumentation figuring out how
things will run when it actually goes
live on our network so one of the things
that we've been saying repeatedly as we
write things to automate ourselves out
of job when we do this we try to take
the pain points that we currently see
and make sure that they never happen
again
so while developers may focus most on
just making their software work we make
sure that those software works on tons
of machines spread across many many data
centers around the world
absolutely and Aaron what do you think
so
like Dena I certainly think we spend a
lot of time working on the monitoring
and production infrastructure aspects
more focusing on things like the ability
to if a developer comes to us saying
we're going to launch this new feature
we're going to launch this new small
product or even large planetary scale
things like web search that we've had a
chance in advance to put in place the
tools that are going to be able to allow
them to do that productively and large
portions of our lower-level
infrastructure written directly by the
suv's from the monitoring
infrastructures and the the frameworks
that make that easy to do to the rollout
infrastructures to be able to build
systems so you can deploy that software
easily to our squint ilion's of machines
and production it's really that that
scale that I think is is the the
familiarity with the production scale is
is the key differentiator absolutely and
we're really lucky here at Google to
have code that's highly instrumented
very scalable in its base sort of
library basis being able to navigate
through the the large grid scheduling
system that we have at Google is I count
myself lucky to be able to do that so
just a part of a part of every day job
at a site reliability engineering okay
so so we have these site reliability
engineers we've talked a bit about what
they do but for which
teams do they do what they do right do
do Google s3 work on certain products do
they work on all products do all Google
teams have an SRE working on things how
does this exactly work and we'll go back
to you Aaron for that so for my part
I've spent the last probably a three or
four years mostly taking stuff where
that did not currently have s3 support
and helping bootstrap it and get it up
to the standards where we're willing to
have an s3 support it so this might make
you wonder who ran it before that
typically when new software is
introduced by a developer it's run by
the developer for at least the first six
months of its production life cycle and
that can include rolling it out to live
users and though we usually do encourage
those developers to have s arrays
involved in helping them get ready and
getting ready to roll out
it is often at a more mature point in
the product life cycle where they've had
a chance to stabilize it and get the
kinks worked out if you will and run a
few hurdles through it themselves where
the S rays then come and help them
really prepare it to be long-term
supportable and of course that's not
throw it over the fence and we run it
from then which is one of the nice
differentiators there yeah so what
Aaron's talking about as far as
bootstrapping a service up to the the
quality standard for sre teams I think
that is a very valid point that's a
crucial time when there's a handoff of
part of the responsibilities for product
into the s3 teams Leslie where do you
want to take this from here I know you
have some thoughts yeah I mean so Aaron
had said that you know we don't start
out when when a new service comes up
it's not staff meet with sre we make
sure that the devs are responsible for
making sure that it's stable and that
they understand some of the common
pitfalls that occur when you're running
in production systems s3 teams are
normally deployed for mission-critical
services or services that you know
Google sees the need for making sure
that we're serving users very reliably
on that service and they'll either work
with the developers to make sure that
this comes up to speed and then we can
we can you know deploy a team of people
who can work with this or once the
project reaches maturity we can actually
have a real team work with it and take
it over complete
and then work with the developers on the
future long-term prospects of that
service absolutely right so it's
interesting to me that that we have the
standards that we do for the SRA
organization I think this actually
separates out a substantially from a
traditional opera operations
organization where it's like here's
here's what you get we're giving this to
you right and in fact most interestingly
enough though sre provides a lot of
value for for production services if we
find that it's not up to our standards
we'll hand it right back to the
developers right so there's a time and a
place for us to get involved and we do
that as a whole team speaking of which
do you know what's your take on which
projects to Google f-series work on
right so sre as a whole really tries to
support organizations with a group of s
eries so one thing that is important to
know is that a small service is unlikely
to get a singleton SRE working for them
because we believe that a group of s
eries working together are much likely
much more likely to have a bigger impact
so for instance sometimes smaller
services are grouped together that's
that a group of SMEs can support all of
those services and collaboratively work
on larger and more complex problems
absolutely cool so it turns out we have
a question from our Google+ hangout on
air audience this question comes from a
UConn one and his question is what kinds
of projects have you guys worked on in
the past Aaron why we start with you so
when I came to Google I guess the first
thing I got handed was our serial
console infrastructure I'd worked on
serial console things before I came here
and and this sort of feeds back into the
the engineering aspect of vesser II I
pretty much with me and a small team as
a couple of people wrote all of the code
many thousands of lines of Python from
scratch to manage integrating a
planetary scale serial console
infrastructure out of the gate and it
was it was quite a challenge from what I
was used to in the past was a lot of fun
I've worked on them what we like to call
well I guess the best way to say it
because
work in the bowels of infrastructure and
things that aren't public facing at that
to choose my words a little careful make
sure we I've worked on on turning up our
new data centers of machines when they
come online so if you have that you can
imagine with large chunks of machines
that we bring on and turn-turn web
search on top of them or Gmail and
various other sundry services and and
automating that process so that it's not
done by a human something that it allows
us to greatly increase our velocity
every time any of those machines is
sitting idle and that's that's dead time
that is literally money ticking away on
the clock so we work very hard to make
that process fast and expedient and
these days us that have worked pretty
much in the bowels of the infrastructure
still so doing things like working on
the system that safely and carefully
rolls out our production Linux image to
all the machines in the fleet you can
imagine that if if we make errors there
that it can be catastrophic ly bad so we
have to be very slow and very careful so
that we don't disrupt the systems
running on top of that such as web
search and G cetera good stuff we all
have a story about things that we've
worked on here for Google SRA I have a
couple I'd like to share so I happen to
I think like Aaron have a background an
appreciation for music and so I jumped
at the chance when we launched a music
related feature on Google web search in
fairness it was only in the Americas at
the time it was a feature where you
could search for an artist album or
track and it would pop up a playing
streaming bit of music the thing was we
weren't hosting that music ourselves we
were hosting it with some external
partners and like any good site
reliability engineer I had to make sure
that the entire and end-user experience
was going to be fast friendly perfect
the first time
so I actually worked with those external
companies to load test them through the
commodity internet we used the same
infrastructure that the Googlebot uses
to to send a representative sample user
traffic and we streamed at tremendous
bandwidth rates over the Internet to
make sure things are going to work
perfectly I've also had the pleasure and
privilege of working on scaling up
Google's encrypted search which we
launched a few years back so if you use
HTTP Google web search myself another
sre and a software engineer work
together in tandem intensely for a
couple of weeks to get that out the door
in a timely manner so privacy and
freedom of information being what it is
was very proud
as a Googler and as an individual to be
able to launch that feature couldn't
have happened without sre so those are
some ideas of some things that we worked
on and thank you you can't for asking
that question if other folks have
questions you can tag us at tag s re
hangout on Google+ okay so coming up
next another question that that many
people ask is what does a typical day
look like for sre what are some of the
typical problems you face and the answer
is there really is no such thing as a
typical day for SRA in fact that quite
frankly hits the nail on the head it
turns out that as an SRE you are a jack
or Jill of all trades right you work
across multiple teams your challenge is
adapt on a daily basis where perhaps a
traditional software engineer may be
working on the one feature that they are
going to launch this quarter or this
month or the one or two features right
sre are moving within several different
demands doing the reactive consulting
excuse me the proactive consulting we
mentioned is something going to scale or
spending their own amount of time being
in an on-call rotation some of the more
reactive stuff meetings with developers
meetings with their teammates to get
stuff done right so in my particular
case just as the example that I'll take
for this question I spend about 20% of
my time in meetings keeping track of
what's coming up communicating changes
to folks making sure everyone's on board
I spend about another 20% of my time as
a senior oh sorry here at Google
teaching newer SRE how to be a good
on-call engineer how to do the
diagnostics and sorts of things that we
do right I spend maybe another 40
percent of my time writing code as a
software engineer I'm the tech lead of a
project that prevents abuse against web
search denial of service attacks people
who want to unfairly copy our search
results that sort of thing
and the remainder of my time is spent
you know occasionally serving shifts in
our on-call rotation right so that's a
that's a typical day or an atypical day
and SRA you never know quite what you're
going to get so we just want to make
sure we covered that topic now another
topic that people particularly have
questions about is what's it like to be
on call at Google right what happens if
you get paged and you're dealing with an
emergency alert
and I will send this off to Aaron to
leave that answer so I'll start off by
admitting upfront that I'm somewhat of
an on-call junkie I am delighted when
the pager goes off because of the
intellectual puzzle that it often
presents the if being woken up at 2:00
in the morning and having to go fix
something it's really something I thrive
on that said I have to say that at least
for our particular group and I think
this is broadly representative of Essery
they work very hard to make sure that
our pager rotations are not sort of the
meat grinder you might imagine that on
call rotations can be from from some of
the industry that we tended to have very
well established procedures for the
typical things that can go wrong in the
form of play books and and very good and
concise monitoring alerts and making
sure that you don't have a pager that
goes off when it there's no need for a
human to respond to it and getting
getting back into that whole automate
yourself out of a job let the machines
fix it where it's practical for them to
do so so that's that's sort of my take
on it yeah it's it's a lot of fun to
hold a pager but it's really not not
nearly as bad here as it might have
might be elsewhere
so to speak cool that's definitely one
take on things I like the adrenaline
junkie that many of us re are if that's
something that intrigues you take a look
right Leslie I'd like to hear your take
on things yeah when you get an emergency
alert you know maybe you're woken up or
maybe you're just out and about it's
like getting a problem dropped in front
of you it's like a puzzle and you have
to solve it and you know there might be
some time constraints with that as well
it makes a little exciting I think that
when you're on call and you get an alert
you have to kind of you're now the lead
person you're coordinating the effort to
fix it but that doesn't mean that you're
the one person who's who's on call for
this event there are many other
engineers who are also on call that you
can tap into there are other developers
you can you know ask what's going on
they may be experts in a certain part of
the system that you need to look into
and as part of your reverse engineering
effort as you're trying to figure out
what went wrong
you can tap into this vast network of
people so although you might be the lead
on this you're you're never really alone
when you're on call you have a very good
support network
absolutely I'd like to underscore some
of your points Leslie yeah you're fully
supported by Google and Google teams
when you're on call it's kind of
thrilling to think that as the incident
commander for an outage right what you
say goes and is your it is your
responsibility to divine the ultimate
root cause of a problem and and make
sure to see it through all the way til
its completion at the same time right
you have to prioritize circle things
right this is where the excitement and
the puzzle stuff comes in how do we
prevent the breakage that our users
would see right it's actually amazing to
consider that of all the different
things going on at Google there's
brokenness going on every day but
because we design our systems to expect
failure and to route around things much
of it is not seen that being said the
SRS can swoop in and make sure that it
doesn't become a problem of epic
proportions right so that to me is
really fascinating and when I'm on call
to reiterate you know Aaron's point
about the adrenaline of things right
it's absolutely a rush because you're
out there defending our users from
brokenness and making sure that they get
the right results thinking of it less
from an operation standpoint and more
from a scientist and engineer sort of
standpoint right you can imagine that
any Google engineers time is very
valuable but an SRE who's on call even
ee or Tripoli so because of all of the
stuff that's on the line think for a
moment about the hundreds of different
factors that one could imagine that
might contribute to any sort of problem
that we have to Google and and like I
said there are an unlimited number of
these things I like to think of it as
kind of a decision tree or even a search
space of things that we have to consider
before we can find the root cause of a
problem it's my job to take my
experiences and my skills that I've
brought from school from work and figure
out how to prune and navigate through
that search space that I spend my time
most effectively nipping the problem in
the bud and I think that's something
that s re definitely brings to the table
so perhaps a bit more of an insight into
how we deal with emergencies here at
Google but it's definitely part of our
company culture pitch in get done fix
the problem and fight for the user
that's the SOE way and the Google way
okay
so we have another question from our
audience as a reminder you can hashtag s
re hangout if you'd like to contribute
the question from me hi it's adore
is do you make use of machine learning
and artificial intelligence algorithms
for your projects if yes could you
provide an example where such algorithms
have proven useful during your projects
all right I know several of us can
answer to that I'll take a first pass at
this as a matter of fact we use machine
learning and artificial intelligence in
our abuse detection software that we use
here at Google and in fact leading a
team of folks who are doing all sorts of
clustering and analysis to try to figure
out what behaviors for web search are
totally aboveboard
totally normal our users on a variety of
different platforms right versus all
sorts of nefarious behavior that's
trying to attack and shut us down right
it's an interesting arms race and so to
the extent that we can do some of our
pre work by automatic classification or
through learning and supervised systems
we do that and then ultimately we'll
step back and measure and cut again so
it's a definitely exciting thing on the
face of abuse detection I know that
perhaps Aaron would also like to
contribute to this question sure yeah
like I sit down in the in the bowels of
the infrastructure we deal with
literally all of the machines at Google
and so as you can imagine that's that's
a lot of machines in order to keep track
of what's gone wrong with any particular
machine at a point in time we need to be
able to diagnose what that machines
problem isn't be able to fix it quickly
and reliably there's a couple neat
things we do here one of them there's
actually some insight into it in the
paper we've published about hard drive
failure rates a few years ago most of
the information gleaned for that was
done in in applying machine learning to
figuring out what are the signals that
this machine will go bad in time and
that's not something I personally worked
on but something I was closely
associated with and the things I've
personally done for monitoring why the
software on all those machines the sort
of lowest layer of software the actual
production image itself as it rolls out
as we roll out changes to the fleet
things will break and there will be
coincidence coincidental raikage's and
being able to determine the signal from
the noise in that condition can be very
tricky we apply some some neat machine
learning tricks there to make sure that
when we're rolling out a bad change we
can tell the difference from merely some
of those three or four or five nine
events that that happen to fail in
with that little app so as you can
imagine at Google we we do things that
what we've been referring to is a planet
scale right and you can imagine the
different sorts of data sources we have
on everything from machine failures to
you know queries per second coming in
through our border routers or what have
you
it's a tremendous and interesting data
problem for anyone who's interested in
machine learning and artificial
intelligence and having the keys to the
castle to be able to make changes and
then on call sort of capacity also
allows you to spend the time writing
software in that same environment which
is pretty darn cool if I do say so
myself maybe I'm biased alright so we're
going to go on to our next question then
so you know a lot of students ask me a
job and career fairs that we host for
Google what are some of the skills
needed to be an SRE right so in fact one
of our students online here is asked a
question Matthew has asked what is the
typical education level for Nasari which
i think is a good follow-on question so
let's start off Lesley with what are
some of the skills needed to be an SRE
well so you know a lot of people think
that s3 is you need to like and all
these engineering roles you need to have
some type of a CS background then well
that does help that's not necessarily
the only thing that we're looking for
we're also looking for people who can be
assertive when you know a situation you
know needs someone to take a lead on you
need to be able to say you need to be
able to tell people like this is this is
not a good design you need to be able to
have confidence in your knowledge and be
able to assert yourself either in an
emergency situation or even in design
discussions and you'll be able to say no
this is like it may not be the right way
maybe you should look at this this
design because it will be more fault
tolerant you also need to have a good
head for triaging you know you want to
evaluate when a few different problems
come up all at once you want to be able
to weigh which one is the most severe
which one is going to lead to the most
user impact and then attack that problem
and those are skills that aren't
necessarily taught explicitly in formal
education but those are skills that are
really good to have as necessary
absolutely the case mm-hmm so Edina
what's your take on this
yeah I definitely agree with what likely
said I think it's really important in
talking about the kind of work that sre
do to remember
the reactive and proactive kinds of work
so since one of the things we do is
react to pages and other interrupts work
it's important to be able to balance
between our projects as well as the
interrupts work so one of the things
that that can require is being able to
focus on multiple projects at the same
time which is a good skill for s eries
another good skill is being able to
communicate succinctly when you're in
the middle of an outage you want to make
sure that all of the stakeholders and
users of your system know what's going
on every step of the way and that
everything is community communicated
clearly also to respond to the question
what is the typical education level for
Google s re from our audience just on my
team alone there's a wide array of
education levels we have people you know
majored in SIA ts typical we have people
who are masters we also have people who
learned mostly by doing and may not even
have a degree but really it's it's big
it's about what you can do and the
skills that you have that you can bring
to Google absolutely and so to the idea
of skills that we may not have learned
in a classroom as well let's talk about
some of the skills and extra things you
can practice to help put yourself on the
career path for site reliability
engineering Aaron what do you think so
for my two cents I'm probably the least
traditional in that respected that I did
not come from the CS background so I
certainly had to learn it the hard way
if you will myself and so we see in
essary as far as the educational
backgrounds people who did come from the
CS background we end up having to to
help them learn some of those more
operational skill sets you know the if
you're currently a student this probably
is something you could think about as
well to answer your question directly
that any chance you can get to work with
production Linux systems either at home
or if it with your local Linux users
group or at a computer lab at the
university any hands-on exposure you get
to dealing with file systems and dealing
with actual you know lamps tax serving
websites this kind of thing
or very practical skills and ranging the
gamut across into networking as well so
those things are the sort of core
operational skillsets that software
engineers end up having to pick up as
they go not because it's something you
necessarily need on a day-to-day basis
our systems tend to abstract away a lot
of the sort of mundane T of running a
job on the Linux machine in Google but
that's true until they don't right so
when things start to fail their skills
become extremely valuable in the
intuitions that Leslie was talking about
earlier to be able to triage those those
problems as you see them so again you as
far as educational backgrounds that
myself I I came as a conservatory
musician you know I certainly do not
come from the traditional CAS background
so that you you certainly can succeed in
this space on your merits as I think I
was saying earlier that you you can you
can prove that you can do it and that's
really all we're really after is success
over over paperwork if you will
absolutely the case as myself as a more
traditional computer scientist I took it
upon myself to diversify my out of
classroom experience as well right for
example I was the IT manager of sorts at
the campus radio station at Carnegie
Mellon and I also interned with the with
the campus's network engineering and
network development group to kind of get
a whole different perspective for those
of you who are computer science and
electrical and computer engineering
students perhaps out there in variations
thereof obviously you know be solid on
your data structures and algorithms
understand computational complexity and
runtimes understand the fundamentals
really of what makes computer science
computer science but venture out a
little bit to getting that extra
experience with Linux or servers or that
sort of stuff will definitely make you
stand out as far as site reliability
engineering is concerned and the balance
of those two things regardless of which
way you came into SRE is is a great
thing and we will we will build you up
on one if you are less familiar with it
than the other software engineering and
the more traditional systems engineering
roles so with that then I think we have
spent a lot of good time here talking
about this the site reliability
engineering role and I'm so glad we
could take this time to discuss all of
this I'm sure there will be more
questions if you have others please feel
free to continue tagging sre hangouts
on G+ and will help answer some of those
questions for now for myself for Dina
for Aaron and for Leslie my name is
Andrew and thanks so much for attending
our Google students hangout on air about
site reliability engineering for more
information about Google and its job
roles you can visit google.com/students
your portal to hiring at Google and of
course you can also plus us on Google+
that's plus.google.com slash plus Google
