a life-form in the international
conference we're here the world by a
boyfriend Leon's my name is Christophe
test I'm a software engineer of Google's
London office and with me here are
another 10 which research scientists
from the New York office and Slough
petrol for suicides also new york office
anna is actually by the booth at the
exhibition center and be on our way
google has a little booth google search
and slightest joining us from New York
City from the google office tell em i'm
sitting at the undisclosed location in a
nearby hotel where we'll be hosting
tomorrow the google student PhD for this
is exciting this is the first time we
are doing a hangout using publicly it
will live with the insensible i'm anna
is coming to you over the Wi-Fi and
important center I'm internet thing
doing these new Google infrastructure
and there's not a peer-to-peer network
it actually also oddly let us it's
exciting for me I'm respect the time by
backgrounds is lovely um so I hope you
share of excitement about that and let's
go to Anna and ask her I'm did you do
before Google and why did you join
Google hi everyone I'm sure do you hear
me to hear me yes hi everyone I'm gonna
just here actually as kristef said in
the Google booth in the own attending
the dub dub dub conference I joined
Google four years ago as a research
scientist and I came before that I was a
research staff member in IBM Research
mathematical sciences department I after
three years of being in IBM i just
wanted to change and I wanted to see how
it is working for us picnic high tech
company like Google and trying to make
research work over there
thank you thank you and love you for
google Wendy to join and work yeah so
I'm sloth Petra I joined Google about
three years ago I was before that a grad
student at 4k did my PhD there and I was
an intern my second last year and Google
and I really liked it but I wasn't
completely convinced that I want to do
it so I applied for academic positions
that the whole academic job search too
and at the end decided to go to Google
because of the people and the resources
in terms of data and computers were
better for the type of research that I
do so I work on machine learning with
applications to language and natural
language processing and it just seems
like I could do more exciting things
here than anywhere else I can relate to
that my I work for 10 years and we
switch I'm a theoretical physicist by
training i was in computational hi anna
physics high energy physics I don't
drifted off into bioinformatics and
bioinformatics that's biologic image
databases but Ethne it post even closely
to anything that since to what Google
has a scratch look and it's actually a
smaller less science fiction when I
worked outside of it okay we have some
questions on my sheet here um let's just
start first is at Larry Sergey public
roads room about 12 years ago at the
world where that conference it's a core
of what has move made Google a
successful company since then what do
you think what other significant pieces
are for sure goober then maybe stylist
laughs he's on the screen right now
trick um so I mean I think if you have
different people they'll give you
different any different answers here of
just go to the publications page of
Google and you'll see lots of
publications I think under its every
year some of the big ones I think that
everybody now is using our MapReduce
concept big table
Google file system and all the large
scale computing infrastructure but those
are a little old by now in my particular
field google has really pushed the
limits of machine translation and kind
of showing that it's possible to do it
at a large scale with many languages and
with good quality I think speech
recognition is becoming more and more
for reality on our mobile phones and
google has pushing the limits very well
this keeps going like if you look at
computer vision like we have
self-driving cars now there's lots of
contributions so I don't want to pick
favorites but I think everybody is aware
of some in their area yeah i was quite
quite amazed when when i looked at the
poor girl published in the area of like
large data tosevites tickets to say map
reduce how much of the things we do are
actually being published in paper
summarizing every day demo that's
publicly now as we carry it's a it's a
way that allows you to 10 queries
against trillions up the big public most
of what's being used in it has been
structure when it comes to file systems
I'm I worked so long around the
limitations of the classical data center
infrastructure like NFS that it really
feels a bit like working with science
fiction to have all these tools suddenly
available so from here there's probably
DD mostly or thinks thing I found when I
worked as Google infrastructure its
protocol buffers I don't know how many
it's completely public in open source I
don't know how many people outside
actually use it but I've seen how it's
being used inside and has soaked about
half of the problems I had when I worked
in public databases and inviting from
ethics and actually we've linked data
and trading good way of it to
interchange data even it's a very very
small thing but protocol buffer is an
amazing thing if it's used right
okay um let's go to the next question
with the like and with research and
publishing at Google in both honor and
slap out what we call the research I'm
doing Google that's actually not a
strong separation between researchers of
engineering usually basically more
refers to where we were poor too will
strike a balance between engineering and
research at Google em and the question
goes to Anna the machine okay are you
unmuted now yes so the reason to work in
Google is really if you have a passion
for creating and making the real life
impact you will work closely DVD gging
teams and our goal agenda as a research
scientist is to public push our ideas
publish our work and make our research
work basically striking the balance
between engineering and research is up
to each researcher individual is some of
us like more applied work some of us
still lean like in my case towards
building new theoretical concepts but
what is great is that working on it
closely with engineering teams and a
real products help you create or work
optimize and build the theoretical
concepts that are more meaningful or
work under all these various
technological and business constraints
so I think this is what google offers us
I still do collaborate with different
people from outside but basically
working in Google is the most important
part is actually that you can create
these ideas and run them life Thanks
great thank you
I'm plus you want to say a few words
about that I'm sure so I think that's a
common question in it that's a question
that I had myself when I joined Google
and I happen how they define a role and
how did you go on and i have found gone
over the time the best way that it works
for me is not to think about things in
frightening imbalance but to find
problems that are challenging and that
require a new solution because the state
of PR is just not good enough and so at
that point you're trying to solve a
real-world problem that you need to
develop a new a new framework new model
and you implement all the baselines you
compare them and you show that your idea
is better at which point you can
convince the product innovation grant
your solution and then you can sit down
and write up a paper senator conference
and show the research community that
this is a new way of solving that
problem and you don't really need to
think about which part is now research
with parties engineering is all part of
the problem solving and then the goal is
to have impact and impact can meet and
under academic community but also on on
the on google and the best projects are
the one step a cheap boat and because
there's so many open and the problems at
Google it's actually not hard to find
problems it's more traveling to find
solutions okay going thence to the next
question related basically to that but
now basically thinking about student 0
UT student is ending nearing the end of
its thesis what could you do it if you
joined Google what can you do Google
that would be beneficial experience for
anyone who wants to be a well-rounded
researcher and for example even if a PhD
student wants to become professor after
on and normally the academic life why
might he or she consider working at
Google and it's left
um I mean I think coming at it tastes
nicely together with the previous
question one of the sort of limitations
or challenges of academic research is
that your oftentimes have to speculate
what are the important problems in
industry or in the real world and you
you have all the freedom to work on
whatever you want but you want to work
on the things that really matter and
sometimes you don't know it when you're
at the University if you come to Google
you actually get exposure to lots of
these problems that who was trying to
solve and because of the benefit of
google being so big right now is that
every computer science problem is to
some extent relevant to google and you
can see real world applications and so
spending some time at Google you see
where the challenges we are and what is
missing from the current understanding
and how what needs to be done in order
to move things to the next level and the
other thing I think is that there's an
amazing set of people here google from
whom you can learn a lot there's lots of
former professors who decided to
subscribe to google there's actually
lots of visiting professors that then
you have more than 20 visiting faculty
every year walking around the company
and these are tough people from top
universities so just spending a couple
years of Google you can learn from those
people as well and then be better
prepared to start your own research
agenda and to know how to pick the right
problems local yeah I had a feeling when
I joined Google that it probably was the
biggest collection of white people I've
seen so far have been some quite big
institutions and good institutions and
my fields but it's amazing to be able to
work with such a number of people that
you will up so quickly that important
I'm academic life is eid actually become
realized so I just talked to somebody
from the Google Art Project who was
killed in a more at our booth I need
talk isn't you lady
150 views and snow sign up being
available on the web for Ewing was
Bigley done by the free google engineers
at immediately after that would be a
research project in my home country that
puppy would be three year project 60
students that produced a prototype at
the end so Google if you want to do
something interesting and something that
has really relevant for the web develops
it's really good a great place for that
for my perspective and then some sense
computer science um in my opinion I'm
speaking of the three offices my opinion
computer science is an applied science
and it should produce something that's
actually tangible and working it's not
normally we actually have engineering as
a science we first study engineering
study engineering science same thing I
think what we r do is actually great
science and would be bubbly creative
people even if you want to go back to
university and teach and what you learn
Google about actually building real
world wait to teacher and if you think
about teaching that would be a great
opportunity to learn a few things that
you can ditch okay um next question yeah
somebody joining Google as a PhD student
post piece after his speech d the
question will always be collaboration
with academia there's always a question
can we collaborate with academia what
have been your most notable
collaboration with people academia at
Google Anna wanna answer that yes
definitely so first I continued and a
new collaborations with people outside
of Google really emerged since I joined
Google I wouldn't like the differentiate
between my collaboration since I think
each of them was valuable I just think
that they are very very necessary
especially since we collaborate right
with people that work in the areas of
computer science engineering applied
probability busy school me personally
and
all these people really care and strive
to have two new problems and new
approaches to solving them the
collaboration with us or me allows them
to Justin reach their models and to
provide solutions that are more
impactful to publish research ideas
together with us that are going to
change potentially the world to the
better and also through our common
programs and visiting scholarships and
PhD students engagement we help really
advise students through their
collaborations with the advisors we help
students really work and publish more
and have more more impactful papers more
significant contributions in the areas
of engineering and computer science
thanks um I have maybe even a slightly
different perspective of collaborations
outside I used to work in bioinformatics
for an institution that was mostly
service institution and so I got
involved a lot with you keen union
projects in the era of big data and
basically since I left you feel
bioinformatics Institute where was
running a database I have been more and
more involved as a policy in the
research policy so I'm worked as a as an
expert on on an 11 expert rule about
scientific data that wrote a report to
do communion and and sometimes observing
us reviewer for projects or going to
what we call consultations will be
contributed policy decisions in the area
of research and I found that quite
exciting having the opportunity to
actually as a Googler still contribute
to these things which I think are really
important for the scientific future of
Europe good European I thought it never
has been happy in great collaborations
by just people approach in us for
example Wellcome Trust invited in
another Googler to join one of their
conferences
on in database interoperability we talk
to people there we got talking to
somebody from Imperial College and then
we had Tim voting a supporting letter
for his grand and he is very interested
in pocket Google and the outcomes that
people interest was from the research
community can join Google for shorter
time as faculty list obsessed about
actually the opportunities for working
with people outside doing about the same
when I was in academia so we're down now
too too bad since we got from google
moderator see the app interface with
some of the students posted festers
before and the first one only has four
words that's Google do research I'm slap
you want to say something about that
that's Google doing research let's keep
it short yes but now my seriously i
think it is like the discussion
hopefully has made it clear so far that
yes we do a lot of research we work on
problems that nobody knows how to solve
it's not that we just implement the new
button somewhere so a lot of the things
that we do our research and I think
that's shown by the number of papers
that we publish our presence of
conferences not sure how many people are
a dub dub dub from google but i'm sure
there's there's a good number whenever i
go to conferences there's lots of
Googlers depending presenting papers we
have lots of interns who come by and do
great great things here and so I think
that answers purity yes and maybe one
other thing that I should say because
this question is so common and I think
every Google are attending a conference
then sit never going to modify talking
about just the research that people does
we we actually are going to publish a
paper and there's no communications of
AC am this summer I think it's scheduled
to be published at August where we try
to explain Google's research model and
give examples of the type of
research that people serve it varies not
just you don't have to take my word for
it but they'll be actually something
with me explaining how the bull does
research and how it differs from other
research labs because we don't do this
isolated research environment but
they're more integrated with the
products because peeping that that's
actually open up the producers the
better research results okay Anna
anything about that that's Google to
research yes I I believe so I mean is I
I beliefs oh and I am trying to work on
that and as all of my colleagues
everywhere throughout Google offices i
also want to stress the fact that it's
not just the applied research yes we are
integrated but from my own experience i
usually yes collaborate with engineering
things and try to build products but
also i'm oftentimes intrigued by some
new problems in the area and try to see
whether there is a new theoretical
concept that i can build on the top of
it so which is probably maybe we could
someone in google good or so well is not
directly applicable to google products
and applications but this is up to us
what we create so we can as this is one
this is probably also an answer to one
of the previous questions the way to
balance between making an impact and
building some new theoretical concept so
yes i do believe that that we do t
threat here yeah i actually work in an
engineering teams oh I mean in London
and what I found us that nearly all the
design decisions being taken in Google
are scientifically found two people
think about what is the state of the art
in in research and try to build products
or solutions based on that so we are in
the big data area basically a processing
large amounts of data about them of
people watch TV and we're using all
sorts of tools like dremel let MapReduce
that have all been public and enable us
and who
really large amounts of data and from my
perspective there I'm interested in data
science there is a large movement right
now to put things together that stated
data science on solid foundation and how
you work with really large amounts of
data and that's basically what everyday
life at Google right now if you work on
back-end systems and analytics distance
and whenever I've seen design documents
inside Google they're always very very
clearly found that in the state of the
art Naboo storage and I think it's also
reflected that I'm Google I think it's
sort of Google engineers have PhDs we
have people from large variety of
backgrounds but the kind of thing I
found this that are all very much driven
by the state of the art but by data and
by understanding how to do the science
actually should work so I up so we have
one last question from the moderator
it's something that often comes up as a
Google researcher can you collaborate
with external researchers I assume
that's the question of a very many
people from University and we may have
that if they join industry because
non-disclosure and secrecy in that
company and they will be able to do
research but not a publish it which will
then impact the career and Anna would
you like to say something about that yes
we do collaborate and we are encouraged
to collaborate I understand that it
depends on what we collaborate there is
something in that too of course we
cannot disclose the information that is
strictly Google's and that cannot go
public in any form Alamy in terms of the
majority of the data some external
person cannot see a collaborator but
actually but exchanging the knowledge
and co work on research in the common
area is very encouraged this is why we
are offering all these research grants
every year to the people or academicians
with the great research proposal so I
would say
encourage of course even when we publish
our work we go through this clearance
process and the goal is yes create a
research that works create a research
that is generic we are just lucky enough
that we have all this data and we can
experiment with our ideas and that is
basically what to be owned and we cannot
release Thanks okay say something about
that um yeah I mean like I I think
there's a kind of big spectrum of what
the collaboration could be like I've
done the traditional let's write a paper
together type collaboration where we had
some ideas we talked to the conference
and then we actually it was around some
code that was open source so
collaborating actually on the code was
possible sometimes people collaborate
where they made them in something
internally and then people at the
university developed the same code
independently and then me run
experiments on the large-scale data and
ethical and exciting they'll run it on a
smaller scale develop it together write
a paper then there's sometimes
collaborations church needs where people
will talk to a professor at a conference
and say oh like your research is really
where like what we do why don't you send
a student for an internship and we can
collaborate by the student because he
knows what you know and ghouls falls
into the club problems and then you
learn things you'll go back heel kitchen
spoons lights and then you write a paper
again with the professor and the
students and then they're more
responsive collaboration like these
research grants that animations where we
fund research that is carried out at the
university but in close contact with
with a researcher Google who give
suggestions and ideas and tries to
influence that the research that way and
vice versa complete ideas from from
academia all the time and try to see
whether they scale up to all of values
and then go back and say well
word but this didn't like writing
there's a quite bi-directional
communication going on yeah i also i
wrote a piece in major methods shortly
didn't formally shortly after joint and
when I realized that of course being at
Google I have to get permission for that
how the great thing was the permission
came back in basically like eight hours
after sandy Emma was just a short email
coming back from research director New
York saying that touches nothing that is
google internal I'm ready for
publication that was actually simpler
and getting out things in most academic
plays desired worked um okay so we had
its 459 p.m. in Leon at the World Wide
Web 2012 conferenced we made it to a 30
minute hang out with only a zinger about
over the public Internet um would like
to thank everybody who tuned in thanks
Ananse laughs and probably I should say
everybody will tune in hope to see them
again I'm sure there will be other
hangouts from google search and thank
you very much thank you all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
