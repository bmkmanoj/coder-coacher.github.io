well welcome to another stem women
hangout on air and today we are joined
by Aaron and Sam from the Google IT RP
program which stands for information
technology residency program so let's
dive right in and um talk to Aaron first
Aaron your background is in IT support
and you're now the manager of itrp can
you tell us a bit what itrp is and how
it works
sure hi I'm Aaron um my spaghetti said
I'm one of the I see a residency program
managers and based out of Ann Arbor
Michigan and I've been managing
technician to run this role for about
three years and I hope to start the
remote support branch of this program
just has some background I started as an
IT support technician here in Ann Arbor
so I've been in the IT field for about
seven years and working at Google for
that Islam so just to get you some
background on itrp it is a 26 month
fixed term rotation program based out of
Maui California New York City Dublin and
also Ann Arbor Michigan and sydney
australia it is an immersion program
into ite and providing a deep foundation
to jumpstart people's Itt careers our
mission is to provide an active
exceptional level of support to Google
employees and to empower the next
generation of IT professionals it
provides opportunities for travels and
from working with other teams we've
built in structured training and
residents are educated by industry
experts who are already working here to
get up to speed quickly there are two
tracks so the first track is field tech
resident instead of Mountain View New
York and Dublin they focus on in-person
support in some of our largest offices
in this role residents will act as
liaisons between technical and
non-technical groups they support Google
infrastructure and internal services
they have to long-term rotations one
will be in another Google office for
three months US or abroad learning and
supporting local infrastructure and
voice and also a three-month rotation
with another operations team so that
might include networking development
site reliability engineering and systems
administration the second track is the
corporate support technician
as Ann Arbor and Sydney and in this role
residents focused on remote global
support his residents exposure to a lot
of different different range of issues
for all Google employees across the
world they're in a really unique
position to analyze all the incoming
global support requests and just sort of
see trends and understand what's going
on globally and they also are given the
opportunity to rotate with other teams
travel to other offices and spend some
time working the film across the world
that sounds really cool the travel
capabilities as otakus we were talking
to you just before we went on air and
you're telling us about all the places
you've been to us or anything that's
really exciting
yeah the travel definitely felt it for a
lot of the people on my team you know
the opportunity to go visit Sydney
Australia or to go to Dublin you could
work in New York for a week back nothing
so then you've actually come up through
the program and you're now working as an
engineer at Google what are some of the
projects you've been able to work on
while I'm at Google through the ITR
program yeah so I also give my little
background feel so I came to Google
right out of college I attended UC
Berkeley for my undergrad and studied
computer science and jumped right into
the idea as an IT program I could go on
Mountain View and yeah I've been about
it I've been at Google for now almost
almost two years but that's the first 18
months of my time at Google in the
program yeah so while I was in the
program I worked on a variety of for
software engineering oriented projects I
helped build some tools that we use
internally within our own organization
at Google and help make the life of all
my co-workers that you supported Google
at easier I'm helping to manage some of
the some of the travel there's one
example that Aaron was talking about
helping to also make it easier to
coordinate all the different support
efforts that we have in our various
offices and then also as Aaron mentioned
part of the program is a is the rotation
on a different team and so for
that I actually rotated to the team by
now and permanently on which is the
Gmail front-end site reliability
engineering team where I'm a software
engineer so while I was in the ITSs
program I spent a quarter with them and
I helped tackle some of their
operational workload that goes with
running a large google scale production
service and I also helped with various
yeah a lot of operational projects but
also some some top engineering and
cutting projects that I've gotten to
continue working on and then throughout
the rest of my time in the ITR program
and then as I tried to change into that
role hole it's really clean had the
experience sorry
buddhini of go ahead and sort of
unpacking and fun and projects yeah yeah
it really was a it was a working doing
doing software development in the ITU as
an IC program kind of things were not is
it it operates a little bit differently
than the user facing products that could
go build but it also gave me a lot more
leeway to kind of work on different
pieces of these tools and get exposure
to a lot of different ways of doing web
application development that was really
cool yeah and something to say that set
in the ice residency program on text
work on a lot of different things you
know not just development projects
there's all kinds of different things
and I actually also manage our internal
documentation systems and so I have a
lot of residents who work on my team to
help write our user-facing technical
documentation that helps solve your own
problems so you don't have to call tech
support which is a big time-saver for
the Googlers and so Google in general
but I mean there's a wide variety of
different projects that people work on
anything from automation to doing things
like writing rules to help automate have
tickets internal support requests get
routed from one team to another which
the most part really isn't from a
development perspective coding it's just
manipulating rules to make sure that
things get sent to the right place
there's been a lot of really cool
projects that come out of itrp
and people with all different
backgrounds have worked on them it's
awesome so
our residents able to choose these
different projects so is that a sign I'm
just curious about you Sam
uh yeah so it's definitely residents are
kind of it's not really
handed to you a project isn't handed to
it's more that once you kind of get
settled into how the organization works
and you get familiar with your
day-to-day expectations you tend to hear
about other projects that are
interesting and things that you would
like to help work on and because the ITR
program is geared towards new grads who
are still kind of figuring out what they
want to do after the I terrorism is a
program um there's a lot of expectation
and opportunities for you to kind of try
out different types of projects and see
how Google operates beyond just beyond
beyond just kind of core support
directly for Googlers and kind of more
behind the scenes somewhat like some of
the other areas that people work on our
networking infrastructures from security
projects a lot of event support
audio-visual stuff there are a lot of
different teams that that new things for
kind of to make Google run effectively
yeah be on first line support and and
definitely those teams are have a lot of
ideas that have gone and work on
projects with them so if you could speak
personally how how do you feel you have
benefited personally from being a part
of itrp yeah so as I said this was my
first job outside of or after college
and it was also my first real exposure
to working in the tech industry I didn't
do I didn't do internships outside of I
worked at my university support
organization
while I was in college but I didn't work
for any industry while while I was in
school this is my first exposure to kind
of at the tech industry and being able
to jump into that jump into Google right
out of school was really really
beneficial um in in a couple ways it
gave me a really it gave me a lot of
ways to kind of figure out how I wanted
to proceed after the
for them and what I wanted my career
what direction I wanted like to take my
career after the program and kind of
allowed me to explore various different
parts of text that I was interested in
all within the confines of the same the
same program which was really cool
so um then I wanted to UM ask you from a
managerial perspective how do you think
that the ITR program benefits women well
I would say that you know HR creates
opportunities for everybody in this
paradigm traditionally found in STEM
careers you know this is an entry-level
role for people who just are leaving the
university people haven't really had a
lot of experience in the industry yet
people who may not have even had a
traditional IT or computer science
background you know I I didn't come
through this program as a resident I
learned it as a manager however I didn't
have a traditional IT background I
actually had a business degree in a
spanish adri i don't think i speak
spanish anymore so it really helped me
but um the you know over the years just
seeing people who have entered this
program with psychology degrees and one
of them the neuroscience degree like
people who have had the ability to
develop their careers without having
really that traditional background it
casts a really wide net and since it is
you know a rotational program they get a
chance to work with other teams and see
what it's like to you know rotate with
an SRE group or work in networking or do
some programming some people who join
this team you know don't even have any
kind of experience writing programs but
by the time you hear you know they
already has what we call feasibility
which is you know like your trusted
reviewers of other people's code so you
know it's an inclusive environment
we look for people who are you know
where it's diverse across all of you
know the different the different things
that you would look for you know raise
some cultural backgrounds all that kind
of thing and gender of course but we
also welcome different perspectives and
ideas which i think is really important
to making sure that our products are
great which is what makes Google awesome
and also I would like to say that you
know women who join the ITRs NTC program
have strong professional models like me
being one of them I
a female manager and IT which is
something you don't see every day and I
also have a not my manager but my
managers manager head of our org is also
a female engineer who has been up the
ranks who serves as a great example of
you know seeing a woman in a leadership
role he's got that technical background
she can really you know walk the walk
and talk the talk and also Google has a
huge presence at the Grace Hopper
celebration for women in computing I
went last year and I'm going again this
year and it's a it's a really great way
to integrate ourselves with more women
out there and to show them that you know
we're we definitely have diversity here
it's cool to you that you'll queen of
the disciplines and perspectives and
blending that with the IT and
engineering backgrounds um and also we
don't know if you know but we have a
us-based IT internship program which is
in its second year and it's geared
towards those who are historically
underrepresented in the field and
although our summer you know world have
been filled we're going to be opening
another opportunity starting in December
for those for pursuing a bachelor's or
master's degrees completed in December
2015 to August 2017 and qualifications
are really similar to itrp experience in
all the major platforms degrees and is
information technology applied
networking that kind of thing but you
know it's definitely Google is opening
up doors for people you know across all
walks of life to get involved and get
excited about IT and stay in careers in
it and we'll be sure to post links to
all the resources that Aaron mentioned
on our website when we write up about
this angle as well um so some in in
European what are some of the challenges
associated with being a woman in tech
and how does the itrp help you deal with
them yeah so as Erin mentioned there's
so many female role models at Google um
within the tech field is not with
something I didn't actually even realize
was challenging
before I got to Google in my CS program
in school there weren't a ton of role
models in
once I got to Google and started me I
tear our program and eventually my
manager was a was a woman and as as Ann
said the directors our organization as a
woman and that really helped me kind of
envision what it would have passed for
my career to look like Kim gave me kind
of a lot more confidence in navigating
the detect industry yeah I mean for me I
would say that you know being a female
and I see as this hasn't never really
been a big deal like I haven't really
found that I feel like an outsider you
know Google such an inclusive company
I've been here seven years and yeah you
know I noticed that I'm one of the few
females that you know over the years but
that number of females grows you know
over here but one of the great things
about working here is that you know
there's so much diversity of not just
you know male to female but all
different culture so you know I never
feel like I'm an outsider which I've
never really worked anywhere else in an
IT company but I imagine you know it
isn't that way everywhere but yeah
definitely I don't I don't think that I
personally have met any challenges
because of being a woman I see thank you
um system D what are the special
training that you've received all the
skills and experiences that um this you
can talk about that young women might
also consider if they want to try and
prepare for something like the ITR
program yeah so my personal path was a
mix of kind of my education I studied
computer science and I spent some time
in high school also doing programs that
were technical but also my my student
job while I was in college was also
pretty similar to what I ended up doing
a night air program but for the students
that lived in the dorms I helped with
that running running the internet
service inside
Berkeley's Berkeley student housing and
that was that was a mix of tech support
and also working with other students in
a very similar way
and so I would say though that there
there isn't really one path that a lot
of people that end up in the HR program
take a lot of it a lot of people do have
the educational background a lot of
people also had little arts degrees that
ended up working in IT in some way and
got experience that way and found out
they really liked it but the the common
denominator I think is just kind of a
passion for technology and intellectual
curiosity about technology and being
able specifically for this for this
program being able to interact with
people have kind of a strong customer
service still set and be able to quickly
kind of narrow down what what kinds of
problems you're dealing with in addition
to being able to work with the people
who are experiencing the problems them
and there there are so many different
ways that you could you could end up
with those skills but education and
prior prior experience are definitely
those I got my second that like working
in your college computing lab or any
other kind of hands on IT experience is
really key I am I did a couple years
internship doing tech support and I
think without that I probably wouldn't
have had the skills that I needed to
draw here just because they didn't have
that traditional background even if I
had I think that that would have really
come in handy because seeing a problem
in real life and being able to you know
figure out what's wrong and trying to
solve things you know process of
elimination and trial and error is
really important to helping yourself
understand how all these things work and
um I don't think you get that out of the
textbook all the time so I would
definitely recommend anybody who's
interested in in some careers to to find
that that opportunities you know in an
internship a co-op you know summer job
whatever it is but definitely you know
if your college with a computing lab
like start there because that's where I
found a lot of people on my team have
started and it's been really valuable
experience for them I think that um you
know what we kind of talked briefly off
here that there are some and I think
people think that getting into Google
it's obviously quite competitive but
that you need to be doing something
extraordinary but you know as you're
saying as long as you're working in the
field and can demonstrate it
skills are transferable I'm sure that
that's tails like that's what you saying
you're looking full yeah definitely
people who are really passionate about
technology and are intellectually
curious and her great problem solvers
tend to be some of the best candidates
and I knew them so I would say that you
know having some of that experience
definitely important but you know
showing that you really do care that
you're really interested in in this kind
of work and and that you like working
with people who's definitely key because
you're not sitting behind a computer all
day and only working with code you are
actually in front of people and helping
them solve their technical problems and
it definitely is important that you want
to help people solve the technical
problems mm-hmm how competitive is the
itrp I'm just thinking if there's
someone watching this who's thinking do
I have a shot at getting in okay can you
tell us a bit about that I don't I don't
have any like metrics for
competitiveness but I would say if
you're interested apply like it is one
of those things or most people who apply
for Google on against cancer probably
backing up there you put in that that
application thinking there's no way I'm
going to get a callback and then you're
always surprising to do especially with
this you know it's a graduate program
postgraduate program so people who are
applying to this role you know we're
looking for people who don't have a ton
of experience with looking for people
who have recently graduated in the past
few years so if you don't think you have
a shot apply anyway
because you know you yeah course there's
a limited number of spots but if you're
not at you know don't don't count
yourself out before you either die yeah
you have nothing to lose so why not try
absolutely and these that can have the
min imagine that you've got several
programs running in different cities can
people all over the world apply for them
yeah definitely um you know there's
obviously eligibility regarding like you
know your work visa and that kind of
thing in the country that you are
applying for
but our recruiting team can help you
sort that out so you know apply and if
you have any questions um you know the
recruiting so you can help you awesome
and so can you tell us a bit about some
other programs that Google might be
running that women can also try out for
oh so many of them that I've had
try to list them all probably at all
their names jumbled so I'm just going to
tell you that if your student you can
explore technical and non-technical
opportunities at google.com/jobs slash
students and that's your best place to
start every year we have different
programs to put scholarships so by the
time this video is on YouTube for a year
if I say any of them now little probably
not exist anymore but just so you guys
know you know it the the jobs are
definitely out there on the student site
so can I just jump in obviously been a
non-technical person um so what are some
of the non-technical roles that women
might like to look into I know you so
unit you can't name specific programs
they're just generally speaking um well
you know okay well there's a wide
variety of roles across all different
departments so um you know we have
summer internships here in Ann Arbor our
cold interns they work in our sales and
marketing teams there are holes in these
people apps which is our team that that
does staffing and that kind of thing
Human Resources antennas area oh yeah I
mean there's just a really wide variety
of different and who-ville doesn't just
do software development like we have all
kinds of function so if you really think
about it like you know really the sky's
the limit if we have all kinds of
different roles at Google and you know a
lot of them are open for people who are
percent since I graduated so um you
mentioned a little bit earlier but um
you know if your interest to just apply
for it can you tell anyone who's
watching what's the process how do you
apply for the ITR pink yeah I mean the
same starting point as all the other
roles google.com slash dog slash
students and you'll find the role under
IT residency program but yeah that's the
best place to start and then you submit
your application and you know you'll I
think you'll be looking at automated
email and and with the backbone operator
and it's some twice a year you should
yeah we do hire for itrp fourth year
that is because we it's a fixed-term
program so it's sort of like
the higher sort of like you do with the
school you do in semesters kind of okay
and yes I think we've pretty much
covered everything we wanted to ask you
guys did you want to add anything
any last words samurais the woman if
you're interested you should apply don't
don't hurt yourself short
before you get started so definitely and
don't be afraid of of working in you
know a environment like Google where you
know it seems like it it seems like it's
competitive but you know we're all here
to support each other this is the kind
of environment where people learn and
grow it's a development program it's a
learning program you know you're here
this is twenty six months so you're here
during that time to get fully immersed
in IT and to pursue your passions and to
work with other groups of people who are
interested in the same thing as you are
there's training there's opportunities
for work and projects and talks about
some of them earlier you know it's
definitely a place that you know it's a
safe place to be so I encourage anybody
who's you know hesitant to consider
applying for the role
Thanks so and look one thing I that I
was thinking about was um I mean
obviously we've got on Sam as an example
so programs like this obviously build up
your skills over the year and a half but
you're looking to you know to a way to
get in to a career in Google correct
you're trying to retain the people who
work on on these programs I mean the
goal is for to build people lazy details
and if them you know to make them great
technical generalists you know the goal
isn't necessarily for those people to
stay at Google forever it's really up to
the individual and how they learn and
grow and develop and what what
opportunities they create for themselves
but it's definitely a plus I mean I love
being able to see former ITRs still in
the walking down the halls at Google
when I visit not movie or New York or
even here in Ann Arbor um but you know
it's not a conversion track necessarily
it isn't like that's not the end goal of
it the end goal is to make you awesome
at ID mm-hmm okay
I think that pretty much covers
everything that we want to do us thank
you so much for joining us thank you
thank you and we'll see um everyone in
two weeks time when we have another stem
women hangout we'll be talking to
professor Julia Greer who's a material
scientist and we'll talk about her
exciting
3d nano material architecture thank you
yeah fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
