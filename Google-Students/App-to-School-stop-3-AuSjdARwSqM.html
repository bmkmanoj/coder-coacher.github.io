KEVIN ROBERTS: Hello.
I'm Kevin Roberts,
the CIO at ACU.
Students and faculty and
staff are thrilled
to welcome the bus.
Glad that they were able
to celebrate with us.
Google Apps for education, and
some of the ways that we use
it here on our campus.

MALE SPEAKER: Well, I love the
way how Gmail just puts all of
my messages into conversations,
so I'm not
having to read 50 of the
same replied messages
over and over again.
Just look at one large
conversation.
I can immediately go to where
I'm trying to get to.

MALE SPEAKER: So many times on
a college campus, you use so
many different computers.
One thing that I like about
Google Docs is that no matter
where I am, I can always access
the same information.
So it makes it a lot easier,
just to be able to be
anywhere, and always have access
to that information.
FEMALE SPEAKER: We had
[INAUDIBLE] groups in my
literature class, and so we
would edit the documents at
the exact same time,
and it would save.
And so you didn't have to
download an attachment, or
take up space on your PC.
Even if your computer
crashed, the Google
document was still there.
So that's how we got
our grade, wa
susing Google Documents.

MALE SPEAKER: I'm the HR
supervisor at 1055.
So I keep track of
interview times.
I use Calendar to keep track of
what shifts are available
for new employees coming in.
Yeah, we use it a
lot around here.
MALE SPEAKER: I have
my classes there.
I have other appointments
that I need to be at.
So when the time comes, it will
pop up and tell me that
that's where I need to be, so
I don't forget about things.
MALE SPEAKER: I'm a part of
about six different groups on
campus, so I'm able to sync
all my calendars.
And the great part?
I'm able to put it on my phone,
and on my computer.
And send the updates
and emails of where
I'm supposed to be.
Plus, half the time I forget,
but don't tell anybody.

MELANY SIMPSON: It was great to
hear from the ACU students
today talk about how they
use Google Apps.
We also want to hear from you,
so upload your story today.
