much for joining us today as we talk
about a veteran's path to Google my name
is mala Tejwani and I help manage
Google's MBA intern program and co-lead
the Google student veterans summit with
my colleague Whitney Bosch I have the
pleasure of being here today with four
amazing veteran Googlers who are going
to talk to you about their path to
Google their experience thus far and
more importantly provide you with tips
as you begin to navigate your journey to
transition from military experience to
the civilian life so without further ado
I'm gonna have these folks introduce
themselves Jackson if you want to start
hi everybody my name is Jackson
Castleberry I am on our global agency's
team so effectively it's a it's a
business development role managing the
global relationships with some of our
largest ad agency partners and my path
to Google I spent about four and a half
years in the military and the Navy
specifically as an Intel officer and and
after about four and a half years
decided I wanted to try my skills in the
corporate world and so I went to
business school at the University of
Virginia and while there Google came on
campus to recruit and I landed an MBA
internship out of Mountain View in 2008
and I came on board Google full time in
2010 and I've been here ever since
great thank you Sarah do you want to go
next
sure hi everybody my name is Sarah
Sutherland and I'm with the Google Data
Centers group I do environmental health
and safety work for the data centers
team I've been with Google now since
2009 before that I was in the military
in USS Navy and I was stationed on an
aircraft carrier based out of San Diego
where I was in the nuclear power program
great
Dennis sure hi everyone I'm Dennis I'm
currently a second year student at
Columbia Business School MBA student
prior to Columbia Business School I was
an army officer for her seven years five
of those years I was in active duty
infantry officer and two of those years
I was in the reserves as a singles
intelligence officer after I left
the activity army I've worked at Booz
Allen Hamilton as an IT strategy
consultant and my path to Google after I
joined Columbia I started I started
going to the recruiting process and I
went to one of the on-campus interviews
or the on-campus presentations but
Google I was looking at tool and MBA
internship this summer out in Mountain
View with the Enterprise team and I'm
excited to return to Google after I
graduate this may more exciting that
you're coming back and last but not
least Travis hi everyone I'm Travis and
I was an intern last summer with Google
through the bold internship program
currently I am a junior at Harvard
College studying economics and before
that I was in rank report for five years
enlisted doing signals intelligence
great thank you guys for the
introduction I'm gonna I'm gonna start
and dig in really deep are ready you
guys have all kind of talked a little
bit about your path to Google and your
specific steps but as you talk through
the transition from your military to
civilian life
can you talk to us about how you were
able to communicate that on your resume
and specifically Jackson and clear if
you want to talk through that process
and what it looked like for you so um so
when I when I left the Navy I chose to
go to business school mainly because I
wanted to explore the number of
companies that come on campus and also
really take advantage of the of the
resources that come onto campus as well
so you have a Career Development Center
you have affinity groups such as a
veterans group you have your own
personal network recruiters you have a
lot more resources and and they can help
refine your story and it's also a good
practice to go through that as well the
big challenge as malla as Amala
mentioned was was figuring out how to
translate your resume though into
corporate jargon corporate vernacular so
that an HR recruiter can can look at
that and clearly understand what it is
that you did and so so it's definitely
iterative process it took me probably
ten to fifteen different tries and a lot
of pain and heartache but but but after
about
for five weeks and in a lot of
socialization amongst friends and family
I was able to finally remove all that
vernacular the military jargon so that I
felt like it was in a good spot and we
have some resources and I'll kick it
over to Sarah to discuss the resources
that we have yeah so when I got out of
the military I was planning on changing
what I was doing with my job completely
I was planning on going through pharmacy
school and finishing up my PharmD and in
the meantime I was working at a nuclear
power plant and I was thinking to myself
why am I going through all this effort
to change the things that I already know
when there's all these great companies
in the local area that I can look at and
Google happened to be one of the ones
that had moved into South Carolina so I
took a look at my resume and I said hey
what do I have that they're looking for
even though I feel like I had very
specific expertise that I could tailor
my resume to so I could apply and become
an employee with Google and I made that
kind of my job goal so you know some of
those great tools that Google actually
has available to veterans that you can
use to assist with creating really
really awesome resumes that are really
readable by the civilian world we've got
the YouTube channel that has the
veterans channel that's dedicated to
just helping you with transitioning from
military life to civilian life and then
of course we've got the resume writer
that's found on the veterans and
Families website and that will also give
you some tips on translating that jargon
and vernacular and those kinds of things
so that's great I think that that's
really great advice I'm so thank you
both
I know Dennis and Travis both of you
were part of some of our internship
programs so Dennis you're a part of our
graduate intern MBA program this summer
and then Travis you were part of our
bold undergraduate program I'm in
addition for those of you listening we
do have a very robust engineering
program as well but for both of you why
why was Google a place that you
considered or just technology in general
all right great
well I think
it's your first question of why was
technology and I considered I've always
been a tech junky if you will I guess
when I was trying to figure out what I
wanted to do after a transit out of the
military I gravitated towards you know
simply what I liked which was technology
and then Google sort of became a natural
focus for me which is I imagined what
many people are and then I think as far
as you know why maybe Google cific aliy
and how what they're lined up with my my
background as an army officer I felt
like I was I had the ability to affect
huge things to where they work on big
problems that mattered throughout the
world just you know through our country
our nation and Google and very much the
same way as doing that sometimes I would
even say at a bigger scale than I had
the opportunity within the army so that
was a huge huge draw to me to Google and
then I would also say that one of the
things I really loved about being in the
military in the army was that there was
a tremendous sense that I was I was
doing the right thing I was a force for
good and Google to me has that same
feeling you get that I felt that way
from the outside and then once I worked
there at the summer I was just very
apparent to me those was one of the good
guys absolutely Travis what about you
being part of the bold undergrad program
sure one of the most difficult things to
transition from military life to
civilian life was in the military
there's there's never a lack of a sense
of purpose so everything that you do
everyday matters are you know down to
the little details of your of your job
and when you when you transition to
civilian life there's a lot of great
causes there's a lot of problems that
need solving but I don't think that
sense of purpose is as clear-cut
civilian so you know for me it was it
was a it was my task I think was to look
for companies that were tackling big
problems today that we're doing
important work in the world and for me
you know that the name that kept coming
up as the top of the list was Google you
hear about Google all the time the news
doing great things
that google org was doing all kinds of
stuff in in japan following the tsunami
and i believe in haiti as well and you
know on top of that they're just they're
coming up with great projects and
products and that sort of thing and for
me
you know that that just said that's
where i need to be you know they are the
ones on the on the leading edge and i
want to be a part of that that clear
sense of purpose I think translated
really well into into working at Google
that's great and I think I'm just from
our university programs perspective when
we when we go to campus that's a huge
point for us you're going to be here
you're going to do some really cool
things that matter and you're going to
make an impact and feel feel like you've
really made a difference so I think you
bring up an awesome point I think
something else that we wanted to mention
is Google launched the Google student
veterans summit last year where 20
participants were were flown to Google
I'm specifically Mountain View our
headquarters for a two-day summit and
Dennis I know you were able to
participate in that so if you can kind
of give some insight into what students
can expect um should they apply because
the application is live and open until
April 26
um and what can they what can they be
able to walk away with should they be
able to join this summit well the answer
right away is the apps we should apply
so that's a military people out there
but you know what so what they can
expect I think you can expect a
professional development that will help
them transition out of the military so
whether you know Google is you know
where you end up and certainly hope it
is but whether it is or not the
professional development is applicable
to your life outside the military and
Google certainly cares about that the
ability to network you know with other
veterans who are in the same position as
or other service members soon-to-be
veterans in the same position you will
be in the trench transitioning out and
then also with networking with veterans
that are you know currently at Google so
that's kind of like you know I think
what you can expect but and really I
think why you know why they should apply
and you know the big takeaway is it I
think it helps redefine as a veteran
what what you what is possible
you know I know
only that what I was trying to figure
out if I should be the military or not
Google seems like I reached too far that
was a thing only for engineers that
wasn't a thing for veterans now and the
the Google soon veterans summit I think
helps helps vets see that you know hey
not only is it a place for engineers but
it's also a place for veterans and we
have valuable skills and you can not
only can you get in there but you can
exceed and do really well so it just
really helps redefine your your career
for a first cellphone I think all of you
are prime examples of that so folks that
have just tuned in welcome we have the
opportunity to talk to four veteran
Googlers about their path to Google
something that our our current CEO Larry
Page and co-founder says he always says
he doesn't just want Googlers to have a
great job he wants them to have a great
life and part of that is really hiring
people that have very unique experiences
and we have this philosophy of really
being able to bring your entire self to
work I'm so given your military
background what what is bringing your
entire self mean to you I mean if anyone
or Travis there anyone wants to answer
this please please chime in so I think
for me what that means is I spoke about
it a little bit before but it's it's
bringing that that's sort of Drive in a
sense of purpose to to what you do every
day so coming from the military you have
very unique experiences that I think
well you know most most people aren't
going to to have or even you know have
know people who have had them so
bringing that sort of those sorts of
experiences bringing the the sorts of
ideals that the military spouses to the
workplace in enriches it in a way that
then I think you know you you don't you
know you might not be able to get in in
many other ways you know for me
specifically just when when I go to
Google II people ask me about my service
they say you know they wonder what I did
in the military and that sort of stuff
and so sharing those experiences I think
maybe broadens their their perspective
on the military but it also brings us
closer as co-workers we at Google we
have a number of employee resource
groups and the greatest part about them
is their grassroots driven so they're
they're created by employees until one
of them is vetnet we're a bunch of
either veterans or supporters are able
to join and really have a professional
and personal developmental aspect to
their job as well Sara I know you've
been involved in bet net a lot do you
want to talk a little bit about that
yeah
vente is a really great organization
especially because sometimes you just
want to reach back to all of that
military experience and camaraderie that
you used to have and so we've created
that here at Google where you know we
have all of these different veterans
from all the different branches just get
together at the different facilities and
we do different events like hire hero
where we actually go out into the
community and do resume writing events
and find student veterans that want to
know how we got to where we are and
we're able to share our experiences that
way so it's a really really neat
organization it's just one of the few
organizations that we have when within
the company that gives you this great
ability to focus on people's diversity
and different backgrounds and come
together with really great ideas to
maybe even make new products or improve
the company as well as being able to
just find that common background that
you're looking for that's great as we
kind of transition to to the close of
this Jackson do you want to tell us
maybe one thing that you know now that
you wish you knew then yeah and I think
some folks you know on the on the call
already touched on I know I know Dennis
and Travis and Sarah have have have
touched on a lot throughout the the
course of the call but but mainly don't
underestimate yourself I know when I was
transitioning out most of the people I
knew were had been in the military and
there was some sort of common connection
so I thought hey you know that's just
kind of run-of-the-mill you know my
experience is not going to be anything
too valuable or really differentiate me
myself you know at business school or in
the pursuit of a job after business
school and and what I find found out
this is the complete opposite I mean the
stat you always hear you're being thrown
around is that you know 1% or less than
1% of the US population has served in
the military and and at the end of the
day you bring a fantastic number of
unique skills and perspective to the
workplace and if you think about you
know where you've been and what you've
done a lot of people will never ever get
a chance to experience that and at the
end of it you know and then I found you
know Business School and and here at
Google that it's you have you're
surrounded by great people but people
are also really eager to hear your
experience and hear your perspective on
certain things and so so just keep that
top of - don't underestimate yourself
and especially keep that in mind as
you're going through the interview
process they'll help give you some
confidence and and add to the excitement
well thank you guys so much for your
time Jaxson Sarah Dennis and Travis and
for everyone listening we hope this gave
you a little bit of perspective of how
Google really does hire people with very
diverse experience and we want our
internal Googlers to represent our
external folks that use our products so
please please please continue to apply
to any of our programs as we mentioned
the Google student veteran summit
application is open it'll stay open
until April 26 so we hope to see your
applications there should you have any
questions you can also email student
veterans at google.com
um thank you ven everyone for your time
and thank you for chiming in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
