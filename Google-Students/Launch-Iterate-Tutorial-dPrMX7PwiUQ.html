game where you and your friends are
software engineers launching products to
gain as many users as possible to launch
products you must develop the necessary
technologies while keeping an eye on
external events that may help or hinder
your efforts the game ends when you run
out of events so you need to build
quickly launch and iterate has three
decks of cards the blue cards of the
technology deck the yellow cards of the
launch deck and the green cards are the
event deck you'll perform three steps in
your turn first you may play a tech card
from your hand tech cards come in two
flavors tech stack cards and one shots
text at cards permanently improve your
product by adding features accessibility
storage or testing each card has a name
for the technology and a given stack
level you can't just write a
personalization engine and do you have
something to build it upon so you need
to satisfy some prerequisites once you
have played the prerequisite
technologies you have to commit the
engineering effort to build it this
effort is indicated by the card cost you
and any of the other players must
collectively discard this many tech
cards from your hands to play the
technology higher-level cards offer
permanent abilities that remain in
effect until you play the next higher
technology on that stack one shots are
like tech stack cards except they give
you a one-time ability you aren't
required to play a tech card but most
likely you'll want to play tech cards
throughout the game your second action
involves contributing to launches launch
cards gain your users this particularly
large gains 50 million users to launch
this card we must meet the prerequisites
and contribute the necessary cards to
the launch
unlike tech cards only the active player
may contribute to launches your third
action is to draw one card from the deck
if you are out of cards then you get to
draw two instead once everyone at the
table has played around we reveal a card
from the event deck this card takes
effect immediately if you reach for the
event deck and all the cards are gone
the game is over so let's play launch an
iterate
so we've set the cards up according to
the rules and we have chosen to play
with our cards face up because it's a
cooperative game there's no point in
keeping the cards secret so we begin by
drawing three cards and choosing one to
launch so cat so it looks like caddy
requires low-level cards which we have
and it also costs Elise so maybe we
should go with caddy okay cat is taking
the two cards we did not choose and
putting them on the bottom so we begin
with Peter that's me all right so I've
got a lot of good low-level cards to
play but it looks like other people do
as well so I might choose design doc to
play which will give us a discount on
one of these stacks my choice I'm going
to choose the S track and so here you go
I'll place the - to discount card on the
S deck and draw my cards and my turn in
turns great because you played that it's
gonna make developing the a stack much
cheaper and so I'm gonna go ahead and
play the S one and it's free when it
would have cost two cards we're gonna
put this back so we don't use it again
and I'll take a card to end my turn
okay so I have s 2 which I could play
but it's gonna cost three cards and I'm
worried about us running out of cards
because we have a lot of good cards
right now I don't think we should have
to spin them all so I'm gonna play in
turns in order to draw three more cards
so one two and three and then I do not
want to contribute to the launch right
now because I feel that we need the
cards to pay for technologies so I will
draw one more and that ends my turn
so I don't have any cards to develop any
of our technologies so I'll play the
documentation card which allows me to
add two cards from the discard pile to
contribute to our launch and I also have
s1 which I could also contribute to our
launch which will make us half way there
awesome interns intern season yeah
all right so we've gone around the table
once which means it's time to reveal our
first event so Peter please all right
the first event is career fair an
internal career fair is held and you'e
tends to attract more developers to the
project two players draw one card each
Watson I think it should be cat night we
seem to be in need of some cards yeah
great okay so for my next turn I think
I'm going to lead off with playing t1 it
costs one card anyone wanted to pay for
that I can pay for that I have a high
level card the Brawn used for a while
perfect and draw it my turn
well I'm gonna continue to develop our
technologies with a1 and it's gonna cost
one card and I will pay with this one
since we don't need it for a really long
time
my card so we've gone around the table
event Lorentz alright let's see we get
out of capacity an unexpected growth
leads to cascading failures and services
place a +3 penalty card on the S deck
but since we have s1 developed all
players draw one card
okay so we've moved ahead in the game a
bit we are about ready to launch caddy
great so I'm going to contribute the
last three cards to our launch we have
now satisfied all the requirements so
we've launched caddy boom exciting so
next we're going to choose our next
launch
well since I already have t3 why don't
we launch Google Maps 8-bit for NES
looks good so to finish my turn I'll
draw so fast forwarding to the end of
the game it was just cat's turn and
there no more cards in the event deck
which means it's time to end the game
and add up our users Sydney would you
care to do the honors 555 million users
our products are warmly received I
should buy a boat so thanks for playing
launching iterate coming to campuses
