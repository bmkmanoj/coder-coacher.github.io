manager came to me and asked me look
Nara we don't have basically an Arabic
coordinator for Adwords but we do have
advertisers that basically need our our
support would do you think he'll be able
basically to help out with AdWords it
was completely out of my of my core job
my core job being Adsense so I went
through the training it was actually a
one-week training and now I'm basically
able to help out advertisers and and
publishers when I was asked to do it
my idea was like like everything is just
possible in here as long as you have
time to dedicate as long as you want to
do things broaden your knowledge so you
don't know only about Adsense but you
know about let's say AdWords Gmail
Google News Maps Earth and that that's
what makes you basically evolving them
in an environment when learning I think
is is something very important you just
have this feeling that you're basically
improving yourself every day
my name is nada and I work in Adsense
with our publishers in the Middle East
and North Africa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
