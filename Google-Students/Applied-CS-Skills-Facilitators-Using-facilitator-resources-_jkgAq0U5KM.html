SETH: Hi, I'm Seth.
And in this video,
I'll be reviewing
some of the key resources
available to support
facilitators.
Facilitating applied
CS with Android
might appear to be
a daunting task.
But there are lots of
tools and resources
to make it as easy as possible.
One of the best
places to find support
is the Facilitator Community.
You can find help from
seasoned facilitators,
and discuss with
beginners having
the same experience as you.
From past facilitators'
experiences,
guides have been
created that cover each
of the units in your program.
Each guide has an overview
of the unit activity,
key talking points for
facilitators to review,
and information about common
areas where students get stuck.
We have also created videos that
review the technical concepts
which facilitators can
share directly with students
before the workshop, or watch
together during the workshop
introduction.
Additional resources
to support facilitators
are also available in
the Facilitator section
of the website, including
downloadable marketing
materials, unit briefings,
and a code sprint evaluation
framework.
If you or your students
have feedback for Google
on the program, or
even a particular unit,
you can fill out
our feedback form,
which can be found on
the course home page.
We encourage you to check
out all the facilitator
resources available
to you so you can
make your program a success.
If you're interested
in learning more,
be sure to check out
our video on tips
to help you get the
most out of workshops.
