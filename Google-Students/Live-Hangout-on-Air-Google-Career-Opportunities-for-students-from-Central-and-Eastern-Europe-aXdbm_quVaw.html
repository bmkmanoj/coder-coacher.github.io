Tatiana and I am responsible for Central
and Eastern Europe for the university
programs a bit about myself I met some
of you on campus already and you
probably know my personal story but I've
joined the Google five years ago and I
started in Graz laughs in the global
customer experience team and I moved to
Dublin two years ago and I moved from
the cells to people operations about a
year ago so now I am traveling a lot to
stay in touch with the central in
Eastern European universities and today
the agenda for us looks like that we
will cover first the Google internship
positions then we will cover the full
time positions for you and then we will
share some personal stories of the
Googlers who are here today with me and
they will share their personal
experience about living and working in
Graz love and in Dublin and then we will
be joined by our recruiter Ailish who
will share with you our CV and interview
tips and tricks and we will also leave
some time for your questions I already
seen a couple of them on the handout
guys my only ask for you will be can you
please answer or ask them in English
because I already received your
different language unfortunately I
wouldn't be able to address them so
please switch to English if you want to
if you want me to take this question at
the very end and then at the very
beginning just just to start out here in
Google we laugh there are creams and in
case if you don't know what is s and B
and C I'm going to explore explain it
now SMB States for small and medium
businesses and C is Central and Eastern
Europe and for central Eastern Europe we
have languages like polish Hungarian
Czech Slovak Kazak Kazakh Belarusian
Ukrainian and so on and yeah new grads
who are joining Google they normally
joined us in them on the edge' level
positions and these positions are
located in Dublin I
and in lots of parts and guys i'm i'm
here today with Camille Medina and
Natalia who are going to introduce
themselves now okay hi guys my name is
Camille I'm working for SMB polish team
here in Dublin okay Natalia hi my name
is Natalia I'm working in blossom Poland
I work for the Russian ruble customer
experience team hi everyone my name is
marina I am placed here in Dublin in
Ireland and I'm currently working for
the YouTube creators team for the
Russian market okay
thank you guys and later we will be
joined by a shower recruiter she will
introduce herself after after a while
and first I I'm going to start with the
students opportunities basically we do
have two kinds of opportunities if your
student or recent graduate the first one
is an internship and if you are
graduating in 2017 or later you will be
eligible for our internship program if
you are graduating this year or you're a
recent graduate the best way to join
Google is to join our as some
entry-level positions SMB customers
sales and SMB global customer experience
teams and a couple of minutes about
Google internships unfortunately the
applications for this year are already
closed so that's why I wouldn't spend a
lot of time here but in case you're in
case you're wondering so what is the
Google internship
Google internship is like a summer
internship for 12 weeks and you're
basically working with the team and you
are working on the project so you will
have 50% time on the core job at 50%
time on the on the on the project work
and these are the real business projects
and you will be able to make an impact
the global impact
sometimes even and you will also be able
to expand your professional network and
like as I mentioned already ilish who
who is our recruiter will join us later
and she will also cover how to how to
apply to this position
and what is important in your
application process and for now let's
talk about life at Google and let's talk
about life and global customer
experience team and SMB sells guys
you're working on you were you're
working now you have started working on
these positions and if you would do an
elevator pitch of your current role how
would you do that okay so a year ago in
March 2014 I've started my my working
here in Dublin where in Google and yeah
I start working in a direct program and
I used to work directly with customers
after nine months I moved to a agency
program so you know in SMB sales you
have a lot of opportunities to go from
working with direct clients to the
agency with the first part which is I
think very exciting sometimes job is
very challenging there is a lot of
challenges but at the same time you get
a very unique opportunity to gaining a
very nice business skill set okay thank
you coming and patellar can you because
you're still in there our global
customer experience team can you please
sure how would you do the elevator pitch
off URL so why join the global customer
experience I think that no one can
succeed in business without knowing
their clients and their needs and global
customer experience is the best place to
know what your customers want we educate
clients on AdWords we help them grow
their businesses we help them solve
their issues and based on are their
issues we identify what is smart working
using Google and fix processes so we
both talk to clients and also work on
projects so it's a great place to figure
out how Google works what you want to do
further on at Google and also get all
the necessary skills to go and do it
yeah Thank You Natalia and I also always
try to highlight the thing that Google
is making money through Adwords and to
start to work in the business is
important to understand how how your
company makes money and whoa
these positions are related to our main
revenue product so it is a really good
opportunity to understand the business
from the very basic my next question
will be for you Camille like a strong
sales pitch is a key to success I in the
interview process can you can you maybe
mention a couple of factors which are
important for sales pitch also for the
sales pitch especially here in Google
when we are talking with our clients the
main point is to listen your your client
to know what the client needs this is
the first thing secondly make a deep
dive in his or her account and make a
deep dive in the business field where
your client is because this is also the
key factor how to you can grow their
business and improve the campaign the
business etc so okay thank you
and guys we're all working in the very
international company and the question
here would be what lies which is to your
speaking your tips Masha I can maybe
jump I can maybe jump for this one I'm
currently part of the Mei YouTube
creators team and we're a very
international team we all speak a few
languages so every now and then we would
have a day when we would all speak one
language and usually 80% of us are
fluent in that language and the other 20
are eager to learn so it also comes to
be a very fun team experience and an
exercise but in general the Dublin
office where I'm based right now is one
of the most multilingual places I've
ever visited
I'm always amazed I get into the
elevator to go to the top floor and wait
during my ride in the elevator I hear so
many different languages people at
Google are usually very international
and eager to learn more yeah I do speak
a few languages in my team normally like
in the office it is English and then I'm
going on campus that might be completely
different languages it might be Russian
I might be even Ukrainian and a bit of
Polish I'm not very professionally in
this one but I'm trying so that's like
from my personal experience that's very
international background around you all
the time
so you you basically have an opportunity
to speak any language you want and my
next question will be to you Natalia um
when considering applying to the account
associate role what level of product
knowledge is required basically product
knowledge of a teacher all right so when
a person joins we don't expect them to
the specialists and AdWords because it
is indeed about the product that you
need to learn and of course we're gonna
provide all the resources for people to
be you know professional in their job
hunting them everything they need I
wouldn't say that your product knowledge
is the first thing that we're looking
for yeah I received this question very
often on campus and students asking me
should they know adverts already
should they be professional in this one
and my answer normally is the ruble
teach you everything so yeah Natalie I'm
agree here with you and but we'll
definitely would like to see that people
are motivated to to work with this
project a product and we this is kind of
think what we are going to test you on
the interview so before they interview
additional coverage but just a sneak
peek before the interview I do the
preparation the basic preparation of the
product itself and product knowledgeable
um every associate account role is
paired with the business associate
program and I also received these
questions on campus very often the dela
can you please elaborate what is
business associate program about and how
it helps to develop your career in guca
yeah of course so big program is a
two-year program that is tailored to the
needs of both guards and people to just
join Google and be focuses on both
developing the skills that are necessary
for the daily job so the product
knowledge project management team work
and stuff like this but also on the
skills that I needed for your further
growth even below or outside of either
the personal growth as well so it's
leadership network in personal branding
and things like this last there's a
chance to
you know projects that are outside of
your immediate job and the scattergram
helps to do your skill set to grow
within Google and just I would say
personally grow your career even if you
decide to go outside people afterwards
yeah thank you my favorite my favorite
training from this program was the
presenting with charisma so the most
interesting part of it was that we all
were recorded while presenting and it
helped me a lot to improve my
presentation skills because when you see
yourself presenting on the video you
just like oh probably need to fix this
and this and this so this program is
really helpful for soft skills as well
and it really helps you to develop to
develop your skills
my next question will be Pepito to
Marina and why it is a great to start in
global customers experience teams and
the global sales team yeah this is
actually very connected to what you were
mentioning before so for my experience I
joined Google as a fresh grad and I was
part of the SMB team and I went through
the BA program and it was crucial for me
being a fresh grad to have the
opportunities to keep on learning and to
actually get the training not only the
product training but the general
professional training I was now suddenly
a young professional adult and I needed
the support in a more formal way of how
to better present my findings how to
analyze the data I'm working with how to
be how to behave in a big international
corporation and communicate with my
peers from across the globe and Google
gives you this experience as part of the
VA program and as part of the smv
onboarding program and I think that
helped me a lot especially being a fresh
crack hires I would definitely recommend
making sure that when you join a team
that training and according aspect is
there Thank You Marcia and I really like
pointed out a few times that the new
grads positions are available in Poland
abroad Slav and Google were in Dublin
Ireland and
however overvalue internal mobility a
lot and even if you are joining on the
entry-level position in this new
location you can always move to another
place for for example you can be back to
your own country and actually the new
girl with whom I joined Google five
years ago joy his dream was always to
move back to Moscow and he did it in
three years or if you don't want to come
back to your country there are always
lots of opportunity to join Google teams
in the United States in Europe or even
sometimes in Asia and for now I like to
talk about the life in broad slab and
the life in Dublin and let's start with
frost laughs me myself I've joined the
Google Android stuff and I think it was
very right decision to do because this
is a tiny office of 300 people allocated
in the city cell city centre in a very
nice town in Poland and like this is a
strategic allocation for many of the
language skills language seems like a
Hungarian Ukrainian Russian German
French and Italian few more I I'm not
going to mention all of them and in this
small office it's always good to do to
build a relationship and actually are a
lot of my friends in Google came from
God's love office and guys can you
please share how the broad Slav office
what what is dress love office about and
your personal experience there so I am
that'll start I started hearing God's
love and I've been here for three and a
half years and as Donna mentioned this
office is smaller compared to Dublin but
that creates a very special atmosphere
so your colleagues here are not only
your colleagues but very often they are
your close friends we do a lot of things
together outside of work the travel we
have fun there are lots of different
clubs sports movies and stuff like this
the office itself feels more like home
than an office because it's smaller very
cozy very nice views from the windows to
the city and I enjoy working
monster yeah thank you very much um what
do you like what did you like or do you
like in about living in watts love the
most
yeah I I probably will direct this
question to Marina because she she
started in the life as well and she
moved to Dublin so she can she can
compare to life in two different cities
sure I'll be I was hoping I'll get the
Broads love question every time I share
God's love I smile and I have great
memories about being there and starting
my journey with Google there but also as
Natalia mentioned it really feels like
like a family it's very important when
it was very important for me I was a
fresh grad it was my first time starting
a new full-time job in a different
country so having the experience was
very friendly very family-like office
and having fellow Googlers who are also
relocating from their countries and
joining the artists in Poland was very
important and really helped get started
and have a have a great time so I really
valued the family like atmosphere and
also have to say that noogler groups are
an important part of the onboarding
experience within Google so when you
start and you're a new Googler you're a
new glar you get the funny hat and there
is a group of fellow Googlers that you
get to go through training boarding
programs and these are usually the
groups that really stick together over
time so it's wonderful to not only keep
in touch with the friends I've made a
drug stop but also keep working with
people that I started that world stuff
even though so many of them moved
different locations different themes we
still interact every now and then it's
always nice to see a familiar beautiful
face in Dublin in Mountain View or in
Tokyo yeah thank you
Medina and let's most of the second
location the Dublin Ireland
yeah this is a completely different
office compared to roads LaVon this we
do have Hyrum more than 5,000 people III
think and a few buildings and this is a
headquarter the biggest office in Europe
a biggest Google office in Europe and we
do have come in here who started in and
in in Dublin and can you please share
your experience how do you like them of
course I agree with you that for sure
this is the the biggest office right now
in Europe more than 5,000 people there
but even though we maybe not with all of
those 5,000 I know each other but with
most of people even they are working in
other teams like in LCS or GTECH more or
less we know each other because
sometimes we very collaborate very close
in some kind of projects there is a lot
of nice advantages working here in
Dublin for sure we have a four
restaurants which is totally cool the
brand new was open last quarter this is
the Italian pizzeria we have our own gym
our own swimming pool half Center so
yeah a lot of fun here Tremont swimming
pool I'm very important especially when
they opened a Italian restaurant and
every day you can enjoy fast and feed
science really hard to resist marine how
you promise to you that I will ask you
to compare two lives one and component
and another one in Dublin can you please
share your experience of living here in
Dublin yeah it's actually a very often a
natural transition from from roads off
to Dublin it's one of the locations
where you can relocate within within
Google and it's been kind of like a
natural step for me I got the chance to
move to bigger office and also start
working in a different team so this was
probably the biggest change there was
just more more people more Googlers who
speak even more languages and come from
even more diverse backgrounds but also
for me being in Dublin really I got a
chance to discover Ireland it's
beautiful country very friendly very
welcoming I started hiking for example
which I never did before
but I really enjoy the outdoor
experience of being in Dublin and and
that's kind of like part of your life
here so that's been great and also as as
the guys already mentioned first as it
is a big part of after-work life here so
that's been wonderful but I still keep
in touch with a lot of my lots of
friends sometimes it feels like we never
left yet we start with a new chapter
which is event
yeah and it's true they even have a lots
of lunches once per week where we all
meet and we all discuss changes in our
life okay guys and last question before
we will jump into the interview
interview process now will be to all of
you probably how often do you travel
back home so maybe right now maybe not
often basically during this some kind of
holidays like Christmas or Easter maybe
more time I spend traveling around the
Europe because Dublin this is a very
nice point in Europe that you can fly
wherever you want and yeah I'm trimming
travelling about around islands during
the weekend so yeah it's not what I'm
here I know yes okay Natalia how often
do you travel back home a summer said I
think it's it's personal choice right
I personally travel around two times a
year and I prefer spending the rest of
my vacation exploring Europe because
specific areas all situated we are very
close to Berlin interesting frog yeah
everything at around so it's it's very
tempting to just go around and explore
countries and yeah that's how I prefer
traveling right now but of course if you
want to go home there are opportunities
to go more frequently than I do and a
lot of my colleagues go and work from
their home cities but there's always an
opportunity like this yeah okay Marina
how often did travel come I think I'm
also part of the weekend travelers and
if you drink how is it is in Dublin to
move around Europe I definitely take
advantage of that opportunity and it's
the same for abroad Slough it's very
centrally located but I also try to go
back
home as much as possible if you keep
working within the region that you're
that you come from it's also a nice
opportunity to come by and work and
personal travels so as much as possible
I try to if I travel for work also go
visit my parents
but with Googlers very often home is in
many places so that makes it even more
spread around yeah I travel back home
every quarter and first of all because
of my role and yeah I'm traveling a lot
over to Moscow but also I like to spend
a week home during the summer time and
when I was an SMB global customer
experience team I love to work from
Moscow office because it's very quiet
it's a very tiny and you always have an
opportunity to connect online I doesn't
matter where you are in Moscow in
Bratislava in Dublin so I always use
this opportunity to work from home just
to spend a bit more time home with my
parents okay guys thank you very much
and now we are going to jump in for to
the recruitment process and we have
English here English coming in which is
recruited for Central and Eastern Europe
and she is in Google for many years if
you can maybe introduce yourself quickly
because we have not done it very sweetly
so I'm Hamish Cassidy as Tanya said I'm
the recruiter for the sea region I'm in
Google now five years and I still love
it as much as I did on the very first
day and I really enjoy hiring for this
yep and guys the recruitment process for
internship and for full-time positions
is slightly different and yeah and if
you can explain us what's the difference
between universities so the intern
recruitment process is a relatively
short process in comparison to the full
time and pinchley process so the intern
recruitment process involves two phone
screens one with the hiring manager and
one with a member of the team if the
candidate is successful we will then
proceed to offer the can place the
full-time hiring process involves two
phone interviews one with the
creature and one with the member only
rather than team for which the Canada
just interview far if the candidate is
then successful ash the business phone
interview stage they will then proceed
to the on-site interview stage which
will be three to four images depending
on the particular team and if they're
successful they will then be passed over
to the hiring committee review and if
they proceed through that process we
will then proceed to give them an offer
which is the part of the job I
absolutely know mhm okay thank you very
much and as a recruiter you probably see
a hundreds and hundreds CVS on a weekly
monthly basis whether your do's and
don'ts for the good city city sure so
I'd say first and foremost sure that you
run a very very personal check on your
CV is absolutely crucial not to present
your CV to any company let alone Google
with spelling earth so that's very very
important then second of all I would
emphasize you should list your
achievements rather than just listing
your real responsibilities and quantify
those accomplishments yeah by adding
metrics and data where possible we
really want to see the impact so don't
be shy to add Asian metrics where
possible and I would also recommend try
and in order to make your CV visually
look better to try and use bullet points
where possible mm-hmm okay thank you and
what would be your top two tips for
interviews okay so first and foremost
preparation is so so and you need to
really ensure that you first of all
understand clearly the role that you're
applying to that you've done the
relevant homework on the team and the CD
markers Google products
second tip I would give is to really
listen to the question that the
interviewers ask can you answer that
question I would also recommend using an
interview technique called start method
it's very very useful mentoring
behavioral style interview questions so
you would start off by explaining little
bit about the situation you were in or
the tasks that you had to accomplish
then you would clearly state what the
action the action you took to solve
either the problem you are faced with or
the the task your gift
and then you will always bring it back
to the actual results and quantify this
add metrics reduction where possible
Thank You English yeah guys you should
be on my events I always highlight this
model to you star situation task action
result and the result part is all like
quite often the result part is missing
in the see me please make sure that you
fold it there ah thank you very much and
like as we mentioned already couple of
times moving like we have new class
positions available in Bratislava in
Ireland in Dublin and moving is a very
moving change in the country is a very
exciting experience do we get any kind
of support while moving I mean if you
can take this question please
yeah I've moved a few times so
definitely can speak from personal
experience google offers relocation
support and that comes as part of our
company benefits and that's something
that your recruiter can walk you through
in details but I would also would like
to point out that in addition to that
you also get the support of Googlers and
your peers when I was joining when I
joined and got the offer the next email
I got was from the hiring manager saying
hi I will be your manager I'm here to
help you out so let me know if you have
any questions can I put you in touch
with other interns who are preparing to
to come to to Poland any any help you
need so the teams are always very very
helpful your manager is a great point of
contact so you can rely on that support
group as well and both of my relocation
experiences have been very smooth I've
quite enjoyed them and it hasn't been a
stressful experience which I really
appreciate it okay thank you very much
thanks everyone
okay so we are now approaching the Q&amp;amp;A
session I do have your questions here on
my laptop and I will try to read them
carefully
um I yeah I think this question will
perfectly fit your Ailish what are the
important God's the most voices so what
are the important criteria that you take
into account to select applicants
for an interview short so I suppose
first and foremost it depends on the
relevant role that they're applying for
so we've you looked in to see what
skills or experience they would have for
that particular position that's probably
the the most important thing and then I
think I would also emphasize like what
their leadership skills are except
something that we really look for in
candidates candidates who could really
lead themselves through situations and
see results mhm okay
thank you very much ah the next question
it's a very funny one so it's a I will
ask it and I guys say if you want to
take it however just jump in if not they
can take it and imagine you are also
students willing to work in Google like
we are now and we are people who hire
employees say free sentences why should
we be interested in you anyone I'm Mary
you know maybe Natalia I can try yeah so
you should be interested because you
will keep learning and that's connected
to something I've mentioned before this
is the culture of non-stop learning and
then stop developing your skills you
should be interested because you will
have a great great peer group Googlers
are some of the most amazing smartest
and somebody fated and driven people
it's it's just incredible and thirdly
you should be interested because it's a
truly global company and if you're
looking to gain international experience
and work with people from all over the
world as well as touch large groups of
users and impact large groups of
customers that's definitely a place for
you yeah one thing I would like to add
is even you make some small things in
SMB you really have sometimes a very big
impact in your market I think that's
something that I've seen you can always
think about ways to improve yeah Google
is I would also add ownership so you
basically own your own Joe
all your own yaw roll so if something is
not working you go and you fix it and we
actually had couple of examples in rods
laugh about this one and as a result of
one of this action that somewhat
something was not working was there 24
hours phone support for Russia and
Russia is the only market in Europe I'm
not talking about english-speaking
markets but they're in Europe Russia's
the only market who has the support 24
hours okay um the next question will be
a Nutella probably to you what kind of
goes to the person achieve in the first
one or two months of his or her work at
SMB services so I would say that if you
are talking about first month or two
months it's about learning so you need
to understand how the team works what is
looked at what are metrics as we as our
English that we are very numbers driven
organization so we look at numbers as
well as metrics so you need to
understand that but realistically
speaking I know that we are all very
ambitious people so usually we will go
way beyond this they start exploring
other opportunities talking to people
building their network and that's great
so I think the pace at which you learn
depends on you
in the first month what is required from
you is understanding the core job that
we're going to be doing and growing in
it learning all the things that you need
to know yeah okay thank you and guys I
see some familiar names from the
questions and I definitely see someone
from compost uh hi guys I already I feel
that you're listening to us today um
unless the next question probably will
be the best one to you what is the main
difference between applying at Google
then at applying for other companies is
there anything in particular that Google
looks for soit suppose our website is
actually a great resource to go into
more detail around this but I think
there's four key criteria the first one
being the the relevant experience for
the roads I discussed previously we will
always look to see what the skills
are for the role we also assess
candidates on their leadership skills we
want to ensure that they have a strong
ability to see projects through to the
end and then we will also ensure that
they're the right fit for the company so
I think Google is not unlike any company
but we really do look for the very very
best possible students that we can hire
mm-hmm okay thank you and guys I also
see the question about the two years
educational program how does it organize
for newcomers and etc it is the business
associate program and Natalia already
I think answered this question but maybe
if you need more details just Natalia
how is it structures how is it
incorporated in the data job so as I
said it's a two-year program alright so
for two years you have scheduled
meetings different projects that you
participate in trainings and stuff like
this so usually you have in advance
information which trainings you're going
to have in the upcoming two or three
months during those days you are
completely taken out of the job so you
don't have to balance you know I have to
do my usual job and attend that training
you have the time to reflect to learn to
fully experience the trainings
themselves and this is spread out
through this two years with the
different modules and also you have an
opportunity to go for an assignment do a
project in the meanwhile and also time
it's obviously ever created for that so
that you can you know do it for the
dreamers truly engaged and get the best
out of it yeah thank you
and the next question will be there are
a couple of questions about how many
interests we are looking for how many
full-time positions we are looking for I
will exploit it and that the first part
will bethe you Irish what is the number
of people Google plan to hire this year
and their upcoming sorry and upcoming in
the upcoming years in the center of
Europe I understand what we don't have
like exact numbers but maybe some some
information should be very difficult to
give specific numbers right yep so I
would just say keep a close eye on
website and you know if there is a role
that's open and you're interested we
would actively encourage you to apply
but we really cannot give definite
numbers for this year or beyond yeah
because the business needs change yeah
yeah thank you but for some markets like
our Central and Eastern Europe I mean
Google for five years and this region
almost every time has open positions for
the full time so definitely I search the
web look on the website I would say 90%
you will find the position for yourself
you feel like if you are speaking on the
fifth central Eastern European language
yeah yeah and the next question again it
is related to the hiring and the Peggy I
think you will be the best person to
answer probably again we don't have the
numbers but just a bit of information
how how many entrants do you need in
Google vladislav and in what spheres so
Google Rosoff is the office of the
mostly focuses on global customer
experience so that's the type of in
looking for at the moment this year we
will have wealth entrance if I'm right
if I'm wrong please correct me yeah so
it's different markets for which the
interns are going to be working and
every single time like I've been at
Google for three and a half years and
every single time every new year we look
for more and more entrants the program
is growing they're very happy about that
so yeah stay tuned and check out the
next year's as well ah thank you and
Medina next question will be probably to
us you've been kind for a while and I'd
say it's a philosophical one I'm really
curious why there are around seven steps
phone introduced and on-site and tutors
for full-time job actually that make
anyone depressed before well it's it's
obviously there is a process and we want
to make sure we recruit the best people
and we make sure we place them in the
positions that aren't the best fit for
them that we're currently the two
currently have open but I really
actually just wanted to say that
Googlers even when it's during an
interview at least for me was was very
pleasant the recruiters and hiring
managers people who interview really
tried to make it an enjoyable experience
for you and it's all about telling your
story and sharing what you've done
before and how you see yourself fit into
this certain position within Google so I
I've had obviously I was very nervous
and it was a very important step for me
to apply for the internship initially
and then be converted full time so it
was it was a big deal and but I quite
enjoyed the process and I wouldn't call
it stressful I just make sure you do
your homework you'll have the
information at hand and the recruiters
as well as the interviewers are there to
guide you I hope you actually enjoy the
process because I quite much did thank
you and my question I may be coming to
you can you give an example
oops switched can you give an example of
some typical interview questions about
Googlers about the Google image whoa so
basically maybe did one question which I
remember from my interview how do you
collaborate in a in a group of people I
think this is yeah the question is
essential and the skills how you can
collaborate in your team or with other
teams it's very crucial sometimes in
Google when you are working in in some
big projects so this one I think yeah
okay anyone else wants to share their
good in this question no I when I was
doing the interview in the in this
service system I was I was always asking
tough questions about volunteering
experience and about their achievements
outside work and the studies and if you
have any sports achievements if you have
any any kind of activities work they're
not really related to your current
status or your current work experience
my next section yeah I just wanted to
add that sometime
Googlers or people's but people who
apply to Google have they speak a bunch
of bunch of languages so it's always
interesting for me as an interviewer to
understand what the motivation was
behind choosing to to learn a certain
language and very often there are great
stories behind it and they also show the
extracurricular interest that the person
has so I always like that googliness
question as well yeah the guy's probably
told ask questions and I will take this
ones who has a lot of a lot of foods the
first one you mentioned about relevant
experience that google looking for I
would like to ask what kind of
experience from school academic
experience or from internship you're
looking for what kind of backgrounds
finish so I think any skills that had
any opportunities that you've been given
that have helped to develop your
analytical skills I would certainly say
to include them like strong analytical
or crucial at Google so so absolutely
include them in your CV and in short it
to reference your analytical thinking
and how you actually demonstrated that
in your interview yeah yeah yeah what
else what kind of background we also
need except for the analytical I really
like I mean it's obviously something you
can learn but you're not you may not
necessarily have that experience but
once you do your homework in the
interview and you come to the interview
with a passion to develop your skills in
this area that's really really important
as well so you have to have that
interest okay and the last one that is
quite short maybe again to you relish
how long after the graduation can I
apply for the entry position so I mean
we actually do start interviewing
candidates before they graduate so you
don't have to have graduated before you
can apply to Google so we're really
excited to see people in their final
year for example applying for full-time
roles obviously for the internship you
can be in your penultimate year to apply
for a position but for the full-time
roles we're certainly open to seeing
candidates before they officially
graduates okay thank you very much
I think that's it for today thank you
very much for listening coming Ailish

joining and sharing your experience and
