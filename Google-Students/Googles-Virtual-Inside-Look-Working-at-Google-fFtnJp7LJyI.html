NADAV ALON: Hi, everyone.
Good afternoon.
So happy to have you here with
us for this virtual session.
I'm Nadav from the university
programs here at Google.
DINA GANDAL: I'm Dina.
I'm a software engineer
here at Google Tel Aviv.
NADAV ALON: And we have a
busy afternoon ahead of us.
So first of all, we really
want to say thank you
for taking the time
in joining us today.
I'm quickly going to go over
the agenda for this session.
So we're basically
going to start
with speaking out about Google
and the values of the company.
Then we're going to speak
about the intern position
that we have to offer for
students here at Google.
We saw all the registration
forms and all the requests
that you sent in.
Most of you asked for us
to speak about CV tips.
So it's definitely
something that we're going
to cover in the session today.
Then I'm going to hand
over the mic to Dina.
Dina is going to speak
about her journey
at Google, with a lot of
interesting and technical
issues and challenges
that she's going through.
And then we'll finish
with questions.
Even though it's just the two
of us here in front of you,
we have some of my
lovely team members
joining us as well over chat.
So Emily, [INAUDIBLE],,
and XT are
available through the live chat.
Feel free to ask questions.
That's why they're here.
And we're happy to
answer everything.
So before we move
forward, I want
to introduce you to our
hashtag of Google Students.
We have a Twitter page.
We have an Instagram
page and Facebook.
So definitely, if
you see us on campus,
if you have any
Google-related activities
as part of your student's
life, definitely put post.
Don't be shy.
And put the hashtag on
so we can see it, like,
and we'll be happy to
be in touch with you.
So I want to start by
talking about something
really, really general.
What is the mission
that Google has?
So our founders came
with really, we can say,
something very ambitious.
And that is to organize
the world's information
and make it accessible,
universal, and useful.
So basically we're trying to
organize all the information
out there, making it accessible
for everyone, no matter which
country are you, no matter in
which social demographic you're
of.
We want to make it
accessible to everyone.
And as part of
it, you can really
see Google evolving
through the years
and having a lot of
different products.
Even though we started
as a search company,
now we have over
seven products that
already reach one billion users
each, and we're still growing.
So on the slide you can see
all of our different products
for right now.
So products like Android,
products like search,
YouTube, Google
Play, Gmail, Chrome,
that's products that already
reach one billion users.
So definitely we're
putting the user first.
We're putting a definite
emphasis on scale.
And our users' database
keeps increasing.
And that's part of really
making everything accessible.
So even though we started
at search, we keep evolving.
So it can be email.
It can be a browser.
It can be cloud,
which is something
that we're putting an emphasis
on these days, keep trying
and find new ways
to make everything
accessible for everyone.
And the best single
perk at Google--
so even though a lot of people
are seeing movies and video
clips and articles
about us, but if you'll
ask an average
Googler what he thinks
is the best way at
Google, most likely
you will always get
the same answer,
and it's not the food, which
usually people expect that.
But it's definitely the people.
The DNA at Google, and we will
speak about that in a second,
is really putting the
emphasis on the people.
We want to hire the best people,
people that are friendly,
people that it's
nice to work with,
definitely intelligent
people, but also that
have that extra added
value, and that's
something we're looking for.
And we're going to speak
about it in one second.
So we want to start by speaking
about your career at Google.
So everyone joining
us today are students
from across Europe,
Middle East, and Africa.
And what we have to offer as
students is our internships.
So we have two types
of internships.
The first one that we offer is
called the Classic Internship
Program.
And you can already
write down the dates.
We will start the hiring
process on September 26--
sorry, October 26.
So you can just
log to our website,
and you can see it over
there once it will be open.
Feel free to join,
submit your resume.
We'll speak about all the
qualifications in a second.
But that's our summer program.
It's targeted for
last-year's students.
So just make sure you're already
strong and algorithm and data
structures, and we'll be
happy to get your resume
and check if that's
a potential fit.
Our second summer
internship it's called Step.
So Step is a summer
internship mostly targeted
on under-represented talent.
And our focus is
really to help showing
more under-represented talent
in the high-tech industry.
It's open for everyone,
so don't be shy and feel
free to submit your resume.
And you can already
submit your resume
during the first and
second year of school.
That will open a
bit later this year.
So Step will open in
mid-October for most of EMEA.
And in Israel, we will
open this role in December.
So just a quick reminder,
the classic internship
will open September 26,
and the Step internship
will open in mid-October
in Europe and mid-December
in Israel.
So the million-dollar
question's,
what are we looking for
in interns and engineers?
So as part of our
evaluation process,
we have four scopes
that we're looking for.
And that's the four
different criteria
that we're targeting to see
during that interview process.
So the first thing is
how a candidate thinks.
So someone might find
this title a bit general,
but we want to hear you think.
So when you come for
an interview, speak up,
even though you're sure
you know the answer
or even though you're sure
that maybe you're stuck
and it's something that you're
not aware, think out loud.
Make us hear you think and
that we know exactly what
is going through your head.
And even if the answer
may not be the best one,
if we know that the
process is right,
that means that
we have potential
and that we would
like to move forward.
Second thing will definitely
be leadership skills.
So a question that
we get frequently is,
how can we show
leadership as students,
even though we don't
necessarily have leadership
experience from the industry?
That's completely fine.
Try to think about social
organizations you're
working on, volunteering,
clubs during school,
extracurriculars
that you're doing.
Everything that can show us
that you have this potential
will be great for us to hear.
And please mention
that over your CV.
The third criteria
that we're looking for
is definitely the
classic one, and that's
role-related knowledge.
Obviously, if you're looking
for internship position,
we will interview for
algo and coding skills,
so that's something that
we're looking forward
to seeing and
understanding, what's
your level with experience
that we're looking for.
And the last but definitely
not least is &quot;googliness.&quot;
So what is googliness?
No one really has an answer
that we can say really out loud.
But that's definitely the DNA
factor that we're looking for.
We're looking people which
we will like to work with.
We're looking for people that
seems cooperative, people that
look intelligent,
and that's someone
that it will be great to go
in the morning in the office
and see him.
So try as much as possible,
because the interview process
can definitely be
stressful sometimes.
Try and be yourself.
Try and be as natural as you
can and just the real you.
That will be the winning thing
for you to pass the interview.
And as your suggestions,
a bit of CV tips on what
are we looking for.
So first of all on
the basic things
that you need to be aware of,
know who your audience is.
So a lot of time people
are writing their resumes
thinking that an engineer will
be the first one to see them.
But most of the time a
recruiter will see it first.
So keep in mind that's the
true target audience that
are going to watch
over your resume,
so please make sure everything
is written down, explained
properly, that whoever will
read it will understand
exactly what's written.
Specifically for us and
for other companies,
make sure that you submit your
resume in the format of Google
Docs or PDF.
That's the best one
that are preferred.
Sometimes other
formats get a bit
disrupted when you submit them,
so that's our recommendation.
And make sure that your CV
are clear and consistent.
So still speaking
about format, make sure
that everything's consistent
in terms of time line,
that you don't have any
gaps, that you don't
have any dates that suddenly
may look a bit awkward
or that are inconsistent.
And make sure that the
format is clear, clean,
definitely readable, and nice.
And addition thing is definitely
use standard font type
and not smaller than 11 points.
A lot of time people are trying
to use really nice graphics.
But if we won't have
them on our laptops,
we will just say
gibberish or something
that will be unreadable.
So make sure to use something
standard that you'll
be 100% sure that the other side
will see it properly and clean.
And as well, separate you
content into sections.
Help us to read it
as possible and clear
as we can, so that we'll see
everything in bullet points,
everything super clear,
super structured.
So it can be bullet points,
like personal information,
education, technical skills,
your work experience.
As students, you definitely
have extracurricular activities,
so definitely mention
that and don't be shy.
If you have any achievements,
if you did a project
and you finished
with distinction,
if you graduated summa cum
laude or whatever, mention that.
A lot of time people
are worried that they
will sound a bit too much and
maybe too full of themselves
so they neglect a lot of things.
But we want to see them.
So we can be humble,
but don't forget
to mention everything because
help us try and identify you
in the crowd and
make sure that you're
the right person
for the position.
And the next step will be
mostly relevant for PhDs
or advanced degrees.
But if you have any
publications that are out,
if you have any patents that
are written under your name,
mention that.
We're definitely
interested in seeing that,
no matter which role it is.
And we would love to
see it in the resume.
And something that you
will hear a lot in Google,
focus on result and impact.
You can mention that
you did a project,
but we will have no idea
what the impact was.
Maybe for someone
from the outside,
it will look very small.
Maybe for someone it
will look very unclear.
We want to know what exactly
is the result and impact.
So try and use data.
Try and use metrics.
Rather than using long
descriptions and long stories,
try to be straight to the
point and mention exactly
what was the impact.
It can be percentage.
It can be budget numbers.
It can be number of lines
of codes or whatever.
Just try to put it inside so we
can understand what's going on.
And as you saw in
the previous slide,
try and use it as bullet
points because that
will be a bit easier
to read for us
And make sure that we're
not missing anything.
So after saying all
of that, and hopefully
I've answered most of your
questions, how to apply.
So just visit
google.com/students
for the best role for you.
We also have a lot
of prep materials
that can help you put focus
on during your studies,
put focus before the interview
season's starting out.
So definitely visit
our career site.
You have the address
on screen right now.
And make sure to find
the best opportunity
that we have to offer you.
Please make sure to
upload your resume
in English and your transcript.
It's completely fine
if it's unofficial.
Just make sure to submit it and
press Submit, and that's it.
Now we're going to move over to
Dina, who will share her story.

DINA GANDAL: Hi.
So my name is Dina.
And I'm a software engineer
here at Google in Tel Aviv.
And I'm currently
doing my masters
in Tel Aviv University, where
I also did my BSC in Computer
Science and Economics.
And I came here
today to tell you
a little bit about what it's
like being an internet Google
and tell you a little
bit about my work
and share my
experiences with you.
So before we dive
in, I just wanted
to show you where I work.
So these are the Google
offices in Tel Aviv.
And as you can see, they
are incredibly beautiful.
And here are some more pictures.
So you can see each
floor is different,
and it's very colorful.
And the best part is that
we have an incredible view
to the beach from
the 35th floor.
So how did I join Google?
I joined as an intern, as
a software engineer intern,
about a year and a half ago.
I had just started my
master's degree when
a recruiter from Google called.
And I thought, why
not give it a shot.
So I had two
technical interviews,
just like Nadav said.
And in these interviews,
the emphases of
was really on
algorithm and coding.
So I was asked a question.
And I needed to
think about the best
solution for this question,
explain it to my interviewer,
and then implement s in code.
So about a week later, the
recruiter called me from Google
and told me I'd passed.
Yay!
And I started working at
Google two months later.
So when I joined
Google, I was assigned
a host, who is also a software
engineer from my team.
So each intern is assigned
to host who is actually
your professional
buddy, and he will
guide you through
your internship
and help you plan your
next steps at Google.
And except for that, you're
also assigned a buddy,
who is more like a friend.
And you can ask them any
unrelated-to-work questions
or any questions that you
don't want to sound silly
in front of your host.
So when you arrive to
Google, you're not alone.
And so in your first
few weeks at Google,
you will begin learning the
internal fundamental Google
technologies.
And trust me there are many.
So your team will help
you focus on the ones that
are relevant for you and
relevant for your team.
And these are sort
of like tutorials,
and they're actually really fun.
So once you've settled in and
you've done your tutorials
and you're ready,
you'll be assigned
with your first project
within the team.
And now my internship
was a year long,
which is not unusual for Israel,
but it's different per country.
So I have more than one project
throughout my internship.
But don't worry because your
project fits the duration
of your internship.
You will have time to
finish your project.
So these projects,
why are they special?
Well, first of all,
these are projects
that the team does
want to execute,
but they're
relatively not urgent,
and a new member of the
team can do them, an intern.
So you can start work
immediately on these projects.
And you can progress
at your own pace,
which is important because you
will create your own timeline.
But you are the one creating
these timelines and not someone
else.
So as an intern, I was an
integral part of the team,
and I worked on
real products that
are used all over the world and
are used by millions of users.
For example, my first
project at Google
was to create a
security-related system which
affected more than one
million users a day,
which is incredible because I
had been at Google just for,
what, a few months, and I
had already so much impact.
It was really,
really incredible.
So this first project of mine,
I planned it, and I designed it.
And after launching, I
measured and monitored it.
And so I actually
owned it end to end.
And at the end, sensed
my impact and changes,
and it really was so
satisfying and very rewarding.
So you're probably
asking yourself,
how does a week of an
intern look at Google?
So first of all, you have your
weekly meetings with your host.
As we said, you are
assigned to host.
And in these weekly
meetings, you
update your host
about your progress
and about the challenges
that you encountered.
And your host helps
you set future goals
and think about how you can
develop and grow at Google.
And except for that, you
have your team meetings,
which are pretty similar to
the one-on-ones with your host.
Except in the team
meetings, the whole team
updates about their progress.
And this way you are
exposed to all the projects
that your team is working on.
And this is a great place to ask
questions, so feel free to ask.
Don't be shy.
And except for these
meetings, there
are many other
meetings and events
that you can attend in
Google, except for those
we just mentioned.
For example, earlier this week,
I attended a presentation skill
session in order to
prepare for this session,
and I hope it's working.
So besides all these
professional aspects,
Google offers a fully equipped
gym, which is super fun.
I go a few times a week.
And we have TRX and yoga
classes and many other things.
And last but not least,
which I wanted to mention,
are the volunteering
opportunities at Google.
And I personally
like volunteering
in the Google Summer Camp,
which helps girls in high school
prepare for the Computer
Science Olympics here in Israel.
And I think it's
important, but there
are many, many other
volunteering opportunities
at Google throughout the year.
So here are some pictures
of me and my team
going to the gym on the
right, doing yoga on Yoga
International Day last year.
And here we go again.
I make them come with
me to TRX lessons.
And the cherry on top for
me is that the offices
are dog friendly.
Yay!
So as you can see, we have
some non-human visitors,
and it really makes my day.
So another special thing
I wanted to share with you
is about the Google culture.
So the Google
culture encourages us
to help outside of
one's scope or project.
And this is not just a cliche
because Google promotes
the Peer Bonus Program, which
is basically one Google who
nominates another.
And the nominee receives
a small monetary bonus.
So this creates a
great atmosphere
because you can recognize your
peers for something exceptional
that they have done for Google.
And I'll just give
you a small example.
When I joined
Google as an intern,
I started organizing these
night outs for the team,
like once a month we
went out for a beer.
And I organized these
really fun activities
and these embarrassing games.
And I thought it was important
that we hang out after work.
And after a few months, one
of the teammates rewarded me
with a peer bonus
and saying that they
appreciated the time I spent
for organizing these nights.
And I just want to
say I really enjoyed
organizing these nights anyway.
But being appreciated
by one of the teammates,
well, was really
satisfying, again.
So that's very special.
And another nice program
I want to mention
is the 20% Program at Google.
The company allows
employees to spend up
to 20% of their time
working on a passion
project of their own creation.
And this lead to products
that you might know today,
for example, Google News or
Google's autocomplete, which
was actually created
here in Israel.
So I also think that's great.
So to recap this part
of the introduction,
the work at Google is impactful.
It's diverse.
It's interesting.
It's fun.
And it's global.
You get to meet and
work with people
from all around the world.
And I'll just give
you one last example.
As interns, you attend
the Intern Summit,
which occurs in the summer.
And I attended the one
last year in Zurich.
And in the Intern Summit, we met
interns from all over Europe,
Middle East, and Africa,
which is you guys.
And it was just an
incredible experience,
because during the summit, we
attended really interesting
lectures about machine learning,
about system design workshop,
even about personal branding.
And in addition to that,
some interns volunteered--
I was one of them--
to present their project
to the rest of the interns.
And it was really
interesting to see how much
impact interns have at Google.
We heard about intern
projects at YouTube
and Chrome Web and any
product that you know today.
So there's interns
everywhere at Google,
and they have lots of impact.
So these are just a few
pictures of the Intern Summit.
You can see him in the
first row on the left.
I'm like the only
one with my hands up.
And here are some more pictures.
And here is my favorite one
because it's so colorful.
And so now I want to
tell you a little bit
about what I do at Google.
So I'm part of the
Security Center
team, which is part of the
Identity team here in Israel.
And just in Israel, we have
over 100 engineers in Identity.
And we have many more in
California and Germany
and all around the world.
So overall, Identity's goal
is to keep the user's account
safe and private, help the user
follow their own activities
and settings, and help restore
their account in case of loss.
So this is our main
page of Identity.
And you can type in the
URL myaccount.google.com,
and you'll reach this page.
And we help you
avoid highjackers
so that they won't go in.
So my team is responsible
for the sign-in and security
part, which is
responsible to display
recently used devices and recent
activities in your account.
And you can change the way
you sign into your account,
using two-step verification
or changing your password.
So that is my page.
That's our team.
We're responsible for the
security of your account.
And I would like to tell you
about a new sign-in feature
that my team has developed
about a year ago.
And you can try it later.
I use it, of course.
So this is a pretty
cool feature.
Why?
Because we let you
sign into your account
without using your password.
Meaning you can
sign into your email
without using your password
but instead using your phone
and without adding any
risk to your sign-in flow.
So why is this good?
Well, so let's look at the
big picture for a minute.
Google has over
1.5 billion users.
And some of them,
including yours truly,
tend to forget things
sometimes, including
my password sometimes.
So this flow will allow
me to enter my account,
even if I forget my password.
And we all know
how frustrating it
is to sit in front
of your computer
trying to sign into
your account and not
being able to because
you forgot your password.
So we'll walk through
this new feature together.
So as I said, this is the
main page of Identity,
and we'll be clicking
sign-in and security.
And we reach this
page, and it says here,
tired of typing passwords?
Try using your phone
to sign in instead.
Yes, I want to try.
And what does it mean?
It means that from now on, every
time I sign into my account,
I can easily use my phone
instead of my password.
Meaning, if I want to
sign in from the library
or from a device of
a friend, I don't
need to remember my
password anymore.
I can just use my phone,
click Yes, and I'm in.
So it all sounds pretty easy
and straightforward, right?
Well no, it's not.
There are many security
and privacy related issues
when developing
front-end products
because we don't want to add
any risk to the sign-in flow.
So what could be
problematic here?
Well, I'll let you think
about it for a second.
And then I'll tell
you that, for example,
what happens if we turn--
I turned on the flow.
I'm using this new feature.
And now someone
else, who is not me,
is trying to access my account
from a different device,
and it isn't me.
But right now I'm
using my phone.
I'm typing of a
message to a friend.
And suddenly this
prompt message comes up,
and I accidentally click Yes.
I just enabled someone, and
someone is now in my account,
and it's not me.
Or what happens if I
even read the question
and I click Yes anyway
because I didn't quite
understand what it meant?
So again, we have
a problem here,
and we let an intruder in.
So how do we solve this problem?
So what we thought would be
a nice and elegant solution
was to display after you click
Yes, after the user clicked
Yes, to display on the screen
three different numbers
of three digits and display
just one of them on the device
that you're trying
to sign in from.
Now if it's you, you
will be seeing a number
on the device you're trying to
sign in from and three numbers
on your screen, on your phone.
And we will be
asking you, please
choose the correct number.
And you will know exactly which
ones to choose because you're
seeing it on the screen.
But if this is not to
you, then, first of all,
we hope you will stop and
ask, what are these numbers?
This looks suspicious.
And once you do,
we hope you don't
click any of these numbers.
Therefore, you won't
be letting anyone in.
And even if you guess
one of these numbers,
it's less than 50% that
you'll get it right,
but we hope you won't
be clicking those.
So this was just one of
the many cool features
that my team has
developed over the years.
This one is about a year ago.
And again, you can
try it now at home.
And the last topic I
wanted to talk to you
about is to tell you just
about another team in Identity
Israel.
It's the Account Recovery team.
And I wanted to tell you
because it's an interesting team
and they work pretty hard.
And they provide a mechanism for
users who no longer have access
to their credentials to prove
that they own their account.
And for example,
it could be users
that forgot their
password, unless they just
turned on the flow so it's
not an issue for them anymore.

So it can be users who
forgot passwords or users who
their account was
accidentally deleted
or users that their account
had really been hijacked.
And the Account
Recovery team deals
with many, many of
these requests a day
because, as we said, there
are many, many Google users.
So there are many
factors used in order
to make sure that only you
will be able to get back
into your account, and Account
Recovery team uses machine
learning technologies
for recognizing
suspicious activity, and they
use risk analysis models just
to make sure that it's
really, really you.
And in more technical
words, they're
trying to minimize the
false positive, which
means not letting
the bad guys in,
while also minimizing the false
negative, which is not letting
the good guys in, well, because
it's pretty frustrating, again,
to get locked out
of your account.
So as you can understand,
these features and logic
are very complex and they
require planning and designing
and collaboration between
the different teams
here in Israel or
around the world.
And this was just one example
of many, many projects
of one team and also just one
team amongst so many others
who work hard every day to
make Google products great.
So I hope you feel
a bit safer now
and that you enjoy the session.
I had a good time.
And we will be answering
your questions now.
NADAV ALON: Cool,
so thank you, Dina.
Sounds like you're having
an interesting time here
in Google.
And now we're going to
go over the questions.
So one of the questions was,
how did I get to Google?
So you already answered that.
So I think I'll go over that.
So I was actually
in my previous job,
and I saw a posting
on a Facebook group.
I wasn't actively
looking for a job.
So I said, why not?
Sounds interesting.
Let's see what will happen.
It was a very interesting
interviewing process,
I have to say, because I
haven't been in an interview
for four years.
And the process definitely
a bit unique to Google.
But all of my
interviews were amazing.
And all of them are
now my colleagues, so--

DINA GANDAL: Lucky you.
NADAV ALON: --that
was pretty much it.
Yeah, I have to say.
Dina, do you want
to mention a bit
how did you study
for the interviews?

DINA GANDAL: Yeah, sure.
So first of all, also the
recruiter here at Google
recommended me studying the book
&quot;Cracking the Code Interview,&quot;
if you guys have heard of it.
I really recommend
going through the book.
So I read through most of
the chapters in the book,
and the most important
tip I have for you is
don't just read the question
and then look at the answer
and say, oh, yeah that
was what I was thinking.
But try solving it yourself
and try asking yourself,
like, second steps
of the question.
For example, how do I
make the solution better?
What if I can't use
this data structure?
How do I solve it now?
And really implemented in code.
So that's my tip.
NADAV ALON: Cool.
And something that
I can add also
is that feel free to try and
practice on a white board,
feel free to practice on some--
even if you take your
computer, just try and use it
without autocomplete
because we're really
trying to test you
without you having
the option to go for like
cheats over the internet.
So make sure that you're trying
to work as clean as possible.
And if the computer
isn't working
and you need to work
on a whiteboard,
so just make sure that
you're not stressed of that,
because first time
can be stressful.
DINA GANDAL: Right.
I, for example, I used a notepad
on my computer, the simplest
way, I think, to study.
NADAV ALON: Yeah.
That's a good tip.
So next question that we got,
what is in your experience
the most important
thing an engineer
should know for a
successful career
as one all ready been in Google?
So what do you think, Dina?
DINA GANDAL: Well maybe this
question can be also for you.
Maybe it's just a
successful career,
but I think you need to
be eager to learn things.
And it's best if you're curious.
And, well, it's even better
if you like what you're doing.
But you need to like to
take initiative and be
responsible for what you do.
And I think those
are the overall
for a successful career.
Do you have anything
else to add?
NADAV ALON: Yeah,
I completely agree.
And Google is a very
dynamic company.
We're constantly growing.
We have new products
all the time.
So definitely putting focus
on learning new things,
and the opportunities
are endless.
So I completely agree with you.
Another question is, how
easy it is for engineers
to switch from a
project to another
when their interests change.
DINA GANDAL: Do you
want me to take--
I'll-- OK.
So as an engineer,
I can tell you
it is not hard because, well,
as you know, Google's very big.
So you can-- and Google
wants their employees
to be satisfied, because a
satisfied engineer works better
and is happier.
So it is easy to change teams
and switch projects and even
relocate, if you really want to.
NADAV ALON: Yeah, and
I have to say something
that you'll hear a lot in Google
is definitely the couple words
of internal mobility.
So it's definitely
something that Google
is encouraging to try and
get out of your comfort zone.
As Dina mentioned,
there endless projects,
a lot of different
products zones
that you can go from
one to the other.
So even though the
question is, of course,
focused on the engineers, I can
say that overall as a company
it's something that
we're really encouraging.
Another question,
how much time do you
spend coding and how much time
thinking what to code, Dina?
What do you do on weekends.
So we have a lot of
questions over here for you.
[LAUGHTER]
DINA GANDAL: OK.
So I think that about
50% of the time I
code or think about code.
But the think about code is,
well, we don't just code.
We plan and design.
We go back and
forth between teams.
We go back and
forth with product,
which is also important.
So it's not all about coding.
And as I said, we have also
many weeklies and meetings.
So I would say about
50% of my time.
And on weekends I do not
work most of the time,
unless it's something
very urgent.
I think that at Google there's
a very good work-life balance.
So unless it's
something very urgent,
we do not work on weekends.
NADAV ALON: Yeah, and I have
to add to that as well in terms
like work-life balance, so
it's definitely something
that we're all really
putting a focus on.
I think no one, from
my personal experience,
is really looking at the
hours that you're working at,
but really just looking
at the productivity.
So it's not like someone is
looking to see when you arrived
or when you are leaving.
So it's definitely not
part of our agenda.
Yeah, so definitely trying
to be as balanced as we can.
And I think you can
see evidence of it
because most of the
engineers and the employees
has a lot of different hobbies.
So it can be sports.
It's going to be traveling.
It's going to be dancing
or a lot of other things--
languages.
And each one of us has time
to keep improving and growing
in that direction.
Cool.
So I think that was several of
the questions that you asked.
The first of all,
thank you for that.
I think we still have
time for one more.
So, Dina, do you
want to try and say,
like, how long does a
project usually take?
DINA GANDAL: Yeah, sure.
So it all depends.
I'll answer that
regarding your internship.
So in my internship, I
had between three and four
projects.
And they varied between,
let's say, three months
to almost six months.
So projects are going to be
around that sort of time.
They will take time
just for your planning
and designing and implementing
and understanding.
And in order for it to
be called a project,
it really has to be whole and
have all these steps in it
and not just add
another feature.
So projects, I would say,
take about between that time,
between two months,
but we could also have,
like, this project where the
whole teams take part in.
And then it might
take even longer.
But no more than six
months, something like that.
NADAV ALON: Right.
Thank you.
So I want to
summarize everything
we just talked about.
So first of all, really
thank you for taking the time
and joining us today
from all across Europe,
Middle East, and Africa.
We're very excited
to have you here.
So it definitely was
a great opportunity
to speak to all of you.
I hope you enjoyed this time.
You can definitely
reach out to us.
All of you that got the
invites through the email,
if you have any
questions or requests,
you can email us back.
We'll be happy to see your
applications in the upcoming
hiring season.
Please don't be shy.
We gae you some tips on
things to think about when
you build your resume.
But we're definitely starting
the interview season soon
for our intern business, and
we'd love to see you here.
And we'd love to see
you in future events.
Reach out to us in
your local university.
My team in the past
almost three months,
we did around 70 events
in 45 universities
across EMEA, which is Europe,
Middle East, and Africa.
So we're definitely trying
to expand of the schools
that we're reaching, and we'd
love to see you soon and have
a great rest of the week.
Bye-bye.
DINA GANDAL: Bye.
