hi everybody out there that is listening
in on our hangout on the air this is
Jeff Moore lead recruiter at Google
talking with a couple of my dear friends
Devon Bryan and we're going to talk
about non-technical interview prep today
which is not my specialty but I like to
pretend I can talk about anything and
yeah so we're got a little bit of fun so
Bryan was here last week so we're like
Bryan introduced himself first and
without further ado Bryan want to
introduce yourself and talk a little
about what you do at Google sure my name
is Bryan Kaminski and I work on our
University programs and outreach team
here at Google specifically focused on
our non engineering programs
so that's roles like sales marketing
finance Human Resources our enterprise
group our media platform services group
the lots of companies like double-click
and their YouTube organization and our
role is to work with our our students on
campus that are going to be there be for
our on-campus outreach going to campus
say hi but then also for some of our
internal programs like our internal
internship programs and our programs for
other undergraduates here at Google I've
been at Google for about four and a half
years I focus now on schools in the
Midwest as well as Stanford and and I've
had a number of different roles at
Google I started kind of on the
engineering side for a bit went over to
the sales and services side working with
a double-click organization on display
advertising and then move back to the
program scene about a year a little over
a year ago so excited to talk a little
bit more about my experiences
interviewing students as well as kind of
what I've seen working with different
different people and different groups
here at Google awesome and Deb hi
everybody thanks for having me I'm Debra
Castro and I do the same thing Bryan
does but I do it from the Cambridge
office
um but yeah so like Bryan mentioned we
work with a lot of the internal business
groups at Google and helping them
attract talent from undergrad
institutions across the country so my
major focus is on the East Coast region
and I predominantly visit schools
throughout the New England area and
mid-atlantic but I have also been known
to go down south
I have a different background I've
actually been at Google for close to six
years and before Google I was working at
a radio station in advertising sales so
when I first when go
I joined our advertising sales team um
and began cold calling sales clients so
I've kind of been on the side of having
a really business II interview and
getting asked those tricky questions so
I'm happy to provide some advice on how
I landed this job in a business
interview and then even transitioned out
to the university programs team through
another interview cool well welcome
thanks for you guys for joining it's
great um so we're talking about
non-technical interviews and in the blog
you know I talked about a lot of things
there are a couple things that I sort of
preach to people that are looking for
interview advice I just sort of want to
throw out there and then get a couple of
sort of you know what you guys we can
consider your biggest tips that we can
then sort of look back get some live
questions and kind of go from there and
so my biggest tips I guess is that you
know what one and it's sort of huge for
me is to do your research right like do
your homework spend some time going out
there and making sure that you're
applying for roles that seem relevant
they're interesting you know what the
company does so you don't show up for an
interview and not have any idea what the
job is um you know sort of blocking and
tackling right like recruiting and
interviewing 101 and then there's
another thing that I advise people to do
that is a little bit more complicated
and requires a little bit more work and
most people don't do it as far as I can
tell I've done it my whole career so
Brian I'm dying for your opinion um I
actually tell people the night before an
interview to go and create a list of the
kinds of questions you might get you
know tell me about your strengths talk
about your weaknesses a lot of time you
took a risk and fail tell me the time
you did something that wasn't required
that you succeeded I mean you know on
and on and on and on
and write down these questions and then
write down what you would answer like go
through the practice and go through the
whole exercise of interviewing before
you ever go in the interview so when
you're actually in front of your
recruiter recruiter your homeland or
whoever and they say hey Brian what were
your strengths and weaknesses you just
you know right through the list and
you're ready and you're polished and
you've got good answers and you don't do
a snappy dresser um you know so that
you're really ready when it comes sort
of you know go time in your interview
and so how we start with Deb just to
make her uncomfortable what are sort of
your like a couple of big hints that you
would say to people are doing
non-technical interview prep um so I
agree obviously with doing your homework
ahead of time I also think that when
you're practicing that night before and
coming up the questions and answers um
look in the mirror see how you sound
when you're answering a question because
I think sometimes even just smiling a
little bit can make your answer come off
so much more natural and and genuine um
I'd say you know make sure you know a
lot about the company without looking
creepy and the same for an interviewer -
right research the people you're
interviewing with um not to the point
where you're asking them questions about
their life that they probably wouldn't
have wanted to or expected you to know
about but when you're doing your
homework make sure that you have a
really solid understanding not just of
yourself and the information you want to
get out there to the interviewer but
about the company so that you're able to
kind of craft your answer so they sit
what the company's values are and they
sit in line with maybe some of your
interviewers interest and past
experiences as well absolutely Brian
what do you got yeah I think I would say
like doing your homework is incredibly
important and for me that always meant
that there were a couple of big things
to look at first is how does the company
actually what's the business model how
do we generate revenue in one way or
another Google's got a lot of
information out there whether it's
Adwords or Enterprise sales unit or any
of those groups in between but generate
revenue it's important to understand
kind of how that works I think other
things it's important to understand at
least for us is our culture and we've
got a great about page and there's tons
of information out there about what you
can look at to understand kind of the
things that we value what's important I
think that's all really important and
then I think the stuff with practice
means a lot it really helps and I'd even
say do it a couple of days ahead of time
give yourself a chance to to work out
some of the kinks some of the some of
the your catches along the way I always
found that if
would do it with other people practice
with other people then I can get some
real-time feedback and how is doing the
biggest thing they like when you get a
question that's a basic question you
should always be able to illustrate it
with a story you should be able to say
yes this is how I feel this is what I
feel like my strengths are here's a time
when I've seen that played out and
that's why I think I'd continue to do
that in in the future because it's
always when you can lean on some of that
past performance but that's going to be
indicative to an interviewer if that's
probably how you're going to behave
again in the future and that's really
what they want to get at they want to
see are you going to be a good fit on
the team and are you going to be able to
kind of help us along helped us
accomplish some of our goals and what we
want to do the last piece is that well
it's important to understand what the
company does anything that you can find
out about specifics about what a
particular organization does or a group
there's so much information out there
about the different organizations at
Google what their products are what
their services are some of the cool
things along the way I think that's that
just shows that you've done a little
gone a little bit deeper than the
cursory sort of overview of the company
about page and I think that really
speaks to a lot of interviewers very
positively now how do you guys before we
take live questions I actually just sort
of have a like lightbulb moment and so I
apologize running but it's why they are
a live question right now but how do you
guys feel about Deb you mentioned you
learn about coming to be creepy how do
you guys feel about when people do a
little bit of research on you like you
know I know personally I know interview
a lot people talk a lot of people and
though I read your blog last night I was
like oh that's cool but you know I have
had situations where you know someone's
like I read your blog on the train into
the office in your blog that you wrote
yesterday was don't wear a suit and I'm
wearing a suit is this going to impact
my interview and it's like no no no no
no it's okay this is happen is there
sort of a line there for you guys on
sort of you know that that company
research piece just so you seem prepared
but not me over prepared yeah I mean I
think it also is based on the industry I
think within our industry since we're in
technology pretty much anything that you
research about me is something that I've
controlled or that I've wanted to put
out there because I'm pretty tech savvy
I can I'm really good about making sure
that the messages I'm putting out about
myself are appropriate and things that I
wouldn't be offended or weirded out if
someone found out I think if you're on
having a non-technical interview but in
a different industry outside of the tech
industry not to be redundant um I'd be
slightly more careful I think you don't
want to you know creep on certain social
media sites that privacy settings might
not be as obvious to to most out
industry um I also don't think you want
to lead in with something that's
necessarily like oh I read this about
you but I think if you can craft an
answer that you know will play off of
your interviewers strengths or interest
I think that that's helpful in just
relating to the person a little bit
better right anything else out on that
yeah I kind of feel the same way that
that information that you find out about
a person through LinkedIn through other
social media sites that are out there I
think that's all great to have and it's
kind of like some of that back pocket
stuff that stuff that you can use to
craft your answer that you can use to
cater to your interviewer but it's not
something like so I looked you up on
LinkedIn and I saw that you did this
this is amiss and I'd really like to
learn more about that like that's about
the time when I feel a little like I'm
you're inside my circle here back off a
little
you know if I bring it up in an
interview then it's fair game absolutely
but if it's I want to let our interviews
an opportunity for us to learn a lot
about our candidates and the more that
the answer can kind of craft to our
interests that's definitely going to
help in sort of that rapport building
standpoint but the I've read your
biography because I don't have it
written oh that might be a little too
much and I watch your hangout on air
you've got great hair I don't get that
one a lot um all right so we're about
halfway through our hangout on the air
broadcasting live and talk about
non-technical interviews and so what I
want to do is start getting some
questions we've got a bunch of questions
people submitted by a moderator and so
we'll just queue a few those up we'll
get going we've got questions coming in
via Twitter and from the students Plus
page as well so we've got a lot coming
in and we'll just sort of start jumping
through these and see how many we can do
over the next 15 minutes I think the I
think my favorite one here is um you
know water interviewers really looking
for when they ask so tell me about
yourself
I know for me I'm generally not looking
for anything when I ask the question
like that I'm seriously right like I'm
looking to break the ice any a lot of
times people what's going on I was going
and it's completely just ice breaker I
don't know how you guys feel about that
kind of question but I'm sort of just
trying to get people comfy so we can
chat I guess I'm looking I'm looking for
something along those lines I want to I
want to kind of understand what's
important to an individual when they're
coming to interview and I say you know
tell me about yourself I'm not looking
for the life story I'm not looking for a
seven-minute answer this really you know
the 30 to 60 seconds this is where I go
to school here the some big things I've
involved in I've been I've had a couple
of cool internships the one that's most
important to me is this and give me some
give me like a starting point for
conversation from there then you know we
can dive down and do a lot of different
things and it's it's really an
opportunity for for an intern or
candidate to set themselves up for
success put the best foot forward right
away shape my perception of them because
I don't have one yet and I go from there
yeah I would say for me it's quite
frankly just the test to see if you did
your homework and prepared ahead of time
because I think like Ryan said it
shouldn't be a long-winded answer and
for people who have a really succinct
elevator pitch for them shell for
themselves it shows that they've
prepared and that they know exactly what
they want to get across it also tells me
how long winded they're going to be so
if this conversation is going to be very
one-sided if it's going to feel more
interactive between the two of us that
they answer questions concisely get to
the point and let's move on it kind of
sets the tone but also shows me like are
we in this together right yeah no
absolutely cool all right so we're going
to take another question from Lexi Ian
in Chicago this is actually really good
one too how important is it to have
questions prepared at the end of the
interview and then he goes on to say
yeah I feel like it can be four
sometimes I don't really have any
questions w start will sort of boomerang
back around I think it's important to
have questions because I think by the
end of the interview your interviewer is
kind of like done asking questions and
they
want to be on the receiving sites that
they can start talking about themselves
but I think it's really a really good
trick that I learned when I was
interviewing was you're going to be
asked a lot of questions on your
interview a lot of them might be about
your background some might be opinion
questions um some might be just
cognitive challenges but I think it's
always interesting when an interviewer
or interviewee flips the question back
at me and says well you know earlier you
would ask me what my thought was on X Y
&amp;amp; Z I'm curious to know you know what
are your thoughts on this how does the
company um believe towards this etc and
I think it kind of either shows a place
where you can relate to each other and
the interviewer will say you know I
actually agreed with your answer in
which case you can kind of leave the
interview knowing that like score I did
well um or just starts like a healthy
debate healthy conversation back and
forth and you really start having that
conversation in the last few minutes
that's a good trick Brian yeah I'd agree
that it's really important it does
definitely show that you're curious in
what the person is up to just the person
that's sitting across from you or on the
other side of a line also that it shows
that you've done a little bit of extra
research that you get an opportunity to
kind of show off what you know I would
say that though there are definite
cautions with that I think my advice is
always try and constrain your questions
to an area that the interviewer would
have some knowledge of their field their
career path what brought them to Google
what their experiences have been ah it's
a big company a lot of the companies
that students interview for very large
there's a lot of things going on and
there's stuff in the news that we may or
may not have a whole lot of information
about so if it's something that you know
is reasonable it's a fair game is
something that you think that they have
an idea of absolutely but something
that's you know kind of outside their
world of expertise it's kind of that's
kind of like a yeah this was definitely
a prepared question they came up with it
ahead of time they're curious about it
which is great but it doesn't really
jive with what we're going for in the
interview so you know I think it's
important to ask those questions but try
and keep them to the to the area of of
where the interviews gone so far yeah I
think there's two other things that I
like to mention on this run especially
on like a sales interview when I back in
a previous life when I was a nation's
recruiter at least to encourage chemists
you asked for the job
my name you go do you think I'm a good
fit for the job and and I think it in
sales roles that's actually not a bad
question um of course you know that the
fear is always you know what well you're
not oh I shouldn't mess my question but
I feel like I feel like that you know
you can get a lot from that final
question even if it's a question that
you might think is Monday and like so
what's your favorite thing about working
at Google and if you ask every single
interviewer that same question that's
really low-hanging fruit for them you're
going to walk away a lot of informations
I think that those are would be sort of
my two points ask for the job if you're
you know that kind of a person which
most people aren't which is fine
or sort of have one sort of stock
question that you can go back that night
and sort of compare answers and go oh
actually look every single person said
the colleagues are great pool so I'm
going to good place or you know whatever
all right so we're going to get some
more questions we've got about nine
minutes left on our hangout on the air
with Brian and dev talking about
non-technical interviewing we're going
to take one from an KITT on Twitter
which is what's the best way to answer
an unexpected question at the beginning
because he's faced this twice this year
um I said I'll refrain from my joke
about it saying um because I just did
that cuz I was not expecting this
question so Brian I'll put you on the
spot how do you answer unexpected
questions well first thing is that you
shouldn't freak out about it you're
going to get those we deal with that
stuff all the time at work where
something comes up and you don't have an
answer with an interview it's definitely
okay to think for a little bit pause
collect your thoughts I mean if you
brought something to write on and you
want to structure an answer if it's a
complex question but then but if it's
something that you don't have a clue of
how to go about just start talking
through what your thought process would
be to solve that problem if how would
you if you were faced with that problem
in real life how would you walk yourself
through it how would you how would you
what assumptions would you make what
additional information would you need to
have so that you can work to an answer
to a question you're going to get them
they're going to come up and then I
think the thing that most interviewers
are looking for is how would you
approach it how would you tackle it and
then where would you go from there we
come across stuff that we don't know
what to do with a lot at work and so how
would you respond in the
similar situation and if you can you
know tie it back to a story I something
that you this is you know I'm not
exactly sure how to go about this but
something that was similar where I
wasn't where it came across an
unexpected question you can almost turn
the question in some ways and yeah it
doesn't necessarily answer it right away
but if you're really that if you're
really that that out of it on the run on
the wrong page you're not sure where to
go I think that's a definite place to
start I also think it's important to
member that you can have a little bit of
awkward silence and I know that's a
little harder when you're having a phone
interview because you're like a still
there but I think in person it's okay to
kind of take that question by surprise
and think oh wow
I haven't gotten that question before
let me take a minute think about it um I
think you know it's really hard to be
thrown off if you've done your
preparation you know Jeff talked about
thinking of the questions that you would
be asked I think also just think about
three things you want to get like out
there about yourself during the
interview and they might be three words
three anecdotes three experiences
whatever those three things are and if
you keep those three things in the back
of your mind and let the questions be a
little bit more surprising it won't
throw you off if you don't have that
script um and I I think interviewers do
try to throw you off right away because
for business roles like Brian mentioned
you're going to be expected to think on
your feet and it's how you kind of
recover from that that shows if you're
going to be a good fit for the role I
mean the other thing is when you're
interviewing for a job like sales the
interview isn't just to understand would
you be a good fit for the role buy it
how you answer the questions but sales
is selling yourselves and if you can
sell yourself in an interview and
convince me that like you're a great
hire than selling a product you know I
don't have to ask you about I kind of
get that from the interview and how you
conducted it so I would just say breathe
and don't don't prepare so much that you
have a script that you're following
because then it's easier to kind of
divert from that it's necessary when you
guys both mention awkward silence which
I think I mean it's kind of funny and
silly but like I have no problem of
awkward silence in the interview right
actually it's not awkward a minute right
I fully anticipate I'm going to ask you
a question that you don't
the answer and you have to think for a
couple minutes and I'm just not going to
say anything and it might be two minutes
my five minutes it's been as long as 15
that was a little awkward but it happens
and and I think that most you know
students in particular when you're
coming over near view this may be your
first interview your second you're not
used to awkward silence and so no
remember that your interviewer probably
really comfortable there and it's okay
they sort of expect that so I think
that's sort of a big point to we're
going to ask
I've got other one coming in from
moderator from Joe and Vancouver I'll
refrain from the Canucks jokes ruins um
if the interviewer asks a question about
experience and I don't have experience
how do I answer that um devil you start
yeah so this actually happened I guess
to me when I was interviewing for this
job on the universe' program seemed I
didn't have recruiting experience before
I was only on the business side so I
think it's important to know that you do
have experience it just might not be the
experience you think the company is
looking for so don't discount the
stories and the experiences you've had
just because they might not align
perfectly with the job description so
one thing I did was kind of think as the
core responsibilities of what this job
is going to require and have I done
those things in other roles and
sometimes those roles are you know being
a tennis instructor at it at a day camp
or meeting a community service project
in college just just think about the
skills that you have and that have been
displayed in other scenarios and try to
work that in to be your experience um so
but don't discount everything that
you've done before is not being
experienced it is life is a full
experience okay absolutely
Brian what do you got I'd say you know
very similar one of the things that I
always like to tell students is that at
Google we don't have an English
department
we don't have an International Studies
department we don't have a math
department so you know the people that
when you come interviewing with your
major
it doesn't always necessarily fit but
think about all the things that you've
done and what you've done in those roles
and whether you've been paid
firm or not whether you know worked with
customers worked with students worked
with faculty there's all stuff that
comes from their project groups all of
those things give you experience in a
role uh if you really haven't done it
and in any way shape or form then it
might not be a great fit for the role
for you which is also an important part
of an interview is to find out if you're
good fit for the role but also if you
think that it's good match for you so
you know the important the thing that I
would always do is I'd look at what's
all the stuff that I was involved in
what did I do in those roles what were
some of those like core competencies
that Deb talked about and how does that
play over to what companies do in
recruiting in our organization we
organize a lot of events I did a lot of
that in college
so I was able to lean on a lot of those
experiences in when I worked in the when
I worked in the sales or the services
organization for double-click a lot of
that was working with customers and
clients and I'd have a lot of experience
working with faculty who are a little
bit older a little bit more important
than I was at the time so kind of
leaning on some of those experiences and
how you influence them and how you're
able to communicate with people where I
help my parents out with computers all
the time because they're not as tech
savvy and some of the clients that we
work with wouldn't be so how are you how
can you convey those answers so thinking
about just everything that you've done
and how that all fits together and what
things you might be asked for the role I
think that's really important and a lot
of that comes down to have you done your
research ahead of time do you understand
what that role might entail and how you
fit into it and hopefully by then you
can develop a story based on what
experience isn't due yeah and I think
just to sort of pile on just a little
bit I think that one of the the key
parts to that is answering your question
in a way that shows you heard the
question you processed it and you're
giving an answer so as opposed to like
you know hey Jeff have you ever built
computer know like like I haven't so my
answer might be something the iveco you
know I've never actually built a
computer but I have done XYZ that's
actually pretty relevant to what you're
asking me and so answering it in a way
that you show yeah I actually heard what
you asked rather than just saying no I'm
going to say something that's a little
bit more meaningful talks to those
skills but also sort of acknowledging
the fact that your job like blowing by
the actual question to get to this
so as opposed to just sort of seeming
seeming like you're dodging I guess the
sort of how I would phrase it so I think
we've got about a minute or two here
left I'm going to take one more question
from Nathan on Twitter and it's actually
kind of a fun one jokes aside the
question is basically when asked what do
you do for fun what mix of personal
business stories should I use um I find
that to be a tough question because like
I don't like talking about what I like
to like to walk my dog hangout my family
it's not exactly like woo-wee Shire that
guy because he likes to walk his dog um
so I tend to do more sort of business
you and I if I was asked the question I
lean more towards work stuff or stuff
that you could tied to work oh I like to
blog and I'm active in this and you know
those kinds of things so I think it is
off question right I mean I don't think
there's any way to to phrase that but I
think that I think I would lean more
towards business with a sprinkling of
personal as opposed to like I mean I
guess unless I do something so cool that
I have like you know I rebuild you know
vintage cars that I sell for thousands
of dollars okay that's pretty cool but I
don't know I think I think I would leave
more stores businessí stuff that would
what he got there I would use this
question as an opportunity to kind of
take whatever you weren't able to convey
and those more straightforward interview
questions and get that third pillar out
there so if I was asked this and no
one's really talked to me or no the
questions lend it to me talking about
how great I am is working with people I
might use this question say I love
watching sports and I love watching
sports because I'm a team player I can
relate really well um to the camaraderie
within sports and etc etc and that kind
of shows that one I'm into sports but
two it's more about teamwork and it's
about being around people and um kind of
twist it to kind of get that last point
through yeah that's a good angle through
on that side Ryan I think I think
approaching any interview you want to
have kind of a if when this person stops
talking to me that these are the four or
five things three to five things that
they actually leave with and know about
me and kind of like Deb said you know I
wasn't able to convey those through
another answer I think that's a great
way to do it for me I volunteer
a lot I take a week off every summer to
go volunteer and it's something that
I've never gotten directly asked about
on a resume so it's something that I
always like to bring up in some capacity
and I think I think that type of
question is is a really good one to do
it it's kind of a it's a softball in a
lot of ways but you got to be prepared
for it you got to kind of expect it yeah
say this is what I'm gonna take it if I
get it
it should also show kind of what you're
passionate about I think it should be
able to demonstrate this is the stuff
that I would do if I wasn't getting paid
for it so I also am really into wine and
I enjoy doing that so I enjoy talking to
people about it teaching about it
sampling it if you will different
wineries I'm learning a lot about the
business so I think I think that's
something that that's kind of cool and I
enjoy talking about that with people and
I think that that could come up in some
capacity too so any anything that you
know gives it a little bit more about
you as a person that you can't get from
a resume you haven't got not an
interview it's a great way to use that
question and sort of tie back to how you
might fit to the company of the role
right exactly yeah cool
well I think that was our last question
so again Brian after last weekend this
week thank you sir for attending our
hang on the air we appreciate it and Deb
