up at a school called North Central
College because I wanted to stay close
to my family and I could pay for an
all-night waitressing I worked as an APM
an associate product manager intern at
Google it meant that I was the person
who was driving the life of a product I
ended up working on Google+ search which
was really cool because I started on it
before he had even launched I had a lot
of responsibility at first I felt it was
a little overwhelming because I was
doing all these things I had never done
before I was the one who was driving a
lot of the decisions we were making I
ended up making the page for signed out
search which was the first experience
anyone got in the new Google+ search and
so basically I owned this page that tons
of people were gonna land on when search
was actually launched and getting to see
something that you did and up on Google
is a really cool experience now that I'm
a full time Googler I work on Google+
and security as a software engineer I
get to make sure that every piece of
code that touches our users goes out
safely I can go and talk to someone
about code and I can also go to and talk
to someone about karate
I think Googlers are really interesting
and I think that's such a cool thing is
that it's a community of whatever you
want it's one of the most friendly
places I've ever been as an intern you
really do get exposed to so much the
inclusion at Google is different than
anywhere else I've ever been they want
you to know about everything they also
let you take all of the classes that are
available to regular engineers so I
snuck into a few Python ones which was a
lot of fun I think Google has really
allowed me to dream as a person it's
really important this company to do
something big to take moonshots if you
will three months doesn't sound like a
lot of time but when you're spending all
of this time in an environment that
really grows you and wants you to learn
you have a chance to really accomplish
anything you put your mind to you can be
from small town Illinois or you can be
from wherever you are the best thing you
can have is passion if you're really
interested in the user if you're really
interested in the online space I think
Google is the best place you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
