people op staffing team hi I'm Meg I'm
with the communications to human people
operations and I was at Google start
associate and we're here today to talk
about the Google start program for the
past couple of weeks we've been getting
questions on our Google students
Facebook page and our Google students
twitter feed and you guys have been
posting those questions on Google
moderator so we're going to go through
some of the questions that got the most
votes and get you some of those answers
about the start associate program sounds
good let's see what you guys have okay
so first won't you tell us where you're
from and where you went to school away
major so I'm from Kentucky I went to
school up in New York at Cornell
University and I double majored in
comparative literature and Spanish and
that's definitely like something that
you see throughout the Start program we
have majors all across before the
humanities and we had some people in
math and sciences as well cool okay so
our first question comes from Maddie and
she wants to know what is the Star
program so the google Start program is
basically kind of a network in a
community for new graduates who are
hired at Google and the non technical
field so that means everything that's
not engineering and it includes like our
sales department and also our people
operations department great okay so our
second question comes from jazzy and
Kolkata why and how did you get to be a
google store associate so my experience
was maybe a little bit different than
others because I was a Google bold
intern in the summer of two thousand
eight so after my internship experience
was over at the end of the summer I did
some interviews and then I was converted
to a full-time employee and that's kind
of how i joined the Start program was
exciting great and MJ bakken washington
wants to know what position within the
Start program did you participate in so
in the Start program I was at the people
operations department we're doing kind
of a job analysis project where we're
looking at our job descriptions and kind
of clarifying those for you know people
to understand what's involved in neutral
and now i'm with the communications team
as i said so we work on kind of connect
googlers with the information that they
need great Julian Chicago wants to know
describe a typical day in the life of a
Google services yet so there's no real
typical day it's kind of exciting and
kind of different each day as you go
along everything from having meetings
with different people all across the
company that's one really nice benefit
is that you get to meet with people more
senior and also newer people as well so
it gives you some great experience also
tons of brainstorming sessions with your
teams you guys can just kind of sit in a
room and try and figure out the best
processes and ways to do things and then
of course like the individual work time
so you know writing documents putting
together spreadsheets things like that
great and Ben wants to know what do you
like about your job and what's your
least favorite aspect to your job so
definitely my favorite thing about
working at Google is the people we have
a lot of like really quirky exciting
interesting people I think that makes it
really refreshing and awesome to come to
work every single day my least favorite
thing is trying to schedule meetings
with those people because they're all
really busy Brendan in Texas wants to
know what is the best advice that you
have to get accepted in this jar program
yeah so I mean I know it can be kind of
overwhelming when you're applying for a
new job especially a company like Google
where you know the recruiting process is
maybe more involved in other places I
know that at google it really helps if
you're just really honest and open in
your interviews so go into it thinking
of it as an interactive process you want
to ask a lot of great questions to find
out more about the company and see if
it's a good fit for you and also think
about what you can bring to the table
and what makes you unique and how you'll
add to google okay and our last question
comes from RZA and malaysia wants to
know what actually do you feel when you
become an employer that's a great
question i think it's really fun to talk
to different people at the company about
that it was a really awesome moment for
me I called my parents i called my
grandparents my whole face
right away it's very humbling though
because you realized how many brilliant
people are here at the company and I was
just so thrilled to be able to be a part
of that going forward great well thanks
a lot Meg and for those of you who are
interested in applying for the Start
program for 2010 just go to google.com /

opportunities section you'll see not
only the Start program application but
