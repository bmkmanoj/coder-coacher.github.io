hangouts on air this is our second hang
out that we're having for our Black
History Month series and this time we're
going to be talking to Googlers and
non-technical roles so to start off we
can introduce ourselves and since this
includes me I can talk to so I'm Britain
you saw me yesterday with our engineers
and I'm actually working on the people
operations communications team and we're
going to start and go around and
everyone can introduce themselves so I
have a guest sitting right next to me so
she can started hi everyone my name is
Yolanda I'm the director of global
diversity inclusion at Google as well as
talent outreach program which is
basically a fancy way of saying my team
helps to hire new grads coming into
Google around the world my name is taupe
I also work in people operations I work
on our central staffing team and I work
on helping advertise our jobs online
until today where you went to school
also I'm the Stanford Graduate I'm
villanova undergrad Stanford Graduate
School okay Elena you can go again hi my
name is Elena I attended the university
of central florida and i have been at
Google for almost three years now and I
am on the benefits team specifically
working on our wellness centers hello
everyone my name is Rachel Spivey i
graduated from hampton university and i
work on the offer view team so my team
goes with a lot of hiring here at Google
hi everyone my name is Jana Landon I
graduated from Dartmouth a couple months
ago in June and now i'm on the
university programs team so I do a lot
of the programs on on campuses and help
with hiring new grads perfect well thank
you everybody for joining us today and
right now we saw on the blog we heard
about Yolanda and Jana's packed google
so how about the rest of you tell us
what really got you into Google what was
your path how did you end up in the tech
industry and Elena you can start
sure so I got to Google um by being bold
in turn I was currently at an internship
that I did not like it all so I randomly
searched on Google and found the bold
internship program in 2008 so I did that
the summer 2008 and then I was hired on
full-time in 2009 and i started at
Google about a year after I graduated
from college I was looking for jobs
involved media and I actually saw a job
posting on a job board and I applied and
I actually started out as a temp in our
online sales department working with the
AdWords product so I've had a number of
different jobs since then both in sales
and then I transferred to people
operations about two and a half years
ago so my path has been kind of long and
winding but I'm really happy where I am
now hey Rachel yeah I graduated what
Google came to my campus in 2008 I came
to Hamptons campus and that was my first
introduction to Google and I really love
it I fell in love with just the
atmosphere here and the environment and
then I ended up coming to Google about a
year later and I started in the same
alum and now so I've been at Google
almost two years nice as for me in 2008
my friend convinced me to try this
internship called the bold internship
that Google had just launched and having
never thought that I was that interested
in technology I applied for it anyway
and I ended up on the global university
program stamen realize just how much fun
the tech industry is how fast it moves
all the challenges that are unique to
the tech industry and basically the
impact that technology is making on the
world which I find to be really
interesting and after my internship I
had a job offer and went and did a
fellowship in South Africa under my
University's name for a year and then I
came back to Google and since then
I've been a rotational associate first
working with the HR team at YouTube and
now i'm on the people operations
communications team so a lot of us
really talked about the bold internship
program a lot of us had our start there
so it'd be great if we could talk a
little bit about bold and your
experience being an intern and basically
what you've learned being an intern and
how it's how to change since you've been
here as a full timer Elena do you want
to start us off sure I was that again
and so my experience being a boat in
turn was completely different than being
a full-time employee one of the main
reasons being that out in turn in ann
arbor which is one of our smaller
offices and i started on these those
training teams so basically I was tasked
with training our facility employees and
employees and getting them ripped up to
start their jobs and then when I was
hired on full-time I became a rotational
associate as well within our HR
organization and then I started in cells
HR but bold really helped me in the
transition from being an intern into
being a full-time employee it really you
know taught me the organizational skills
that I needed it taught me how to
network with my teammates how to wrap up
quickly in my job so it was very
valuable experience and I wouldn't trade
it and it was my key to get in the door
here at Google so very appreciative of
that program so I actually talked a lot
about bold in the blog but uh it mean
it's an amazing program and it's why I
came back I really enjoyed my summer and
the work I was doing something maybe I
didn't talk about in the blog was also
the mentorship component to vote and so
I'm actually sitting right next to my
mentor from that summer rachel was a
great mentor and it's nice to have
someone who's not too far and age away
from you to help you out and really help
you navigate
um as an intern and you know it goes
beyond professional advice you know she
runs one weekend we went to the beach
because I hadn't been to the beach out
here so it helped to definitely have a
network of professionals but also
friends when I got out here nice and at
Google we have employee resource groups
one of them being the black Googlers
network or BGN and I know a lot of us
have had positive experiences being a
part of BGN so total can you saw us off
telling us a little bit about BGN and
your experience with BGN yeah so I was
actually here when medians started it's
probably about five years ago and we
were at the time some of the other black
Googlers and I were just kind of looking
for a way where we could do more
outreach in terms of recruiting students
from historically black colleges and
universities and you know helping to
build a more diverse workforce so we
started the employee resource group pdn
and so we we did a lot of work around
outreach but then also just around
community building within Google you
know it's the tech industry doesn't have
a high representation of
african-americans or blacks so it was a
great way to network to to bond with one
another so we do social events but then
we've also done service events as well
and you know one of my favorite events
is the New Orleans trips that we've done
so I gotta to go to New Orleans of a
community service trip in 2010 where we
spent a few days doing various projects
in the Lower Ninth Ward working with
different educational groups and it was
just a really rewarding experience a way
to to give back first of all and then
also but also just to bond with with
colleagues and different departments
that's one of the great things about BGN
is that you know at Google sometimes you
tend to be a little bit siloed in terms
of you know having your set your set of
colleagues in your department but BGN
was a great way to network with other
black Googlers you know in different
apartments and then also in different
offices as well awesome and Rachel I
know you've been active in BG and also
can you tell us about some of your
experiences being a part of BGN sure
yeah so BGN have been great I've seen it
grow tremendously since I've come to
Google about two years ago especially
like door black history month we've been
very active who's had tons and tons of
events from political speakers academic
speakers musicians come we've had we
even incorporated Black History Month
into our culinary cuisine for the month
we did culinary internships we've had a
step show we've done just a lot of
different things that have been really
fun and I think it's a great atmosphere
and I really appreciate the fact that
Google is so supportive of us doing all
these events in the name of the black
coolers network and it's just been great
being here and release the support the
company has I've seen through the ER G's
which are the employee resource groups
right well a lot of people are
interested in career development once
they get a job and Yolanda I know that
you have great experience that's it so
can you talk a little bit about career
development at Google and just in
general absolutely I think one of the
nice things about Google is that you can
really write your own career path and I
think listening to told the story around
how we got two people operations i
starred in sales when got two people ops
is a great example um if in it for those
of you who read the blog my blog post
you'll know that I had started my career
in a fairly structured environment so
investment banking and management
consulting which are very clear career
paths assortment up about upper out
mentality um but not a lot of sort of
variance in different paths that you can
take Google is sort of on the complete
opposite end of the spectrum there and
it's really about to where you're
interested so on my team I have I've had
a number of people come over here from
sales and sometimes earn recruiting I
have a fellow on my diversity team who
does business development work around
diversity so he goes and helps to bring
more minority owned business
minority-owned businesses online and
then gives them the tools to grow their
businesses
I've had people who have seen people who
know less people ops and gone into into
product marketing product marketing and
enjoying their sort of entry-level
particle product marketing program so
it's really about what your interest is
and and try and there's lots of
opportunities to try and pry out new
things so we have this concept of twenty
percent and I know we get folks from
from finance volunteering for like
different k12 activities on my team who
wanted to try it out before they
actually make a step but there's lots
lots of freedom there isn't a structured
path it's really what you make of it um
and I think I feel like my career is
sort of testament to that I had started
us individual contributor ran a central
staffing business and now have a fairly
varied portfolio things that I'm
responsible for now but it's really what
you make of it so one thing that I know
people would love to hear from you is
basically all of you how did you get
interested in the technology industry
having not been a computer science major
this is something that is very
interesting because for myself I didn't
even know that you could work in the
tech industry without doing computer
science or engineering but there are a
lot of people who are potentially really
interested in things like working at
Google or working in the tech industry
that may not know that you can do
without being a computer scientist so
total can you start and tell us
basically what attracted you either to
Google or the tech industry even if you
weren't planning on being a software
engineer yeah you know someone who I
didn't know that Google higher
non-engineers and so when I first saw
the the job opening for someone in you
know kind of online sales support I was
like wow I didn't know google have that
kind of operate I grew up in Silicon
Valley so you know the tech industry has
always sort of been there I bought it
but to be honest I never expected to
have a job at you know at at an Internet
focus company like Google growing up but
you know throughout college I I'd always
you know paid attention to it you know
I'm always always been interested in
personal technology and in communication
new media so you know I i think you know
in looking for jobs in Silicon Valley
you can't you sort of couldn't help but
but come across jobs from big big
technology companies like Google at the
time so it was a natural fit for me
because I was able to find a job that
matched my skills but then also my
interests in a place like Google and you
know one thing I'll say is that even for
those those of us who aren't engineers
or who aren't you know intimately
involved with products you still get
really involved in in all of our
products and all of our releases that
come out and just being here there's an
energy around it and you really get the
sense of you know your work is
contributing to the products that we
offer into building the teams that are
going to build those products and just
to add on to that for those of you out
there who may be interested in law or
communications or marketing or even
philanthropy the tech industry has all
of this you just may not realize it and
a lot of it you can do within a big
company and an example of that would be
that I do communications but within
Google we have marketing teams here we
have lawyers here we have so many
different parts of different industries
all within the tech industry so you
don't necessarily have to be an engineer
to get inside the tech industry or
inside Google jaana do you want to talk
a little bit just going along with this
things that you find interesting in the
tech industry or how you got here sure
so similar to what a lot of people said
Google Katie to Dartmouth campus and
delivered a presentation and that's when
I really realized that even though i'm
not an engineering person or a CS person
that of course technology applies to me
the technology is a part of all of our
lives on some examples that were given
in the presentation that really stood
out to me was the ways that google for
instance use its search algorithm to
connect families and times of crisis
around the world it it was clear to me
that it's so much bigger than a search
engine that
we almost automatically go to to find
out whatever we need but that they're
doing things all over the world and that
it was really inspirational because it
was a chance for me to be a part of that
and just this broader mission of using
technology to make the world a better
place hurry Rachel do you want to add to
that sure I think what's funny is I was
actually a marketing major in school but
when i thought about google i didn't
really think of it as a tech company i
thought of it's an innovation company
I've seen like Google take its knowledge
and its intellectual capital and just
solve the world's problems not just
quote unquote tech problems so I that's
what I kind of viewed it as and I just
wanted to be a place where innovation
was thriving and people weren't afraid
to make mistakes and people weren't
afraid to try things and you know put
their foot out there so that's what kind
of attracted me to google yeah Elena how
about you tell us a little bit yeah like
we go I was also a marketing major and
Google actually didn't come to my campus
at all to recruit but I do remember one
of my professors using google as an
example of a company that did non
traditional marketing and so I
automatically thought to myself like him
they have to be onto something if
they're not using the traditional way to
do things so that kind of piqued my
interest a little bit and you know with
further research you I really found out
that google was very innovative and fast
paced and I think that's what I love
about the tech industry and working
within tech is that things move so
quickly and we're on the brink of
everything it when you think about it
tech touches everything so I think
whatever you're passionate about you can
somehow map it back to technology and
that's what I really like about you know
working in tech any longer what's your
experience it's been really really great
I think I had a similar experience
dystrophy tolu and Elena that I when I
started when I was decided that was
pretty for a new job and I started
looking at companies Google didn't come
to mind because I didn't think of it as
a
I thought it was an engineering company
I had a friend at the fete at the
company was working at who um had a
frontier and he said you should look at
Google Google's hiring and so um I came
in and talked to her friend who who ran
business operations and people
operations at the time and the more I
the more people I talked to the more
excited I got this was about six years
ago now in Google was at an interesting
inflection point it had about five or
six thousand people there weren't a lot
of people processes in place I had
really interesting people problems to
solve and when I thought about um what I
like to do it was around it was it was
solving big problems and good and Google
just brought it brought to it that from
a technology point of view and so it's
been a tremendous learning experience I
you know often you talk to new grads
sort of you know in my role around the
kind of opportunities that are available
technology place like Google and that
you don't have to be an engineer to have
it to make a difference in the world i
think i look at your people operations i
look at sales and we're making big
impacts all the time and i think an
interesting thing to talk about maybe is
everybody if they could just share their
major I heard that we have two people
that did marketing and the people that
I've sat next to at work I've sat next
to someone who did film studies I've SAT
like someone who did anthropology i sat
next someone who did Russian studies so
really there's so many things that you
can do and still work here and use those
interests I study sociology and I think
this is a natural fit because a lot of
the work that we do involves people and
that's what sociology is what was your
undergrad major i was making alex major
mmm i was a communications major and a
poli-sci minor and and one funny story
were talking about all the different
majors that you work with my first
manager majored in modern thought and
literature I was a psychology major and
I actually was pre-med when I first
started out in school um so like so many
of us um but I was coming at it from
sticking with psychology for the medical
point but now I see a lot of relevant
types of psychology like organization
change in behavior but within my my team
we have someone who's a German major we
have someone who was an art history
major on econ major just a bunch of
different majors I even met a poetry
major he's in finance wow I am heard
about a person who was recently hired at
Google and her major was persuasive
speaking oh I thought that was really
interesting the artist speaking in a
persuasive manner for those of you who
are just joining us this is our hangout
on air for Black History Month series
and we're going on to our last questions
this is something I'd like to ask
everybody which is what is one of your
favorite things about either working at
Google or in this industry can be a
moment that you had where you're like
huzzah this is amazing or just a general
feeling um Yolanda you look like you're
pensive and I'm thinking I mean I think
my favorite thing about Google is the
people that I get to work with every day
I love my job I love coming to work I
work with some of the smartest people in
the world I think and I learned from
something from them every single day and
at the end of the day I think a company
is only as good as its employees and I
think we have some of the best yeah some
of them we were on the people theme one
of the one of my favorite perks that we
have here is our speaker series so it's
called Google talks originally called
authors at Google but then it expanded
to musicians at Google candidate to
google so seeing some of those those
speakers come through Barack Obama came
back when he was Senator Obama 2007 so
seeing him speak was was just a definite
highlight and you know some of the great
authors and celebrities that we've had
here you know just come to you know my
place of work it's just mind-boggling so
that's that's probably my favorite thing
I would have to say piggybacking off
what you're on the said definitely the
people one and then I think the freedom
to be creative and think crazy a think
of crazy ideas and
not have people look at you like what is
she doing um but view supportive and
really help you think through your crazy
ideas and if they make sense go with
them if not let's storm for later
because they may make sense later so I
would just have to say the people and
the ability to think creatively yeah i
like i like the fact that impact can
come from all levels at google's that
you could have been here for a couple of
days it could have been an intern you
could have been here for many years and
that um it's it's an equal playing field
for you to have an impact and I talked a
little bit about it in the blog just
being able to have a significant project
at an intern as an intern um and just
how it proves that you really can't have
an impact no matter your experience
level here I think my favorite thing is
the element of surprise you never know
what's going to happen in Google you
could wake up tomorrow and trey songz
could be on campus riding a bike and you
just don't know and you to go out what
are your cube and Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's gonna be
there you just you never know or just or
you could be going to cirque du soleil
the next day you just never know what
could happen at your day at work and
that's something I really appreciate it
keeps you on your toes it keeps you
excited to come back to working so
what's going to happen next so yeah as
cheesy as that sounds I think my
favorite part about working at Google is
really the impact that we make
everywhere and even though I personally
don't directly work on a specific
product at Google it really makes me
happy to think every day that we're
really changing how people use the
internet and how the internet is being
fed into people's lives if it's you know
helping people get on the internet to
get their businesses promoted or as we
talked about before using people finder
to find people in times of crisis like
the tsunami in Japan or the earthquake
in Haiti there are so many things that
our company does it has such a huge
impact on the entire world and i think
that's amazing i I just love that well
we can ask our last question what does
Black History Month mean to you you can
start
okay thank you ready for me it's like I
was born in the 70s actually 1978 and so
I don't remember when i was in school
learning a lot about the contributions
of that african-americans made to US
history I mean it wasn't until I got
older but I that I started to learn
about like George Washington Carver and
I think the guy who invented the
stoplight was actually an
african-american and so to me it's a way
with there's been a long and interesting
history of serving of blacks in the US
and I think Black History Month to me is
sort of a celebration of all those other
ways that black Americans have
contributed that history and how much
they are fabric of of the u.s. story as
as the Italian immigrants you know from
the early 1900's so to me it's a
celebration of all of all the great ways
that blacks have contributed to the
fabric of the US for me it's about
setting examples for a future generation
you know just going over the history of
you know all the different contributions
that blacks have made you realize you
know how brave it was for certain people
to you know break color barriers and a
lot of different industries and it is
just a celebration of those who have
come before us and you know and it makes
me remember that you know our generation
now is going to set the example for the
generation to come after us so it to me
it's just the continuation of a history
that's ongoing when me I would have to
say it's a month of collection I think
we hear the term my black is 365 which
is true like your black 365 days of the
year but for me it's a time to really
slow down and think about and reflect on
our history which will never change and
really look forward to where we're going
to as tolu say you know we're setting up
initiatives and things for future
generations so it's really looking back
and seeing what everyone who came before
us on way through
and then how we can aid and making it a
better future for those who are coming
now I definitely feel as though Black
History Month is a time for learning and
also passing it on so I think just
growing up it's a probably a lot more
learning and i still no matter how would
i get learn just something new every
black history month about contributions
to history but also as I've gotten older
it's about passing on that knowledge to
other people and so on just even with
these events we've been putting on at
Google through BGN it's been great to be
able to just share and learn from other
people I think for me Black History
Month is about celebration its
celebrating where we've been where we
where we are now and where we're going
to in the future it's just like a great
time for recognition and to celebrate
our culture because it's amazing how I
want to thank all of you for coming
today and thank everybody who's watching
remember you can always go to ww goggle
calm students for our internship
postings or scholarships and our
full-time new grad positions or
google.com slash jobs for our other
full-time positions and stay tuned to
the Google students Google+ page for
month more fun things like this thanks
