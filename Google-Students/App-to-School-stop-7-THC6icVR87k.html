the George Washington University here to
personally welcome Google than the
Google bus to George Washington's campus
we had a fantastic implementation of
google mail all the students love it
we're glad that they're here to be able
to thank them in person
with gmail I suppose it's that I don't
never have to delete any mail I just
keep it all because I huge storage the
spam filters a fantastic the search
function lets me quickly find you know
whatever I need if I was in contact with
an advisor something to school and I
need some information that I've
forgotten it's really easy just to dig
that right back up with the search
I like the document thing you can send
it to other people and they can edit it
while you're still working on it that
saves time that's like you don't have to
like the whole thing send it to them
wait for them to edit and send it back
you can just like do it right there I
use Google Docs to set up my whole
wedding RSVP list so basically my mom's
getting the RSVPs which use in
Massachusetts I'm here in DC and then my
fiancee needs to see what's going on too
so we have a shared document so the RCP
is coming to her she updates the shared
document I can look and see foods I
repeated my fiance conceived it's really
easy so at like Google Docs
I really liked the calendar feature and
that I have separate colors for like
homework versus parties versus classes
and I can make them appear or disappear
at different times and so that's really
helpful to just keep myself organized at
a glance I'm an officer for a student
organization we made a google calendar
for everyone in the student organization
that way we can all put our class
schedule on to one calendar it makes it
really easy when we're trying to
schedule officer meeting because we all
know what each other's in class
after braving the rain at George
Washington University we spent a day
with students showing them how they can
use Google applications inside and
outside of classrooms to make their
lives a little bit easier so let us know
how you use Google Apps upload your
