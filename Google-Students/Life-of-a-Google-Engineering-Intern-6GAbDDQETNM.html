the Google students YouTube channel
thanks for tuning in today I know some
of you might be in classes it's
lunchtime there or you're just waking up
during the summer vacation but it's
great to have all of you here we're
really excited and I quickly go over the
agenda with you today of what we're
going to go through we're going to have
about five questions so we have for all
our interests here today we're going to
go over the interview process talk about
student programs and also have more time
for all of you to provide more questions
for us so just to get started let's get
to know who's here today so I'm
Charlotte I'm a university program
specialist basically Singapore hi
everybody I'm sneaked up I'm doing my
computer engineering graduation from the
National University of Singapore Pia
walking with me everyone I'm computer
science undergrad and NTU in Singapore
and I'm with the other team great thanks
great to have all of you here and you to
know where all of you are tuning in from
so as you can see on the right side of
this video there's a live chat box and
we got some chat moderators that are
going to be able to answer your
questions so go ahead and tell us give
us a quick hello from the country or the
city or wherever you're tuning in from
or the school even not just to quickly
go for internships
we're going to share that part of the
experience is for you to just learn
apply what you've learned in school and
also get development adventures to
opportunities while you're at Google and
of course we want you to make sure
so as you can see all of our interns
here are based in the Singapore office
but this is not the only office you can
apply for if you see this list this
shows all the offices an impact will be
hiring interns so feel free to apply to
any of these take a look at what
countries you might be interested in
applying and you don't have to only
apply to software engineering they can
also apply to a UX intern and other
technical opportunities there as well so
we're going to get started I have about
five questions for all of our interns
here today and around the fourth
question you can start typing your own
life questions so the first one can you
share kind of about your journey about
Google so in the last five or six years
I do not remember even a single day
where I haven't used a Google product so
that's where I started getting
interested in working for a company who
makes such amazing products that
everybody uses every day so I kept
pestering my mentors my supervisors
professors asking them like how what do
I need to do what do I study how do I
prepare they recommended I treat
cracking the coding interview a book by
Gail Lachman as my particle and so I
started reading up on it I really get up
or practicing the algorithms and that's
where my journey started cool I love
that under your Android oh I actually
have practice okay cool this is how the
book works
make sure pretty good
since like when I was really young and
so five of time a few times I'm only now
so I guess that shows them a lot of
people can get into Google on their
first try and that's continuing normal
so don't give up and what do you like so
I've always had a passion for building
things that I can call my own and even
though Google is this massive company it
does generally operate like a start-up
internally and we do build great
products and rapidly prototype and
things like that so that's where I found
my calling
so of what you can tell us all
internships have a project can be sure
it's a little bit about what project
you're working on so I don't know how
many of your new book I know it's a
smart messaging app the Google launched
in September last year so I'm working
with the Android team at the ILO's
Android team and I don't know how much
more I can reveal about that so yeah
yeah and from me I'm working on systems
monitoring and reporting might have even
being the different metrics such as the
several agencies and there are base and
reporting so they're the rest of my team
the software engineers can also know
that what's going on in your backends
and I'm working on a project that hasn't
been released by the ten years
cool yep uh moles are working on the
other team on a feature I can't tell you
anything about great so very mysterious
all our entrance projects are but it's
pretty normal on your at Google and is
pretty cool as well
as we all know Google has a lot of perks
we have pretty cool offices so what is
your favorite person for me it's knowing
about the project that everybody at
Google is working on so I can just
randomly pick anybody on google shot or
whatever internal Messenger will be
using and ask that like I'm really
interested in a project tell me more
about it and they won't hesitate we just
come up deal
you can go meet them for a coffee chat
and they'll tell you everything you want
to know so that's really cool what about
your favorite providing you with food
and
is there like an Omega value of this
ever yeah yeah as someone who lived on a
diet period junk food the honey food and
the GM is welcome change to my life
great so awesome to have all these perks
and during an internship you can really
have the chance to experience the
culture here at Google and that's kind
of the best part of an internship
it gets really experience the culture
and the real life of whatever company
you're interning for actually so we have
a lot of people in the audience that
they may be interested and how can we a
sees interviews to Google or in fact any
company that you're in training for so
what is your best interview audience a
five people with
for an interview procedure where you're
supposed to call online and talk to the
interviewer at the same time so there
will be times when you have a difficult
question and you don't know what to do
next so you will just stop keep watching
your brain thinking what should I say
what should i type so don't do that keep
talking to your interviewer they are
very helpful people they've been opposed
to the process many times so I think
what did I remember that it's not an
examination your final answer does
matter but what also matters is the way
you came to keep explaining your thought
process if you're going the wrong
direction if you might even correct you
so it's a good it's a good way to sort
of correct yourself if you are going in
the wrong direction
great these are awesome tips for of
yours thanks so much now this is a great
time to start typing in your questions
in the live chat in case you might have
any
and we'll start answering them after we
answer this question so lastly what is
your favorite part about being an
employer um for me it's being around
such and such amazing people super smart
to know everything you want to ask them
like they have an answer ready for every
question you have it's just amazing yeah
and my favorite part is like just the
range of technologies and things that I
can learn right now I'm working on like
many different languages python named
typescript and even we can't even start
that things from other teams as well
that we get to meet people from great
great with each other about machine
learning and us working on this like
very interesting as well
yeah what I like the best is how
transparent it is internally even though
you're an intern you pretty much have
the same access as a full-time employee
and you can look at any project that's
been working bid work done at any part
of Google and see how they've done it
and that's that's really great thanks
now there's looking of the live chat we
don't have any questions yet so we're
going to stay that till the end and
we'll just move on forward to the
internship interview process so when
you're applying for a job at Google the
process will be going through four
interviews is that it will go through
two to three phone interviews first and
you'll be also talking with an engineer
going through a review about which
projects will be most best before we
also go through a hiring committee and
then you'll finally get to author's name
so this entire process can take about I
don't know three weeks but also several
months I know that some of your process
has varies throughout this is a time
before you got here I'm now moving on to
the specific details for phone
interviews just a few tips you've
already heard several former insurance
here today just remember to manually
invent in case you're not used to that
make sure you have your cell phone
charged because this is a phone
interview after all find a fire location
be comfortable don't be running on a
treadmill when it's time for your
interviews or like inside McDonald's
eating your hamburger I mean if that's
what makes you comfortable that works
too how about pen and paper ready for
scribbling and code and writing your
ideas and really remember to think out
loud and make sure to communicate
everything you're thinking
every they want to know everything it
not just the solution and I'm moving on
to how you can apply just remember to go
to this website student couriers come on
a little website and just find what
rolls fit best for you can apply to more
than one don't find it like 10 to 20 we
recommend maybe two or three that you
think you're really well fit for if you
know a Googler it could be in any office
they can also be even as an employer you
bro
make sure you upload your resume just
clicks a minute and lastly we have two
programs so you can keep a look out for
we have women techmakers we just
selected our scholars for this year but
in keeps next year you're interested in
applications go put around around eight
roller so and you'll have the next
program that we also have code Jam
kickstart so many of you may be familiar
with code Jam that's from the North
America teams but we have coach on kick
start in eight packets is a coding
puzzle platform where you can develop
your coding skills and just practice so
the next round starts on the Sunday
and you can go out to that website to
see if you might be interested in if you
want register lastly we have additional
resources for all of you to go in and
take note take a screenshot of this
slide and just see if this might be
useful to you and you can use it when
you're applying for internships or maybe
even a job next I think we have some
time left let's see if we have any
questions from our viewers on the live
chat oh looks like we have a question
can interns get to pick their own
projects so after you go through the
interview process there's this intern
questionnaire that you're supposed to
fill in that by you write what you're
interested in why you're interested in
what you're looking to learn from Google
etc so that really plays an important
role in selecting what project you
eventually will be working on so that is
very important like make sure you fill
that up correctly and precisely so yeah
you do have some control over what
project you will be working on to that
even if you are assigned any project you
do have the option to speak to your
manager and change that project or take
that in a direction that you want you to
go in so you always have that option how
does it feel to work on a mystery
project through a mystery team without
being able to talk about it much fun day
when I office I joined the team which I
didn't know about and they told me about
for Jen which I've never heard about
before in my life and it's a really big
feeling that you're working on something
you that you are one of the first but
they're having a hands on the project
and just like a paddle I think using a
new product yeah cool well I think
that's about all of our questions that
we have today thank you all for joining
hopefully you were able to learn
something new from this live session
we'll have a couple more coming up but
do keep a lookout and thank you all for
joining us feel free to stop the
feedback link in case you'd like to let
us know about what we did well when we
could improve on and any last words from
partners don't give up and keep trying
