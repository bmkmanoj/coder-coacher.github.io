creating a game called scar DS dice
here's a quick overview of how the game
works
scar nice dice is a turn-based dice game
on their turn each player rolls the die
until they either choose to end their
turn or they roll a one in which case
their turn automatically ends with no
score so for example here's Alice and
Bob playing a game of scar nice dice
Alice goes first and rolls of five she
could end her turn but she decides to
roll again she gets a six so now her
total score for this turn is 11 she
decides to end her turn so her score for
this turn is added to her total score
it's Bob's turn to roll he gets a three
he decides to end his turn and take his
three points
now Alice begins her second turn in
rolls of four she decides to roll again
but unfortunately rolls a 1 that means
her current turn automatically ends with
no points Alice and Bob carry on with
their turns until one of them reaches a
hundred or more in this activity you
will create an app that allows a user to
place carnies dice against the computer
you will create the user interface for
the game to be played as well as write
the code to roll the die keep track of
the points and reset the game you will
also write the code for the computer to
play its turn we hope you enjoy coding
scar knees dice and learning about
creating you eyes in event-driven
programming in the process be sure to
check out the extensions on the activity
page for ideas to improve your app
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
