of its kind in the region
the selection process of these students
was very tough this is the forum where
they can express themselves this is a
great opportunity the Google Student
Ambassador Program is very simple
students come to this training they stay
for one week they have fun they learn
many things and they go back home to
their own countries to help their own
University gets in touch with Google
help their colleagues learn more about
the tools and of course for their own
selves gather the experience and have
also something to place on the city
anakata been the hard archana i beliefs
of the dead.the para para whom
technology is done that I get another
head bath it's really exciting to
surround myself with students that like
technology that want to actually tackle
big problems and it's also exciting to
see a company like Google launching a
program very close to the students in
the part of the world these types of
events allow us to not only you know
tell people about our products but also
get feedback and listen to what the
community has to say a lot of us
students have business ideas or talents
and insula could really help these two
in show casts but they have especially
with Google food whether it's you cuber
Adwords or chrome this is the forum
where they can express themselves talk
to us and bounce those ideas off of us
hearing their stories understanding
what's important to them is really what
excites me about being here they gave
you a very important role that would
influence millions of people and that
they gave the responsibilities that they
would give to full-time employees we
look for the perfect combination of
work-life balance people with good
grades who have hobbies were interesting
to talk to and with skills perfectly
fitted to their top so whatever you're
applying for make sure that you like
that job regardless of your experience
will train you will help you you just
have to like the job you're doing I was
overwhelmed with their energy
overwhelmed with their capacity to learn
honestly couldn't have been better
