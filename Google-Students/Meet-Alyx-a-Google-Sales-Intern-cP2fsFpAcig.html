to handle ambiguity and navigate the
space which is definitely not something
that you learn in college it's something
you learn by doing and it's something
but I was able to learn very well when I
was an intern here so I went to school
at Washington University in st. Louis
where I studied psychology I wanted to
intern at Google because I love
challenging myself in new ways during my
internship I got to work in Adwords and
I quickly became the social media
strategist on the team my entire project
was based on a single question how can
Google better sell social media it's not
just about coming up with theoretical
answers it's about coming up with real
solutions and testing them so I have
devised a social media strategy for a
cosmetic company got to pitch it to
their top executives and ended up
winning a $300,000 pitch by the end of
the summer currently I'm an Account
Manager within Adwords I work with small
and medium businesses and I do account
consultations it's really cool to hear
someone say that without AdWords that
they wouldn't have a business because it
shows how much impact I have when I talk
to them my advertisers are people who've
really taken a chance on something that
they love because they're a smaller
medium business it feels like I'm truly
touching people's lives and making a
difference that matters to them the
people are just incredible here everyone
has the coolest story it's really
inspiring just being around smart people
is probably the best motivation to just
become a better version of you there's
constant internal growth opportunities
without even having to leave the
you can try hundreds of different
positions and I personally would ever
want to leave so I love Google so much
and I just think that the best place in
the entire world to work I like so much
love for Google it's really awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
