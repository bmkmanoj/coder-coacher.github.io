morning to those in that and the other
coast or the other part of the world I'm
Kyle Keogh here together with Laszlo
Bock we want to go talk about
demystifying the interview process here
at Google it's a process we developed
and honed over years we actually have a
very happy to have Laszlo here who's
actually led the development and all the
honing of the process but we realize
it's a different process than most other
companies go through so we wanted to use
this time hopefully to demystify it just
talk about why we do it the way we do it
and more importantly what it means for
you and what you should expect if you're
you know if you come through the process
so Before we jump into that my name is
Kyle Keogh I'm a sales director here at
Google I lead our sales to
telecommunications industry last when I
go way back though we actually started
working together 12 years ago at a
different company but I've had the
opportunity to work together for the
last couple years ago yeah if last would
you mind introducing yourself yeah I'm
Laszlo Bock I lead people operations for
Google and are we gonna do backgrounds
yes we okay I won't spoil the surprise
but I lead people operations I've been
at Google for about the last seven and a
half years and it is great to be talking
to all of you thanks for plugging in and
tuning in and listening Laszlo has a
wide variety of great experiences to
come in here in particular though if you
get the chance to talk to him talk about
his baywatch experience all right thanks
thank you
great so les was we talked about this
people are going to interview in this
process and they think about the process
how should they go through and prepare
themselves when they're coming - okay
well there's a couple things the most
important thing actually is you think
about preparing for the interview
processes it's actually kind of the most
important thing our basic interview
hygiene kind of things right you should
know a little bit about the company you
should know the products you should
think about how you use them you should
sort of have some sense of what you want
to be when you grow up so nothing that's
a surprise to any of you there's a few
things that are a little different in
the Google interview process one of
which is we really try to recruit for
aptitude for the ability to learn the
ability to kind of take on new things
and and incorporate them the lesson that
you learn into what you're doing and
build on them and so it's a little bit
different we'll talk a little more about
that but the preparation is like for
most companies but with a little bit
more focus in thinking about kind of
what have you learned through your
career how have you kind of stepped up
into leadership roles and so on
right so what types of interviews would
they would they actually see that and
will they see different ones or will be
the same thing over yeah there's a
couple different things you'll actually
probably have pretty similar interviews
as an MBA candidate across all the
people you meet in fact we designed the
process so that we try to get as Calista
can balance a perspective of you as you
can and part of that means in the
interview process multiple interviewers
will be screening for the same attribute
and the reason for that is we want to
make sure we actually have an unbiased
view of you and if one interviewer is
wrong we want another interviewer to
actually have a good independent
perspective so as you go through the
interview process there's four
attributes we screen for the first and
most important as I alluded to before is
what we call general cognitive ability
there's a lot of research that suggests
one of the best predictors of how
someone does in their job and we see
this too is raw intellectual ability how
well people learn how well they acquire
new skills so we screen for that the
second is leadership ability and unlike
most companies what we look for is not
where you present the chess club where
you the head of an organization in your
MBA program did you have some fancy
title we look for something we call
emergent leadership and emergent
leadership is characterized not by
formal Authority but by somebody
recognizing there's a vacuum a void and
stepping in to fill that leadership
vacuum and just as importantly stepping
back out of it the third thing we look
for is cultural fit and the idea there
is not that we want a monoculture we
don't want everyone to be the same but
what we do want is everybody to have
sort of a shared sense of curiosity of
conscientiousness a little bit of
humility when it comes to learning and
being open to new ideas and that they
might be wrong and that they want to
have an impact on the world and the last
thing we look for the least important
thing actually is your actual expertise
in the area your interview report what
we found is generally you can learn that
on the job in most cases and it kind of
falls to the bottom of our list of
things we screen for very interesting so
leadership cognitive ability googliness
or cultural fame and role a role related
knowledge that's right very good how did
we determine that rule related knowledge
was actually the lowest well it's funny
when the company was small the view of
talking
1999-2000 the view was we were going to
be taking on a bunch of different areas
that nobody knew how to solve nobody
knew that search worked nobody knew how
to make or companies knew how it worked
but it was still an unsolved problem
totally nobody knew how to make money at
doing it at it and so the idea was if
you hire people who have done the same
thing again and again again they're
going to see a problem and apply the
same solution they've seen in the past
if you hire somebody who doesn't have
experience in that area but is bright
and curious and can learn and it's
willing to step in when needed and lead
they're more likely to come up with a
new solution that the world hasn't seen
before and so this looking for cognitive
ability stems from wanting people who
are going to reinvent the way their jobs
toward rather than somebody's going to
come in and just do the same thing that
everyone else does
so that rolls back a lot to the
cognitive ability question yeah
absolutely and we used to look more you
know we still look at GPA for people
coming out of business school because
it's sort of the most recent experience
but in general we've changed a lot the
way we look at cognitive building yeah
you know we used to the easy way to look
at this in a lot of places just to look
at test scores look at GPAs and to give
brain teasers or case interviews and
we've actually moved away from that what
we found is that for your first couple
years out of school that stuff is a
little predictive but after that it's
not and so we instead have developed a
way of screening for cognitive ability
by using structured behavioral
interviews so a specific interviewing
technique and that actually is much more
predictive than asking somebody how they
did on the GMAT or an SAT or asking for
their grades it's also much more
predictive than case interviews more
predictive than brain teasers so you
will be faced with some of those in all
likelihood as you interview at Google
some people still like to use them but
at the end of the day when we review the
offers and the applicants for everybody
of the applicants applications from
every student we really actually
discount the case interviews at the
final review levels and focus more on
more general demonstrations of cognitive
ability and does every offer package
still go before you before it goes out
the door half of them so actually what
happens is all our offers all our
candidates before we make an offer get
reviewed by Larry Page our CEO there's a
step before that where
there's two hiring committees one that
screens all the technical applications
and one that screens all the
non-technical sales and finance and
business development and I'm one of the
folks who reviews all the non-technical
ones okay it's a lot each week but it's
it's actually important because it's a
way of keeping the process objective and
making sure we keep a high consistent
bar for the kind of people that we hire
Google fantastic
so we talked a bit about role related
knowledge we talked about about
cognitive ability in the fact that GPA
is still important especially for
someone coming out of school but it's
definitely not the be-all end-all and
we're looking for sort of mental
athletes if you will people who can take
on new challenges they go for it
can you talk a little more about
emergent leadership and how that differs
and how someone coming from business
school might look at that yeah sure you
know one of the one of the things that
often comes up when I talk to students
on campus is you know they say well you
know I I was at a small company and so I
didn't have this exalted title or you
know well all my friends were making
everyone was a vice president I wasn't
does that count against me none of that
stuff matters what we really care about
is not the title the level how many
people you supervise none of that stuff
what we care about is can you articulate
examples of times where you have stepped
into a leadership vacuum where you've
identified that there's a gap and come
in to solve the problem and just as
importantly been willing to relinquish
power because that's the way we work we
divide our problems in this sort of
small family size teams and nobody's
going to have the answer for every
problem and the team is much stronger
when you're able to call on the best of
everyone whenever it's needed so that's
that's what we look for very interesting
is there an example that you can think
of that you've had someone put near some
of the spot yeah that someone's come in
and you've interviewed them and they
talk about something to be relevant for
those folks not and I let a three
thousand person organization cuz n are
you gonna be a lot of senior folks yeah
but something where you'd look at a good
tangible example that that they could
sort of hold their hat their hat on yeah
you know I mean the classic example you
see this with folks out of consulting
all the time
and it's funny because the the sort of
the canned narrative is I was a junior
person on the team and the partners
weren't listening and I worked with the
client and came up with a great answer
so you get that kind of thing all the
time
what really makes those kind of stories
distinctive I remember interviewing one
candidate who was a fairly recent MBA
grad and what he talked about was a
situation
where the the client didn't want them
around and the client literally said you
know we hired you we know you have to be
here go sit in that corner we don't want
you here and the the partners basically
said like just get your job done just
keep billing you know whatever just do
what they say just go and this person
actually wanted to have more of an
impact and so what ended up happening
was this person sort of you know slowly
sort of built relationships made
friendships with everybody and found
ways to add value and in the interest of
time I will go through all the details
of the answer but the the short version
is they found ways to insert themselves
into a lot of small conversations where
they were able to add a little value and
from that built enough credibility a
broader impact but what was interesting
was they then step back and let the
client be the star in each of those
cases and other people on the teams and
when the project ended and they were
doing debriefing you know they weren't
the person that the partner looked at
and said you are the hero you save this
and they didn't care what they cared
about was they had done the right thing
that's actually very true man I've
actually seen as a lot of folks I've
worked with like in our job or in sales
is right it's helped the client be
successful and then the credit finds a
whip whines its way back to the right
spots eventually right you get and
directly treat it well and in a way even
if it doesn't right it's your career is
kind of a long game and you know some
things you'll never get credit for and
that's kind of okay um
I won't we really want our people who
regardless of you know even long term
benefit they they just feel there's a
right way to to kind of think and act
and contribute and that's what motivates
them rather than being the hero of the
star interesting so finishing off on
leadership but emergent leadership is
not about how you let something directly
yourself but I an impact on something
and made it bigger than yourself your
contribution was more than just an
individual contributor you made the
whole better because you were part of it
that's right well and then you also step
back and that willingness to relinquish
power is actually an important part of
it because that's a good transition to
googliness right or cultural fit is the
cultural fit of you know not being the
wanting to always be the star can you
talk a bit about sort of Google culture
and how someone think about googliness
is the interview yeah so
it's funny the everybody at the company
has a different definition of what it
means to be googly and I actually I tend
not to use the phrase to self that much
I noticed you didn't I did yeah so but
that's a stick that way it's fine it's a
good question I think it's one of the
rising ones on the moderator list so
it's good we address it I think it's
most people look at and say you know at
most companies they look for something
special in a candidate and something
special will be you know they run
marathons or they've done a lot of
volunteer work or they want to serve an
award and for us it's it's less about
that discrete accomplishment and it's
more about how you think about your kind
of place of the company and the world
the people that sort of you know are
most finely attuned with our culture
tend to demonstrate that they're
motivated by a mission and so there's
something meaningful right the company
has a mission that's not about making
money that's not about selling apps and
so people who are motivated by something
deeper than traditional sort of NBA
metrics kind of are tend to more be more
finely attuned people who are incredibly
curious and have a lot of intellectual
resilience so they you know they like
debate they like argument and they're
okay with being proven wrong and
learning and then people who have kind
of a very strong as I mentioned before
dose of conscientiousness a sense that
you know it's not just if it's not just
a job their goal is not just to hit
their quarterly goals they're not all is
not just to sell a certain amount that
they have a greater sense of ownership
for the company I mean it's one of the
reasons why everyone at Google is
eligible from stock because Larry and
Sergey believe all of us should be
thinking like owners not employees and
so people who have that ownership
mindset that conscientiousness sort of
are more attuned with the culture
interesting so yes so I mean a lot of it
is you have the you have the right
long-term mission is a consistent is it
a cultural fit there rather than here's
my short-term goals
I love the focus - and resiliency right
as much as Google as successful many
times over right and has had success
queen of other markets well a lot of
that becomes from resiliency the early
efforts are actually not usually
successful
comes back in the time after and the
third and the fourth and the fifth
effort when we actually finally really
succeed I don't I think sometimes girl
forget well it's funny I was having a
conversation this morning with victim
d'etre her leaps our social area and we
were talking about how we're looking
forward to the end of the year because
yeah it's been a really hard she's like
a lot of hard work a lot of hours I'm
sure you know you do the same and and we
both kind of paused and we both taken a
little time off for Thanksgiving and
kind of came back realizing you know
from the outside you look at Google and
it seems like this great cleaning shiny
thing and all these products launching
and all this focus and from the inside
you know you're constantly like working
and busting involve and trying to have
impact and you know you fail more often
than you succeed internally and so you
need people who are able to kind of
learn from that rather than have their
learning shut down yeah we're definitely
introspective challenging culture I was
like hey that was good that wasn't great
always do better and it's a great way to
learn right have to be a little
exhausting yeah it's a great way to
learn very good so I think we covered
off on the main four areas we covered
off on the cognitive ability looking at
how you actually really think you're
looking for mental athletes if you will
folks who can do something more
long-term we covered off on a leadership
that's really emergent leadership not
hey I was the head of the Chess Club as
you mentioned but something I had an
impact well beyond my role and I took
and I knew when to step forward when to
step back essentially sort of like the
New York Yankee style right do you play
for the name of the front of the Jersey
not the neighborhood's right we talked
about googliness in particular of having
a long term view consistency with the
mission resiliency and then talked about
role related knowledge is probably less
relevant especially coming out of
business school
all right thanks so much everybody for
joining us sorry less will had to leave
for another another appointment we had a
couple technical difficulties you can
imagine that at Google the technology is
still not quite perfect but hopefully
this will work we want to do is go
through and answer a few of the
questions that came up on the Google
moderator these are the common questions
we hear as people go through the
interview process and just want to go
through the sort of the top five if you
will if this is helpful the first
question is my previous work experience
was in a different capacity in industry
than I want post MBA as far as
internships
is it better to leverage my prior work
experience or should I do something
differently and go directly after the
new option that I want what we'd say is
on the one side it's very important to
make sure that you're going to do
something in a field that is where you
want to work right you don't want to go
and do an internship somewhere in sales
if you want to be an engineering or in
product management on the flip side you
do want to make sure you set your else
up for success so think about the
balancing act of that is making sure
you're gonna have 12 weeks to really
prove yourself and prove the impact that
you can have at Google so I would
balance off making sure that you can
have an impact but then also not also
making sure that you don't wind up
getting an offer and doing well in one
area and saying that's actually not
where I want to work I want to work in a
totally separate area Google is fairly
integrated but it's still somewhat large
so if you want to work in large client
sales but you do smaller client sales
that's probably workable and fine but if
you want to go from engineering if
you're in sales new into product
management I would encourage you go
straight Department if that's your
long-term passion and only what you want
to do because you want to make sure that
should you have a successful summer you
get an offer and you get excited about
the opportunity to have afterwards
second is how does referral process work
for summer internship applications and
what does the referrer need to do the
refer just needs to put you in the
system online we do find referrals to be
helpful in terms of market validation
right as much as we can interview well
having other folks who've worked with
you recommend you who are being or
successful Googlers cannot hurt it's
only going to help you sort of get in
the door to get the interview and maybe
a little bit there on so don't worry if
you don't have refers here but if you do
it's always grant great it's always a
good helpful data point for us as we
make decisions and as you know we're
really big on data third your experience
would have top candidates done to
demonstrate their googliness
so googliness is at
an interesting word in it really it's
around the cultural fit we want folks
who are excited to come into work every
day who don't see work as a paycheck but
we see work as an opportunity to really
have an impact and develop themselves so
we think about usually things like are
you really interested in the Google
mission right are you organ does
organizing the world's information and
make it universally accessible and
relevant excite you because everything
we're going to do is really going to be
first up foremost dorama secondly do you
enjoy getting up and making sure you
have an impact and can you do that
within a team rather than individually
right well individual performance is
important we can't really care about how
does this person make Google better so I
focus on those areas that are really
going to showcase how you can help
Google achieve its games and how Google
is a better place because you're here
that can be things like you've done
things you know in a non-profit can be
things that you've done it's at work but
really showing that you're a team a team
player as well as a leader and that you
focus on impact not on process on the
fourth one what does Google look for for
potential product marketing internship
candidates the first and foremost thing
is technical expertise we're looking for
folks with an engineering background
from a product standpoint we are still a
very engineering driven company we want
people who can create tremendous simple
beautiful products for people
we're not interesting as much in a
me-too product or something that
compares directly relative to the
competition we look at an unmet need in
the marketplace and try to build
products that do that if you look at
anything from Android to Chrome to
Google commerce and other areas we've
gone into it has not been hey someone
else is doing this and we should do it
too and there hasn't been a consumer
need that you can look down and say
exactly this is the need state what it
has been is an unmet need or an
opportunity we look at and we see from
the consumer behavior and then you build
an amazing product that solves that
seamlessly so we're looking for folks
who fall in from an engineering
standpoint can do that and to from a
thought process innovation standpoint
you can develop conceive and actually
deliver on projects that are going to
admit we fit an unmet need or even an
unknown name lastly the structural
behavior interview sounds like a great
way to gauge cognitive ability
leadership ability personal fit and
expertise
how does Google gauge these elements
before the interview so before the
interview we're going to look at
from a cognitive ability standpoint what
you've done recently right if you
graduated from college 10 years ago
that's not as important to us but if you
graduated three years ago and then went
straight to business school probably is
more important to what we're looking for
is a history of continued success or if
you've had challenges that you've been
able to overcome some of them and you've
learned tremendously from it and we
would benefit from that experience so
we'll look at we may look at grades
right for those schools that offer them
up we're also going to look at what are
the things you've done to go above and
beyond to have a greater impact so
general cognitive ability can be grades
and test scores if they're more recent
leadership ability can really be about
what did you do and how can we show from
the resume that you've done things that
show you so you go above and beyond and
that the team or Google is going to be
better because you're here and then
personality fit and expertise we're
going to look further other experiences
that you've had that are very consistent
with Google's values from an expertise
standpoint we'll look for we call role
related knowledge but it is as Laszlo
pointed out one of the lower things in
the priority list because we want what
we want you to be successful in the job
straight out of the gate we also know
that you can learn a lot of those things
are at Google and if you're going to be
at Google for a long time we want to
care that we build your career
successfully over years not just deliver
in the first six months you want people
to be successful at Google for five 10
15 years and that takes a look at the
long term and looking for folks who can
adapt and continue to move on so thanks
so much for taking the time hopefully
that addresses many of your questions
and look forward to hopefully seeing you
at Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
