the go global with google india hangout
on air for australia and new zealand we
are glad that you want to know more
about the opportunities that you have
with google in your new location that is
australia new zealand and we have with
us Stephanie who spin our specialists in
India Australia New Zealand region and
you've seen the introduction I've given
her on the email okay overdose death
great thank you so thanks everyone for
joining us I'm actually really excited
to speak to you today a little bit about
Google Australia and you know hopefully
some of you will be interested in some
of the opportunities we have here so
just to share with you a little bit
about what I'm going to discuss today so
just a little bit about Google culture
and the culture here in Australia in our
Sydney office some of the roles and
openings that we do have for you as
students and a little bit of insight
into our recruiting process and some of
the processes that would be involved in
internships and grad opportunities for
you and other programs that we do have
available and then we will have time at
the end for some Q&amp;amp;A so don't be shy I
think of some questions that you would
be able to post I'd be happy to answer
them so googles mission is to organize
the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful that's
a huge mission with world information so
this is something that we cannot do
alone so we're absolutely growing our
office here in Australia is nearly a
thousand people now and half of which
make up our engineering organization so
this is a mission that we really care
about and it's something that we need
your help with Google as an organization
has been for about 15 years old now so a
lot of happens Google started with the
search engine but it's become a lot more
so you can see the dozens and dozens of
products that we do have and a lot of
them are developed here in Sydney
so you may have seen my intro on the
post but just to give you a little bit
about myself so I am Stephanie I've been
at Google for seven years and I started
in the New York office seven years ago
but I also worked in Singapore and now
I've worked in Sydney for nearly four
years so I've worked around the world
and I really wanted to share this with
you because there are a lot of
incredible opportunities to move around
and and be global so go global with
Google that's absolutely true there's so
many opportunities to travel in and move
around the world and thinking is just
one of our many offices but I did
studying the US and I spent a semester
here in Australia and it loved it so
much though I decided to come back and
just a little bit about the history
there are founders Larry and Sergey and
Eric Schmidt there so a lot has happened
over the years and it's just really
exciting to see what's to come so there
is a picture of google glass so this is
just one of the products that um you'll
see and there's just really amazing
opportunities to actually do cool things
that matter do things that affect
millions of people so to share with you
a little bit about Google's culture it's
pretty interesting you can see our
offices are very funky and very
interesting and lots of colorful things
and a lot of areas for people to
collaborate and be innovative so you can
see people working all in all different
places and we have people from all
different backgrounds and all different
walks of life and a little bit about our
Sydney office here so there's a picture
if you can see it of our Google Sydney
monorail this was a monorail that is
actually functioning and one of our
google site reliability engineers
thought hey wouldn't it be cool if you
could bring the monorail into the Sydney
office so a couple weeks later our
facilities team here listed the monorail
and put it inside the office so it now
makes up three meeting rooms and it's
just kind of one of the many examples of
great ideas can come from anywhere and
our offices are are pretty funky and
pretty unique
and make up some really interesting
spaces to come up with great ideas so I
want to share with you a bit more about
our offices so you can see there's as
you can see we do have many offices
around the world and in more than 40
countries actually so Sydney is the only
office in Australia New Zealand for
engineering we have a lot of really
exciting products so Google Maps was
developed here in Australia and we have
a big team called the Geo team that
works on maps but we also have other
exciting teams here in Sydney so we have
drives we have engineers working on
Chrome blog or google+ app engine we
have network engineers engineers working
on the go programming language we have
software engineers and tests and site
reliability engineers so we have quite a
few products you can see that our office
is right on the harbor it's a really
beautiful office sunny most of the year
so I think you'll see that on Sydney is
a great place to work so we do have
internships so you can see those are
some of our interns we had more than 60
interns this past summer and the seasons
are actually flipped in Australia so
summer is for the South American and the
spheres of opposite than the northern
hemisphere so our summer months and our
summer internship chips take place from
november to februari but we do take
entrance throughout the year so we're
very flexible for those of you that are
considering that so one of our
internship programs a software
engineering internship we are currently
doing that internship recruiting process
for our summer interns but as I said we
also have in turn I'm interning now
starting soon in the winter and we take
interns at all levels bill masters and
PhDs and we do provide relocation so we
provide housing and a lump sum for those
that are going to be real relocating so
as most of your international students
definitely welcome to apply
eyes and the interviews happens in June
to August and we make offers from august
and sep tember we also have the step
internship program which is for
historically underrepresented groups in
computer science so this includes but is
not limited to women students with
disabilities some students from with
indigenous backgrounds and LB LGBT these
are um the step internship is for first
and second year undergraduate here and
some of the engineers that we do have in
the office so we have the classic
software engineers which you know you're
working on some of the really great
products with great ideas a great
exciting product that we do have in the
Sydney office really I'm doing cool
things that matter and work and things
that we feel will change the world we
also have software engineers to test the
software and our site reliability
engineers these are engineers that keeps
Google running so the graduate
opportunities that we have are in all of
those different areas and we also have
graduate opportunities in IT as well so
we take students who are graduating
throughout the year as well we do have
some deadlines that you should be aware
of usually around May but again we're
open and flexible system applying
throughout the year so what does the
application process look like it's a
little bit different for interns so when
an intern if they're looking for an
internship you would apply online so
basically all you need to do is put
together a resume and send us a copy of
your transcripts and you would have to
technical phone interviews with
engineers so these would just be over
the phone and you would nike coding
through a document if you're looking for
a full-time position the process is a
little bit more in depth so you have two
phone interviews and then it's
successful we would have in-person
interviews on site so several of those
technical interviews with engineers and
then we would get together an offer for
you
so we do have another some other
opportunities and programs at google
that i do want to mention so at Google
we really care about diversity and we'd
love to see you know we want our
employee base to be as diverse as our
users so this is really important to us
and as a result we have several
different found programs that really
show how we are trying to invest in
diversity one of these programs is we
meet a board scholarship so this is
particularly for women it's a
five-thousand-dollar scholarship 5,000
australian dollars and the scholars that
are selected actually get flown to tokyo
for a really incredible experience to
connect with other women in the field
from all around the asia-pacific region
region so the Anita Borg scholarship is
open to students of all levels women
students and post grad students as well
so encourage women to apply for the
Anita Borg scholarship a couple other
programs i want to mention one is code
Jam so just if you're thinking about
applying to google code jam is a great
way to practice so this year the
deadline did pass but it will be open
again next year and there's some great
prizes this year the finals will be in
LA and we will fly all the finals there
and the winner gets 16 thousand dollars
but again just great way to actually
practice some of the questions that you
might get in interviews so another
position that we do have is the
associate product manager so this is a
two-year rotational program that teaches
computer science grads what it's like to
be a product manager so this is pretty
exciting you get to do two different
rotations we also have internships as
well in this area but basically this is
for someone if you're kind of looking
for you have a technical background but
you're looking to sort of lead engineers
launch product lead a team it's a really
exciting opportunity and you get to work
on two different project so they can be
one year and one
location and then you can do a second
location as well and work on the
different product like go to Zurich for
your second location or another another
office so really exciting opportunity
there for those of you who might be
interested in the APM program again who
should apply so if you're really excited
about Google product a computer science
background is essential for this part
because our pm's are part of engineering
and if you have a passion for the latest
technology and you're really an early
adopter that follows technology trends
you're interested in product development
and you have an entrepreneurial spirit
so encourage you to apply for that we
have internships and full-time
opportunities for product managers so
your application so if you want to get
noticed there's a couple things to think
about when you're putting together your
resume and I just wanted to share some
tips for you on things that you should
be aware of if you're applying to Google
so keep your application relevant clear
and specific so we want your execution
it's going to burst be read by someone
on the recruiting team so keep this keep
the really technical stuff for your
interview that will be asked later on
and just make sure you have your general
information education work experience if
you have any and if you don't that's
okay too and any additional information
so if you're interested or you know you
want some more tips on how to put
together a resume and what some examples
look like there's some really great
information on our student site so
google com flash students you can find
some information there on putting
together a really great resume so what
is google looking for we're really
looking for people to get things done
problem solvers who are excited about
tackling major challenges at scale so
Google works with huge scale millions
and millions of users so this is you
know we're looking for people that are
really excited about solving those big
problem and we're not simply looking for
engineers to solve the problems that
Ernie
know how to answer we're interested in
engineers who can work out the answers
to questions they have not come across
before so tell us what makes you unique
so acutely value town and intelligence
group spirit and diversity creativity
and idealism Googlers range from former
neurosurgeons puzzles champions
alligator wrestlers and lego maniac so
we look for people from all different
backgrounds so make sure that you tell
us what makes you different if you on
have any interest outside of university
that's always really useful and really
interesting to us as well a little bit
about the interview so to help you
prepare for the interview a couple
things to keep in mind so really were
we're looking for someone who's with a
solid computer science and engineering
foundation so learn about a couple of
different programming languages a C++
Java for all Python we really have no
preference you can interview with google
on any different language that you want
so really no preference there but make
sure that you do interview those the one
that you know best also get some
experience outside of class so it's
great to get those foundations in your
university classes but it's also great
to join clubs so if you're studying in
australia there's a lots of different
computer science clubs at the
universities here and it's great to get
involved they run lots of activities
also great way to meet other students as
well programming competitions are great
i mentioned co jam but there's also lots
of other ones but there's a CM
competitions here those are really great
things to get involved in also gives you
an opportunity to see the types of
questions that you might get asked in an
interview practice really does make
perfect so the more you practice the
better you'll go get it experiencing
these types of interviews internships
are great so definitely apply for
internships at all different places
because if you see some great experience
to bridge the gap between university and
industry
also open source projects are really
really great so get involved an open
source project Summer of Code with
Google is a good one to to their minds
okay so if you do have an interview with
google just so you know what to expect
so usually there'll be a short
introduction and then the meat is the
technical assessment so our interviews
are technical with Google engineers so
they will ask you on coding questions
algorithms data structures on so you'll
either be asked to code on the
whiteboard or through a Google Doc and
then finally you'll close with questions
so always come with questions I think
one thing I recommend is that if you
want to know more about the company and
if you are a woman then maybe you might
want to ask about the types of things
that the company is doing to address I'm
getting more women into the company in
in engineering so kind of use that
opportunity fast what questions that you
might have and also we don't ask puzzle
questions so we're not trying to trick
you the act the interview it actually
wants you to be successful so we aren't
going to ask anything this to try and
confuse you we really just want to know
your coding abilities yes so there's
some great tools that you can find on
google com / careers / students lots of
different resources on preparing your
resume and ok and I'm preparing for
interviews with google so that's all the
prepare that I have but Sydney's a
really great office with lots of
opportunities engineers here are really
really passionate really excited great
to work with very friendly and open and
would love to answer all your questions
so at this point I think we'll we'll see
if there's any question yeah Steph
thanks so much for that
yeah now we're ready to take some live
questions on the YouTube student shannon
that we are that we had emailed you
earlier just leave comments on the on
the live stream that's going on right
now and we take those questions up for
you in the meantime Steph would you like
to talk a little bit more about the
internship program in Sydney sure so
yeah the internship program is really
exciting and we love when interns come
and join us it's a really exciting time
of year as I said we take interns all
throughout the year but the summer is
the biggest intake and I think the
really important thing to note about the
internship program is that our interns
actually work on real projects so we
think really hard about the types of
projects that you give intern so we'll
try to match your skills and your
interests with the type of projects that
we have and we have them approved and we
really think about things that will be a
real contribution to Google's product so
you're not going to be making coffee
they're actually going to be things that
you know you do really that do really
affect millions of people and we hope
that is a project that you can launch at
the end of the time interns I get the
same persons regular employees so a lot
of people ask is it true you get free
breakfast lunch and dinner yes our
interns absolutely get all the perks of
Google employees that we have a really
great cafe on site and breakfast lunch
and dinner are all included and we also
have you know a games room and and all
those things you can take kayaks out on
the hardware so our interns get involved
in all of that but in addition we have
lots of different trainings for our
interns so they'll definitely be get a
lot of technical training as well as
professional training mentorship as well
and we have a lot of events throughout
the summer so there'll be several
different events as as an intern you
have a hosts and molasses be included so
there's you know boat cruise at the end
of the summer which is a really great
way to connect though usually our
interns make great connections during
the summer that they are able to keep
throughout the year so really a great
chance to build an incredible network
and again
work on real projects so it's you know
hopefully the interns as an intern
you'll walk away having worked on
something that you know you can show
your friends and you can something that
you can point to and say that you worked
on and and the usual intentions are come
away really proud to have have worked on
something really excited in the summer
okay great we don't have any questions
yet but we do have we had some questions
submitted earlier so I sort of asked you
one of those which is how does the
location of the university matter does
is it you know extra helpful if the
universities in the same location as the
Google office do those students the
students have an additional advantage of
any sort that's a great question no it
doesn't matter so we actually take we
would take students from any different
university so there's some really great
universities here throughout throughout
the country in Australia and New Zealand
as well and it really doesn't matter
Sydney is the only engineering center in
this region but we're we're happy to say
that we can provide relocation so we
would help an intern area grad move
providing housing and providing slice
and everything like that so really
actually has no impact we take a diverse
group of people from all over the
country so i'm having a google office
although we'd love to have more there
this is the main one but we're we're
happy to relocate anyone that's
interested so definitely doesn't matter
so please yeah keep that in mind ok we
just had a question submitted which is
one of the differences between the step
and software engineering internship I
think it's important for us to clearly
define the difference so everyone
understands it right that's a great
question so staff I'm stands for summer
trainee engineering program and this is
a program I'm specifically for for first
and second year undergraduate students
so that's you know it's pretty specific
and in that but it's really for
historically under
presented groups and computer science so
the internship program is slightly
different because there's a little bit
more support because those students are
coming from the first and second year
degrees so there might have a little bit
less experience but they work in teams
and there's a lot more support in that
you work in a team on a project but also
there's a lot more on professional
training a lot of technical training
that is involved as well in the project
and really the step program we're hoping
that it's something that is able to help
us support our diverse groups in
computer science there the difference is
mainly that they would work in teams
that there's a you know that it's really
a development program the software
engineering internship is open to all
levels and again in both internships you
work on a technical project that you
would present on to a group of engineers
at the end of the internship program so
both internships you get to work on
great project and you get all the sort
of parts that that come along with
working here but the step program is
mainly designed for our underrepresented
groups in computer science and it is for
first and second years only okay so
stuff I had a question for you about
what if students who are pursuing the
Masters in other countries what if
they're interested up lifo full-time
role in Sydney because the timelines are
so different how will how would the
process be for that now that's a good
question so the timelines are a little
bit different because our seasons are
swapped and the fall semester actually
starts in February but that really has
no difference um we do take we're going
to be able to take students from all
areas and we do provide visas so there's
really no issue there in terms of the
timing it's usually not a problem
because we are open to taking taking
internships and grad students throughout
the year so we're actually very flexible
with the start
the start of of either of those programs
so really I'm really flexible there and
there's not too much of an impact in
terms of the timing I guess the main
thing to keep in mind also with
internship is it is full time it's paid
in its three months so you would need to
dedicate three months whether that's
Sydney summer or a different summer
that's that's fine as long as you are
able to dedicate three months full time
because we do feel like that the amount
of time that's needed to actually
complete a project and be successful
okay okay great looks like that's all
the questions we have so far Steph would
you like to add any final concluding
points well I just wanted to encourage
people to apply you never you never know
if you don't apply you won't get it we
do have lots of opportunities our office
is always growing and it's really
exciting to see some of the things that
our engineers are working on we do lots
of campus events so throughout the year
I will be on campus with a lot of
Engineers and we run a lot of different
workshops very interactive fun workshops
we did a lot of will give out prizes
like this android we're lucky guy he's
one is the one of the prizes that we
give out of our bench so I definitely
encourage you to look out for us on
campus and we're really excited to meet
you and hopefully you apply for some of
our opportunities I hope this is helpful
but um anyone can reach me on out on
google+ and on our students ID to find
out more okay thanks thanks so much for
that stuff thank you everyone for
joining the Hangout go global with
google india we hope that this
information was useful to you you can
expect an email from us about two things
one is to sort of get your feedback on
how the Hangout voice was it helpful for
you and any fee at you have for us and
some of you have mentioned that you
still haven't chosen your university yet
so we will reach out to you to get that
information so so we can update our
student database accordingly okay please
make sure to also follow
the Google students blast page because
this will be extremely helpful to you in
your new location because it will have
updates about the programs that are
happening in your location ok thank you
so much everyone hope you had a great
time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
