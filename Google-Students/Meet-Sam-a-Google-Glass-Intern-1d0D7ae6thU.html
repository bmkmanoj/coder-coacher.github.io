internship in that they give you a ton
of responsibility really fast and let
you touch all sorts of incredible
infrastructure and hardware and software
in a way that many people in the real
world just never had access to so I was
an intern at Google last summer and
worked on project glass and we part I
worked on was the camera hardware I got
to see all sorts of interesting stuff
about the project like all the
prototypes that band put together over
the years I got to see all of the design
documents that they had it was really
amazing as an intern to be able to
access all this stuff that is extremely
confidential and extremely sensitive to
the project so I was simultaneously
terrified and really impressed by this
part of the experience of working on the
camera was we really had to take into
account the needs of the user and how
the user would actually use the products
and the real challenge that that was
there's no reference point for glass no
one actually has one of these in the
real world yet we wanted to make sure
that users could share their experiences
with their friends and family and feel
like they're sharing the whole moment
not just the pictures and we tried to
figure out what trade-offs we needed to
balance to make a compact camera fit on
a wearable device that was also
extremely high quality and worked
naturally for the user I was amazed at
how I got listened to by a lot of people
that probably had no business listening
to my advice all the technical analysis
that I conducted all the code I wrote
all the image characterization and
camera characterization I did all of
that went towards critical design
decisions on the products so that every
glass unit that goes to the production
line ends up being tested by software
that I am a friend there's so many
interesting problems to solve associated
with the form factor that you just would
never experience with any other products
and it's really cool to be one of the
first people getting to take a stab at
that sort of stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
