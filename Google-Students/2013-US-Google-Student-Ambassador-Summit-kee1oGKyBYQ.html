we will soon ambassador program is an
opportunity for students who are
interested in tech and particularly love
Google to go take the company back to
their school it's really about creating
an opportunity for students to connect
with Google on campus let us know what's
going on with students how they're using
technology the problems that they're
trying to solve I've learned a lot about
how passionate people really are about
technology and I really want to share
that passion with the students in my
home campus I've been able to interact
with a lot of faculty and staff members
at my school and then determine the best
kind of an event that would impact these
people we can be there to guide them
along and teach them so that they can
teach more people you really get to meet
people from all over the world that I
know I'll be able to connect with in the
future not only do these students have
your ambassadors in their network now
but they also have this global community
of investors who are all out there doing
the same thing promoting Google products
and getting students really excited
about what we're doing here they start
to understand a little bit more about
who we are as a company the things that
we aim to do and know how they can take
little pieces of that and bring it back
to their campus my experience in
ambassador program has given me so many
skills that transfer to other areas
where I may be working and that's
something that will always be useful
wherever I may go in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
