Dublin we've 70 students from right
across
amia for a three and a half day
immersion program to teach them
everything about Google and to help them
develop soft skills as well as knowledge
about the online industry both is
building opportunities for leadership
development it's a program that we
deliver to students who are from
underrepresented backgrounds within the
technology industry the aim of the
program is for students who experience
Google and see for themselves what
Google is all about and for them to see
if they think they like it
make the most of your time here soak it
up drink it in and really challenge
yourself and maybe go outside of course
hide your comfort zone over the next few
days these guys are going to experience
variety of workshops and presentations
everything from CV writing skills to
presentation skills they're going to
learn about more some of the more
technical aspects of Google and then
they'll be doing a business challenge
competition at the end of the day I'm
hoping to go home and they tell all
their friends how much fun they've had
here how much they've learned and how
impactful it is for those students
hopefully this program will bring a
boost on their CV new skills and new
ways to network new ways to see other
people in the professional world and
maybe apply for a job at Google later on
if I could sum up those Speedos in one
word that would definitely be inspiring
Pharrell amazing phenomenal I don't know
somewhere in between inspirational and
challenging which is a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
