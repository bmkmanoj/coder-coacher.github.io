at Google because I really do have the
ability to set people up to be
successful I have a lot more control
I've got a lot more ability to connect
people with opportunities to get
roadblocks out of their way to get them
all the information they need to make
good decisions one of the things I got
to do was really start shaping and
creating positions not based on a job
req but based on what people wanted
their role to be and that's really been
collecting up all the pieces of work and
sorting through who wants to do which
pieces everybody wants something
slightly differently so on one of the
projects on google talk it was really
growing a lot more infrastructure a lot
more back-end a lot more front end and a
lot more coordination between different
teams everybody on the team wanted to be
engineers and write more code nobody
wanted to be the one to coordinate the
release management the processes
communicate between the teams and so
when I sat down and talked with each
individual it was really clear I needed
to hire a manager to come in and take
over all those functions so the team
really got to determine how they wanted
the team to grow how they wanted it to
change and how they wanted each of their
roles to evolve my name is Lydia ash I'm
an engineering manager for the test
organization and Kirkland Seattle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
