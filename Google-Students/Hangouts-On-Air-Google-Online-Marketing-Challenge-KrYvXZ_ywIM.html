tuning and my name is Jessica I work on
the University programs team here at
Google and I manage our google students
page which you've luckily found on
google plus and i'm joined today by two
of my favorite Googlers we're going to
talk a little bit about the Google
online marketing challenge which is
hopefully something you've heard about
and are interested in learning more
about since you're tuning in now so I'm
going to kick it off to AJ and Andrea
we're going to introduce themselves sure
so my name is AJ hi everybody I'm a part
of the AdWords team here at Google I'm
based in Mountain View and I'm also a
part of the Google online marketing
challenge team so as you know we put
this program together and we hope that
you'll find it a value and learning a
lot about online advertising and AJ give
us some Rebecca and where did you go to
school and how long have you been here
what was your path to Google sure sir
i'm originally from the san francisco
area i went to Columbia for college so I
went to New York for four years on my
studied psychology there I mean I worked
at Google as my first jobs I've been
here ever since psychology brought me to
AdWords where I am able to understand my
customers segments them research their
needs and then present to them you know
the best tools and the best ways that
they can best grow their business so
it's a lot of fun so far very cool hi
everyone my name is Andrea and I work
with AJ on the google adwords team and I
also participate in you know help out
with the Google online marketing
challenge so I'm very excited to be
having this hang out with you guys
because we really do hope that it's
beneficial for people for teams
participating the challenge and then
also anyone that is interested in
participating participating this year or
next year a little bit more about me I'm
from Ohio I went to the University of
Cincinnati I did work at another company
before coming to Google but I've been
having a great time since I've been here
also I majored in marketing and
international business awesome so I
guess we'll just start right in why
don't you guys give us some sort of
background on the Google online
marketing challenge tell us what what
it's all about for maybe some of those
students who are tuning in and
interested but don't know too much about
the program okay so i'll go ahead and
question um so the Google online
marketing challenge started in 2008 that
was our first year back then there are
about 500 professors that were
registered and now we have over a
thousand that just kind of shows you
that the challenge has been growing the
purpose of the challenge is to really
give students real-world experience
working with Adwords and with online
advertising so really just introducing
them to this space and giving them the
opportunity to see how they can really
grow real businesses and nonprofits by
using online advertising great and so
who can participate is this open to
students only in marketing or I mean
what's the process to get if someone
wanted to get involved in the program ok
so is open to any student around the
world so this is a global challenge you
can be basically any major that you want
to be as long as you have a professor
that's willing to register for you and
then you will register under the
professor to participate and
registration does happen online so WWE
google com flash online challenge is
where you would go and you just click
the big blue button that says register
great so to elaborate a little bit more
to and what i'm andrea was able to point
out so we do ask that teams register as
part of you know underneath professors
but by professors we can also include
lecturers or researchers so if you don't
have an individual professor that can
register for you at least somebody who's
affiliated with the institution like a
researcher can be that supervisor great
and so you said the professor's have to
register first right and is there an
upcoming deadline or when what is that
sort of the timeline look like for the
program so professor registration has
been open since november of last year
and it will go to may first of this year
so you still do have a few months to put
together your team get your professor to
register and participate in the
challenge so may first is the deadline
for the professor's right for the
professor's okay and how many people are
usually on these teams the teams can be
anywhere from three to six and we filled
up you know
team of that size is probably you know
the most effective okay and then once
their professors get registered the
students can now register under their
teams mm-hmm it is a two-step process so
professors must register first I'm after
professors registered then students can
register because they'd have to register
underneath their professors after
students registered and professors
simply have to verify the teams I'm and
at that point the teams are able to sign
up for an AdWords account i'll link it
with their challenge account and move
forward from there okay so for those who
are just tuning in we're live talking
about the Google online marketing
challenge with two experts in the field
here who help manage the program and if
you don't know too much about the
challenge you can learn more information
at the website google.com / online
challenge and it'll give you some
background on what the program is all
about now so for these students what's
in it for them if they win what is what
today and its global to right so is
there a global winner and how does that
work so there are a number of winners
yes there are both global winners and
regional winners I mean we have winners
in a couple different areas so we have
winners for the challenge we have
winners who you know participate in the
social impact award so those that help a
non-profit and we also have winners for
social media so people who are able two
teams that are able to create Google+
pages you know and maintain those I mean
the prizes are awesome other prizes
range from a seven-night stay in San
Francisco to free tablet devices free
laptops up to fifteen thousand dollars
in a donation to your nonprofit partner
so Google has a lot to give I mean we
hope at the same time that students are
you know motivated to learn about online
advertising you know and become those
true marketing consultants yeah and I
mean this sounds like something that
students could put on their resume that
they participated in and definitely
something to supplement what they're
already learning maybe in an advertising
class definitely I'm especially because
this challenge as Andrea pointed out
before is global right so you're
competing with students over the entire
world so certainly ranking at one of the
top is you know an accomplishment worth
mentioning yeah and so teams can be
three to six they have to register under
their professor names sounds like there
are some awesome prizes and we're going
to
it's some of the questions that we got
from Google+ and Twitter one of them
from Clayton he asked if he needs a
professor to be participating and we've
already answered that yes you need to be
registered under professor or researcher
or someone who's associated with the
institution someone asked if they can do
the challenge for personal blogs so
maybe explain a bit more around the
structure of what exactly you're you're
working on during the challenge and also
i'm not sure if we mentioned what the
time frame is for competing in the
challenge itself ok so i'll just go
ahead and take that question if the
personal blog would be a business or a
non-profit then yeah they can definitely
advertise for their personal blog we
just ask that it is a business or a knob
or considered to be a nonprofit
organization as far as the challenge and
how it actually how those students
actually run their campaigns you have a
three week time frame to use the two
hundred and fifty dollar credit that we
give you so you can take you know
anywhere from about seven days to the
fold 21 days but you do only have that
three week time frame and then once your
budget is depleted the two hundred fifty
dollars then we'll consider that the end
of your campaign and then you guys play
around with the numbers and figure out
who did the best right we look at a
number of metrics to determine regional
winners and the global winner so okay
and when do they have to finish the
challenge by so they have three weeks to
do the entire thing but how much time do
they have to complete those three weeks
when does it officially start so the
last day is june eighth so that's the
last day of the three week you know
consecutive time that they're that
you're allowed to continue running your
campaigns but as you know after you
complete running the campaign's you also
have to submit that post campaign report
or the impact statement or the social
media you know execution right up and
you have until june fifteenth for those
pieces I'm so like Andrea pointed out
before you know one thing we look at in
order to determine the winners are the
metrics right how successful was your
AdWords campaign but we also look at
those write ups that you submit once the
campaign is done so we want to know what
did you learn how did your campaign grow
how are you able to drive success for
the business you worked with
and this is something they typically
work with their professor sponsor on
putting this together I'm yes especially
before the competition you know they
asked their they asked the professor for
guidance but who we think they can play
a greater role with is actually the
business right so the pre-campaign
strategy is supposed to demonstrate an
understanding of how the business works
so that they can move the business
successfully marketed successfully
online I'm so especially for the
pre-campaign right up a student should
be working closely or have a great
understanding of the business that
they're working with great are there any
sort of tips or maybe areas where
students can find resources to learn a
bit more about the challenge or maybe
they're already the professor's
registered they know they're going to do
it where can they find some resources
that may help them get a better
understanding or better prepare them to
compete in the challenge sure so I can
take that question there are a couple
that comes to mind one for instance is
the AdWords beginner's guide so you can
find that on google.com / Edward /
beginners guide in order to get extra
information about the metrics you see in
the account how to better structure your
ad groups in order to successfully run a
campaign another important thing to look
at would be short video tutorials and
that's on google.com / add / learn and
so there's no visual learning resources
to use in order to better understand you
know how to run and how to manage an
AdWords campaign great and it sounds
like all the information for anyone who
wants to know about the challenge is
that google.com / online challenge
definitely great um we haven't gotten
any more questions since we started and
it looks like we covered a lot of the
FAQ you guys have anything else you
wanted to add any parting words for what
students should know about the challenge
minus why they should be interested in
competing anything they can use to sway
their professors to help sign up and get
involved um I guess one thing that i
would offer as a tip or advice for for
the students already participating and
maybe getting ready to run their
campaigns it's just to make sure that
the wave structure account should be
focused on a certain theme so just to
give an example i have a shoe business
right so I saw boots
tennis shoes and I sell sandals so the
way that I would want to structure my
campaign is that I would want to have an
ad group for boots and AD group for
tennis shoes and a group for sandals and
then the keywords within those
individual ad groups to be all centered
around the boots theme sustainless name
or the tennis shoes theme I think
initially you know what we see with
student teams and even just with
real-world advertisers that use AdWords
is making sure its structure the correct
way from the beginning so that's just
one tip and advice I would like to offer
so sure and my takeaway tip is do as
much as you can to invest preparation
upfront so as you know the competition
is only three consecutive weeks long
when you're allowed to run your campaign
so what's the campaign's performance
within those three weeks that we're
going to look at so before you start
that campaign do as much learning as you
can so you don't have to waste time
during those three weeks catching up on
things that you could have learned
before the campaign even started I'm on
that note to make sure that when you add
your coupon code into your AdWords
account that your campaign is paused
otherwise you run the risk of your
campaign going immediately online
because you added to count so those are
those are my parting words of advice and
we know from talking to past
participants that it is a lot of fun so
we really do encourage you guys to you
know have as much fun as you can you
know when working with these businesses
and running the AdWords account yeah it
sounds like the more prep work they can
put in beforehand the better prepared
they will be definitely great well
thanks for joining us it sounds like we
answered a lot of the questions and
hopefully students will get excited
