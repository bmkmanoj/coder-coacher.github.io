room hangout for want of a better word
and this is being broadcast live and
will also be available from the google
student log and i'd like to introduce my
colleagues and myself my name is Peter
Bickman I'm an engineering manager in
during office where I manage teams
looking after our search back end and
now over to marry in Dublin hi I'm Mary
I'm working in the Dublin office as a
computational linguist and I'm part of a
team that goes multilingual text
classifiers so if you have a piece of
text in one over that 15 or so languages
and you want to know what's the major
topic of that text or what's it all
about while we detect that kind of thing
automatically and burial in London I am
now very I am a software engineer at the
office I site reliability engineering
teams which are the DS that manages
production services of tulips and same
kinda make sure that they perform fast
reliably and large-scale in medieval on
my team work until our second services
and oh hi I'm most atoms from Munich I
am a software engineer and I work on
Google's build system in particular I'm
the tech lead of the tool that we use to
run the web system what's interesting
about Google Earth system is that we
have a couple of million lines of code
literally in the depot so we have to be
extra careful to make it fast and
reliable also I mean we're Google we run
all of our bills in the data center so
part of what I'm doing is to figure out
how to best distribute jobs across data
center and to make it work well right so
today we're going to talk about why
someone with a computing science PhD or
engaged in a related topic will be
interested in a career at Google and to
get this started we're just going to
each tell you a little bit about our
background and how we ended up at Google
so I was originally mathematician I
worked in industry for a few years
software and they went back to
University to do my PhD where I focused
on large-scale distributed systems and
managing objects after that I was
postdoc for a couple of years and then I
spent nearly 15 years as an academic
before moving to google for years ago
while an academic Iran graduate school
looking after large number PhD students
across my plan takes computing science
statistics in psychology and I found
that in fact might both my PhD and that
experience of supervising PhDs and Romeo
graduate school incredibly relevant to
my job here because the engineering
teams basically feel like small research
groups they are very very bright
engineers working to build things
practically oriented but still at that
very high level nevery that was a little
more about your background and so I did
an undergraduate degree in applied
computational linguistics which
basically mixed computer science
linguistics and languages and kind of
brought all those together into building
systems that would compute in some way
over natural language and so from that
then I went on to do a PhD in computing
and I focused on natural language
parsing and machine translation and I
work for a couple of years of the
postdoc researcher and part-time
lecturer and really enjoyed that
experience I was at Dublin City
University before I joined Google and
all of this background was actually
really relevant when I moved to Google
because I still work a natural language
processing system so all of the sort of
fundamental ideas from linguistics and
computer science are all just as
relevant now as they were when i was in
academia there so during my PhD I was
working in privacy data management with
a particular focus on geo social
networks this is not exactly were they
doing now as my main project I'm
actually sitting here google and in my
twenty percent i collaborated am I
kind of a consultant and also operated
em to check that our brother handle data
and the user data in a safe way for
users and the Stella mean that a PhD
experience is you safely at home and if
you means that luckily during my PhD I
improved a lot my problem solving skills
I used to say to my friends that make me
this question about how your PC's useful
it back probably I wouldn't have been a
horrible fate for Google Earth by the
time I was a trance this is not always
the case later that are also some
talented people that comes from out of
chromatographic in belong together
degrees but did not me personally the 15
have a deep understanding law until the
science topics like I believe
distributed systems III was a teaching
assistant Felicity's the course and
maybe enjoyment and so yeah in general
also one of the main thing that the
period that I briefly is an exceptional
ology that I actually applies almost
then it applies to almost every week on
you you face here in general more
systematic approach so especially the
fact that you will need to provide data
with your solution for some solution in
order to support your solution is very
important here google in this part of
the day the culture anything this is
something that the common come straight
from their research methodology in the
canoe account and i'll tell us a little
more appeal pipeline so i studied cups i
started studying computer science in
germany and then i went to Stanford in
California in the USA for my master's
degree when I came back I decided to go
for a PhD in the intersection of
computer graphics and hardware to to
follow what might you know my colleagues
have said before um the the main thing I
learned in my PhD that I'm still
applying today
guess if my writing skills which have
greatly improved as part of writing the
PhD thesis also due to my advisor
greatly helping out with that and to add
to the range of institutions I can throw
in my postdoc time where I was at in Rio
and Paris I spent time to Nash give
Lisbon I've also spent kind of Germany
had Denmark this is not unusual across
the four of us we've worked in something
like eight different european countries
and the USA that's fairly standard i
think for any group of Googlers of the
sort of level across engineer and let's
talk a little bit more about sorts of
careers that that it's possible outside
of Google research which is a very small
part of Google engineering oh you've
already mentioned it about writing
skills and spelling us anymore about the
way your edges are led into your career
and what you've done with it since well
so so I I turn out to be a software
engineer even though i did hardware in
my PhD see this I really like software
you know and i like i like programming
and you know that that turned out to be
the right choice for me but i guess it's
different for everyone out there I'm so
I'm a tech lead so I'm actually using my
writing skills to write design docs that
either either I or my team that
implements afterwards after discussing
and deciding on on the way to go so
that's very important I'm also thinking
about going into management and that's
something that you can do here as well
if you want to I don't think that's one
of the important things if you want to
Google's an interesting company from
that point of view because you can
continue as an individual contributor
all the way to very very highest levels
of the company without ever having to
manage any body my role is rather
different since I do manage people
almost full-time across search but even
when I look at my team is about 35
engineers in that team a large fraction
of food
have the edge needs the the one thing
that's common across all of them they
come from very different backgrounds is
this desire to make things to actually
build something they're waddling pact
the world and and for anyone who's doing
a PhD but who's got a practical focus
with that who wants to make a difference
makes for an interesting environment I
just came from a session it's another
event where one of my colleagues he's
talking about his working machine
learning and he helped build the part
where he designed the priority inbox and
built most of it and his work is
impacting hundreds of millions of people
every day and the dip organises their
email forum how to decide which messages
to read first and so on it's hard to get
more impactful than matters machine
learning specialist later um let's go
back to something that very much Dario
is talking about how he's with research
methodology sort of influences working
day Mary do you want to add anything to
that how do you use your research scope
um well so from a natural language
processing perspective when I worked in
research there were very standard ways
for measuring the performance of your
systems if it was a pars or an empty
system or whatever it might be and I'm
using exactly the same evaluation
methodologies now so the basic principle
of collecting a good sample of the type
of data you're trying to process and
determining good or the either the
correct answer or good answers that you
would expect from your system and then
sort of challenging your system to
replicate those human judgments and
measuring how close you get to that
standard standard technique is still one
that I'm going to be using every day and
something else that's from the research
methodology perspective so one of the
things that I worked on when I was
working at machine translation was
looking at linguistically annotating
corpora and understanding the
differences between different languages
and why an empty system would do better
on some language Paris and others and
this concept is also directly relevant
now where i work on multilingual text
classification systems and where for
some languages we find things to be
relatively easy
I am for other languages things are
pretty tough so understanding why we
might find some language is more
difficult to work with than others and
how we might overcome that what kind of
information we might want to use to
compensate so those are the kind of
things that I'm really just came with me
and transferred with me from academia
and Dario does that ring bells I mean
it's something to add to the earlier
comment yeah I am example about
something we are working on right now so
we have to face a problem at mix case we
have some processes they have to process
a large amount of us data and we won't
understand how the single-ended is no
chance they say an advertiser monitor
cousin has an impact in our process in
processing dying of memory so how much
of the memory for example is he survived
due to a particular advertiser so doing
this kind of providing is it's a kind of
a challenging task and to come up with
the best solution research methodologies
we have there not because I know that I
have to look at the state of you out
first and so having to reach someone is
some it's not something cigarette so I
never had to model the Nolan probably
before proposing some solutions or
really understanding wasn't quite so and
what are the possible there are many
ways offline analysis all my little eyes
modifying the process attaching a
diuretic not many possible solutions and
you can really judge and in 10 minutes
which is best you need to analyze each
solution oh and understanding what other
costs and constantly if solution and
possibly also trying to explain in some
prototype of those to understand booties
and what is best friend what is for see
to give the best and as after the most
mechanical yourself and finally a
decision comes out of it and then you
start writing there and what is your
final solution in your writing but it's
in tonight's Concorde which was actually
live in production this is what's very
exciting because you really see how your
solution then is applied to a very large
scale is e the world
and in case anyone's joined this part
way through this is a google plus
hangout on air about PhD opportunities
of google in europe my name's Peter and
joining here are Mary burial at all from
different Google offices across Europe
picking up on that that let spoil in
barrier made that that leads us nicely
onto the topic of of algorithms and
mathematics and alpha I was wondering if
you could just say a little bit about
how much you make use of of algorithmic
material and that's the background and
so on your daily work so it's it's
difficult to say that because we're not
when we talk about these things we don't
say okay now we're going to talk about
algorithms and now we're going to talk
about other things and what I find is
that especially if you look at
complexity theory that really pervades
the language to be used to speak about
the system and speak about performance
and how we want to involve the system
and I mean that happens every day we use
it every day and we just assume that
that you're you know the person that
you're talking to no set stuff well
enough so that they can participate the
discussion for another another example
which is maybe more concrete is that
it's a build system as i said before
distributes stuff across a lot of
machines in the data center and we're
actually looking into pretty heavy graph
theory algorithms that you know that can
help us solve optimized or 4-foot
optimize the distribution so that we get
perfect performance or you know as good
as possible in some cases it turns out
that these problems are actually hard
and the best thing that we can do is to
use a heuristic and and then we can try
to tweak the heuristic and figure out
you know try to figure out what's the
best way is to to do that yeah i think
it made an interesting point to stop at
the
then turn on and off the utes of your
your background knowledge in computing
science your deep knowledge with PHP and
so on it's just part of who we all are
we just use it instinctively every day
in conversations with our colleagues in
front of whiteboards actually working so
on and that environment in which that's
the what may things are where there's in
something like getting on for fifteen
thousand engineers at the moment in 2012
within Google of whom many thousands
have PhDs but it just sets an
environment in which we just talked with
people assuming they know things because
they do is just part of the everyday
discourse that does lead on to a
question of why we're not all doing
research why why is Egypt was not an
active research of these days in
academia for me the the answer is very
simple I spent a long time as an
academic and I thoroughly enjoyed my
time I was happy to keep going doing
that and it was all about making a
difference but here I can make a
difference on a much larger scale I'm
not making a difference on the
day-to-day basis bringing on the next
generation of students instead of my
work directly or indirectly is making a
difference to tens hundreds of millions
of people across the world but Mary why
is it you're not still in academia well
I think something you mentioned earlier
I thought I'm definitely a very
practical person and I like to sort of
get in and fix things and in my case
rummage around in my data and see what's
not working and why it's not working and
you know having a system that makes some
errors is most naturally in which
processing systems do it's no longer an
academic question of all we have this
type of error and wouldn't it be nice if
we could fix it I have users and systems
were waiting for a good classification
or better classification and these kind
of mistakes matter to them so I really
need to be able to go in and sort of fix
them and solve the problems i find it
very motivating to have my work sort of
deployed in systems and deployed in
different products and really you know
it matters whether it works well or
whether it doesn't and so I think for me
that's a really
big motivating factor and even coming
back and so previously i talked about
evaluation methodologies and metrics you
know using the ones that i used in
academia but now sort of dividing up the
error is much differently you know
precision errors some of them you can
live with and some of them you can't
depending on how your system is going to
be used and what the risks and at the
other end of it really needs and this
just provides a whole new dimension
really to the kind of work that I'm
doing something else is that I spend
quite a lot of time sitting in the gap
between how good we can get with fully
automatic classification techniques and
building the best possible systems that
we can and the accuracy level that's
needed for the system to be useful and
sometimes there's a gap in there between
how good we can get with purely
statistical techniques and what we
really need for the end use case and
that's sort of that sort of an area of
work or a gap that doesn't really exist
in academia because you don't really
have users you can't connect with the
end system to see which errors matter
and Pateros don't so I think it's the
practical application that's really a
big thing to me and OH your user base is
is somewhat different because it's
focused very much on the Google
engineering population supporting him
their work but what's the difference for
you why aren't you still in an academic
role ah well I guess what I guess the
answer is similar um I I did some
soul-searching during my PhD mmm and
decided i want to i want to be more of a
programmer and less of a researcher and
and if possible right fewer papers but
obviously the writing skills even or eat
or even though hughes if i don't
actually have to write papers okay and
that that then brings up another nice
question which i'm going to send to
dario in a second which is which we're
often asked in engineering because we're
all in google engineering more than
Google research can we actually publish
papers and we collaborate with people
externally now in what's your take on
that so
yes Molly many researchers will know
that Google publishes people actually
this the research at Google pages an
extensive listing / k type of you papers
through the google what is different
between probably these papers and what
is in any guys that these papers are out
kamala possible work too so think about
the big day big big table paper we just
been very selling out or the
distributors really distributed hash
like defeat the table systems and very
recently there is also very interesting
money from structure which is about f1
to the distributed relation basis is
also published from google and i'm also
with my data privacy in my operating
with i'm also discussing some
preliminary just write a paper fancy so
the only difference is that you don't do
just research for finding new things but
you you present the results that like in
a you do encountered in them for
something that was needed us google as
product there are many a example that
you can and if you can check yourself on
the website regarding external
collaboration I still in some program
committees about so I be contacted I
ready were for papers and i esteem
except this thing it is something very
welcome with google recently i
participated in google sponsorship for
dr. dark 2012 conference so there is
definitely room for cooperation and
communication with other people in
academia the researchers and if people
are interested in seeing what we have in
the way of external research and
published papers google.com / research
is a wonderful resource about it lists a
lot of papers published by Googlers and
it also gives people an idea of
association to involving and now we
don't have very long left so i'm going
to take some questions from the
moderator that were set up for this
session as well and and the first of
those is asking about internships for
the hd's its question from Niccolo
and if there are internships for PhDs is
it possible for people to work on their
page research during the answer that I'm
a great believer in PhD students taking
internships I strongly encouraged it
when I was running a graduate school yes
a significant fraction of of our summer
interns do indeed have PhDs in addition
to the Google engineering PhD
studentship which is the the large
portion of our intern program we do have
a smaller number of internships with
Google research as well people working
in engineering won't normally work on my
research they will join of real
engineering team and they will be
involved in delivering a real
engineering products they they will
write code that goes into google code
base and that is used to help tens or
hundreds of millions of people get
things done each day in my own teams we
used to have a slightly naughty habit of
giving the interns the most important
task to do because they wouldn't know
how scary it was and then other people
would help them if they got stuck and we
had some huge successes like that a lot
of intent in terms gether feel great
deal hasta if you're in the middle of
your PhD it's a good thing to do but
treat it as a break from a PhD don't
treat it as part of your PHP and it is
very difficult to work on an internship
as something is going to contribute to
affinity because you're working on the
commercial environment you're building
your products here and so it may be
commercially sensitive and it would be
difficult if that turned out not to be
something could be published or reported
back to your supervisor because it
turned out to be an important trade
secret there's also a related question
how to deal with now from from Andre who
asks how long appear to the internship
lasts and what stage with the HDH should
be done and our internships are fairly
flexible they usually somewhere between
three and six months and you'd need to
talk to your supervisor about this that
you depend on on how well your PhD is
going my advice before I joined Google
was the PhD students go in for a
three-month internship it's just long
enough to do something worthwhile but
it's not so long that you will forget
what was going
on your PhD when you get back to it
certainly six months is is an upper
limit of Eliza's the risk of detaching
from from your research agenda before
you came away as for what stage they've
do it a month before writing up your PhD
get a PhD finished first their goods a
month into your PhD because you've got
settled in yet somewhere in the middle
makes a lot of sense there is absolutely
no harm also in doing more than one
internship one of my own PhD students
manage the internship with IBM before he
actually joined a ph.d program then went
on to work with other companies as well
you know had internships with Intel
Microsoft and Google and then he moved
on after especially female works within
our London office and then the third
question I'm going to get Barry 02 and
so choose from Lawrence what sorts of
qualities and skills are we looking for
and PhD recruits into engineer yes a
melon wolfdog not that we're looking for
people that like to do pack your things
and as part of is actually there is a
bagel chance it's not that yeah that you
will have to write some code and we have
very extensive yes and so heavy also
some the programming skills so probably
focusing a little metal now worries so
that you can be very proficient with
writing put it in cold what your
solutions are I think this is a kind of
requirement page depending on the HD
copy not everyone may I have a problem
you need to work on that a little bit
and besides that problem-solving skills
are important as we as we mentioned
they're usually the PhD education should
help you it include the skills okay and
we're getting close to the end now so we
should wrap up this is Hank from air
about here's the opportunities of Google
30 seconds each guys any last messages a
top tip for someone who's in the middle
of a
HD thinking about whether they want to
move to industrial engineering
afterwards Mary do you have anything you
like to surf in chocolate and I think
it's just back to the idea of if you
really love to be practical and get your
hands dirty and dig into the problems
and see your work deployed in a
real-world scenario then you would be
suited to and it would be great barrier
removal because I work here I was
generally surprised about the
opportunity that the bugles numerous
hear things like able to go to
conferences or still dedicating some
time to some research aspect so
definitely HD is under here this is all
something in the one thing and so yeah
probably if you don't feel like doing
research for the rest of your life you
do go to mark things and I by impact
products let's so who is the little
paste growing of modeling original and
oestrogen you mean come on skits all hot
spots from Munich let me just say that
if you're a PhD student and you're in
the midst of it and maybe you're getting
a bit frustrated hang in there you can
do it that's a really good fighter no
message and for those of you who like
making things as well as thinking about
things that combination is amazingly
amazingly great feeling at the end of
every day and don't feel like you're
stuck with only one way forwards or no
way sports you have lots of
possibilities ahead of you and
engineering in the real world is
definitely a place to use your PhD thank
you for listening this was a google
hangout on air on PhD opportunities for
