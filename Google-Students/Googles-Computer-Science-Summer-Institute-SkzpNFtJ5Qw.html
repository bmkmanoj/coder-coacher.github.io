qualified engineers than we have supply
of qualified engineers so if you know
this stuff your future looks pretty
bright Google computer science Summer
Institute is a program for rising
freshman in college it's a three week
residential program held at Google and
students come to Google to learn all
about computer science back at home
computer science is an offered in my
high school I went to orientation at my
college and I was around all these other
kids that already had prior experience
and I would be starting from scratch and
they would be at a higher level than I
was and the CSSI helped me get a head
start to that the the idea behind the
curriculum here is to give students the
tools they need to build something that
can immediately be used by people around
the world they learn HTML CSS JavaScript
Python app engine and a bit of App
Inventor on Android we basically take
them from having little to no experience
with computer science developing a fully
functional web application by the end of
the three weeks here I didn't have a lot
of friends who are interested in it but
when I came over here obviously everyone
here was like oh my god computers and
code and it's really cool to be around
people who have the same interests as
you that complete interest and they're
all here for a common goal to learn
stuff about computer science and to see
if this is really what they wanted to do
before CSS I I knew close to nothing
about programming programming languages
and now the fact that I know these it's
great I know how to apply them to real
life I know how to make a webpage I know
how to make applications I am
where that a large percent of the people
who work in computer science are guys
like you know their males
so it's just really encouraging to come
here and see that there are so many
other girls that are just like me and
we're all into computer science
especially since we do have the boys
outnumbered here it's just like it's
really funny it's definitely a great
opportunity to come to fine-tune your
skills to figure out if computer science
really is right for you or to really
figure out what area you want to go to
computer science if you're thinking
about applying to CSS I do it there's no
question about it
how could you not apply we also have
panelists from people across Google who
work in technology but in different
roles so there are people who work in
engineering in user experience UI design
and research and analysis program
management and you get a little taste
for what it would be like to work in any
one of these roles and we teach you the
skills that you would need to develop if
you wanted to join later on in one of
these roles CSS I was really important
to me because it was my first step in a
career towards my full-time job at
Google from there I went on to work in
the engineering practicum and then from
there and internship and finally I
converted to full-time which was really
awesome
