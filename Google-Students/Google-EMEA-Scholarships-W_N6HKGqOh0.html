Greece I'm here for the Anita Borg
scholarship I applied to this
scholarship because my passion for
computers and because I had the chance
to meet Google and see the offices and
meet other girls from Europe that share
the same passion with me
the Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship is
all about celebrating computer science
and women in computer science
encouraging them to further excel in the
field and contribute to the community
and build a great network it's been
expanded to many countries of the world
including Europe the Middle East and
Africa when I think of Anita Borg I
think about passion for technology here
love about computing and how she wanted
to encourage all the women in the world
to embrace it
this scholarship gives me more
confidence because I felt that my my
ideas have been appreciated from the
Google engineers which is a kind of
appreciation that really is I like it
I'm not from Cairo Egypt this is color
ship have developed me and here is
psychologically to charge up and to work
more so I'll impact more and so on and
that's really the big point that it
builds up
hey I'm Tom I'm from London I'm here for
the Google Europe scholarship for
students with disabilities
there's lot of joking giggles absolutely
unique it's not something else in
offered anywhere else the girl seems to
redirect mice disabled students you know
students from all sorts of backgrounds
if I was a student with disability I
would definitely consider applying to
the scholarship because it's a fantastic
opportunity to come to Google's officers
to experience what it's like to work for
Google to meet amazing technical
engineers to meet other scholars from
across Europe so you will build a
virtual community when you go back to
your University and it's got to be great
for your CV in the long run when I fill
out an application
I felt like my father didn't qualify for
the scholarship I thought why this busy
obvious not all that perhaps they're
those that are more sweet asleep so
these fellowship on myself since private
scholarship I've applied for an
internship and I'm gonna be working for
3 months on that so I'm really excited
to start that the funding can really
help you out if you're like me have some
extra expenses for travel I'm max I'm
from my American the Netherlands and I
love first year I think the disability
shouldn't be too much of a problem in
particular in the area of computer
science where well you don't really have
to do that much physical effort so much
as possible just go for it and try to
get some people behind you and the sky's
the limit
hi I'm Sarah and I'm from Kenya I'm here
for the Google Zawadi scholarship coming
from a community that people don't know
both internet people don't know both
Google the scholarship has been very
good to me
the goal of the scholarship is really to
provide opportunities to women in Africa
who wants to pursue the career in
computer science Computer Engineering or
IT causes women who have shown
leadership potential who have been
involved in extracurricular activities
while studying perhaps in their
secondary education and women who
perhaps have financial needs my life has
turned to the computer world
Kamlesh instead in programming I'm now
interested in telling the computer what
to do and they want to walk with us all
to the software engineering company the
scholarship introduced me to a world
that I had never trust me my career move
was not even close to me it gave me a
full shift in career moves and right now
I've never been happier in my life to do
something which is called computer
science my name is Lee and I'm from
Uganda
I can actually use this to change the
world and you know make something of my
life make a difference
diversity is particularly important to
Google because in order for us to create
the different products and services that
make our organization so successful we
need a great diversity of thought and
experience and background and we get
that by bringing together an amazing
richness of diversity of people in order
to create the organization that we have
brings opportunities of networking rings
meeting a great company being at a great
location builds confidence and makes me
very happy
we lean hardest part is to click the
bottom and simply verification just go
for it it's worth definitely just
applying so often ladies you give it a
toss because feels a lot with them with
them it's a fantastic scholarship and I
promise it will change your life in ways
you don't even expect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
