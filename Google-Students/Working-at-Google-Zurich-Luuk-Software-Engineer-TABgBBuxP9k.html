at Google and other places I've been at
is the absence of competition so and
lots of other places I've seen
competition between team members or
between teams and it's a constant race
to be the best so in Google the unit of
success is Google and it's perfectly
okay to tell your team members that you
should scrap half of your work to get a
better result it's perfectly okay for
your team to tell another team which
they should scrap half of their work
together another problem
it's it's very academic in that respect
that the truth counts more than the
politics the hierarchy is is totally
flat when I started there were already
quite a number of people at Google but
my direct chef was VP of engineering and
it was absolutely no one below me and
one of the first things he said to me
that he absolutely didn't have time to
manage me so he hoped that we selected
for self managing skills during the
recruiting process and I have to say
I've never felt so empowered as as that
they on every level it's if you find a
problem or something that can be
improved you look around for the best
way to fix it and often it's by doing it
yourself
so that makes for an environment where
anything is possible every day we come
to work my name is Luke Fonda I'm a
software engineer at Google Lindsey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
