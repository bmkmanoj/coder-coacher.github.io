are going to talk a little bit about the
engineering trainee summer program which
is being offered this summer for the
first time in a couple of our European
offices my name is Jessica for those of
you who may have seen me on a couple of
these hangouts before I run the Google
students Google+ page and a bunch of our
other social channels and I'm here today
with Farrah and Carrie who are going to
talk a bit about this new program that
they're launching in Europe for the
summer so I'm going to kick it off to
them and they're going to introduce
themselves and then we'll dive right
into some of the fun Q&amp;amp;A that we have
planned so Carrie why don't you start us
off okay great hi everyone my name's
Carrie I work in the London office and
I'm the intern program manager for Mia
and Farrah hi everyone I'm Farrah I also
work in the London office and I look
after software engineering and in turn
hiring across Europe great well we're
glad to have both of you here today with
the timezone me and Mountain View and
you and Europe this worked out well
didn't have to wake up too early don't
worry okay so why don't we start off
with sort of the background about this
program what is it all about
sort of how did it come to be and what
can students look forward to if they're
interested in applying so Carrie you
want to give us some background yeah
absolutely so and the engineering
trainees summer program is a 10-week
internship which will run across the
summer and as Jeff mentioned this is the
first time that we're running this in
Europe and we've seen some good success
from the enter practicum which fire will
go on to you but we really wanted to
launch this over here and hope to see
similar successes so you've been working
in one of three offices so either London
Munich or crackle and they'll be as well
as real projects so you'll be working on
live production items they'll also be
classroom activities mentoring and
hopefully a lot of fun for you great and
what about Farrah why are we doing this
in Europe so no we have that engineering
practicum internship program in North
America
how did it
transition over to this new region well
we Google like to try new things
so this is new for us um we've had some
of the past successes we've run the
interaction for the last three years I
believe in the US and have had some
successes so we wanted to give younger
students an opportunity to get some
practical experience some classroom
training and to have fun at Google it's
not something we've tried before and
yeah so we wanted to try some new and
give that opportunity for younger
students great and what age is this for
students who are interested in applying
on first and second years so anyone in a
first or second year of a course okay
not graduating before 2014 okay got it
so for those who maybe just tuned in to
start watching we're talking about the
engineering trainee summer program which
is a new internship program we're
launching in a couple of our offices in
Europe so we have Carrie and Farrah from
our London office talking about the
program right now so what is the
difference as students were asking
what's the difference between the
engineering trainee summer program and
the regular intern program are the main
differences is really the length of the
program so the engineering trainee
program is 10 weeks long and we're
really trying to get all students to
start and finish on the same day to have
good more of a class feel and so you can
work together and help each other with
any technical problems and projects that
you'll be working on and with the
regular internship program in amel we're
really flexible and start and end date
so as long as you can work with us for a
minimum of 13 weeks you can pretty much
start at any point during the year and
there's room to work for longer than 13
weeks if that fits in with your
educational schedule as well as the
start and end dates being aligned
there's more classroom training so we
understand that students that will be
applying for this program won't be as
far
honors their education as perhaps the
students on the regular intern program
so we want to help build on your current
skill base and give you some more
exposure to real-life projects and
programming and we'll also have a
structured mentoring program so we'll
have experience engineer's giving up
some of their time to work with you
Outsiders having a manager or a host so
those are really the main main
differences and they're working sort of
in teams is if I understand correctly
right so for students who maybe they're
a little bit nervous because would be
their first internship or it's
definitely set up in a very welcoming in
sort of cultivating environment yes
let's do that
so there'll be two or three trainees
working in the same team
or in the same larger theme so you
already have a great support network
both in your office and then obviously
with the other trainees in other
locations so we'll bring you together
probably by ABC so take part in the
classroom training so you're all
experiencing the same things and she can
share those experiences and really help
support each other and help each other
grade great and so we said the program
is targeted at first and second year
students what sort of educational
background or work experience are you
looking for from these students
especially since they're so young in
their academic careers absolutely and
from like a wek experience perspective
we understand that most students at this
stage of their education may not have
any work experience but really any
students that are studying a bachelors
in computer science or related degrees
is really what we're looking for anyone
that shows a real passion for technology
for computer science perhaps doing some
programming or creating apps and your
spare time taking part in Olympiads
those are the type of students that
we're looking for those that really want
to develop their their career and just
take ten weeks over the summer to come
and try something new
great
and when when are the dates so we're a
little bit more strict with this program
with start and end dates versus the
regular internship program so what dates
are we looking at for this so we'll be
looking from the 2nd of July through to
the 7th of September 2012 ok and
applications are due by the 27th of
April ok great so they have a little bit
more time to get their applications in
and what is the overall aim of this
program from Google's perspective what
are we hoping to get out of this well we
hope that the teams will be able to help
the younger students develop at an
earlier age and they can get productive
sooner and if they go on to them become
successful software engineers full time
at Google that would be fantastic as
well 3 so for those who maybe just click
the the broadcast or tune in button I'm
here with Carrie and Farah from our
London office and we're talking about
the engineering trainee summer program
which is a new internship program we're
running and a couple of our offices in
Europe targeted at first and second year
computer science students it's a 10-week
internship program so don't worry we're
recording this so if you missed any of
it we'll upload it to our YouTube
channel don't worry never fear ok so
let's go into some of these frequently
asked questions that we get from
students about the program one of the
questions that we get a lot is what
about students outside of Europe who are
maybe interested in the program can they
apply yes so I mean we encourage
everyone to apply who's eligible what we
will say is that because there is the
entry at scam in North America we
probably will give priority for students
that are studying within Europe for this
pilot program and things may change
going forward but we'd recommend if you
are studying outside of Europe so if
you're studying in the US to take a look
at the programs that are offered more
locally great and we're pretty strict
with sort of those program
qualifications right so some students
were asking if I'm a first year masters
student can I apply but it's pretty set
first or second year undergraduate
students correct exactly so
we have kind of two different courses so
there's a three-year bachelor course I
feel doing that and you'd need to be
coming up to the end of the first year
but if you're doing a four-year course
then we'll accept students they're
coming up to their second year so it's
really the graduation year that's
important it doesn't need to be 2014 but
yeah unfortunately we can't take masters
students at this time okay and how do
students apply for this program let's
say they fit all the qualifications
they're excited what's next how do they
apply well they can search for
engineering trainee summer probably up
on Google and be directed for the site
or have a look on the students page on
patreon now and click on the link and
send a suitable CV a nicely written
maybe two to page 3 page CV with a very
short covering letter one or two
paragraphs is absolutely fine but more
interested in you know what what the
students are doing now what you're doing
now than anything else so those two
would be absolutely perfect and are the
things you would expect in their cover
letter or specifically on their CV that
you really would like to see highlighted
anything further to what Carrie was
saying so if there's been any
participation in open source communities
or something super fun that you've
created or maybe a technology that
you've always wanted to explore further
but have some dimension that we'd like
to hear about so anything related to
computer science that's not necessarily
in the textbook that you want to tell us
about that's cool Carrie do you want to
add anything to that or she pretty much
cover it yeah I think that's pretty much
it I mean just I think it's really
important to highlight your your passion
in your CV so as far as they're just
drawing the attention to anything you've
done it really shows your skills and
your interests you know we're really
looking for inner to innovative people
to come in and have great fun but also
contribute something to Google at the
same time and they should probably
include their
graduation year somewhere on the CV just
knowing from some of the program
applications we review it's always
helpful to see that sort of front and
center since that makes a difference in
your qualification for the program so
after they apply what is the recruitment
process look like for these students
what's next yeah so far and I will
obviously go through and review the
applications and successful students
will be invited to take part in two
phone screens so the phone screens will
generally be four to five minutes each
and they will be with our engineers so
you will be given access to a rightly
document so a Google Doc which you can
code in in real time so um it's always
handy to have a quick practice that
typing whilst talking and just so that
you feel confident and ready for that
and yet so it will be 1 to 2 phone
screens that you will you will do and
then you'll receive the outcomes really
so these are technical phone screens
correct it's not just about what's on
their resume absolutely so there be
technical bang screens we will ask you
up front kind of where your interests
lie what you like doing what your main
programming languages so we can target
our interviews it a bit more to what you
do yourself but you should be prepared
for some problem solving questions and
some more generic questions then of
course the engineers will be interested
to learn a bit more about you and what
you put on your CV say and refresh
yourself on your CV before your
interview good advice and how long does
this recruitment process take when can
students expect to know sort of where
they stand in the process I guess it
depends when you can start the interview
process but we would like to have final
decisions by the end of May good
and okay we already said applications
are due April 27th that's an important
date for them to know and it sounds like
if they just submit resume and cover
letter that's what they need to apply
correct yeah there is a short question
that we've asked you to answer just
about a project that you've worked on
outside of your university studies just
to give us a bit more insight into you
and what you enjoy so and what about
sorry did I cut you off that's okay just
add that into the cover laughter that
would be fantastic
perfect it's important to read
directions right I think that's like
step one of it if you're qualified you
read the directions and follow what
we're asking that's good and what about
how students should prepare for sort of
the the recruiting or hiring process
okay so once we've reviewed all the
Seavey's we will get in touch with the
suitable students and we will then
advise on how to prepare it so now the
top tip will be to practice coding
review the modules that are pertinent to
this so I would say some of the kind of
programming algorithmic data structure
type of modules that that students
currently studying revise those make
sure they're included up on Big O
notation do a lot a lot of coding and
try and do stuff outside of the
university as well that would be the
first initial preparation yeah and I
know on our YouTube channel youtube.com
slash Google students we have a playlist
of all of the hangouts on air that we've
done and we actually did one about
technical interview preparation so for
anyone who's watching who in general
just wants some help with how they can
prepare for technical interviews it's on
our playlist and it was hosted by one of
our engineering recruiters who sat down
with a few engineers to talk about
preparing for technical interviews so
that might be a good use of your time to
help prepare is there anything else
you'd recommend for students preparing
for the sort of the recruiting or hiring
process and talk to them you know
friends and just try to look at a role
play maybe getting you know paper out
talking through some questions and just
discussing in like a
classroom style I think that often helps
as well great good advice and then what
makes a good application so when you
guys are reviewing all of these
applications hopefully tons of students
are now excited to apply what what
really stands out in an application or a
CV or a cover letter for you I think
we've kind of talked about this a little
bit already but I really do think it's
kind of passion and innovation in your
CV so you know this is the first thing
that we see about you it's really
helpful that you really highlight your
skills and what you've learned and what
you've done so in university
universities not easy for them some
really great team projects or group
projects and fill out what you've done
in those group projects and what role
you plays and any sort of out outside of
university any interest you may have
even related to computer science or not
related to computer science if you like
fire juggling or I don't know just
meeting up with your friends and and
reading books or anything like that's
really interesting for us like we really
want to be able to get a feel for who
you are from your CV and what you like
doing so obviously your education and
studying a relevant course is really
important but we really want to see who
you are and be excited about your
application you know it's a really good
opportunity and let that enthusiasm come
across and you're not necessarily
looking for students who have known that
they wanted to study computer science
since they were five right so even if
you just sort of stumbled across an
intro to CS course and it's your first
year like you're definitely encouraged
to apply right exactly it's exactly
those students that we want to see as
well like you shouldn't feel that you
don't have enough experience or that you
haven't done enough coding or
programming this program is designed for
students that have started have got some
really good interests already but want
to develop that so don't feel that you
can't apply it because you're not quite
ready I would recommend that you apply
and you know what if it's not
that's what's a really good experience
just the application and getting speed
for engineers and we'll give you
something to think about for the future
so let me put off by thinking that
you're not ready I've definitely expire
and then you know we never say no at
Google if it's not right this time we
can look next year exactly
and speaking of next year and sort of as
students are maybe some older students
who are watching this now are you still
hiring for normal internships and
full-time roles and so we pretty much
wrapped up our internships for 2012 now
within a mere so we aren't accepting any
more applications but we will start
recruiting again in September which
feels a long way away but we're all
doing April 13 so my recommendation is
for anybody who's looking for an
internship next year visit our website
I'm in 29 2013 in September when will
open applications and just apply really
as early as possible because we try and
review things on the rolling basis so
yeah come September and come back to the
website and keep visiting and sanitation
and all of those opportunities are
posted at google.com slash students and
it's broken down either by region or by
what role you're looking for so post all
of our program announcements on the
student blog and the Google+ page so as
long as everyone keeps the tab on those
sites they'll probably know before a lot
of students even know when all these
opportunities are available all right is
there anything else you guys want to add
before we close this off maybe let's do
a quick wrap-up so we just talked about
the engineering trainee summer program
Carrie do you wanna give just like a
quick high-level overview of what the
program is maybe someone just click that
they want to join the broadcast and they
want to know what we've been talking
about absolutely so it's a brand new
program within Europe ten weeks across
the summer in either London Munich or
cracker
it's designed for first years of a
three-year bachelor or up to your second
year of a four-year bachelor we're
taking applications right now apply by
our students site it comes under
programs and scholarships application
deadline is 27th of April
and to apply we just need a CV and a
cover letter which also describes a
project you've worked on outside of the
university so that was perfect that was
a great elevator pitch for the program
okay so I think that just about wraps it
up thanks for joining us Farrah and to
Carrie and for those who are interested
again if you go on google.com slash
students and under programs and
scholarships under the Europe category
you'll find that engineering training
summer program application and we'll
have this video uploaded to our YouTube
channel
sometime in the next couple of days you
can rewatch it if you missed it if you
have any questions hopefully we were
able to answer them on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
