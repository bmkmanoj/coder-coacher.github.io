I've made an impact at Google I'm a PhD
student at the MIT Media Lab I measure
people's emotional states with
technology and I try to help companies
but understand the emotional experiences
a degree in their product
so what I'm really passionate about is
helping engineered better connect with
the people that are helping developing
user experience what I do specifically
if I measure the emotional experiences
with a psychophysiological measures like
skin conductance and heart rate and I
measure the experiences of normal
everyday people and I help those
engineers understand what is exciting or
frustrating or scary about the products
that Google makes
working here at Google was definitely my
first choice because I'm surrounded by
incredibly awesome intelligent people
I'm sitting next to multiple people
professor to know more about my field
than anyone I've worked with and it's
wonderful getting their feedback on a
day-to-day basis about how I can make a
better impact into them one of my
favorite opportunities at Google is the
resources that are available to us I
have lots of financial support so i can
get the research equipment I need and I
can get the tools and assistance I need
I didn't go to office hours and I can
meet with some top-notch people to get
feedback on but kind of how I plan on
doing my work and I also have day-to-day
conversations with people that are
really changing how I view my work
the work I do here at Google I am
inspiring the colleagues around me and
I'm helping engineers better emphasize
with the customers but what's really
exciting about it is that I'm actually
making changes in actual products and
the products are going to go out in the
world and you know maybe one day
billions of people will use those
products and my Iowa touches every one
of those in some small way and that's
really excited the day I figured out
that I'm having a great impact here at
Google is that when the engineers
despite me just coming in the room we're
actually talking about my research and
wondering about how they're going to
apply it to the product we're working on
and that was really inspirational that I
was able to get people to start thinking
differently on my team here every day
I'm working at Google I'm asked how do
we change the world and then furthermore
I'm push and said okay go out and do it
and do it quite as fast as you start you
