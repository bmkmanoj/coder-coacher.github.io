live event about Google's information
technology residency program for the
agenda we'll share our stories about
Google's culture and why we feel it's a
great place to work and of course we'll
talk about Google's information
technology residency program we'll talk
about what the program Intel's
you'll hear personal experience from our
IT residents themselves and then we'll
finish off by answering some questions
from our live audience listening in also
as a reminder please send your questions
via the chat window throughout the
presentation our chat warriors will be
answering your questions live throughout
the event our chat moderator included
another itrp recruiter Lauren and an IT
was Vint Colton so they're very well
versed to answer your questions so ask
away so welcome again and let's jump
right in we'll start off with
introductions my name is Ariana I work
in our Sunnyvale office which is still
considered Mountain View headquarters I
work on the University recruiting team
as a recruiter specifically hiring for
the IT residency program along with
Lauren as I mentioned who is one of our
chat moderators jennette Google now for
two years so I'm excited to talk to you
all day about this awesome program and
then joined and I'm here today with two
current IT residents Jamie and tan mate
so I'll let them go ahead and introduce
myself my name is Stan mag I am a IT
resident currently working from the
Mountain View office I've been with the
program for about a year and a half now
and yeah sure so my name is Jamie I work
also in the Mountain View office at
Google and I've been in the program for
about six months and really enjoying it
so far pretty new and yeah having a good
time I said well before we jump into the
details of the IT residency program we
want to talk to you about Google's
culture and why we felt like it's a
great place to work and the best place
to work so we do this through our
benefits our workplace design perks and
culture these perks are designed to
allow our Googlers
do their very best work and as many of
you know some of these include free food
and awesome free food mai tai that's a
big one micro kitchens where their small
break areas for people to always be in
the vicinity of snacks and to meet and
discuss me out here every once in a
while the gym and we're also very like
dog friendly so it's not uncommon to see
dogs in an office or on a shuttle which
is pretty cool so those are just a few
of the perks that we offered but I do
want to turn over to humans again and
ask each of you what is your favorite
forget Google and we'll start with
champagne for me I think it's been it's
been the convenience of getting things
done working at Google I don't have to
worry about my laundry or getting around
laundry is you know I'm taking care of
and within Google you can move around
through shuttles and there's a goober
like service within Google so you can
get from one building to the other just
using an app and there's just you know a
ton of different things you can book a
car for yourself for three hours or more
it's amazing it's yeah so my favorite
part is actually a company-wide meeting
that we have once a week they call me
gif and it's a really good chance to
meet other people that you work with or
maybe that you've never worked with
interacted with before it's a great
chance to grab some free food you know
what's going on in the company and
what's happening in different parts in
the company that you maybe don't
interact with this often and also
there's free beer too so you gotta love
that but it really isn't just all about
the perks we want Googlers to have
meaning to their work know what's going
on and be able to express their voice in
a way that works for them it's these
principles and our people that really
make our future as special and with that
in mind that's why you truly believe
that everyone's minds that people yeah
so just like around I was saying every
voice really does matter at Google and
in order to be successful we need those
voices to offer a diversity of
perspectives within our own
and I think our CEO sundar said it best
when he said whether you're building the
company or leading a country a diverse
mix of voices and backgrounds and
experiences leads to better discussions
better decisions and better outcomes for
everyone and that's why we're committed
to increasing diversity both inside
Google and across the tech industry the
first perspectives are really critical
to building good products that work for
everyone right and so you know it's just
not enough to find and hire Googlers
with different poisons backgrounds and
experiences we also need to create an
inclusive environment where every
Googler can be themselves we want them
to bring their whole selves to work that
includes our family their hobbies and
interest with sense of humor in fact
what enables them to thrive and their
careers and make the greatest impact for
our users so I've seen this in my
experience at Google by expanding the
ways that we find and hire our next
Googlers myself or other thinkers have
taken unconscious bias training which is
a training that brings awareness to the
way that we bring unconscious bias into
the workplace and focuses on the ways to
address these biases I've also attended
some weapons or volunteer opportunities
put on fire employee resource groups
here or set up Googlers to support a
bring awareness to an issuer cost so
those are a couple of ways that I think
the way our company values diversity and
inclusion and and as always as we're
doing in this presentation we'll open it
up again to Tammy and Jamie on how have
you seen your personal or in your
personal experience with diversity and
inclusion at Google I figured that
Google is a very culturally rich place
and every every culture every community
that we have internally has its own own
way of celebrating different things and
so on in my personal experience I have a
part of the Indian Googler Association
and we we celebrate different festivals
at different times and just a few weeks
back we celebrated the body which is the
Indian festival of lights
you know celebration a great community
outside
and yeah that's just one example yeah
that's and that's great and those groups
are so great and they're so good for
becoming a part of something bigger at
Google and there are other groups too
there's a group called Ola which is for
the Hispanic Googlers there's a group
called the regulars or a little bit
older gray-haired Googlers and even if
you don't fit in any of these categories
you're still more than welcome to join
and become part of something bigger at
bigger community and I think that's the
key to diversity and inclusion it's you
know diverse groups that celebrate
specific things but welcome to everyone
and open to everyone that's wonderful
thank you guys for sharing and those are
wonderful examples
so in summary we really believe district
diversity and inclusion brings so much
value to our workplace we want every
voice to matter and thrive here so that
Googlers can truly be themselves at
Google and speaking of Googlers that
leads us to tell you about I think our
single best perk and that is Googlers
themselves every one brings different
perspectives and experiences to the
table but there are certain common
traits every color has and you call this
googliness I think it's a term that
can't be neatly defined but it's what
enables Googlers to thrive and
contribute positively to our future
you'll often see a lot of smart
passionate fun funny and I think just
kind people around here I think you know
what that goo goo this means if you're
comfortable with ambiguity have a
certain dose of intellectual humility
have collaborative nature you think like
an owner and can adapt to change those
sorts of things those are what we are
looking for in the traits when we think
about someone who's googling and someone
that we want to join Google so it's hard
work but I think working with googly
people makes compost challenges even
more fun so if you are excited about the
aspects of our culture that we've
discussed and excited about the
potential of being a Googler and on top
of that IT is your passion and then
you'll be excited for the next part of
the presentation which is talking about
hold ITT residency program all right so
I myself am a nightly resident and what
Google's residency of information
technology residency program is it's a
twenty six month twenty six month long
road to come start your career in
technology and Google or beyond I you
will learn what it takes to support and
scale Google's technology from our
corporate infrastructure to end users
using various support channels including
chat phone video in person an email you
will be helping us with all sorts of
challenging supporting supporting issues
you will encounter or sophisticated user
base working on all major desktops and
mobile operating systems you know I
think to add here is we we at Google
believe that it's very important to keep
users productive and we are one of the
very few companies in the world that
offer all platforms and you know for you
to work on and and you know plus point
that is that we get to support all these
platforms and get to learn on each one
of them we have locations in Mountain
View California in orbit Michigan and
you know and the program has start dates
in January and July so this what this
slide shows you is a is a view of one of
the tech stops and each tech each
Mountain View office has a peculiar
unique design to it I currently work out
of the 1201 text up in Mount with in
Mountain View and it is it is designed
based on Star Wars which in itself is
fairly cool and just you know every
single building here is has a unique
accent to it and the information
technology residency program also offers
a couple of other things so first it
offers great training and development
your first three weeks in the program
will be a sort of boot camp where you
get to learn all about Google itself its
systems its processes and you get some
specialized training and networking
infrastructure and multi-platform system
and his administration as part of that
you know
so doing a lot of customer service soft
skills development project management
communication and throughout the program
you get refresher trainings on these
various topics so that you always step
to date with what the latest and
greatest is both at Google and in the
industry
you also get some great travel
opportunities and this is a huge
opportunity that you it's really unique
to Google but you get it's depending on
the availability and the need of of
staff you can get domestic or abroad
trips and you get typically four weeks
minimum providing IT support at another
Google office that's a really great
opportunity not only to get to travel
and explore but also to see how
different Google offices function and
they all function in their own googly
way the next thing you get as well as an
observation so that's a three month
rotation with an Operations team in your
local Google office there's a lot of
different rotations that you can become
a part of but potential ones include
networking development site reliability
engineering and system administration
and finally all those things they
ultimately to just making some real
mission critical contributions to Google
as a whole you get to work directly with
all levels of the organization you could
just support and test new products they
call it dogfooding and you get to grab
the keys to the kingdom you get access
to a lot of amazing systems they trust
us with a lot and it's our
responsibility to use that access to
support Google and Google running really
well awesome so thank you guys for
summing that up this always makes me
feel like I majored in the wrong thing
and wanting to go into IT but I'm the
recruiter on that side I'll tell you a
little bit about our interview process
so we get candidates from three channels
that's online applicants referrals I'm
so Googlers have refer other folks and
source candidates so there's a team that
proactively goes out and looks for
candidates that are fit for the IT
residency program once you are approved
to move forward then you will go through
the recruiting process
which is first we'll ask for a
self-assessment survey to evaluate your
technical skill set or have you rank
yourself on your technical skill set for
your area to to refer to during
interview you'll get set up for a phone
interview if that all goes well then
you'll have to Google hangout interviews
and these interviews are all focused on
your technical skill set and done with
an Operations engineer so someone who is
technical themselves once you move on
from that the feedback will be reviewed
by our hiring team and we use hiring
committees to make sure that your ask
your questions to make sure that your
answers to those questions are fairly
assessed and to make sure that you'll be
a Google long term we want to ensure
that Googlers will add value across
various teams throughout their careers
here I'm and if all of those approvals
go well then the offer is extended and
at that point is when we would fly you
out to whichever office it is that
you'll be working on it for you to visit
and get a taste and feel of what
Google's culture is like up front I mean
in terms of what we're looking for when
you go about your interviews and what
we're looking for in that process is we
want to see how you think your thought
process as you go about trying to solve
the solution ideally right giving it to
a craft solution is great but along that
way we're also just as curious about how
it is that you're thinking about it and
your problem solving skills leadership
is something they're going to be
assessing too and that can be basically
on your campus and your professional
experience we're looking for ways that
you've made an impact in those roles so
that you can come in imitate that rate
when you get to people obviously we're
also looking for role we acknowledge
which means that you're troubleshooting
methods and how you do that your
knowledge of IT concepts of platforms
etcetera we want to make sure that you
can come in and be successful at Google
and then lastly of course is the
goofiness which i think by now you guys
know a lot about how to apply
so if you've enjoyed what you've heard
today you and if you're excited about
Google's culture and have a passion for
ID and visit hulu.com / students to
apply online load your resume and your
transcripts unofficial transcripts
should be fine and just ticks away so
thanks everyone for listening to that
part of the presentation will now jump
into the Q&amp;amp;A portion of the event and
see what questions so from one or Dina
do you get to decide if you want to work
in era in Michigan or Mountain View
California and the answer to that is yet
he deal and you will get a tweet once we
get to a certain interview process he
will give it a twist of which location
that you want to work off of because
you're providing both in person and
instruments at work we're gonna chance
to choose and so from many what happened
after your 26 months
in the ITR yeah so so after at 20 months
you are actually eligible for converting
to a different full-time goal at Google
and that's a really exciting part of
this program but it's important to note
that this program isn't just designed
for converting Aiki RS to Google
employees it's it's actually designed
for making you into a better IQ person
that you can use your skills in the
entire industry
so well that is the goal of some people
who are Aiki residents it's it's also
the goal of many of us to just go on to
do awesome things at other companies
that are out there but basically after a
month 20 if you do want to convert to be
a different Google roll you just go
through the Google and roll a hiring
process for that particular role and we
have previous ITRs who have moved on to
become corporate operations engineers
site reliability engineers and software
engineers so there is definitely lots of
great opportunities at Google if you do
want to stay here after those 26 months
are up it was quiet like university
education itself you do get to decide
what is it that you are more interested
in and you know you on your own you
begin to you know gain those specific
skills by the end of the program you
know exactly what you like so next
question from me
that is interesting you do not have to
have it is nice to see information
technology and recent studies involved
but however it doesn't mean you don't
put other majors if you do have any need
you're outside of that then we are
definitely still open to considering its
considering again because it falls
around your experience maybe you didn't
get a major and that background like you
have been working out your ideal test a
certain amount of years you have been
building a computer since you were young
and how that experience and so got to
believe what we're really focusing on
that I would say yes it does matter as
to how much inclined you are towards I
think and I don't experience
there is somebody I know in the program
who has a music degree so it doesn't
matter
I mean it's to some extent but it's the
influence or the inclination towards IT
that matters a lot and from Hunter when
do you start hiring for each class so we
hire year-round and so obviously before
the start date or before January we're
kind of looking at around August to
December that we're looking for and then
for our July we kind of start hiring
more so in January I've been till June
or so for those class but it really does
depend because we hire year-round so
sometimes the person can't start or we
get their application a little bit
beforehand there are some cases where
you will start hiring of in advance but
closer to the start date I think is is
best or we will start kind of putting
you through that interview process to
start to tan me and Jeannie you guys
what advice do you have for students for
the technical interviews be good at one
thing it's it's I think about everybody
is an all-rounder but everybody is good
at really good at something and every
other person that you meet there's
always something to learn from them
because they're everybody's so unique so
I would say make sure you know at least
one thing really well and you understand
how the world works with NIT
and yeah for interview preparation tips
I would say understand networks try and
try and see if you can understand how
x4x windows to some extent Mac you know
just just a basic overview of how these
operating systems work and be good at
one of them yeah and I think to add to
that
something that's also good ideas you
know know how you troubleshoot and don't
just know what will fix something more
importantly know why something will fix
something and be able to drill down
really the specifics of whichever step
you're taking towards resolution so you
may get asked questions about scenarios
and you will really want to be able to
dive into this scenario and you want to
be able to explain why you took a
certain step and what you think that
step will do towards the problem being
resolved that's really important there
are a lot of people in ite who can just
throw a bunch of steps and the idea is
that a problem no likely go away but the
important and distinction distinctive
part is knowing what steps do what
things and why they're likely to fix a
certain issue and that'll be really
important for you to display that
knowledge on your hair.you and front of
genesis is prior experience working in
an IT setting required or preferred
that's another great question yes it is
just because um where do we see eye to
setting having some sort of experience
but even list on your resume that shows
us that you do have experience and
troubleshooting and providing technical
support and sometimes it doesn't have to
be you know Adam helpdesk it can be in
other areas but having that prior
experience is essentially necessary
because we want to set you up for
success when you go in these interviews
they're going to dig a little bit deep
they're going to expect you to be able
to show that knowledge and so in that
case yes having prior experience before
getting into that interview it is going
to be in your best benefit so that you
are setting yourself up to to be the
most successful in that interview next
question is from Angela
what kind of day-to-day tasks are common
for I turkey livers and of course every
ITR takes baths that they like so me for
example I like automation in a light
so there's a part of the program where
you know you have this ops rotation I
rotate it with the mobile phone stream
and I did a big chunk of develop from
there and we within the support or also
have certain automation projects so as
an ITR I
I support Googlers I fix their issues
understand what's wrong and try and fix
day to day tasks through automation yeah
that's that's really good in some of the
other things that you do you know
besides that the opportunities for
travel and observation is you're really
the face of support for Google and
that's a big responsibility but it's
also a really fun responsibility
Googlers are super nice and super
understanding and patient and you get to
support them and help them make sure
their technology is always working for
them and not becoming a blocker to
whatever they are working on so you do a
lot of troubleshooting you work on
tickets you take walk-ups from people
and help them in person you might do
chat support or phone support and so
there's a lot of things that you get to
do as two-face Google support that will
help our fellow Googlers you know
continue to innovate and move google
forward as a company great that's all
the questions that we have so thank you
all for joining in to watch this YouTube
live event and enjoy the rest of your
evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
