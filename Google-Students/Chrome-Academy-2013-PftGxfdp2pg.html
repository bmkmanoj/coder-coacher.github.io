chrome Academy experience so far has
been the instructors that I've met and
then I've gotten to speak with on a
personal level before we came to chrome
Academy we were encouraged to brush up
on our skills little online so I did the
chrome devtools school and when I click
on the introduction video there was Paul
Irish explaining how great chrome dev
tools are and then three days later I'm
at Google and there's live Paul Irish
showing us the cutting edge technology
that chrome devtools how's it working
with I guess it's the professors that we
bring in and always like big gods in the
industry and how they have all these
resources are coming together and just
feeling the creativity that comes with
that it's just really exciting it's just
great to be a part of that I learned etl
five with the guy who wrote the book on
html5 the other day I think it was
yesterday one of the groups was working
with google maps on their project and
they had a question and I I think it
might have been you you said oh well if
you have a question we'll just go get
someone from the google maps development
team to come answer your question I was
like wow you know no big deal right
Google Maps development team
so this has definitely been an
unforgettable week there are a lot of
things only back with me I took a course
in web development at school and I did
learn a lot of cool stuff but nothing as
exciting and cutting-edge in New as I've
learned here you will learn more here
than you will possibly in a semester at
your University it's one thing I think
to read about google and its company
culture and its company's mission it's a
completely different experience to have
come here and seen it first person to
have experienced it to have eaten the
food taking the tour's talked with the
people
just apply it's it's a awesome
experience it's very unique you get to
come all the way to google and get to
experience the culture it's definitely
an experience of a lifetime go ahead and
submit your application because I think
that Google sees potential in everyone a
lot of students are generally worried
that they're not good enough to be a
guru or they're not good enough to be
part of this program I don't think that
students should worry about that because
this is chrome Academy you're not here
to prove yourself or to even land a spot
like as an employee at Google you're
here to learn I would say definitely
apply um don't worry about this only
being a week and it taking away from
your job opportunities to summer because
this is google and i have a job wing
from back home but i'm taking a week off
because this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
