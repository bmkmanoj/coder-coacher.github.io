the way that we do marketing is not
traditional either I spent three awesome
months interning on the entertainment
marketing team for YouTube which is part
of Google and my main project was to
work on a film called life in the day
which was a historic cinematic
experiment we asked people across the
world to film their life in a day and
then we edited down the thousands of
hours worth of footage that was uploaded
to YouTube into one feature-length
documentary that we debuted at Sundance
Film Festival and then showed at film
festivals across the world there never
been a film that have been created like
this when we told people that we were
making a feature film that was entirely
YouTube clips some people were skeptical
as an intern I worked on the team that
determined the entire theatrical and
online distribution strategy for life in
a day I also worked on our social media
strategy and thinking about how we could
engage the YouTube community and all of
our fans on social media to let them
know about life in a day that I actually
got to write tweets that were going out
on the YouTube Twitter account which has
millions of followers I definitely had a
pinch me moment when I was sent on my
first work trip to Los Angeles my
manager told me I want you to run and
organize three events around life in a
day and so I knew that I was empowered
to work on all of these things and
really make them my own but at the same
time I had very experienced talented
marketers alongside me who were helping
me along every step of the way everyone
is really curious excited passionate
interested in problem solving and
working on things and challenges that
have never really been broached before
one thing I really love about Google is
that ideas are currency we don't care
where ideas come from as long as they're
good and so as an intern you have the
ability to speak up and really see your
ideas turn into projects and turn into
big things for the company in Google
Marketing we're storytellers and our job
is to tell people about the awesome
amazing products that Google puts out
who knows what Google's gonna be working
on in five or ten years but that's what
makes it so exciting is that we don't
know we're gonna be marketing
and but we know that it's going to be a
really cool project since making a
difference in a lot of people's lives
