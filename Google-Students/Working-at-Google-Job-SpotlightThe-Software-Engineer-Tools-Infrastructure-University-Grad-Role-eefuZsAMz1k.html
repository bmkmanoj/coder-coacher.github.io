are hearing the voice of Mike I am a
university programs specialist at Google
essentially our team on university
programs is in existence to help inform
you of and prepare you for technical
opportunities at Google so today we're
going to highlight one of our software
engineering roles software engineering
tools and infrastructure we have a group
of illustrious Googlers here today to
talk about their experiences we're going
to be talking about the role how it
plays into Google's development process
and we'll hop on a panel of these folks
so just to have you have an idea of
who's in the room these are the folks
that we'll be talking to you and we will
have a panel at the end and we were
going to kick off our presentation now
my name is Jan I'm a city at Google and
I'm here to kick off this presentation
as well start with just a quick overview
of what we'll be talking about for the
next 15 20 minutes or so I'll start by
touching on Google's development model
how Google develops software and how
that's different than a lot of other
companies develop software we'll talk
about what we call engineering
productivity or end prod which is a huge
part of what SETI's do we'll talk about
the philosophy behind that well sort of
move into what SETI's actually are and
why Google has settings we'll move on
from there to what we call impact
stories which are actual stories of real
cities and how they had an impact on the
engineers that they work with them on
Google's products well touch on how to
tell if you're a good fit for a city
role and then we'll go into a Q&amp;amp;A with
some actual societies about the work
they do at Google we do at Google so
first we'll start I mentioned we're
going to talk about Google development
model and sort of understand Google's
development model it's worth talking
about what we call the traditional
development model which is how software
was developed and sort of the 90s and
2000's and how it's still developed
today a lot of other companies
and the idea by the traditional model is
you have developer or group of
developers and they build a piece of
software and they work on it for some
amount of time and they get it to some
idea of done and then they sort of throw
it over the fence and they pass it to a
different testing team quality assurance
and then quality assurance QA uses that
software tries to find bugs in it gets a
list of bugs throws it back over the
fence to the developers they fix those
bugs they toss it back over and this
keeps going back and forth until either
a QA I can't find any bugs or more often
they just run out of time and have to go
to release this is not a great model
because in order to scale it you have to
hire more people to be testing your
software it's very slow it really sort
of regimens the entire process in a way
that slows everything down so the way
that we do things at Google is this idea
that the developer owns the code and the
tests and is the developers job to build
the software and to make sure that it is
good so to do that rather than relying
on these manual testers instead we rely
on testing infrastructure the idea that
developers can write automated tests to
test their software and what that lets
them do is that lets them fix problems
really fast developer can write some
stuff run a test to see if their
problems fix that that makes things a
lot quicker rather than having to do a
bunch of work get to a stopping point
send it over the wall wait for it to
come back bug fixing is integrated into
the regular developer workflow and cycle
for that so in order to enable this we
basically have to build tools to let
developers do that to shorten the
development cycle and to make testing
really easy so we talked a lot in this
presentation and just studies in general
about what we call engineering
productivity or end product and that's
sort of the cornerstone of what Sade's
do and the key idea behind this is
productivity and quality go hand-in-hand
the more testing you have and the better
quality your software is the more
productive engineers can be because they
don't have to spend all their time
waiting for testers
that I mean you all probably know by now
that if you find a bug a minute after
you write it it's a whole lot faster
than if you found it six months after
you've written
whatever that bug is in and you have to
dig through it so better quality means
more productive engineers and part of
the enterprise philosophy is that
quality is everyone's responsibility
it's not the testers job to find bugs it
is an engineer's job to find bugs you
closely tied to this is the idea of
measurement and metrics and what we call
signals like it says here you can't
improve what you can't measure so we
want to have tools that allow engineers
to get a sense of how many bugs are
popping up how often their tests are
failing how long it's taking them to
release because once you can measure
those you can make concrete strides
towards making them better and closely
tied to this is what we call testing at
all levels which is all the way from a
small piece of code that has unit tests
like you've probably used in classes and
projects all the way up to gigantic
end-to-end tests for testing really
complicated systems with lots of
intersecting parts so an important part
of that is using the right tool for the
job you don't want to use those big
end-to-end tests to test a really small
piece of software you don't want to test
unit tests use a unit test to test a
giant system so underlying all of this
is what it says the bottom of the slide
SETI's our productivity enablers it is
an engineer at Google's job to test
their code and make sure that the
quality's as good as it possibly can be
it is a SETI's job to make it as easy as
possible for engineers to do that so
next we'll drill down a little more on
studies in particular why does Google
have SETI's so like we mentioned Google
development cycle is really really fast
in the traditional model you might work
on a piece of software for
three months six months a year and then
you ship it what you could literally
mean you were putting it in a box and
sending it to Circuit City to sell to
the world Google a lot of teams at
Google are releasing software every week
some teams at Google are releasing
software every day we need to in order
to be able to you know keep up with the
kind of updates that we have to make and
making sure that our products are as
good as they possibly can be so when the
development cycle is that fast we can't
afford to have the kind of slow bug
finding and fixing cycles that exist in
the more traditional model so in order
to make the sort of fast cycle happen we
need to have people whose job is to help
make sure that software is testable as
possible and builds the tools and
infrastructure to make testing and the
development life cycle in general easier
and faster and better so very
specifically what is a SETI that we sort
of been dancing around this for a while
first and foremost the most important
thing is that a SETI is a software
engineer software engineers in the name
it is not a different role than software
engineer it is a different type of
software engineer so a SETI is a
software engineer who builds tools and
processes or tools and infrastructure to
help get our product out faster and
better with fewer bugs the basic
function of the SETI role is to increase
our development speed and make that
development more stable so as a SETI the
the job is to like I said build
automation frameworks build testing
tools that engineers can use to test
their code it's also to build tools and
processes beyond just testing the SETI's
are sort of expected to look at a
developer's workflow figure out what's
painful figure out what could be better
and build tools and processes to improve
that to make them more productive said
he's Drive testability and diagnostics
in products said he's helped make sure
that
the way a product is architected it is
easy to test and it's easy to find bugs
quickly we also had talked about
monitoring and signals that's part of a
Settings job building the dashboards and
monitoring that let engineers see when
there a problem see it quickly and fix
it very fast finally a big part of
Sadie's job is just promoting testing
and promoting best practices said he's
our developers but they're also
evangelists there are the ones who are
really helping engineers realize that a
testing and quality is very important
but B that it's very easy that with the
tools we build it's a lot easier to find
bugs and fix them than you might
otherwise think so I'll hand it off to
Kathleen to a little bit got some more
specific impact stories thanks Dan hi
everyone this is Kathleen I'm going to
walk us through three real-life examples
of actual Googlers who are studies and
some cool projects that they have done
one thing to note in this presentation
while all three examples are around
Googlers who work yet out of New York
we actually have studies all across the
world from Mountain View to London to
Shanghai so the first impact story is my
own I work on the double-click for
publishers engineering productivity team
my favorite project in all my years at
Google was one that sped up my team's
API servers release process by 10x so I
work on a team where our core business
logic everything that matters for our
product is contained at this one API
server our release process is the way we
get changes to that server out to
customers when I was first working on
this project the way that we would do
that was really slow and painful in the
best case we would release once a week
but when things went wrong sometimes it
would take us a month or two to get new
changes out which
had impact in delayed releases and
engineer's being really frustrated that
they had finished their code but it
wasn't landing out in the real world so
what my project did was move a lot of
this manual process to an automated one
so that these things would just run by
themselves every day on schedule and -
this would happen four times a week so
what was really awarding about this
project was one seeing how long it took
our releases to go out like a week go
down to just about 12 hours actually a
10x improvement and second off another
really amazing thing to see was how
happy the engineers my co-workers my
teammates so I said with every day or
that their changes were moving so
quickly the next story that we're
sharing is from one of our engineers his
name is Jalal he works on more general
engineering productivity tools now
before that he was a PhD intern so to
give some context on his work the way
that we figure out whether our code is
working at Google how we know whether
things are broken or not is we have a
bunch of tests that run automatically
all the time when something goes wrong
these tests will break however a lot of
times we still needed someone of
engineer to go and try to figure out
what went wrong and this could take a
ton of time so Dalal's intern project
was based around the question how could
we get a machine to figure out what
broke us instead so his school actually
does that it takes a bunch of heuristics
and speeds up the breakage detection
process because he worked on a problem
that is general - more than just one
team this spread really quickly around
Google today more than 200 teams are
using
and even beyond Google he has a patent
filed to spread this even further
because this is something that companies
all around the world care about our
third and final example comes from
Andrew one of our AdWords engineering
productivity team engineers so when
Andrew joined Adwords
the team was undergoing a big rewrite of
its system architecture and they had a
tight launch schedule that they had to
meet while also lacking any way to
automatically detect if any changes were
breaking the system so Andrew actually
got the opportunity to build an
automation cusp framework from the
ground up he got to talk to the
different developers who are designing
this new system understand the different
workflows that mattered and then got
code of this whole framework himself and
then make sure it was adopted across his
whole team so while this product rewrite
actually finished up a few years ago
even today this is the most used
automation framework for the AdWords
product team so tying this back to you
how do you know if you're a good fit for
the study role so first you need to have
the exact same skills as a suite
candidate what I mean by this is first
you need to be very proficient in one of
Google's core programming languages Java
C++ Python you also need to have a
strong grasp of data structures and
algorithms but in addition to that we
want to know are you you find any of the
things that we just talked about
interesting does the idea of speeding up
for visas excite you does the idea of
getting to build your own framework and
spreading and having it used by all your
co-workers excite you and more generally
are you excited
by the idea of working on problems that
are shared across all of Google in
getting to collaborate with different
teams on building tools and processes to
solve these problems if any of that
sounds exciting to you consider becoming
a study alright we are going to
transition into the panel portion of our
YouTube live so we're gonna kick it off
with a couple of questions for our
studies in the room and if you are tuned
in you are able to chat any questions
that you may have and we will get an
opportunity to answer some of those live
so we're back here live in New York are
my first question and and first thing
I'd like you all to do is if you could
just run down the line again give your
name the number of years you've been or
the amount of time you've been SSID at
Google and a brief description of what
you're currently working on I'll start
hi everyone I am Kathleen I have been at
Google as a study for six years I work
on the double-click engineering
productivity team and my actual product
is double-click for publishers in terms
of projects that I am working on I am
currently doing a huge research project
to measure all the different phases and
and and feature launch and understanding
if there are any huge bottlenecks there
that we can to make our launches go a
lot faster and make our product more
competitive hey everyone I'm Nick I've
actually recently joined Google I've
only been here about six months now but
primarily I focused on low tests and
integration tests between a few
different internal products mostly I've
been working on trying to make those
easier so different teams can spin up a
low test quite quickly without much
effort my name is Dan I've been sitting
here in New York for three and a half
years now I actually run a small team in
New York that builds tools and
infrastructure for engineers across
different app
on iOS I'm part of a broader mobile
focused team around the iOS sub team I
actually don't think I can say all that
much about but I'm working on right now
that's it's cool all right so the first
question for you all is why do you
appreciate the steady roll in comparison
to you to the general software
engineering role what about it excites
you with regard to the work that you're
doing
um what I really appreciate about it is
there is a huge amount of flexibility my
job my team's job is to just make
development better for other engineers
and that's a very very broad mission and
we have an enormous amount of sort of
leeway and freedom to figure out what
that means and build the kind of tools
that we think need to exist to make that
happen so no one is really telling me or
my team what to do we have a lot of
space to define for ourselves what the
job is and I really like that guess
something next one of the things I like
the most I agree with the flexibility
I'm part of a small team and suddenly
certain quite high demand for I am right
now so I get to bounce between different
projects and their individual needs I
not just focused on one project and
importing features for that project but
I get to work and see how these
different servers work and interact with
each other and how the different teams
need to send out and verify that the
different pipelines I'm working
correctly to add on what Dan and Nick
have already said I love that we get to
work on problems that are shared across
so many different teams at Google so
compared to a lot of my sweet
counterparts I've gotten to meet a lot
more teams across the ball and for me
too this has been a great benefit
because I love traveling I love eating
new people and learning about their
challenges and products so that is
definitely one of the things that I
without this role awesome so my next
question and kind of combined with the
question from Ethan on online if you
could describe what a day might look
like for you I know that there's not
necessarily over a typical day but Ethan
was wondering how much programming is
involved in your day to day I remember
we 80% of my time is primarily coding
I've been working a lot of I've been
working on a lot of low tests lately so
I've been working back and forth with
different teams and had I set those up
and running a bunch of different design
Docs but a lot of my time is spent
coding and about 20% of it is meetings
or working with other teams to explain
how my code is going to work how to
interact with those what they have to
change already get better tuning
different results once a week I have
general meeting with continuum I'm
working very close to it but for the
most part I'm what to myself and have a
lot of flexibility specifically what I'm
working on at that time and going back
and forth with other teams I'd say I'm
about the same maybe a little less time
coding just goes like I mentioned I'm a
tech lead for my team so that sort of
involves more meetings and overhead so I
would say it's roughly 2/3 1/3 it's been
about 2/3 of my time coding which is
very broad you know it's it can be as
much researching tools and solutions and
figuring out how they work together as
much as actually sitting down and
writing code and about 1/3 of my time in
meetings usually with the SWE's who are
building tools for to get a sense of
what their needs are and so to figure
out like I mentioned roll up the paint
bumps in their cycle is so you can
figure out how to fix that so my typical
day actually looks pretty different and
a lot of this is because I now manage a
team of studies so one of your big
responsibilities as a manager
the main point of communication with
other teams so I spend a lot more time
talking to different engineers different
teams different ways to see is we have
any problems in common and he is he
already has projects going that are
trying to do the same thing and
basically coordinating and trying to
make sure there are more of us working
on one great solution instead of all of
us doing something that does half the
job I used to code a lot more when I was
just and I when I was an icy individual
contributor but nowadays for me it
probably is more of a 70/30 percent
split somebody percent coordinating
meeting researching and 30 percent
coding next we have a kind of a meta
question from Jacob so how would you say
these test their software testing code
test tasks that's testing to describe a
little bit about what that means really
the same way you test anything else
there's a lot of focus on unit tests for
the tools you know we will write
generally you don't want to write too
heavyweight test for testing tools
because the thing you worry about how
you're testing the test for your tests
and that gets out of control very
quickly but really the same way that you
would test any other piece of software
it's a little more lightweight I would
also say another key indicator for if
you built the right tool if it's working
wrong is whether your clients so your
team your fellow engineers etc are using
what you've built it's a lot since a lot
of our work focuses on solving pain
points for them is they're not using
what we built that's usually a strong
signal that something is wrong but if
they're using it all the time and they
love it and you can
see and also often measure the
improvement in whatever area whether it
be how long it takes them to start up a
little custom environment how long it
takes them to make sure like really
validates our older code is working that
is an amazing signal and usually
actually what we look for also just like
to add please test things and tend don't
just run it on your local machine and
say it works here it's fine actually
hook it up to other products but test
data run the for code as if this was a
normal day-to-day interaction and verify
the results are there so many times you
hear stories outside not here at Google
but just in general you'll see a website
saying this broke there's cases where
you have different units like I believe
this hit NASA once something goes metric
the other ones American units just make
sure you actually do a full test at hand
the next question from Brett what
percentage of your work is implementing
best practices in industry versus
innovating their own ways to do things I
would say it really depends on what
problems were trying to solve I think
it's extremely rare that we look at
something that is coming from the
industry and don't vet it well and by
that I mean we don't we don't just take
a general practice that we hear about
and kind of say oh this is a great idea
let's do this we in order to make sure
that we're doing we're actually making a
difference for our developers we need to
go to them and see you know is something
that you actually care about a lot of
times I think outside best practices can
help shape our thinking and bar it but
it's not it's rare that we just kind of
taken the best practice and implement it
so I would say a lot more of what we do
is
innovation but with that gut check of
first hey has anyone else done a lot of
thinking about this problem or they're
already great tools that exist around
this that I could take to a next level I
think part of that is also you know the
idea of sort of best practices and what
we do is kind of limited because there
just aren't a lot of other companies
doing what we do there are a few and we
have conferences but a lot of times
we're sort of inventing this you know
we're innovating we're the ones who are
coming up with the best practices yeah
I've got a couple more questions before
I wrap up
first question from Dane how much focus
is put on AI and machine learning so
this is actually probably the next big
wave in engineering productivity at
Google and tech companies across the
world so we do have a number of projects
that are starting to use a lot of
machine learning
another example is so one of the ways we
try to prevent failure failures bridges
etc from getting submitted into our code
base is we've run a bunch of automated
tests when we're trying to submit those
and if you broke something that and that
will stop your submission so one of the
common end points for this process is
figuring out what are the actual tests
that are relevant for your code a lot of
pain can also come from if you're
running hundreds of tests but they don't
actually relate to your code so one
effort that's gone on thankful is using
machine learning to really understand
what tests matter for these what we call
presubmit runs so you know what is the
likelihood that if you change this part
of the code days but these other tests
will be effective and
we have a lot more projects that are
also coming down the pipeline that
rotate very heavily on machine learning
it's absolutely going to be an area of
extreme importance for us in the next
five years and onwards I just want to
chime in real fast I unfortunately don't
do machine learning for my specific
day-to-day tasks but I will say we have
open source something called tensorflow
if you're interested in machine learning
I definitely recommend checking it out
right and as our last question just
reflecting on your personal experience
is how much experience programming did
you have language proficiency before
applying to Google as a study you can
reflect on certainly our undergrad or
university experience or anything before
that that you think is useful sure so I
was a new grad when I applied to Google
it's my first job out of college so I
had sort of I guess standard new grad
experience which is to say a lot less
than I thought I did but the one thing
that I did have in particular that's
sort of relevant to my specific role is
I an iOS experience
I built an iOS app and release to the
App Store but I think more broadly for
the seti role specific programming
language or knowledge is kind of less
important than a particular mindset I
think if you find the work of building
tools and building infrastructure and
making other people's lives easier I
think if you find that interesting
that's a lot more important than what
tools you've used or what things you've
done before personally I only graduated
about a year and a half ago I worked a
year out of school and came to Google so
I'll say this primarily I agree language
and libraries don't matter as much a lot
of it is how you think especially since
you're gonna be dealing with a lot of
different projects as a SETI I came in
primarily being Java focus
and ended up doing full-time sepals
falls here I definitely think about how
different products interact and so many
people are focused on scale especially
here at Google that understanding maybe
the basics of distributed systems and
how you have things that consistency
should be something you maybe look into
a few channels but in general specific
frameworks especially since so many ones
are just created and based on papers we
publish they don't open source like
MapReduce it's not gonna matter as much
we care more about the concepts and your
ability to get up to speed quickly then
knowing I learned tensor flow last
weekend or anything of the sort I
started programming early on in high
school so I came in two years experience
that being said I've seen with only a
year or two experience a lot of people
are introduced to programming until
they're in school and I would echo what
Nick says it's not so much the length of
how you've been programming we do want
you to be proficient and improve any
language you should be able to cook your
own programs but what matters more is
once you there you're on a project are
you able to figure out what needs to be
done are you able to debug your code are
you able to go and whether is looking
something up on an internal wiki or
asking someone else for help basically
get the job done that matters so much
more than how much experience you had
beforehand because also as Nick said you
could come in working on one thing and
three years later have worked on five
other things well this has been
illuminating thank you for for all this
fantastic information on the seti role
and thank you for those who are online
for tuning in and we hope that you will
consider
if you are interested in engineering
roles at Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
