we're hosting at hack a hangout on air
on the Google students page about our
software engineering tests position I'm
here with an awesome group of office
cities which is how we call the software
engineering tests to talk about what we
do and how it impacts our products that
you use every day um for those of you
who don't know a CT means software
engineer in test or a special type of
engineers inside Google with very
exciting challenges so let's get started
by introducing each one of the SATs that
we have right here first off is Karen
hey so my name is Carolyn Berg I'm the
automation lead for Chrome on mobile so
that's common iOS and Android I've been
at Google for about five years and
before Google I worked as a developer
for Novell identity manager and I worked
on developmental nice um the next one is
Jonathan hi my name is Jonathan
Velasquez I've been at Google for a
little over five years and I worked on
different products including Gmail Orkut
Google Sites and now working with us
Chaitali hey I'm an ICT on the Google+
back-end responsible for providing
recommendations I've been at Google
three years now but I joined as a recent
grad after completing my master's from
university level so how do all you
Gators out it unlock window at least
Dave hi my name is Dave Chen I've been
at Google for about four years now and
I'm a tech lead manager SCT leading a
team of 12 people on ads specifically
dynamic ads and mobile display ads so I
got my bachelor's degree at Ohio State
go bucs
um and then I got my master's degree
from Johns Hopkins um prior to Google I
was at Yahoo for two years as a senior
software engineer and before that I was
at Lockheed Martin working on R&amp;amp;D all
right um I want to pecan Dave now to get
started with the basics so I'm pretty
sure people are really interested in
knowing like what a software engineering
test at Google does so can you tell us a
little bit about it
sure I'd be happy to um you know to me
it means really two things we focus on
developer productivity one and product
quality two right so if you think about
the traditional testing role it's not
nothing like that right everybody at
Google is responsible for testing right
development at Google is a little bit
unique there are no architects there's
no testers everybody is responsible for
design implementation testing what MCT
specifically work on our automation
tooling best practices um culture shift
for our development process to focus on
the two areas I mentioned developer
productivity and product quality all
right and I think chakali also has
opinions about it sure so I see us
actually as people who improve the
engineering productivity of the team and
that means building the frameworks that
can run - reliably and fast given how
fast we work at Google for shipping
great products I think that's a really
big challenge and it also means making
tools to help your team debug better
write great code and this is for all
Google engineers including us thanks
guys um this is very important for
people to for people to know but um I
know that in the tech industry and
probably for many of the people who are
watching this test is highly associated
with Quality Assurance QA um Jonathan
can you tell us if that's true
I know it's not um and it's not too
closely related to testing either as
some as they've said um actually I when
I hear this misconception I often try to
think of this
we don't allow analogy to what happens
in the car industry you know sometimes
you see these commercials of like the
brand new cars going into a lab and then
you see all this machine's going I'm
making the car go crazy you see all
these robots accelerating to get the car
making it brake making sure that it that
all of the systems work
I dunno sometimes these machines are
maybe even more complex that the actual
car that they are testing well something
very similar happens here uh you know if
we think of a product
such as Gmail to be the car and then an
SCT would be the person that actually
designs all these robots with this
complex sensors we you know we make sure
that we actually have the tools and we
bring up this this infrastructure to
actually go ahead and test a particular
product or maybe several different
products thanks but um if boat rolls a
software engineer and a software
engineering test our building cool stuff
what is the difference between them okay
so there is a slight little difference
in terms of the actual work we're both
engineers writing software so we both go
through the same process whenever we
want to write a new framework we have to
go through a design we do code reviews
we also have bugs assigned to ourselves
that we need to fix so in that sense
it's pretty similar
I think the key difference is that our
software is designed to test whereas the
the software of a so you might be
designed to you know send an email or
create a post I think the cool thing
about an SCT compared to a three though
is that we are able to work our work may
impact different different products at
the same time for instance if a
particular testing framework is useful
google plus then why not use it in
search or using Gmail all right and
let's hear from from Karen who hasn't
talked this until now so I agree a lot
of with what the Amazon site said about
the differences between a sweet set1 and
I often like to say when I explain the
role that se T's are really sweet we
just focus as jonathan say on testing
and and one of the other differences is
we focus often on the product as a whole
so we are working on making the entire
product good so on Chrome mobile and
working on making all of Chrome great on
mobile whereas a lot of SWE's works on
specific features so they might work on
streams or something specific entity
plus a work on some feature of Chrome
but we have to make sure the entire
works and our testing frameworks has to
work for the entire product so that's
really some of the key differences we
write code as Jonathan said we write at
least as complex codes as the sui's and
in some cases I
seems where we actually have been
changing the code written by sweets and
make it better so that's also an
interesting things and I just also want
to say that you might think that these
sweets are like the most important
things for product the day that's not
true
cities are really critical we have very
few manual testing manual test is a very
little manual testing is done and unfun
with ship every week on G+ and others
they ship even more even more frequent
than that and we could not do that if we
didn't have the su T's put in great
testing frameworks and set everything up
so everybody kept the tests so given
those differences um Chaitali can you
tell us a little bit about the
interaction between the SE TS and the
sweets in general like during projects
during meetings during decisions
absolutely and that's a great question
so the interaction between a citizens to
a series is that we sit physically
together so we see a lot of each other
we also get feature requests from sweets
because they are our plank they're the
people we are making these frameworks
and tools for including ourselves but
primarily for them we also act as
consultants for the sweets so right from
the design phase we get involved in like
reviewing design Docs we also do good
reviews for them and generally give
input on how this product can be better
designed so that it's testable
from the very beginning commercially
they also do design reviews for us they
do code reviews for us because we are
implementing these giant frameworks and
tools for them so our code like Karen
mentioned is at least as complex as them
and that does require all the steps of a
good software palette and bars and your
what about on your project how is the
interaction with the in between the
sweets and the su T's it's a lot like
Chaitali said we you know work very
closely together we do code reviews to
each other occasionally when we develop
a new framework we'll get a lot of
questions from them you know we'll get
feature requests I think what's
important to emphasize is that there is
no real add like what happens in other
companies where there is a
competition between the testing team and
the development team and this is not at
all like that this is more of a very
collaborative atmosphere we both work
towards the same goal which is to
deliver high quality products to our
users so now let's try to get people
even more excited and let's help Karen
tell us a little bit about the projects
that ICT is work on so having worked
five years at Google and worked with a
lot of a cities and different projects
we do a lot of different things I have
worked with developers are sad with
developers and help them write better
code understand how to write unit tests
not all developers have tried that
before so work very closely with them
education is a big thing in that way
actually sitting with the developers and
writing the code with them and showing
them how to do things and education has
been mentioned previously I've also
intimate implemented different test
frameworks for web applications Google
Sites d-plus different kind of ways that
we can test it when the frameworks and
then developers and SATs and others have
collaborated and actually writing the
tests I've also worked on tools and I
worked with a lot of cities had worked
on tools I work civilly I worked on a
tool in my 20% time where I worked on
the tool of mexican how testable certain
Java code was and would kind of tell you
hey this is why you need to look at
changing your code so you can actually
write better tests for it and then I do
in Chrome mobile about a little more
than a year ago and I'm really been
focusing on Android specifically are
actually improving the testability we
had a lot of tests but not all of them
are actually passing or they were
passing some of the time so improving us
of the tests were a better measurement
of the quality of the product and Phi OS
we've been implementing test frameworks
forecasting stability bugs and making
sure that we don't actually press and
all that stuff and once we ship to the
App Store and get out to users so a lot
of different projects all over the thing
yeah I can tell Hannam I know that Dave
Dave actually works in ads so can you
tell us a little bit about the
challenges that are normally city in ad
space sure yeah you know ads is an
incredibly complex system I think we
got something like a few thousand
engineers working on ads and it's a kind
of this massive system and you think of
it kind of like as a maybe a 747 or a
just a complex kind of a you know
aircraft that's flying in midair and
we're making changes to it all the time
in midair and everything has to work
right you can't you can't break
something and you know SE T's in ads
typically sit in the middle of very
complex project integrations you know
and we're asked to dive in and figure
out the subtle issues and all of that is
really rewarding right I mean if you
think about ads as a whole we serve on
the order of millions of queries per
second right some of the busiest systems
in the world and you know like it's
critical for our publishers and for
users to serve correct ads so that you
know you can keep getting great content
on the internet for free right that's
that's the thing right like we look at
the bigger vision the bigger picture of
what Google is about and you know we are
at the heart of that and we're making
sure every day we come into work that we
are you know moving uh you know googles
mission forward and we're helping um the
world's best developers develop really
high quality software and and you know
we deal with incredibly complex systems
and the the interesting thing about the
development process at Google is that
you know you may have worked in places
where you depend on you know version 2.0
point five of a particular software
package and they release a new software
package that you depend on and you know
you decide ok I'm going to switch to
that but that's not really the way it
works at Google everything is built and
depends on you know head and we we build
a head and we depend on head and it's a
little scary actually but the systems
and the automation and the tooling that
we've put in place to help engineers
through this is is awesome and a little
bit more about this right we build cross
team tools um you know things that
detect flakiness things that run all of
our unit tests on you know every single
change that goes into our you know one
code base we we do a lot of really
neat dashboard type stuff machine
learning type stuff you know as Karen
mentioned earlier you know we've got
people working on 20% projects you know
some people even work on features just
to get a better feel for the system and
so all of this stuff like tying in all
this stuff together you know the the
scale at Google at which we operate the
mission of that that Google is trying to
fulfill and coming in daily and
interacting with some of the brightest
lines you know in in computer science in
the industry in tech I mean all of that
is awesome stuff that that really can't
happen anywhere else it's just amazing
yeah yeah I've seen that it's such a
great opportunity to to create impact on
the entire world absolutely yeah and now
to to bring it more back to their
day-to-day activities Chaitali can you
tell us a little bit about what a
typical day looks like for nect oh that
stuff I don't have a difficult day
usually you're very different but I try
to quantify things so I think I spent
about 50% of my time on development work
and that includes things like you know
designer of stored reviews writing the
actual codes or implementing things and
then the other 50% is usually
collaboration and that could be a
variety of collaboration from actually
getting feedback on my design Docs so
incorporating like feature equals that
people are bringing to me and so on it
could also be collaboration like
meetings or just whiteboarding session
square is which is where most of our
ideas start off so that kind of
information gathering and input and this
is where is sitting physically with the
team and being part of the team like
Jonathan that she really you have self
so I would say that is what my typical
day looks like but like I said there's
no typical day
assume now for the people who are
watching us right now
and they're wondering what they are
wondering hey should I apply for NCT do
I have the skills that it takes to
Vienna City why don't you guys tell us a
little bit about like what are the
skills the qualities of an ICT Dave sure
I'd love to get us started here you know
just jump back earlier to comment that
Karen made which I thought was awesome
um you know SATs are really software
engineers that focus on product quality
testing automation things like that and
in fact you know we have the exact same
skill requirements in terms of coding
algorithms data structures that a
regular suite has you know it in fact is
actually the same level and if you look
at the leveling across it's all
equivalent you know but but there's an
added dimension to SCT that I think you
know is a great fit for a lot of people
and they don't necessarily realize it so
a few things right you know if you've
worked in if you've coded before you
know that the tools make a huge
difference if if you've got good tools
you're able to be productive if you've
got bad tools you're fighting the tools
instead of you know working on really
cool software right so if tools subtle
bugs um drive you crazy
think about SCT as a potential fit right
if you like looking at things from a
higher-level perspective a system level
perspective a data perspective and you
like thinking about okay data starts
here is processed you know and these are
you know this is like petabytes or more
of data right
cloud computing all of that really cool
stuff that that that is Google is kind
of known for if you like thinking about
data if you like thinking about obscure
edge cases systems under load how to
perform performance systems and also
like how how you know somebody
externally might want to break things or
how we break things internally as we
release as we you know strive to do
things like crazy crazy things like hey
I want to push my software to production
every week right that's a that's a tough
challenge you know think about that
right where the traditional software
model is oh we'll release something
every six months or every year right so
if you if those sorts of problems
interest you ICT is a fantastic rule to
kind of dive in and solve those problems
and think about at a meta level how do
you improve software development how do
you really change the game and make a
you know developing software like a joy
instead of like you know having to deal
with tools and having to kind of you
know finaid
you know pieces that fit together right
and and you know lastly I think a really
important key characteristic of really
good SE T's is the ability and the
desire to communicate across teams
across tech leads across engineers
across you know a whole bunch of
different groups to bring people
together right um and I think that's a
key key characteristic as well right in
addition to the strong strong technical
people we're looking for we look for
strong you know people skills when it
comes to being an SCT because you've got
to be able to bring people together kind
of influence people in pushing the right
solution forward um and you know it's
it's really exciting yeah that's that's
a very very good description of what a
method of what an ICT should have right
that's fun too bad now I'm carrying can
you add a little bit about that well
it's I think they've touched on a lot of
the points but really it's it's either
if you have a big passion for a high
quality code for right helping others
write the code for solving these large
problems it's again as we also talked
about earlier it's it's just as compact
problem exactly they were loving soft
when something cases I even think it's
more complex because how do we test this
software that has all this data and we
can't really test on the black data and
all sorts of things so having a passion
for quality and actually just wanting to
sort of whether it's tools well as
frameworks we wanted to help make
products better if you've been ever been
really annoyed with why does something
work this way why can't they just test
this and make sure it doesn't break as
it is also a great role and you don't
really have to have experienced a lot of
experience with test frameworks and if
you have the I think we are sometimes
refer to it as the test adapt test
ability or if you just have the passion
for these kind of things even if you
haven't written test or test framework
in the past that's fine I did the only
thing I've written when I start at
Google was unit tests we didn't have a
lot of automation just in my previous
job it was a lot of manual testing so
you don't have just one I emphasize you
don't have to be a lot of experience in
writing actually
Automation but if you are interested in
looking at a prologue looking at the
cold how can it work
what closely with both SWE's and test us
in some cases to figure out how can I
make everybody's life better not just to
sweets for those of the magnet testers
and make sure that they don't have to do
like riveted the same relative task
every every day so we can again release
often weekly daily really a lot of
impact so it's a great product also a
great role if you want a lot of impact
as well
and you can work on anything we have
people from keep lots ads mobile that's
a ton of different areas if you have
particular interests oh we have people
from all those areas right here right
now and that's just the five of us right
so yeah exactly all right all right guys
thanks for joining us today we hope you
learned more about what a software
engineering test role at Google is if
this is a role you guys are interested
in you can search for software
engineering tests on the Google comm
slash jobs website or if you're a
student right now looking for an
internship or a full-time job you can go
to Google comm students a slash at sweet
new grad SWE new grad and indicate
you're interested in the solar
engineering test role that's that's how
you do it thank you very much for
joining us I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
