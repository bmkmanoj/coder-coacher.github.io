what that was given to our topics today
so the first things first is intros
you've met me in just a second you'll
need these two then we'll get into some
resume tips and practice with a
fictional resume and then we'll let
these to answer all of your questions so
again please be sure to use the chat
feature and with that take it away
all right hi everyone my name is Jared
farmer I am a university graduate
recruiter here at Google I graduated and
the summer of 2010 from the University
of North Florida with a degree in
marketing and then I joined here at
Google last summer in July of 2015 on
the new grad team been enjoying my time
here very much and one of the you know
more enjoyable parts about this role is
I get to do fun things like this you
know that's not part of my primary job
but I get to come out and contribute
where I can hi and my name is Carol sue
Chia and I am on the tech intern bikuni
team I graduated from UC Berkeley with a
bachelor's in economics I've been here
since November of 2009
so it'll be seven years next month my
favorite thing your Google there are so
many things but it really fits the
people I come into work every day so
exciting to be with my amazing team or
just as excited as I am to come in every
day and just do great things all right
so now that we've got through the intros
let's talk about the fun stuff
why is your resume so important so I
want to go ahead and tell you a few key
points here your resume it's your first
interaction with the company they
haven't met you before so at this point
we don't know anything about you
your resonate could be the first time
that we read your name and you want to
make sure you're putting on the best
representation of yourself your resume
lets us can know how to connect with you
it gives us your name your contact
information and you know allows us know
the best way to reach out your resume
needs to highlight your biggest
accomplishments and your skill sets we
don't know what you don't tell us so be
sure to you know pat yourself on the
back and really highlight some of the
fun things that you're very proud of as
well by reviewing your resume we're able
to determine what roles are best suited
for you in addition to making sure that
the roles that you're applying for are
also a good fit there as well and
remember that the resume screen is the
first of what's hopefully mini steps so
you want to make sure you get off on the
right foot and hopefully if that allows
you to move forward to what typically is
a phone interview for the next step in
the recruitment process okay so where
does it make tips so just please keep in
mind that everything that we cover today
is just a guideline there's no exact
science so we hope that you use this to
kind of help you um create an amazing
resume so that you can apply to
companies like Google feel free to take
pictures of the following slides to help
you either revamp or create your resume
so generally what we're looking at when
we're looking at your resume is that it
needs to be easy to read and simple
right so use the bullet points action
words like created
and include your contact information and
email in terms of whether your resume
should be one page or two pages if you
need to go to two pages that is
completely fine and make sure that is
relevant also generally when it comes to
highlighting your resume you should
really tailor your resume so that it
highlights the requirements of the role
so when you're looking at a role online
look at what they list as the kind of
requirements of qualifications of the
role and make sure that your resume
highlights those all right so resume
tips education education should be front
and center as long as you're in school
that is so you want to list your
education first please be sure to
include your degree in major and
definitely make sure that you include
your graduation date at least the Year
month is acceptable to GPA key courses
and any relevant coursework should also
be included on the education portion of
your resume
lastly provide a brief description of
any important projects that you've
completed while in school alright so for
experience in terms of experience keep
it clear and concise make sure you
highlight your accomplishments once
again this is the time to pat yourself
on the back highlight your
accomplishments versus a long
description of what you did keep things
chronological and order just to showcase
all your experience and that means put
everything that's most recent at the top
and then as things move back in history
put it lower down on the resume as well
but other things to highlight under your
experience are internships student
groups you know hacks that you've
participated in if you haven't done any
of these that's okay make sure you just
include some of the projects and things
that you've done on your own time as
well while you've been in school okay
and so for extracurricular activities we
also want to know what makes you you
right so if you were the head of your
robotics team at school include that if
you were involved in any type of Olympia
include that anything in the sense of
even outside of computer science for
example if you can solve a Rubik's Cube
in 15 seconds include that find that
really interesting all right so now
let's actually take a look at a resume
and let's go through the review process
ourselves we've discussed why the resume
is so important and we're gonna go
through this section in three main
chunks so for this first part let's see
what is positive let's see what Han Solo
did well here first Han listed his
proficient languages starting with
c-sharp where he is most proficient and
worked his way down the list through
sequel where we assume he is least
proficient they're included all of his
post-secondary institutions he attended
the Rebel Alliance University in scruffy
nerf-herder college his education is
first obviously as we just mentioned
making it easy for recruiters to verify
that you're eligible for the role that
you're applying for once again as long
as you're in school education should
come first
ok so let's talk about what he needs to
improve on regarding his resume one his
contact information is incomplete there
is no phone number or email listed so
how are we supposed to contact him if
we're interested in reaching out to a
firm role so that definitely needs to be
included any for example also if you
have a LinkedIn profile or github please
go ahead and include those links but
please make sure that they are correct
also regarding that the graduation you
can see that he does not include his
expected or anticipated graduation date
we need to know that so we know whether
he is eligible for an internship or a
full-time role just as a side note for
an internships for example if you're
applying to a summer 2017 internship
candidates must be continuing their
education so they need to be continuing
that education in the fall of 2017 in
order to be eligible
alright now let's talk about Hans
experience so once again I'll start with
the positives he listed his experience
second after education as discussed
previously your education is your
biggest undertaking right now you should
come first be proud of it
Ulysses experience in that chronological
order we also chat about most recent
first moving back in history towards the
bottom as things get further back
included the title the company and the
dates while they were at those specific
companies so how could we improve this
section for one his formatting could use
a little bit of work and as you can see
his dates kind of get cluttered because
they're included in the employment
sections we want to make sure that
everything that his dates are to the
right of the company's name and to make
sure that is consistent all the way
through so it makes it less cluttered I
me also notice that he wrote paragraphs
regarding his responsibilities
we want to make sure that I mean the
content itself is great but bullet
points would definitely keep the
descriptions concise and a more reader
friendly
so speaking of bullet points we
definitely want to start all the bullet
points with action words for example the
words like created or implemented or
design are great you don't also want to
start all the points with I okay when
writing your bullet points focus on the
results in the impact by listing metrics
rather than kind of long descriptions
tell us what work you did what you used
and what the end result was please only
include the relevant work for example is
great that he you know was a wookie
Walker but is not applying for those
roles so he should probably eliminate
this section all right so now for the
activities let's talk about the
positives and here so included his
activities which tells him what sets him
apart from everybody else he also told
us that he participates in programming
ditions all this stuff is great but
there are some areas that could have
been beneficial where we could have
corrected those of which it's great that
include these activities and the
programming languages but it's best to
have this in bullet point format as
Carol just discussed also Han is more
than welcome to tell us about its other
activities and interests even if they're
unrelated to computer science that's
actually one of my favorite things I
love when you throw them something very
personal I've seen master knitter before
and that might just be my favorite in
history there but it is important you
know just be proud of the other things
that you're doing outside of your degree
- okay so how could that's fine so for
references I'll finish up the slide chat
about the references they aren't
necessary on a resume actually if you
really didn't want to include it it's
okay to just say references you know
furnished upon request but really will
ask for references if they are needed
and let you know when we'll be following
up with those references as well all
right oh okay okay so let's look at this
revamped resume so you can see that it's
nice and clean right he's included his
contact information
he includes his expected graduation date
so we can definitely contact him
regarding roles at Google and you can
see here that the formatting is also
very very clean he starts all of his
responsibilities with bullet points um
so if you were a recruiter to look at
this and say would you rather look at
this that has the bullet points or would
you look at rather look at some of long
paragraphs and also you can see
regarding these awards and activities he
also included his great accomplishments
all right so that's a lot of information
hope you got all of that we will go
ahead and move forward and kind of just
throw out a quick recap here so
education comes first if you are in
school degree and expected draggers
should be at the top help us get to know
you
those extracurriculars you have anything
that you like to participate in
obviously we do want to know everything
about your computer science background
if you are applying for software
engineering roles but we also just want
to know more about use of student groups
you know those extra initiatives that
you take on whether it was a school
project or maybe something that you're
starting up yourself we'd love to know
as much as possible and remember bullet
points are your friend it definitely
helps everybody when we are reviewing
your resume all right so this is Kat
again a little bit off screen but this
is your turn students to ask questions
so please be sure to fill out the chat
feature I'm going to get us kicked off
I'm going to ask Jared and Carol some fa
Q's so first of all why should i as a
student include my GPA on my resume ok
good question so just remember that the
GPA is only part of your story it's just
a piece of the puzzle it isn't the most
important piece of who you are so make
sure that you include all your
accomplishments and projects in and
outside of the classroom
thanks second frequently asked question
do I need to include a cover letter a
cover letters are completely optional we
prefer that you spend your time creating
that amazing resume but if you do
include a cover letter just remember
that it should include something that is
not already including your resume and
third FAQ what do I need to conduct my
interviews alright so for a phone
interview you will need a computer with
internet access and Google Docs our
coordinators will send you out links to
the docs and maybe anything additional
for a phone interview such as a hangout
link please be sure to take a look at
those links verify that you have access
prior to your interview and confirm that
with the coordinator and if there is any
issues we can get those worked out if
you are coming on-site typically one of
the few things that will require is a
official ID just so we can get you
checked in but most the time we don't
require anything else also when you do
come on-site it is always
good idea to make sure you arrive early
my personal mentality is I'd rather be
somewhere a half hour early than ten
seconds late all right are you all ready
to take some live questions already
awesome so the first one comes from
Bhargav Shah I have a question which
hinders me all the time I don't have
solid experience because I just did my
masters what are my chances of getting a
job at Google
I have proficiency in Python you want to
go yep so one of the things is we look
at things also outside the classroom so
when you were in your master's program
if you worked on class projects
definitely hi I like that so that would
be a header you would put projects and
then give a highlight of that project
and include that you use Python and I
would just definitely highlight the
projects the class projects yeah and
something in addition you know we do
understand that you're coming out of
school really not too many students are
gonna have a whole lot of experience at
this point anyways so we like just to
make sure that you know when you are
going through the interview process we
are finding everything about you
specifically we're not going to compare
you to anybody else you know whether
they have more or less experience so
make sure you just highlight everything
that you are very proud of on your
resume to put your best foot forward and
then we'll take a bit care of everything
else from there next question comes from
Tanisha Cruz does Google have a required
GPA no we don't as we have stated about
the GPA that is only part of your story
so definitely include your
accomplishments and any other activities
outside of school they that you've
required next one is from Arun vikarna
and I apologize if I mispronounced your
name can we use different colors on the
resume oh I do like fun resumes I think
the most important thing to keep in mind
here though is you do want to make sure
it's easy to read but I definitely see
you know individuals have put graphics
on there or just make it you know very
fun and almost like interactive I think
all that is fine but you do just want to
make sure that you know all that extra
stuff is great but that the content
they're the main purpose of a resume is
not being jeopardized by anything that
you know just kind of fund up there on
there but definitely be creative be
yourself you definitely love looking at
those things
you know if I see you know a bunch of
resumes that look the same you know
everything starts to run together so do
what you can to set yourself apart but
you definitely don't want it to take
away from your accomplishments your
experience right you want to make it
easy to read so personality good rainbow
back next question comes from Earls egg
how do I dress resume gaps if I'm a
returning student who has worked in an
unrelated field I think it's best just
to put you know all your current
information there things I've seen
before is if you just want to fill in
that slot with you know what you were
doing you know tell us that story
remember we do look at everything has a
hole so not everybody is gonna be a
carbon copy of somebody else not
everybody leaves on a Friday start
somewhere else that very next Monday and
that's okay I think whatever you feel
comfortable sharing with us up front is
totally fine or if you are working with
a recruiter share your story with them
you know we are your advocates who want
to help you through this process next
question comes from Rosie Davis a
master's student I've heard conflicting
things about whether to include my GPA
and whether to use my graduate GPA or my
full GPA from my institution is there a
preference so we if I'm understanding it
I'm you should include your cumulative
GPA not just your major GPA because we
do ask for you to include your
cumulative GPA and I do see pretty often
that sometimes there will be the
cumulative as well as your major next to
it so it's fine to include the major but
make sure you do include the full GPA as
well next one is from Dubin o comm can i
list fallen tier participations as part
of my extracurricular activities also
does the resume have to be on one page
especially if the extracurricular
activities are surplus I think you know
volunteering experience is great you
know regardless of how you were
volunteering you know we definitely love
to see somebody who wants to take extra
initiative go you know above
beyond just what they're supposed to be
doing right now you know focusing on
school you know we love when people are
taking you know advantage of
volunteering experience Carol mentioned
this earlier it does not matter to my
eyes if everything is all on one page
especially if there's good news awaiting
for me at the bottom so if I have to
turn the page or you know scroll to see
the next page that's totally fine with
me right because I'd rather have
something in a readable font versus a
six point font because you can get
everything on a page so we're gonna take
this last one just for now but students
please continue to use this chat feature
you have Jesse and Jess picking out the
best questions to ask out loud um so
this one is Byron Fung do you like
seeing personal websites listed in
resumes and if so what do you recommend
they should contain and what are some
common mistakes you've seen in them I
can take this um yeah I think they're a
lot of fun you know obviously the resume
to just the nature of the beast needs to
be somewhat formal just so it is easy to
read like a psychic you throw in your
personality you can have a lot of fun
with the resume have all the same but a
website that's really all you you are
more than welcome to do anything that
you would like so I will pretty much
anytime I see that there's a link on on
somebody's resume I will I will click it
and just check it out see if there are
some you know extras that they couldn't
fit you know whether it was you know
photos of them participating in the
hackathons or photos from like you know
their previous internships or just you
know friends at school all that stuff is
great I don't really know if I've seen
any mistakes I think obviously what you
want to consider here is you know use
your common sense you are sending this
out to potential employers so you just
want to make sure that anything that you
know goes on there you would also put on
your resume should it fit or should it
be that interactive but I love them I
keep them coming
yeah but links in general make sure it
does link to the correct website or docx
or what have you because I have had
situations where I've clicked on a link
and was either broken or it took me just
someplace different alright so we're
gonna take a break from the Q&amp;amp;A for now
let's assume that a student has taken
all these wonderful
and has made the resume incredibly
strong they're ready to apply how do
they do that
yes so what they would go ahead and do
is go into our website which is it's up
here you can see it ID code slash
student careers and go ahead and search
for the roles that best fit your
background experience and interests
remember to upload your resume and your
transcripts unofficial is completely
fine we do not require an official
transcript and then click Submit just to
let you know for if you're interested in
software engineering internship roles we
are now recruiting for our summer 2017
software engineering roles that
application period will be open until
December 2nd as well as our engineering
practicum summer internship Bowl our
full-time software engineering
University grad walls are open
year-round so you can apply to that role
at anytime we hope to see a lot of
applications come in alright let's see
do we have any more questions we do are
we ready for a few more yes awesome so
this next one is from Earl's ed how
frequently should I resubmit my resume
all right so I'm going to make a couple
assumptions here maybe you went through
the process you know I hate this
conversation no matter if it's
hypothetical let's just say things
didn't pan out typically we do recommend
waiting a year to apply to a similar
position so let's say hypothetically you
were applying for a full-time software
engineering role obviously we have
several of those you know listed we
would recommend that you know you do
give yourself a year to come back build
yourself up you know show us that you
know this next time can be different but
I do believe for other roles if you're
looking like an APM or even an
internship as long as you were eligible
or returning for back to your school
once the internship was complete things
like that you would be eligible to apply
for right away next question is Deepthi
thought to Cora when is it a correct
time to apply for roles before
graduation or off after graduation
I think that's a pretty subjective
question just because I think the only
blanket statement I feel comfortable
making is whenever you feel most
comfortable you know yourself better
than anyone else you know Google does
offer a lot of great study resources
online for you to take a look at when
you really feel like you have a good
grasp of those materials and you're
meeting you know the minimum
qualifications hopefully you know most
of the preferred ones as well I think
that's really when it's a great
opportunity to apply I don't really
think there's a solid rule of thumb
whether before or after graduation it's
all up to you and when you feel best and
then if you're applying for an
internship obviously as I've stated you
have to be continuing students so the
deadline to apply for our summer
internships on the technical side on the
software engineering side is December
2nd so there is kind of a hard deadline
to make sure you submit your resume
before then next question is from Marco
Hernandez most of my job experience has
been restaurant based although I am a CS
major should I add relevant information
about them or leave them off entirely so
it's if you have four years of
restaurant experience you definitely
want to include that to show that you
have been employed but also kind of
highlight your CS projects right so
highlight the technical but definitely
include you know kind of a short blurb
about that you were employed for four
years in the restaurant industry I would
second that for sure next one is from
nineteen Tong what are the qualities you
look for prospective employees there's a
lot I mean I'm myself I love it when I
take a look at a res man and I just you
know get excited it's well formatted
there's a lot of fun stuff there's some
personality to it but you know nobody is
supposed to be the same as somebody else
so I wouldn't want to say that oh I like
this about somebody but I don't like it
about this other individual I think you
know when you put your best foot forward
and you get us excited about the process
and working with you I think that's when
that feeling
it's very mutual and you know we can't
wait to just you know move forward so
those next steps hopefully with you next
one is from Alex Craig would you
recommend having a relevant coursework
section on my resume definitely I see
that at the top usually it's usually
under I think people used it listed
right under their school they'll put
relevant coursework and they'll indicate
so we know especially if you're
currently taking and it's not in your
transcripts definitely include that and
every now give me you know we will see
you know individuals who don't
necessarily have a CS major or possibly
is just a minor or but they have a
strong passion for it so the point is is
it's okay if you haven't taken too many
relevant courses if you are showing
enough initiative outside of that too
next one is from Nicholas Piero's is it
a good idea to include a major
accomplishment such as becoming an Eagle
Scout even if it happened before
attending college oh definitely I see
that all the time you should be very
proud of your wars I know that Eagle
Scout it is it takes many many many
years to become an Eagle Scout so
definitely I would definitely include it
and it looks like that is our last
question for today you guys were in the
hot seat great thank you oh sorry last
one um Denise Stefan saggin door asked
can you please talk about projects how
to showcase that during an interview
that's a good one to close on yeah um
well I always like to think of you know
interviews kind of like if you want to
like speak to a professor in school you
know obviously all of our engineers here
have a lot of similarities but they're
also very different so I think just kind
of opening up that conversation with
that specific engineer during your
interview it's great you know it's it's
not a bad idea just to kick off the
conversation yourself and mention hey
you know I've done this before and I'm
you know really proud of it and I'm sure
the engineer will give you a great
response and you can have you know that
back and forth conversation with them
but you know every person here at Google
is very different so I think that
conversation you know vary quite a bit
but yeah absolutely start off and you
know
yeah on the right foot you know give
yourself that pound the back talk about
your projects and things that you're
proud of all right
again thank you both so much I'm
students I hope you did RSVP if you
didn't if you see that tomorrow's
session look similar it's because
represented the exact same things and no
need to tune in but definitely encourage
your friends to do so and with that
thank you so much for your time thank
you thanks everybody
