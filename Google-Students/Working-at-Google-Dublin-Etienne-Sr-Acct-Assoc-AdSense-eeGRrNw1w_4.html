from the start I was definitely
encouraged to bring a fresh new look
into the product and into the way we
were working and I was introduced to
what we call the ideal pitch it's very
straightforward you can go whenever you
want to this page online and write any
ideas you might have on how you could
improve the product or any internal
processes that we have at first I
thought it was just one of those ideas
that you can post and you'll eventually
get feedback but I was amazed to see
that within a week I got a lot of
feedback on my ideas and that my ideas
were actually valued from top management
within within Google Adsense what's even
better with that is that some of my
ideas were actually taking into
consideration and added to the roadmap
flat sent and a couple of months later
my idea was actually implemented in the
product which is actually amazing
because I know today that a little
feature that I thought about month and
month ago is now being used by thousands
of publishers all over the world my name
is a tendril goo and I work for Google
Adsense as an account manager</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
