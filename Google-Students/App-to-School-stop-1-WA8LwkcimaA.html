apps to school bus tour we're in sunny
Los Angeles and let's see what the
students have to say about what they
like about using google apps we are
using a lot of move it out google
documents yeah google docs we use Google
Calendar Google Calendar can't email
gmail gmail gmail I use all that I love
google docs because I can access them
from computers on campus and from home
for sharing documents with our
professors and other tas things like
rosters and grade books where the
student-run radio station and trying to
coordinate volunteers to post shows or
to go out and flyer and hollywood clubs
and things like that it'll make a form
for you and then just fill that straight
into the spreadsheet so that saves all
of us at a time
I specifically use calendar dealing with
our College television station on our
interview show we use calendar to bring
tons of guests on to the show and we use
the calendar to book them that way all
of the student producers can be on the
same page and they can all edit the same
calendar and it really helped my
roommates and I all share the google
calendar so we know where everyone is at
any given time when music industry major
one of our artists is out on tour right
now I can throw dates in the Google
Calendar tell me exactly where he's
supposed to be the next night we keep
all of our different shows separate from
our radio dates and it's easy to tell
what's going on by colors I've been
using gmail since the second date came
out I'm an old-school user the
conversations are the best with a
professor you don't have to keep tracing
back where your email is from as all my
contacts ever save just type in search
and every person comes up a lot of the
other email accounts that I've had kind
of got filled really quickly if I wanted
to save something or archive something
it just wasn't feasible especially with
all the class projects that i have when
i started using gmail but I ever needed
anything I could just search for it so I
could archive it and not think about it
and it'd be fine they make everything
easy and integrated it just makes for
really seamless experience like my whole
life is on that thing google gave me the
tools and i figured out how to use
do you have your own story about using
google apps upload your response today
