us on the hangout on air for go global
with google india they're very happy
that you are interested to know more
about opportunities in google within
your new location you've already seen
the email with introductions about
Davidson carry Nicola and Stephanie have
joined us so let's start off right away
Davidson audio you next slide please so
again thank you for joining us we want
to take this opportunity to share a
little bit about what to expect in your
new location especially for those of you
that are going to be studying in the US
or Canada as well as in Europe so want
to share what to expect there in terms
of the recruiting process and the way
recruiting works your new location the
roles and opportunities that are
available at Google what to expect in
the recruiting process and a little bit
about the program's happening in those
locations and then we'll have time for a
couple of q and A's from the questions
that over prior to this event next slide
so at Google we do pride ourselves on
our mission which is to organize the
world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful this
is something that Google is really
believe in it's something that really
has a meaning to our work and the
products that we're creating and I hope
you're all excited about some of the
great products and great innovations of
leave-taking especially with maps google
plus and some of the more innovative
products such as self-driving cars those
are types of interesting internship
projects that you could get your hands
on in opportunity in North America as
well as so look out for those types of
projects once you can get an application
process next slide
so there are more than a dozen locations
in North America so we won't have too
much time to cover all of them uh where
the opportunities are going to be or the
most opportunities are actually going to
be area which includes several buildings
in particular headquarters sort of
complex which you see on the right hand
the right hand picture here we will have
several hundred internet in terms each
summer in headquarters but we also have
physicians available in San Francisco as
well as the sample no location and
mountain view contains all of the major
projects and major product areas that we
have and including search maps ads etc
us or will be hundreds of different
types of projects available there I'm
going to be turned over to Kari to cover
the locations in throw ice medicine as
mention my name is Carrie I work in our
London office and work on the in 10 team
there so in Europe we have a large
number of offices and into which we hire
engineering interns on main hubs beans
York and London but we also hire in to
Cracow Warsaw Israel Munich Paris you
can see there's quite a large variety in
the majority of the offices well we have
our software engineering roles in all
offices and with a variation of roles in
the larger hubs but we'll come on to
that in a second next slide clean the
recruiting process so we understand that
this is probably going to be on a
different time scale than what you're
currently used to one of the key things
to be aware of is recruiting in your
animals America starts very early in the
season so you should expect to be
looking for and preparing to apply for
app for internships as earlier September
maybe even August in North America all
of our applications as soon as they open
will be available on our student job
site which will share with you a bit
later in the presentation
but you should really have that as your
first point of contact to be aware of
opportunities available for you
similarly in all of your universities
you'll most likely find a career center
we just go back please and the Career
Center's you should really make the most
of them we have very strong
relationships with many career centers
and they're aware of our application
process and and how you should be
preparing to apply similarly we come to
many campuses and run careers fairs
whether it be a large number of
companies that come in you can just come
along and have a chat with people there
and in certain universities will do more
in-depth events such as technical tools
information sessions so make the most of
your careers fairs and career services
or even finds out what opportunities
will be running on your campuses next
slide please so briefly touched on these
roles earlier but the majority of our
internships both in North America and in
Europe will be software engineers we
have software engineers than pretty much
every office that we that we have the
next largest opportunities our site
reliability engineering so in Europe
these are mainly in Zurich London and
Munich and Dublin those are the four
offices where we offer these
opportunities but they are also
available in North America and then we
come on to associate product managers or
a PMS these are there's a much smaller
number of these rollers available but
are definitely sought after and again we
have user experience for those that
maybe have a background that suits more
to this position next slide please ok so
you've decided that you're eligible and
you'd like to go for an internship so
what next so the main recruitment both
in North America and Europe takes place
between october and save you a that's
when the bulk of our offers are made but
as previously mentioned we will probably
start into being a little bit earlier
than that
the key thing to know at Google and for
our internships if you actually apply
for a role so you'll apply for a
software engineer or a site reliability
engineer but at that stage you won't be
aware of the exact project just yet so
we keep it very open and then as you go
through the process we tend to narrow it
down particularly in Europe internships
take place year-round so through a PhD
student we can be very flexible to
ensure that that fits in with your with
your studies and the same with master
students you can even start potentially
in January in Europe North America is a
little bit stricter but they still have
some flexibility the key thing to
remember is that we need you to be
available for three months the work is
full time and you will be paid but you
have the great opportunity to work in
all of our offices globally a few
requirements from our site so you must
be studying that can be a bachelor's and
master's or PhD it needs to be in
computer science or a similar technical
field and you need to be able to start
and finish your internship before you
complete your studies we'll be looking
for you to have experience in software
system software and algorithms and
excellent programming skills in C++ Java
Python and we also look at other
languages if needed if you're going
there in the ends of your studies or you
already want to start thinking about new
grad opportunities again you'd apply
through our website and you can apply
for these if you're in your final year
of education or if you've been out of
university less than 12 months next
slide please okay so I'm going to hand
it over to Nicola he'll talk you through
the interview process thanks very hi
everyone my name is Nicola I've work
here from the Zurich office and I'll
talk to thinking about that interview
process and here at Google so um if it
was a little bit depending on whether
you interview for a full-time or an
internship division and for a full-time
position you would start with one or two
phone interviews and if successful you
will then be invited for and um reverb
on site interview slowly between three
and four
and then we collect all of the
information and all of the feedback on
the interviews and we and submitted to
the hiring committee where it's reviewed
by pile of engineers and they decide
whether on whether or not we make you an
offer and for an intern position
normally have two phone interviews and
then your packet if you live by
continuing validity and proposal horse
and then you go into the project
matching place where the project close
try to determine whether there is a
match between your skills and the
projects that they have victor is then
you have one more interview which is the
project interview to determine and the
suitability suitability for the project
and its successful need any given
another and next slide please so what
are we looking to assess and we
definitely look into assess your coding
so the language syntax your core
knowledge of core libraries um and I'm
performance issues your services of
analytical skills your google eNOS and
also topics such as scrap sorting
algorithm hash tables and so on and a
few tips on how to prepare for interview
it's good if you have a strong MCS
fundamentals and know how to apply them
so know how to apply data structures and
algorithms and need to be excellent
coding in one of the languages C++ Java
or Python and and also below among
presentation you can see a few websites
where you can practice your cronies
skills and the website such as cod quota
or and google chrome and it's also good
and as part of preparation for interview
to get some experience for example by
taking part in open source communities
and next slide please I'm lost you in am
Europe we also have a few scholarships
which you could apply for one of them is
they need to walk scholarship and which
is open to women and it offers the
successful applicant seven thousand
euros scholarship and also
get invited to a two-day retreat here in
Zurich office or you can meet under I
need four finalists and we also have a
travel grant program where which allows
students to will travel to some of third
and selective conferences and we cover
the cost of travel and cover and the
conference be so basically all expensive
and taken care of and you can apply for
them and you can also give different
scholarships on the google.com / student
/ and scholarships website ah thank you
I'll hand over to questions I believe
now yeah thanks so much Nicola okay so a
lot of you have submitted quite a few
questions and we've selected a few to be
answered I live here for you so okay
moving on to questions the first
question I'm a future master student
starting this fall Google like many
other companies a tense career fairs in
fall which happens roughly within two
months after the start of the semester
what exactly would be the expectations
from google for potential student
interns given the short period of time
they have been there how should such
students best utilize the summer of
holidays between their bachelor's and
start of master's program that's
actually a really great great question
so if you're not already doing an
internship this summer you know there
are a few things that you can probably
do outside of you know having a formal
internship to keep your skills up I
think one of the best ways is actually
to have your own personal project
whether that's you know creating an
Android app or creating your own you
know website running your own database
etc are creating your own database and
that you can certainly gained a lot of
skills or na the practice and that just
adds to your qualifications in your
resume you know there are the google
summer of code that you can also
participate in if you would like they
think a lot of it is just keeping up
your skills and really hands-on projects
another thing a video is actually you
know learn about
you know the different opportunities
that will be available to you in your
new locations and of course relax enjoy
your summer it is you know it some of
you will be going on to study and it's
you know really a good time to just know
really balanced enjoy the summer take a
vacation etc and then be prepared for
another round of school so enjoy the
time that you actually have time off if
you're not doing an integer ok thank you
for that Davidson the next question I'll
be studying of M&amp;amp;MS coercion or
autonomous agents robotics from
University of okiewan wrentham
University what are the opportunity
opportunities and probability of me
being connected with Google in terms of
student programs internships and
considering that there is no Google
office ok and yeah so basically the
question is about if i'm studying
robotics can i be considered for
internships and opportunities with
google yeah so good questions so i think
there's a couple of pieces to this
question that we can look at so we do
have a number of more specialized
projects within the internship so if you
were studying robotics then there's a
likelihood that we've be able to find
your project that would being align with
your skills and interests the key things
that we will be looking at at the
interview stage however as we said
before is more general istic skills such
as algorithms data structures and so on
and programming so we would need you to
have that core knowledge and then as you
go through the process as i said we'd
have the ability to it to narrow down
and look at more your key skills the
piece on location is also important i
think because we don't even though we
may not have an office in every location
to see and we're very flexible in where
we can have people in turns so it's
really where your interest lies and
where you would like to internship in
turn so if you're in canada and you'd
like to intern in Europe that is
possible and we would treat your
application the same as any other
application
and go through the interview process and
then when we found you an awful we'd
work with you to ensure that we could
secure a work permit for you and my
recommendation is to remain flexible on
your location so the more open you are
the higher chance we have of finding you
a role if you're very specific about
location and project and obviously you
narrow your opportunity down but when we
review your application we're really
reviewing you for Google as opposed to
just one office or just one region so
that's definitely a possibility okay
thanks Carrie before we move on to the
next question just a reminder that I've
sent you all the YouTube channel links
so you can post your questions live
right now in the comments section and if
we have time we can take a couple of
questions from the comment section okay
the next question is will a student
enrolled in spring semester be
considered for internship during the
first summer I take that one um yes so
really the key components for an
internship are that you will be
returning to your studies afterwards or
that the internship is a mandatory part
of your degree so said some universities
require you to complete an internship
with a company before you are able to
graduate so here if you enrolled in
January 2015 you would be considered for
an internship during the summer
providing you meet the criteria I've
already mentioned the thing for you to
remember here is whilst your course may
not start until January as long as
you're enrolled and you're officially
part of that course you can apply before
then so just keep an eye on the
application openings and as soon as you
feel ready then you should apply and can
go through the interview process and you
know we do fill our roles on that first
come first serve basis but we definitely
have roles available at the beginning of
the year still
okay so we can wait for a minute to see
if we have live questions from any of
the students perhaps me we can talk a
little bit about you know the internship
program and what what to expect during
your time at Google carrier Nicola do
you want to talk a little bit about that
and you know from the you know and
onboarding to maybe even the development
programs or fun events that we have
during the summer yeah sure so the so
the infant internships in Europe of
varying length so some people will be
with us for just three months some will
be with us for a little bit longer you
generally will go through an induction
on your first day need your teams get an
understanding of what's going to be
expected you over the course of the
summer and then you're thrown right in
it so right from kind of the beginning
we expect you to be involved in a
project and to be working as all the
rest of your team are ramped up is
pretty quick and quite steep but I think
most of our interns really enjoy that
they love having that hands-on
experience right from the beginning
throughout your internship you'll have
access to various technical talk social
activities that are either organized by
your team and or organized by the intern
recruitment see if you're with us in the
summer in europe the culmination of all
our efforts azhar is our intern summit
which is a tuesday event in zurich where
we bring all our interns together for a
few days of talks hands-on sessions and
hopefully a lot of fun throughout your
internship we're really here to support
you as the intern recruitment teams they
will be meeting with you and at various
points but definitely halfway through to
ensure you on track that you're happy
your projects going well and to get an
understanding of what you want to do
next and be that you know
still got two years left to study so
you'd like to come back next year so we
monitor that and and ensure that that
process as smooth as possible
alternatively if you're reaching
graduation then we'll ensure that your
application is passed on to a full-time
recruiter and they can take you to that
processes as possible and generally if
you've interned with us the process for
conversion is slightly different so
Europe needs would have feedback from
your internship and a smaller number of
vinton so we really try to kind of hold
your hand through that piece and make it
as seamless as possible yeah I don't
know if anyone has anything else to ask
now that was a great Gary thanks so much
we do have a couple of live questions so
I'll read them all first one are there
any resort scholarships for masters and
PhD students I take that one Nicolette
are the best tip for you answer that so
um we do have the immutable scholarship
which is open to females of all levels
and the only requirement is that you are
a student in the year after you apply so
that you can actually use your
scholarship during the study and and we
also have a PhD fellowship program
although you would have to be studying
you have to completely control you're
Oliver before you to eat after
University in India which I guess might
need if a school or for some of you and
so I think those two scholarship signs
and specifically a completely and all
honesty okay perfect so we have two
questions around the location of their
University so the question is does the
location of the college matter how can
one benefit from a Google office located
in the same city as his or her
university
um I can take that one so it actually
doesn't matter very much because we do
offer a relocation to the you know did
the location that you're going to be
interning in so there's actually interns
are students that go across the country
to intern for instance to New York or to
Seattle and going coast to coast even
you know students from the US interning
in Europe for the summer etc I think the
only advantage that you would have
potentially in studying in the same city
as a Google location as if you are doing
a longer term internship and you do want
to continue studying but you know that's
usually a case app later on in this case
by case basis and not necessarily the
norm or the current practice that we
have but because typically students do
you know do the internship full fine and
not not studying during that that time
is it it's actually pretty challenging
to do so we do recommend to be either
studying or doing an internship okay
thanks so much Davidson will take one
last question and you can probably make
this brief so the last question is how
does it how does a software engineering
interview process differ from a product
manager interview process so we can
probably keep it quiet at a high level
and need not get into the specifics yeah
so the software engineering process is
just two phone interviews and the APM
process is a bit more in depth so you'd
have a larger number of interviews and
then there is also an essay question
that needs to be submitted see obviously
the content of the interviews will be
different as well and they'll also be
looking for your technical ability so
you still need to have that technical
backgrounds then also be judging not
judging but looking for a variety of
other components that that wouldn't be
there in the software engineering
interview
I think that kind of sums up they so
didn't have anything to add yeah um I
guess the only thing is obviously if you
look at the requirement to the product
management role and the type of work
that they'll be doing it is still a
technical role and you may get asked
technical questions but some of the
things that they may touch upon this
year you know business acumen product
design knowledge they may be looking at
assessing your communication skills your
leadership skills etc all skills that
are needed for the project management
role so just be aware of that and you
know that's a good practice for any role
that you applying for is really taking a
look at the requirements because you may
be able to anticipate the types of
questions what detective skills that
they'll be assessing you one okay thank
you so much so that wraps it up thank
you so much Davidson carry Nicola and
Stephanie for joining us thanks everyone
for watching the go global with google
hangout on air for north america and mr
so will soon be sending you an email
about two things one is to sort of get
your feedback on how you like to hang
out to some of you have mentioned that
you've still not decided on the
universities that will be going to so we
will need that information so that we
can update our database accordingly
thank you so much for joining us and
hope this hangout was a useful for you
will share some useful information with
you post a handout and please remember
to follow the Google students plus page
which has unbelievably important
information for you to know in the
future okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
