I've made an impact of Google i am
originally from Bedford Hills New York I
go to Princeton I'm going to be a senior
next year and a computer science major
and at Google I work on google+
specifically connected accounts
I connected accounts team is there to
make sure that everybody has a really
easy transition to google plus so if
you're not a gmail user or don't
generally use Google products but use
other social networks or other email
clients we go in and try to find your
contacts with your permission of course
so that you can go and immediately start
adding people to circles and you don't
have to go and try to find it every
single person that you know
oh yeah there are so many cool things
about working even girl but I think
honestly my favorite thing is probably
the fact that after the end of the
summer I'm going to be able to go home
and show my family and friends be like
hey you know Google I did this thing for
them and I did it I like working at
Google
I'm so lucky to be able to even work on
this really cool new project and the
fact that the code that I'm writing is
going to impact millions of people that
I don't even know that are all over the
world I'd say that's making a pretty big
impact so when you're an internet Google
you got treated just like any other
employee which is really really cool
when you are working on a project that
launches in the middle of your
internship so the day that google +
Solange I happen to run into one of the
people that found it it came up with
Google+ and I see you know
congratulations it's a really great
product and he was like yeah you too and
it was just really cool and I felt like
a real member of the team like I'm not
just an intern I'm i work on google+ and
its really awesome i really really love
working at Google and the fact that I've
been able to work on the Google+ team
and make such a huge impact on so many
people it's really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
