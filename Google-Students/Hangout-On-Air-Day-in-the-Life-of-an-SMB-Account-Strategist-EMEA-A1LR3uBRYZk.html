O'Neil and I'm on Google's university
programs team and welcome to our first
hangout on air live from Google orange
and which is the headquarters for Europe
Middle East and Africa
so I'm here to host our first ever
hangout on air and entitled a day in the
life of an SMB account strategist and
I'm joined with some awesome Googlers
from within our SMD organization so for
those of you who may not be aware of
that acronym and SMB actually stands for
small to medium businesses and that is
the main entry Rouge for any new grad
into our non-technical and side of the
Google organization so guys and maybe we
should do some introductions so maybe
we'll kick off here in Dublin so Adam if
you want to tell us a bit about yourself
absolutely Debra yet and my name is Adam
and I work on the SMB API team and based
in Dublin as Deborah said the European
headquarters actually live among the
really cool hangout on air studios that
is there you need to send up lots of our
some the Google offices across the world
and so I work in that team and I
basically help a lot of agency accounts
and throws the UK mainly for the UK
market and that's basically what I do
when I take say faces I assume we'll go
into that more detail in a few minutes
yeah and also we have Isabelle joining
us for you as well no guards on
Macedonia actually so my name is
Isabelle I'm French I have two kids and
I'm the manager in SMB services for all
a tree attics including Macedonian
market and all the Baltic markets also
and today is actually a great day for me
because this is exactly my eight years
Yuval anniversary well happy Anniversary
Isabel fantastic here eighth year is
amazing amazing horrible fantastic and
just a reminder to our viewers if any of
you are interested in asking us any
questions at all and please feel free to
and provide in the comment section just
below and any questions that you might
have and we really will do our best to
try to cover them during this hangout
with you all
and so maybe Adam my team for this
hangout is a day-in-the-life
yeah so maybe it would be great for
students across the Europe Middle East
and Africa region watching this now if
you could explain to them what a typical
day for you looks like put in the SMB
Organization yeah sure
so your working week is Monday to Friday
generated in SMB sales and on the
working eras are normally 9:00 to 6:00
in the Dublin office now that's for the
UK and Ireland Marcus obviously if
you're working for the French team you
might start a bit later or a bit earlier
depending on what areas you actually
service so I would command generally of
half face and there are three canteens
across the Dublin campus so I get
breakfast there and so anyone that's
hanging around or I've made up a few
people on my team go down and grab
breakfast 9 o'clock generally you come
up and check your emails and you'd also
check client emails as well as internal
ones then you would have a look at your
target runways they're called so
basically your metrics that you're
measured on every day and you check how
you're doing there so you can plan your
day and how you're actually going to
achieve what you need to by the end of
it and as well as that you would look at
em your portfolio the counts that you'll
be treating and try to see which ones
you'll actually be ringing up and seeing
when you get scheduler call with the end
client where you make a media agency and
that day as well so it's kind of it
planning so then around 10 to 12 o'clock
you would start your phone calls and so
that might involve a bit of cold calling
so proactively reaching out to clients
that you haven't talked before or it
might involve managing a relationship
with an agency that you've built up over
the past year and just to check in and
see how you can just doing the
optimization voice etc then you would
have an arrow for lunch and so again we
have three cafes across the Dublin
campus and so you'd be pinging people
maybe from different parts of the
organization and by the way pinging
means gchat and for any of you that
don't know so or hangouts as it's no
cold bottom left-hand side of your
screen and on G+ so you have lunch then
you come back and then generally you
would have more calls and depending on
how you set up your day it could involve
scheduled calls that you've already had
or it could also involve
you proactively reaching out to other
clients across your markers and besides
that and it does always a team meeting
to go to or an agency for example
product training I had last week so any
of the new products that are launching
when outwards you're generally briefed
on them and quite quickly before they
wear to market so that you know about
them and as well as that you have one
two ones with your managers every one or
two weeks so one-to-one is basically
where you sit down and review your
performance talk about anything you need
to your manager and anything that you
might be concerned as you would
generally be honest and open about us
and talks and letters and then generally
towards the end of the day and you'll be
wrapping up and so closing off emails
and then locking out of your phone and
then just go on with six o'clock agenda
me well it sounds like a very and very
very day that you have yeah no day is
generally the same like you do the same
things but the things don't stay the
same
fantastic and I see that we have a new
comer to hire so Anna nice - nice to see
that you could join us and so we were
just chatting with Adam about what a
typical day looks like for him and at
Google so maybe if you could share some
insights in terms of your day at Google
and what that looks like
yeah sure hi everyone so my name is Anna
and I'm working for SMB Services team
and in my team we support the doc market
so the german-speaking countries Germany
Austria and Switzerland um I've been at
Google for over three years already so
mine kind of one of the dinosaurus
in the in the team and how does my
typical day look like so in the SMB
Services team we support our advertisers
small meeting of businesses on three
main channels our main channel for our
customers they can contact us is phone
support we also offer email and chat
support chat support was launched
actually last year so it's like one of
the newest features we offer to our
advertisers and
within our team we are facing two sides
of road suave and Dublin and somewhere
cross sites so our colleagues from from
Dublin come to work an hour later than
we and we start our phone lines are open
for our advertisers from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. so we spent like well depending of
course on the tenure in the team and on
the role we have so an average about 50%
of our time allocation on phone support
and on chat and email support we
answered thousands of different queries
from our advertising starting from how
to login into my AdWords account and
ending quit how to implement the
remarketing tag for example so recently
we also started offering support for
Merchant Center related queries that
were AdWords customers so this is also
new thing for us and of course besides
of the core job which is which is
support for our advertisers some of us
also have some roles in the theme like
for example they are quality reviewers
or CSAT coaches or are responsible for
setting up the workflow for the entire
team and so depending of course on the
need we have a certain time allocation
for those roles and we also attend
meetings for the whole team we meet on a
one-on-one basis where with our managers
to discuss our performance our plans our
ideas um yeah so um that would be
actually its when it comes to um yeah
split off of tasks and the and
responsibilities different logic so Anna
you mentioned and the word Adwords and
I'm unconscious of the fact that we may
have some viewers who don't even know
what AdWords is so maybe
commercially a tear that could explain
the AdWords platform and maybe the
business model that Google has well that
could be important for our viewers yeah
anybody want to take this yeah I don't
mind yeah yeah and so for every watching
AdWords is basically Google's platform
for reaching people at the right place
in the right time using paid
advertisement so that means that when
you're on Google duck code a UK Google
that I googled is whatever country
you're in and on the countries domain
and you can generate text ads based on
the keywords that you type in so if
you're looking for shoes or if you're
looking for a new coat or a new jacket
the first three results are underneath
the search dialog box will be
advertisements and at the right hand
side they're V about five or six as well
so that's basically whatever it is
they're actually ads that are generated
through the internet on Google's
platform but you can also you probably
some as well you've seen ads with
display images or images that use flash
or engagement ads or all these different
types of things that are actually not on
the Google search engine that's also
called the Display Network that's
another way that we have to reach other
people that are not proactively looking
for a product so for example if you're
on the Washington Post reading the news
you can actually have ads the left and
right hand side from us and that our
clients have paid for to put their ads
there and that's basically what Edwards
is fantastic thanks Adam and so one of
our mottos at Google is to do cool
things that matter and so I'm curious to
hear from our Googlers are there any
cool things that you guys have done that
you'd like to share with our audience so
maybe we'll start with Isabel cool
things that I did and I would like with
my audience
oh and you think that right it is that
I'm responsible for all our creatives
markets and the three main market of
adriatic are serbia croatia and slovenia
and one cool thing i'm doing right now
is trying to expand actually these
markets to bring all values and or
service to Bosnia Macedonia Albania sue
to expand to two more countries to be
able to give phone numbers and ways to
to reach to us to new customers who can
look like future seats who are emerging
markets and we as a pure here to
actively reach out to the anything
Hey Google AdWords that exists and I
think I have a solution for your
business fantastic thank you Anna there
anything that you'd like to share this
uh well maybe what would be worth
mentioning would be this this cross
offices program which is Google serve a
program in which participate actually
all Googlers from all around the world
it's taking place every year in in
spring and those are different
activities actually in every country and
here we also are engaged in some local
activities Googlers from there from the
Roswell office maybe what I can mention
for example one of the activities we
organized last year during last year's
edition of Google serve and because I'm
I run frequently and I really love it
this is my my hobby and I managed to
engage many people from from the whole
office to take part in a charity run
taking place here in Roswell and this
way we contributed to the charity
organization of collecting money for
them and of course did something for us
for Googlers for our health and it was
it was really cool think looking how
people trained for this where this think
you'll make a race and we're really
happy about that
thanks Anna that sounds like it was a
lot of fun that you guys had over there
in Brussels and then Adam what about
yourself honey kill things that you've
done yeah I think all Googlers can be
quite different when they're hard they
like to do different things as you can
see from onions and Isabel's answers I
think I don't give two examples just to
give it a core and non-core role example
yeah so in the corrals the lemon part of
the sales team for the UK and Irish
market so one of the cool things that
I'm doing at the moment is working with
my current agency team to improve our
strategy for q2 so basically that means
at trip how do we better treat our
clients and our end customers better and
quicker how can we reach our targets
better and how coming out
of deeper into our portfolios and make
the most of it and that can get quite
complex and complicated there's actually
really interesting to work with because
it gives us scope into project
management and other things that you're
in taste HR you might get as much
exposure to as you'd like that's really
cool thing that you can do and non-core
role and goes on from this point with
Google syrup so I would have worked a
lot with the Googlers give team in the
later half of 2013 last year and
basically what I did is for a week
we went out to it a small town in
Ireland and to promote the Silver Surfer
tennis project and so what we did was
spent a week and we had a stand in the
shopping center we were Kapono to
retirement homes we're going to schools
to give educational talks about it but
also to recruit students to give an hour
of their time a week and to teach older
and people how to use the Internet and
that was a really cool thing that we did
because we actually saw the impact and
that Google can have the community and
give them free lessons and leveraging
the kind of community atmosphere and
feeling towards it so I was really cool
really enjoyed that great
so it's brilliant to see that work-life
balance is definitely a hot topic within
the organization and there seems to be a
lot of opportunities for Googlers to do
activities outside of their core
religious which is really cool and
unique I suppose and as well as that I
think managing expectations for
everybody as well like as a Googler
you're hired into a specific role so for
example I'm an SMB sales person and then
an e would be services and is there will
be a manager so we all have our core
roles it doesn't mean that we're out
doing these projects 24/7 it's a
percentage of your time that you have so
want to become efficient in doing your
sales or services core tasks you get the
chance to go and do these really cool
things as well so it's really I'm kind
of rewarding in a way yeah fantastic so
you mentioned there that Isabel as a
manager so Isabel is also and by default
a hiring manager at Google so I think
our viewers would be interested in
knowing what are some of the core skills
and/or attributes that you look for in a
future Googler what the first thing I
would be looking for because I'm hiring
for SMB services or sales is I would
like to find somebody who is able to
learn to become an AdWords specialists
AdWords is quite a rich product so the
first thing I will need for an ideal
candidate
this person is actually willing to learn
and become an expert of his product the
second thing I will absolutely be
looking for is somebody who cares so
we're here to solve issues at all
customer they have and then to add value
and grow their businesses so I need
somebody who's able to listen I need
somebody who cares who can become
another expert and then I want somebody
obviously you can be a great team member
team player you don't achieve things
only as yourself here you are working
with teams with quite different
personalities which people who maybe
like to adapt to each personality and to
grow with them so I think you leanest
leadership team player being able to
listen and to hear you know so if the
value mentioned the word googliness
there and oftentimes we live in our own
Google bubble so maybe if you could
explain what you Luis means to you but
to me personally because I know there is
no one definition of googliness
but meanness is not only a sign animus
of being cool eeriness for me means
you're able to do a very efficient job
without finger of yourself are seriously
so we're having fun we're learning every
day but we are also efficient and and
we're nice people basically very good ok
great so hiring at Google is very much
am done by consensus so everybody and as
part of the hiring committee has to
agree in a higher so I'm curious to hear
maybe from Anna what skills or
attributes do you think and a new
Googler joining your team would need to
have actually I also like one of the
interviewers within our team so I have a
lot of contact with candidates and I
interviewed recently many many people to
to our team so I kind of know what the
what we are looking for well I would
actually
um I can only quote what what Isabel
said because this is this is actually
the key here uh people we are looking
for should be first of all very very
open to new things because people in SMB
services will be working with a product
that is constantly changing this is
constantly changing environment and we
really need to be always every day
up-to-date because sometimes it may
happen that a very savvy customer from
an agency will call us and we'll ask
this question about feature who was
actually implemented a couple of days
ago and to really need to be very yea
up-to-date with the product the newest
features and so we look for opening
people open-minded people who who are
really to learn for great team players
who also when I have fun at work because
we're really we do cool things as a
teaching we have joined a team events we
try to go out as often as possible to
because recently we got many new team
members so it is really important for us
to to integrate with them to learn each
other and to be able to work as a great
team fantastic thanks Anna
and Adam do you have anything additional
to add or or maybe like you're quite a
seasoned interviewer now at Google are
there times when you know candidates
maybe didn't get through the process for
particular reasons well typically are
those reasons the candidate might not be
successful yeah so there's a few things
that can happen and Jenna because I'm
hiring for a sales team as well and so
myself and the manager would sit down
harmony and look for sales skills and
that's the first thing we look for and
some people may do a really good
interview but really fall down on the
pitching side of things or maybe lack
experience in actual target driven
environment so for the sales team you're
really looking for someone who has a
passion for sales and yeah okay on a
passion first because for sales can be
really ambiguous different people for
example some people might be read out
going and
extraverted which would suit some
clients and other people might be really
data-driven and introverted but can
still persuade people on the phone or
have a good level of conversation with
the customer so I think one thing that
students can do because I know it's
difficult if you don't have relevant
experience on the sales side of things
or if you didn't have an internship in
your college program but the next time
you're giving a university presentation
or the next time you do group work or
the next time you have to present in
front of a group of people try and do it
as a sales pitch that will really set
you up well for a Google interview so
instead of presenting at the topic and
giving the information try and build the
build your presentation around a pitch
try and think of how can I sell
international business or have myself
philosophy to this to to my audience how
can I get them interested and how can I
get them hooked at the end that's
probably the best thing you can do if
you don't have any experience because
then you can bring that open the Google
interview and measure your impact and
that's something that and candidates who
have been rejected in the past have fell
down on okay Brittany thanks Adam and so
we actually have a question from one of
our viewers so Josephine and Madrid asks
and this is for you Isabel so she's
asking what does the hiring process look
like at Google the hiring process is
quite a more particular with you at
Google what we will usually have is that
you will have the panel of interview so
you may get interviewed via form your
hangouts or you may be coming on site
after wine basically but the objectives
that is that a panel of Googlers will
basically asked you several type of
questions usually you will have team
members which is just reflecting the
fact that this person will actually be
part of that team so I want my team to
give their opinion is like to you all
this person to work with you actually
plus my team is basically the best
interlocutor to meet with a new
potential person because they will be
able to ask them hey what what is it
actually this job what are you doing in
your daily life at Google so he
basically because they have the best
insight but what is their job and they
can handle any questions that the
candidate may have
about the job then obviously you have me
as a manager engineering as well and at
the end they we are striving for the
best so every each interviewer has to be
convinced that you are the best and has
to be ready to fight for you basically
and to say I want this person that the
best one that's how it works
fantastic Thank You Isabel so and maybe
Adam what exactly will a candidate go
through when they actually apply online
for a position with Google what were the
steps of that application process look
like sure yeah
so if you applied directly on google.com
slash jobs you began giving the
application form to fill out and your
resume and if you are successful in that
then the recruiter will reach out to you
to do with on screen so assess your
willingness to the job do you know what
the role is about very general questions
if and if the recruiter deems that
you're to look forward and go through
the process you'll generally do a phone
interview which will involve you doing a
sales pitch for the first half every
minute phone call and then competency
questions a very general interview
questions for the last 15 minutes if the
person that does your phone interview
things that you should be put forward
into the next round you'll do generally
then three on-site interviews or if
you're not based in the country where
we're hiring into it might be a hangout
so you'll do it over hangouts so look
exactly like we're doing now on G+ to do
a face to face into their face face
interview over BC and then once that's
it your job is done more more or less at
the recruiter then we'll reach out to
you with an answer and between the
on-site interviews and and recruiter
going back to you what happens is a
hiring committee meeting so all of your
interviewers will meet together in a
room and discuss how the interviews went
and concerns and what really went well
and we make a decision based at the end
of that meeting that goes to recruiter
and the recruiter gives you the the good
news of an offer and/or the good news of
a rejection if you get the offer and I
know this sounds quite complicated it
was actually very simple at once you
know the process like I do once you get
the offer once the offer goes off it's
sent to the executive committee and so
this is a hiring committee based of
really senior people at Google who
review the information packs so
everything that happened right from when
you submit that application form up
until you did your last interview and
hiring committee feedback is class
it's this pack and which is online and
they will review it if they need
something else they will send it back to
us and then we will reach out to you if
you need more information or if they
need more information from the
interviewers and if they approve us then
the offer goes back out to you and you
can accept the offer or reject us what
we hope you accept if you get that far
okay so the entire kind of process
starts off with an applicant submitting
a CV so the CV I suppose is an area of
huge discussion and among students so do
you guys have any top tips for CV
writing and that you might want to share
with our viewers but I can take this one
I mean the first step I would say is
like spelling mistake is your enemy like
if I'm looking for somebody has fluent
English I I would expect from use it
your CV is spotless and is clear I want
to make sure that if you give it to an
external I and I would actually advise
you to do that do your CV or harden it
lock night to make it clear and then
give it to somebody who is totally
different from you and say what do you
understand are you able to understand
what actually I have as skills and Dee
Anderson which which type of job I may
be looking for like I have committed
some time arriving ad to me and I can
see CV oh I'm passionate about marketing
I want to do my career that's why I'm on
this job and I'm like but hey look I'm
looking for a customer relationship
person so why are you pushing to me that
you want to do marketing maybe the
future but right now what do you want
from this job and this I would expect
you to see it in to see me basically
great insight there and Adam do you want
to add something yeah I would Isabel's
point upon that as well when you're
giving your CV to a recruiter even
though it's true the online interface
you're actually giving it to somebody
who is your audience and that comes back
to the sales thing as well so if you
give your CV to someone it should be how
you want to be portrayed and I think one
tip that I could give all students
watching today would be when you're
doing your CV as a void textbook all the
points on your CV any student can have
customer service skills but I want to
know how you manage to get the customer
skills and I want to know what impact
you have with them so if you had a
part-time job in McDonald's or Burger
King how did you measure your customer
service impact they're like what were
you doing where you getting orders out
five seconds faster what exactly was it
and that will actually help your
recruiter and pulling you forward for M
sales or services position as well
because you're actually giving the the
food to your recruiter instead of her or
he or she having to go back and look
first really really good tip make sure
that you don't have textbook answers now
I know in some areas in your CV you will
have to have them kind of more generic
stuff but if you can have on each bullet
points an actual impact that you had or
a percentage or something that was
measurable to be really really
advantageous okay brilliant and Anna do
you have anything that you'd like to add
there in terms of tips well I would say
like the most important thing is to is
to understanding the the role
description and actually the position
candidates are applying for and of
course having keeping that in mind it is
important to include all those
attributes that are required for this
role in the CV so um yeah X was already
said that and if you have customer
service experience please tell us what
what actually were your responsibilities
what actually you you did well in your
pure experience in the previous job so
that's how can you contribute here
within Google with with what you learned
so far this is important for us not just
the bullet punch like okay customer
service experience in this and that job
great advice all aligned here by
everybody thank you okay so we actually
have a few questions and from some of
our viewers and so we have one from
Achmed and he's asking if you could
provide some top tips for telephone
interviews so obviously telephone
interviews differ some wash to
face-to-face interviews and so is it
that would you have any tough tips when
it comes to telephone interviews
specifically I'm say first thing is to
be on time second thing is to make sure
that the connection is working where
like I'm interviewing candidates who can
be based in Iraq
can be pacing wherever in the world so
just make sure that we hear you very
well that you are on time that you're
polite that you understand well how long
will be the interview and that basically
if you have any question you have time
to ask them because you really prefer an
interview you will have somebody who is
there to test a bit the ground to see if
you understand the job to see if you
want to understand a job so be honest
just just tell us what what did appeal
you in this job and why is this job done
for you I think that the first step we
want to understand after Adam do you
have anything to add on to that yeah for
so I'll just do maybe more on the sales
side so our sales phone interview and
what we're looking for is sales Flair so
how you perceived on the phone and I'm
having a perceived amount of confidence
and persuasion to be able to deal with a
sales call maybe 20 calls a day in
Google that's what we're looking for so
you might be sitting there going oh my
god I don't have that it's okay there
are different ways that you can prepare
for number one is if you're the type of
person that is very outgoing extroverted
and can talk to an old lady level stuff
that you don't know and what I'd advise
you to do there is have some amount of
AdWords public knowledge it's really
important that if you're going to be
pitching and though YouTube or display
or search that you know something about
it and that you can build that into your
pitch and as well as that be able to
handle questions that we throw back at
you in a confident manner that you're
able to still have control of the call
the other way of it is as well if you're
the type of person that maybe isn't as
extroverted but you're quite good and in
negotiations or you're good on the phone
anyway but you might be and very
outgoing outside life which is fine and
what you could do there is try and again
put yourself slightly outside your
comfort zone in college or in some area
and that you can actually test the water
and how you get on and trying to
convince somebody that you don't know
that's really important and I think
that's the problem to talk typical gift
for anyone doing a sales interview
that's a really good tip I hope
everybody's taking this long okay
fantastic so Anna do you have any top
tips for telephone interviews you could
share um well I would say be open and be
curious we
like candidates who ask questions we
actually always inform the candidate
during a phony interview that there will
be time at the end of the phone
interview for them to ask questions
about the role about the office what
actually they would like to know and
what they already didn't know from the
recruiter so use this time use this
opportunity we actually are really happy
to answer those questions and if we
speak the candidate who who doesn't ask
any questions who think okay so is this
person really interested in this role
and of course get some knowledge about
AdWords at least like the very basic one
we informed what the law is about
because it may happen that you may get a
question what actually you would would
you improve about one of Google products
and when the candidate answers actually
what bothers me arse though are those
ads displayed above the organic search
results we are like one this is actually
what we are doing here on a daily basis
um so yeah that's good good tip there
Anna thankful us and so we have another
question thank you guys for submitting
your questions or really appreciate it
and so this question comes from Jamie in
Madrid and can you tell us some of the
challenges that you faced at the
beginning of your careers at Google and
how did you overcome those challenges so
that's a really great question do we
have anyone who'd like to take this
question yes I can start yeah sure
that's a really good question and very
good questions ask the anything
interview just putting that out there
and yeah it's a really good question so
for me if probably would of and maybe
conferences would have been with me
starting off in sales class she worked
for a year and a half and on the HR side
of Google as well and moved to sales
so when I moved to sales was a very
different area and with there's a lot of
challenges in terms of and a lot of
metrics that you were measured against
and targets and then just generally
being with a group of 60 people that
have very very good sales skills so
basically what I did to combat that was
to reach out to other people that were
quite outgoing on this game
and very open and we're willing to share
their sales skills with me and in a very
informal manner now everybody is willing
to share information at Google generally
on my team anyway and for them I just
take kind of your advocates on the team
so look for people that I generally go
on with and see how I could work with
them better and so it just so happened
then a couple months down the line we
were all sitting together in a part and
so part as a group of six people in a
sales team and and just from there
building that relationship with people
that are sitting around with you it was
really really an helpful and also helps
you to network around the sales or as
well and that's one challenge that I had
starting off and was able to overcome us
fantastic thanks for sharing that on and
what about Anna Isabel do either of you
have either of you faced any challenges
like like I started Google eight years
ago so the product like AdWords already
that I was already scoring was already
quite different but it was also quite
rich of a product so the first challenge
aking for me and the main one was to
actively master the product and be able
as Anna was mentioning to adapt everyday
but is not one single layer here in
Google where I don't have to learn
something new and to adapted something
unexpected so I think that was my main
challenge when I started here and the
best way to overcome it is actually to
ask questions to be curious to work as a
team so when you're starting though
you're usually assigned what we call a
body and a body is basically another
team member who has been in your shoes
not that long ago had a million question
and didn't they're asking them so he's
actually there because he understand
exactly your doubts and which type of
challenge you may have so I think the
best way to solve this challenge is
actually to ask a million questions to
go to your bedding and then after why
basically you will be the one teaching
the others you will be the one listening
to that the Dalton the question of other
what we call noogler to new Googlers
fantastic Thank You Isabel and Anna what
about yourself
any tips well um maybe what I could
share is
when I started I spent about three
months my very first three months at
Google approving acts our advertisers
were submitting and the the biggest
challenge for me that times was actually
learning as fast as possible all those
Google advertising policies which was
really a very difficult task because it
was there were like many many pages of
exceptions and of exceptions of
exceptions and actually when I was
realizing that from what I will approve
actually defends the success or failure
of a business yeah over advertiser I was
really afraid of of clicking the enter
in the system so yeah I was the first
the the biggest challenge at the
beginning and maybe like a smaller thing
I can mention but it was actually
something like very internal when I
joined my very first training in Dublin
the so called Googler training um I was
like you know afraid of all those
abbreviations people were using I was
like oh my god what is this all about
and I was like asking people around okay
what disapprobation mean what that
abbreviation mean and but of course like
sooner or later you this this one V you
know any surprise for you and it's
everything comes with the time and if
you learn it so this is just you know
this like the stress of the of the
beginner nothing more absolutely it's
all a learning curve and I need new job
no matter what so we're getting
questions in Fast and Furious which is
fantastic and so we have a question from
I think it's Mert Oh apologies if I'm
not and pronouncing it correctly so how
long does the hiring process take at
Google so I think I might be able to
take that question and so from the point
of submitting your application on
getting to phone screen stage from then
it takes about six to eight weeks for
the entire process and for application
to actually an offer being extended so I
hope that answers your question
and then we also have another question
from Maria and Maria actually says great
insight which is good and tanks Adam and
Ana and Isabel the tip survey that your
experiences are great what do you value
more from the from the application
previous work experience or the attitude
and willingness to obtain new skills so
which is valued more previous work
experience or the willingness to obtain
new skills what do you value more and I
would say both and the reason why I'm
saying that is the skills and the work
experience and that you've learned so
far should help you acquire in new
skills and so really like and previous
work experience like again when it goes
back to the CV question like what of
what impact did you have
and when I say impact I don't mean that
you went in and shook up the whole
business I mean like what measurable
impacts that you have no matter what
your job was in the past as what I'd be
looking for and based on that then we'll
ask you hypothetical questions or
certain questions to put you in the in
the mindset of somebody who's at Google
already and stand test to see what your
answers are and obtaining new skills so
I wouldn't be too worried about
preparing for those two areas I would
just know your previous work experience
and what you did there really well and
I'd also am having kind of an idea of
what new skills you would like to
acquire in the role you're applying for
while at Google so the answer is both
okay so it's vote for Adam and it's a
better I know do you have anything to
add or do you feel the same as Adam well
I would say that the willingness to to
obtain new skills is it's more important
here especially here within the service
system because like the experience shows
that we have we have really people with
many backgrounds and so who were working
in a different companies before not
especially in the customer service but
they're really ah yeah love the way they
are working right now and actually that
was all just a matter of learning this
this attitude this
it's just new skills so I would say here
we do value this the second thing more
super and and what about yourself Isabel
have we lost is above
okay so we'll move on anyway
and so I think we might want to wrap up
things early soon and if there one piece
of advice that you would want to give
our viewers in terms of maybe getting
into the online digital landscape in
terms of maybe for internships or
full-time roles any piece of advice that
you might offer and yeah for the digital
landscape I would say look at what your
current hobbies and interests actually
are and how could you add a digital
slant on it so if you're involved in
your local football club or if you play
tennis or your real gym Bonnie how could
you actually add that to the digital
spirit they don't have a presence or how
would you improve it already that will
give you a real edge and going to any
interview for an online company because
you're actually interested in the
industry and will also help you develop
your skills as well and for a career at
Google and I'll back up analyst points
as well about being open to learn new
things and always always treating
yourself that you can improve every day
in your career I think if you come in
with an attitude that I'm great and you
don't necessarily want to obtain your
skills all the time it might hamper your
performance and you actually might enjoy
your time as much as you would if you
thought that you could improve all the
time as well so you mentioned there
about and kind of creating a profile
that's more digitally orientated and so
actually for those of you watching who
may not be aware we actually have
something called the Google online
marketing challenge which I think that
is a good thing for for students who
want to get involved in the digital
sector so and student groups of between
3 to 6 student teams can are actually
given 250 dollars worth of free AdWords
spend to manage an AdWords campaign for
a small to medium business that does not
yet have an account with ourselves or an
adwords account so that's something that
has actually recently launched and if
you google it
use the poem if you google the Google
online marketing challenge and it'll be
the first search return that you'll see
and you can read all about it online and
so that might be something that you
should maybe consider doing and taking
part in it's a lot of fun yes and Anna
do you have anything that you'd like to
add in terms of and tips and advice just
finally um well I would just say include
as many information as possible about
yourself what you've done on a
professional level but also what are
your hobbies and interest and what your
impact is in the local environment even
with your in in a group of your friends
because those are actually things that
matter for us people who are engaged not
only professionally but also outside of
work and be creative when it comes to
your your CV just be creative we really
like it
yeah we also like on one hand I stick to
the most important information we are
looking for like what was your impact in
that particular role but also yeah
creativity is a it's a very important
factor like we don't need we we had CVS
including links to do some videos with
that was really it was really hoping to
watch them and those candidates actually
like this this you know this discreet
special bond between candidate and the
interviewer so when you talk about
impact do you mean maybe adding metrics
to a CV is that what you wouldn't would
encourage yeah definitely yes yeah at
Google we love numbers so it is it is
always welcome hey fantastic great and
and what about yourself
Isabelle and do you have any last pieces
of wisdom that you'd like to share with
our audience who are interested in
developing a career within the digital
landscape do you have any one piece of
advice for our viewers I think what I am
interviewing for somebody for Google I
would expect that a person will list
to my question and really answered his
ad question I got a lot of candidates in
the past and I run more than 200
interviews in total in eight years who
are just they prepared everything they
prep they are ready they have so much
input to give me about themselves but
hey guys I am asking you one single
simple question do please consider it as
a wall and answer to each part of it and
if you have any doubt about Paulo in a
simply ask me as if with that also some
time also we have candidates who are
surprised by all questions and if you
are googling basically interviews in
Google on the net you will see a lot of
dodgy French questions there are a lot
of myths about the type of question you
may ask you may get Google I'm not here
to trick my any dates but I may ask you
a question where I know there is no
simple answer what what I want to see as
a manager is how are you going to think
about it ask the question about it
process what will be your reasoning and
how are you going to prove your point to
me fantastic so I just want to say a
huge thank you to Isabel Anna and Adam

part today and for sharing all of your
wonderful words of wisdom to our student
