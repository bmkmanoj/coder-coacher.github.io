last week we hosted our first go MC
learning series to discuss how to kind
of incorporate your Google+ business
pages as part of your team's overall
online strategy and for those of you
that aren't familiar with go on see it's
a google online marketing challenge so
essentially what that is it's an
opportunity for students to kind of get
engaged with online marketing and
utilize that Google AdWords platform the
Google+ platform to you know manage
online campaigns and get some experience
there you know some pretty great prizes
there and last year we had over 50,000
students from 100 countries participate
and this week we wanted to kind of you
know for those students that are just
kind of joining the competition or just
starting off to give a you know a few
quick tips on how to set up a good
campaign and go over that and just to
introduce myself my name is Brian and
also joining us today is Andrea hi
everyone and as Brian said my name is
Andrea and I'm happy to be here and you
know to go over some account management
and campaign strategies yep and so you
know just to start off with if we go to
the next slide we'll kind of outline
what we're going to talk about today and
first we'll start off with just kind of
an AdWords overview like how how the
edward system works how you pick
keywords how you structure your ad
groups and and budget your campaigns
we'll also talk a little bit about what
those what that structure means like
what are those best practices that we
tend to see work well we'll also go into
kind of writing good ad text copy and
you know there's a few quick tips on how
this all kind of works together and then
by the end of it hopefully we'll have a
good idea of how we can measure you know
what's working and what's not next slide
and so you know we're looking here at
kind of the first how can I put it the
top level of what makes an AdWords
campaign successful or how we set
ourselves up for success as you can see
in the slide there's a you kind of have
your your campaign which is at the top
level right and at the campaign level
there's certain settings that go along
with that certain bidding features that
go along with that and that's where the
budget is set so for example yeah
a budget for a certain campaign that's
at ten dollars it can spend up to twelve
dollars in a given day but over a 30
point four day period that campaign can
spend ten dollars on average per day so
that's where do you know you kind of
mainly structure everything out it may
be a big theme like a product line a
certain service that you provide things
like that below the campaign level is
the ad group and this is where you kind
of want to bucket your keywords
according to these different sub feeds
right so let's say you have a product
line that our shoes right each ad group
could be a different type of shoe
because then the keywords and the ads
can match up and beat together within a
certain ad group and then you can
strategically bid that way as well and
control your account from that level
next slide okay so now we're going to be
talking about best practices so as Brian
was saying at the campaign level this is
where you have all of your settings so
um you can do the different locations
that you want so you can select a city
let's say New York City to target all of
your ad groups in your ads and keywords
to that location or you can even do a
radius for New York City and have it
expand out to let save New Jersey or
Connecticut so that's something you can
also set the campaign level um you can
also do the bidding options that Brian
mentioned so you can let the system
decide your bid or you can actually
select the option to manually bid for
your different keywords um there's also
going to beat the language settings so
this is a global challenge right so for
some of your businesses they might be
located in multiple countries where
people speak different languages and
read and understand different languages
so I can select let's say English and
Spanish and as the languages I want to
target and that's all going to be at the
campaign settings level next as we said
before you can have multiple ad groups
within one campaign so I know we showed
you on the previous screen but you could
have let's say 10 15 20 different ad
groups
um within the different campaign and you
want to make those very concise and very
specific to to the focus in the topic
area and then lastly at the third level
this is where you're going to choose the
relevant and specific keywords hey next
slide yeah and i think this slide andrea
did a really good job of covering the
the kind of major themes that you want
to kind of create a campaign around so
again location meaning geographic
location New York versus California
those might be two different campaigns
right language english versus spanish
right you want to have your spanish
keywords in a different campaign with
their own budget versus an English
campaign for example and then the budget
of course is set again at the campaign
level next slide and then this slide
kind of talks a little bit about you
know the idea of where we want to create
our ad groups how do we decide what
should be an a group of what should be a
campaign and essentially you know when
you're thinking about the business that
you're helping out helping them market
their online strategy you what you want
to just either create a kind of a tree
or a Venn diagram depending on the types
of products or services that they offer
um you know and if certain products and
services overlap you might say want to
create one added to talk specifically
about how those two work together right
and pick keywords that follow that if
the products are very different and they
can be easily organized so shoes pants
shirts hats things like that then it's a
you know kind of a much simpler
implementation but really I think this
is kind of the key way you can set
yourself up for success is organizing
and thinking about the business that
you're working for and thinking about
all the things that they offer to give
them good coverage and kind of a good
break down for you know how you approach
those different keywords next slide okay
so here's an example so say you're a
dentist right there's three different ad
groups that you want to have you want to
have your cosmetic procedures in one ad
group you want to have your dental
implants and another
ad group and then you can even market
yourself as a pediatric dentist so what
type of keywords would you want to have
in these different ad groups so for the
cosmetic dentist ad group you would want
to have keywords thats a cosmetic dental
office local cosmetic dentist cosmetic
dentist cosmetic dentist mountain view
and these are all examples of how you
can make your keywords very specific so
you're calling out the different
locations where you're located you're
calling out the specific service um
you're even saying you know you're
calling out the procedures and things
like that if me of these is going to
help your your ad groups be more
specific and really focus in on that
targeting that you would want and then
kind of tagging along on on that point
there's also another way to think of
your different you know keywords and AD
group buckets you know one way to think
of them is like kind of brand brand
terms so for example for this dentist
the brand turn would be the name of that
dentists practice so if it's you know
dr. so-and-so that would be a brand term
of his right or if he named his dental
practice something like smile free I
just made that up but if that's the name
of his dental practice that's your brand
term right so you might want to create a
specific ad group tailored to just those
good in terms or maybe even a campaign
depending on how complex and big this
brand is the kind of next level would be
the specific products and services that
they offer so again with dental implants
you know that's a product that he offers
that that might make sense to run on
those things then the last kind of level
of keywords are long tail keywords so
those are the types of keywords that are
more related to the service but don't
directly speak to what this dentist does
so for example a keyword you can pick
there is my tooth hurts right that
doesn't necessarily connect with the
dentist um and what he does but you know
someone who's saying my tooth hurts or I
have a cavity those things the keywords
could play into you know work well with
the dentist for example because they're
looking for they don't know the service
or product they want yet but they have a
need and you know
thinking about your strategy carefully
there to target those different customer
segments will help you you know set you
up for success next slide um and I think
you know this on this point when it
comes to choosing your relevant and
specific keywords for example if you're
a TV repair shop located in same
Mountain View you know you can see kind
of on the left and the right the kind of
differences that make a relevant versus
irrelevant keyword so for example this
particular advertiser may have chosen LG
TV repair television repair mountain
view but he doesn't want to pick a
keyword that's very general like just
the word TV because there's a lot of
different things I can go into that word
for example someone might be selling tvs
new TVs use TVs old TVs someone might be
talking about that they're going to
appear on TV so depending on the search
you want to think a little bit
intuitively about you know ok what would
a user search for that would lead them
to try my product or service and so in
this case again for television repair
the keywords on the right are more
likely to speak to that next time ok um
so a group of keywords that are also
very very important for any account any
campaign it's going to be negative
keywords so these are keywords that you
can add where we're going to make sure
that you're never going to show for
these so using the fault the previous
example if someone typed in free TV
repair you wouldn't want your ad to show
for that because you want your users to
pay for your service so you want to add
free as a negative keyword also an
example could be how to repair my TV you
really don't want people who want to do
it themselves you want them to pay you
for your service so you would want to
add how to draw career etc class course
those as negative keywords that you make
sure that you don't show for those that
just helps you save money on your budget
and just makes you more competitive in
the marketplace and so by using these
negative Q
words like we said it reduces your spin
and improves your click-through rate
which you'll find out later is a key
metric and performance but basically you
know if i type in free TV and then i'm
seeing an ad that says television repair
i'm not going to click on your ad so
that's going to decrease your
click-through rate again it makes your
campaign more relevant and improves your
quality score and it also improves your
ad position ok next slide great so now
we want to talk a little bit more about
what makes good ad copy on you know
Google search so essentially the way to
write effective ad text a way to start
thinking about what makes a good ad are
to make sure you've covered the art
three best practices one is to state
what you're offering clearly so once
again going back to that TV repair
example whenever you're writing your ad
text make sure that the idea that your
business is a TV repair shop is conveyed
when you read it make sure that that you
know you get a sense that that's what
the services that you're offering for
that particular ad the next point is to
have a unique selling point so if for
example your TV repair shop gives a free
consultation or you get you know
something in return or you get a
discount something like that you make
you want to make sure that you advertise
that in one of the lines of your text
and then the last thing I think one of
them probably one of the most important
things when it comes to writing
effective ad text is have a call to
action so if you're say working for an
NGO that's soliciting donations and
that's one of the metrics that you want
to measure for success make sure you
also include that in your ad so if
you're at the point of you know you want
to think of what you want the user to do
once it gets your site you know you've
presented them a good value proposition
with the selling point you've stated
clearly what your business does and if
you want them to take a specific action
on the site whether it be donate call
now order now things like that you want
to call that out so that the user who is
engaged with your product or service
knows exactly what to do once they get
to your site next slide
okay so this slide specifically focuses
on tracking the performance of your
campaign and your ad groups we do have a
tool within your AdWords accounts called
the ad preview and diagnosis tool so if
you're seeing that your ads aren't
showing or if you just want to ensure
that they are showing you can go ahead
and use this tool it's located in the
tools analysis section add preview and
diagnosis so that's where you would
locate it you go ahead click on that you
are brought to a screen that simulates a
google com search and in here you can
type in the specific keyword the
location and then any other additional
information so if you have a radius or
if you have multiple cities or languages
you can also enter those in you click
enter and then it will give you a
diagnosis of how this particular ad
campaign ad group is performing so it'll
say yes your ad is showing it's coming
from this campaign this ad group or
it'll say no and y know your ad is
disapproved no it's not showing for this
location or no it's not showing for this
language so it's very important to use
this tool just so you know exactly how
your ads are appearing and then if
they're not appearing what you need to
do to fix it the second performance
metric is the CTR so this is a
click-through rate and this is a simple
formula of the number of times your ad
was shown and the number of times that
your ad was clicked on so using this
metric you can really see if users are
finding your ad to be relevant based on
the search terms that they're entering
in online and then lastly we have
conversions so this is how you can track
the performance from the keyword the
click the visit to your website and then
having them complete that specific
action that Brian was talking about in
the previous slide so I'm using the NGO
example in your ad you told them about
what the nonprofit organization was what
they do and then the claddagh action was
to make a donation let's say um so in
your account you're seeing that they
searched on the keyword they clicked on
it and went to your site and then you
can trapped within AdWords whether they
made a donation or not or if they did
not make a donation so that's another
way to kind of track the performance of
the different campaigns and adds that
you have in your account next slide yep
and then you know just just to go into a
little bit more about click-through rate
and you know since that's one of the
most important metrics to measure how
your campaigns are doing in order to see
your click-through rate in case you know
you're wondering essentially if you hop
into your AdWords account and you in the
middle row of great apps you click on
keywords one of the tab options the
third or fifth you know column depending
on how you set up your your different
columns within Adwords you should see
something that's a CTR that's what click
through rate gets abbreviated to so
essentially that's clicks over
impressions so you have a thousand
impressions you have 300 clicks your
click-through rates thirty percent right
so that's how you can you can see how
effective you've written your add tags
you can tell if you know the keywords
you picked were relevant there's a lot
you can tell from that clip 3 and it's
important to kind of isolate those
variables to see at what point um you
know your your click-through rate is
showing your success right and you can
see that click-through rate at the
different levels at the keyword level
you can see individual words you pick
you can see that the ad group level to
see if you bucketed everything well and
then at the campaign level just to see
how effective each of your advertising
campaigns are same thing goes for
conversions as well you know there's two
things that go into conversions there's
conversion volume which is conversions
one per click so that's just how many
actions users have taken on the site
whether they bought 50 you know cell
phones they make the donations whenever
they get to a Thank You page or your
order is now shipping page that will get
reflected and then conversion rate means
out of the people who clicked and got to
your site how many people then took the
action right so a higher conversion rate
tends to mean that you know you're
bringing in the right customers to your
stool your online
and it's the stores easy enough to
navigate that they can then buy so again
you know looking at all these different
metrics can look at it in a lot of
different ways and hopefully we can give
you some of those tools to make good
decisions on what to change and what to
keep next one oh I was going to add a
little bit to that slide one of the
things that you mentioned Brian is that
you can't see it at every level when I
talked to different advertisers one of
the things that I might do to drill down
to the performance is I'll look at which
campaign has let's say a lower
click-through rate and then I'll drill
down to actually target it to which
specific ad group needs in performance
which specific keywords needs better
important better performance whether
it's more specific viewers adding
negative keywords etc so it's really
important to do a drill down approach to
see which areas are needed in more focus
okay next one okay so um this slide is
for Quality Score this is something that
is very very important because it will
also determine how high your bids are
and then it also gives you a good
measure to see how relevant your your
keywords are to your ad text into your
landing page so the metrics that are
listed here basically all fall into the
quality score and help determine what
the actual quality score is and if you
notice I'm the keywords in your account
the quality score will range from a one
out of 10 to a 10 out of 10 with 10 out
of 10 being of course the highest
quality score and what you kind of want
to shoot for yeah and just to add in a
little bit to that when it comes to how
ads are ranked how the you know Google
decides you know what ads to show at
position 1 versus position say 10 or two
verses for you have a formula it's
called a drink and what goes the
variables that go into it are your big
so if you did say one dollar on a
particular keyword and then you have a
quality score of five that gets
multiplied together other advertisers
bidding on the same keyword go through
the same process if they're bidding
fifty cents but their quality scores 10
they might appear higher
the auction simply because their quality
score is good so those are the two
variables that you can kind of way
against each other and then you know
hopefully reach a certain a drink within
the option and yeah and I think that
just kind of covers the the main metrics
of success there and how you how to
measure how your performance is going
and hopefully that was really helpful
for everyone you know for people who are
just starting off or kind of in the
middle of the competition you know to
give you the tools to build really
successful campaigns did you want to go
ahead and jump into the question stone
right I think that makes sense okay the
first question that we have here is can
we promote a business which does not
sell products online right so um you
know that's definitely an option i've
seen a lot of advertisers do if they
don't sell a product online there's
nothing to transact I've seen
advertisers you know with their cell
phone in the ad and encourage people to
call or when they go let's say they
click on the add and then the person
goes to that page so again going back to
the NGO example you know maybe they
don't you know they don't sell anything
online but they want to they want for
people to participate in in some kind of
rally for example they want you to call
for more information that you know
taking them to that landing page with a
unique phone number then they know only
AdWords customers can see lets them
track how many people are getting
through admins and how many how many
people are going to call and participate
so definitely you know it's a strategy
that I've seen a lot of advertisers
pursue even if they don't sell anything
or do anything online ok the next
question is what is the difference
between right side advertisements and
top advertisements and go all right I
could part of the question how can we
specify where where our advertisements
can be displayed right so the the way
advertisements are ranked so going back
to that a drank formula
mentioned when we were talking about
quality score when the first thing
you'll see in the top right so the top
listed ad in the top part of the Google
search when the ads are displayed that's
position one and then position to kind
of falls you know right under that and
in position three Falls right under that
so those are the call the top ad so the
ads that showed up in either positions 1
through 3 on the side then it goes
sequentially as well right so positions
for through etc are the side acts we
tend to see a little bit better
conversion rates and better
click-through rates in the top ad so
that's why a lot of advertisers kind of
try to get in the top three positions
but we've also seen success for
advertisers on the side it really
depends on your strategy and the
importance of each of these keywords so
we kind of going time back into those
long tail keywords we discussed earlier
in the presentation you know the keyword
is not necessarily going to you know
isn't of a high priority you know if
it's on the side it's fine you know and
that might be that might do well for us
and if it's a really important keyword
that really speaks to our business we
might want to try to make sure it's on
the top I'm touching on the second part
of you know the question which was how
do we pick or ensure that we get to a
certain position there's no way to
really specify like what position I want
my ad to be in you know what we can do
is kind of set our bids for certain
keywords ad groups and campaigns and see
what positions we kind of land in and
then if we want to appear higher or
lower we kind of change the bit so
that's one lover we can we can even bid
more to appear higher bid less to appear
lower the other way is to improve our
quality score so we can take a variety
of actions there you know maybe make the
landing page more relevant change your
ad text something like that to get a
better click-through rate and hopefully
raise our quality score and then go up
and down in the auction okay now what's
the last question okay so did you have
anything else to add
um no good luck to the team all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
