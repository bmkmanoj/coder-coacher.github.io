made an impact my google I'm currently a
rising senior at Purdue University I'm
majoring in computer science which is in
west lafayette indiana
i'm working on the entries
so as soon as I get off of us to go to
work I go straight for some free
breakfast which is always amazing
because it have really nice pancakes I
want to put the café's but right after
that I go to my desk I try to get a
little programming done before in my
meetings which tend to be around lunch
time they deal with either a bunch of
Engineers or also with product managers
but again most of my beatings tend to be
comped around like the mid-afternoon
time period so once those are done i get
back to work and pretty much the stick
around until dinner million internet
Google is also a lot of fun this is my
second year now and both times I felt
like my change really make an effort to
make you feel included now I try to hang
out with you may invite you to lunch and
dinner often and it's always a lot of
fun even being with the interns I find
myself and yet with them also and just
planning a bunch of events like going to
San Francisco or also just writing out
to lunch
being here and it as an intern I
definite feel like they try to make an
effort to make sure that all the code
that you write isn't just throwing code
they want your code to actually make an
impact on their product so a lot of the
times when I'm working with my specific
feature that I'm implementing they have
me committing directly on top of their
code so it feels as if I'm doing working
at a full-timer we begun it definitely
feels like when you're here at Google
you're yourself you're personally making
sort of this impact on people and just
it's not just a small set of people put
anybody who uses Google products which
means you're reaching out to people all
over the world so being here at Google
has definitely made a huge impact also
on me as a person I feel like just being
a part of this community has definitely
given me the chance to make a lot of
contributions and it feels like an
amazing place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
