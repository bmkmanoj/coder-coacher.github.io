Barry I'm a rising senior at Morehouse
College currently working for adwords
department and optimization team I think
that Google is one of the most unique
diverse incredible comes you could ever
work for the people here are one of a
kind they do a great job of picking
individuals to come together and it's
like a family which is very different
like I can eat whenever I see a person
around the street who has a google shirt
on always say hi to them and they're
really friendly outgoing people are
willing to help you I really like the
fact that everyone here works in teams
is that you can feed feed off one
another so all these things encompass
plus the perks of food and
transportation noise other great things
that they have and the corporate
hierarchy the fact you can just go ahead
and talk to the manager with a click of
a ping there's certain things that I
think you can not find anywhere else so
that's well I think that Google such a
great place i just feel like i got a set
share that with show all right google
