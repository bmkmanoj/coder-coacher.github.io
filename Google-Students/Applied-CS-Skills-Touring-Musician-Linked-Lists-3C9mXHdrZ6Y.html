simple data structure as the name
suggests a linked list stores a list of
values but in a way that each value is
connected or linked to the next value to
visualize this think of each ring or
node in a linked list as made up of two
fields the data field and the next field
the data field contains the value you
want to store and the next field
contains the address of the next node in
the list by connecting many nodes
together you get a chain or linked list
the first node that is the one that
doesn't have any notes pointing to it is
called the head of the list you may have
noticed in this example it is easy to go
forward through the list but there is no
way to go back this is because this
example is a singly linked list if we
added an extra field to each node that
stored the address of its previous node
we would be able to go back as well as
forward this would then be a doubly
linked list in both of these examples we
need to use null fields to represent
when there is nothing to link to if we
connected the last node in the list to
the first head node by storing the
address of the head node in the next
field of the last node then all nodes
would be connected in a loop this is
known as a circular linked list as with
all data types their advantages
disadvantages and trade-offs in using
linked lists for example storing a list
of values in a linked list can take up
more memory than using a simple array
because as well as values we have to
store the next and maybe previous fields
for each node too however adding a new
value to a linked list is easy as you
just extend the last node to point to a
new node containing your new value
similarly deleting an item from a linked
list is easy as you can just change the
next field of the previous
no to point to the note after the node
you wish to remove linked lists have a
wide variety of uses in computer science
and depending on the type of behavior
you expect from your program a linked
list can be a powerful and efficient way
to store a list of values
