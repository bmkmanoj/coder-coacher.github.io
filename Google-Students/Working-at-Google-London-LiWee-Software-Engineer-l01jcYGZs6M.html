fairly diverse team this an office in
Mountain View one in New York s in
London guys out in India and it's really
cool because you get to meet people from
different backgrounds different cultures
and of course that's the cool side of
things in that you get to go out and
meet them as well and so you get to go
to all these cool places but it's it's
nice to work in a team that's kind of
located all over the place
because you get different sort of inputs
from from different people because they
have a completely different background
and culture to bring to the product well
just in London alone so the three of us
on the project this Mara who Spanish
Michael who's German and I'm Malaysian
so at one point we were designing a user
interface flow so it's a user facing
product and you know Michael might say
something like oh you should do it this
way and I'll be like oh no you know in
fact if you were to bring this to
Malaysia this would never work because
it's just not the sort of thing that
people like doing what it really means
is when you're designing because you
have all this input from so many people
we can design into the product early on
sort of issues that we might encounter
rather than later on when you're
actually having studies done my name is
Lee Wei Lee I'm a software engineer with
Google Checkout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
