finding out how students are using
google apps so let's hear what they have
to say I loved able to the desert and
conversations so if people reply to my
email coming back with what I said what
they said so you can keep track and what
you're talking about because it's not
you have to go in search for old emails
I really like the chat feature so you
don't have to wait so long on an email
you can actually sit there ask your
professor as many questions what you
want and you don't have to worry about
getting an email six hours later yeah
I have my school calendar and my social
life challenger I'm able to organize my
friends calendars are in mind and that's
the only way that I'm able to spend time
with other people to find those white
faces so I do for my assignments my
daily life schedule I can also add on
calendar is like TV shows that if I
don't want to look through the TV Guide
i can just add them in there and it'll
show me what times and come on also i
can add the school events calendar so i
can know what upcoming the Vincennes for
my organization
I use Google Docs and Google Apps from
just about any group project library me
and all my friends we all get on there
we create one small little group and
then we're able to share every document
we do it on the project so what makes a
change but I know about it you can keep
track of everything anything that
happens and it's just great nothing we
had to do this presentation and there's
a group of seven of us that had to do
this it's all seven notes at different
times of the day she got on there added
their reports somebody even one point
completely rearranged all the slides
although I totally screwed up there's no
big deal went back to revisions that we
needed to go everything back the way
it's supposed to be no hassle no mess
it's great to hear from lots of
different students about how they're
using Google Apps collaboratively inside
and outside of the classroom and we'd
love to hear your story so post it today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
