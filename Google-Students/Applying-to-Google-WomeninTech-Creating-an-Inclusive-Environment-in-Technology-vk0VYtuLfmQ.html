series called women in tech create an
inclusive environment my name is Emil I
know and I'm a tech university program
specialist based in Chicago focusing on
growing tech talent here at Google today
I'm welcomed by to Google software
engineers who are going to speak about
their roles how they got started in tech
combating imposter syndrome and what
diversity and inclusiveness at Google
means to them our chat moderators will
be answering your questions via the chat
window throughout the presentation and
then we'll finish off with QA and answer
some questions from our live audience
listening in so to start let's have our
panelists introduce themselves hi my
name is Heather I'm a sweet here I'm
sorry software engineer here in Mountain
View I've been at Google little over two
years now unfortunately I can't disclose
much about the project I'm currently
working on but I can say it's in the
smart building technology space I
previously were done data center
software which is a team that maintains
the voice of different software points
of our datum owners hi everyone my name
is sarah and i'm a software engineer on
youtube kids which is an app that helps
kids safely and creatively engage with
YouTube content and I work in an opium
and I've been here at Google for about a
year so to kick off what could both of
you speak a little bit too what is your
typical workday like okay no days
typical around here I'd say I'm a
morning person so I like morning traffic
so I usually come in around six and then
I'll leave round 2 30 or three I usually
a breakfast and lunch my teammates or
sometimes I'll meet up with a friend and
gotta grab lunch at different cafes
things up um pretty much every couple
hours and people's punctuated by food
sucks just been the part of my day
before lunch just really hide stomp
focus on writing code or researching
magnification for something I'm working
on after lunch I might be doing any
number of things depending on the day I
could collaborate with other engineers
eating or most of havin to spitball
ideas that are gasps I might do some
code reviews or 10 detect off or we'll
have a zillion
different classes going on so I'm at
their windows board but I really
productive morning storms will just call
the day and leave early and my name is
two different i live in yo Cisco and her
about a 45 minute and so i'll come in
i'll go on the bus people have free and
so i will go with us and work on the bus
and live around nine casa breakfast and
that head over my dad sees my team here
and help them put a little bit sometimes
well how the VA will have stand-up or a
design review where we'll get together
and we'll sort of collaborate on the
designs that we have for publication
moving forward all get together with
team lunch and then usually i'm coding
most of the day awesome now that we've
learned a little bit more about our
panelists let's discuss the importance
of women in tag so my daughter was ten
years old when she told me she hated
computers our current CEO of YouTube
Susan Wojcicki stated that for someone
who has spent their life working to
build one of the biggest tech companies
in the world she was shocked to hear the
statement from her own daughter sad
truth is that gender stereotypes
developed early and research has shown
that both boys and girls more associate
boys to being better at subjects like
math unfortunately these attitudes are
reconfirmed and expanded to other fields
within science technology engineering
and mathematics through toys marketing
parental attitudes and media now when we
look at the story in numbers girls found
out start out with a love of science and
technology but by high school less than
one percent of girls studied computer
science unless we invest in education
and exposure to technology early we
really risk widening the socio-economic
gap and losing valuable contributions
from women in every field so why it's
gender diversity in the workplace
important because women are awesome but
if you need more evidence than that
there are a couple of things I want to
point out according to research
conducted at McKinsey companies with a
higher portion of women
in their top management have a better
financial performance diversity also
leads to better more sustained
innovation and it leads to more relevant
and representative products google has a
important role to play in equipping the
next generation of women with the skills
required to be creators and not just
consumers of technology and at Google we
have a saying focus on the user and all
else will follow products will never be
as free as they can be if they are only
being developed from one perspective so
what can we do first we need to focus on
expanding access to CS education for
women and minorities underrepresented in
the field we have several ongoing
programs here including CS first which
provides teachers tools and volunteers
with fun engaging materials to lean a CS
first program for fourth through eighth
grade students are made with code
program is an initiative inspiring teen
girls to learn to code through coding
projects community resources and more in
our engineering practicum is a 12-week
summer software engineering internship
that brings first and second year
university students from diverse
backgrounds to Google for real life
experience at a technology company
lastly our computer science summer
Institute's the SSI aims to increase
enrollment and retention of cs students
through collaborative CS pre coulomb and
provides students who just finished high
school and unique experience to build a
network with other program participants
all these programs can be found on
google com edu and honor career site
google.com / careers / students going
back to our panelists one of the
questions that I wanted to ask you is
what got you interested in technology I
guess are you really happened my
sophomore year I just had to take a CS
class with a prereq for another class
and I loved it so much is a second major
my story is very similar I
have never done any computer science
before my sophomore year of college and
my first class bunk with you love it
felt like i was doing magic and i could
control computer for the first time I
felt like I could make it to literally
anything mingling alright so second we
are working to create an inclusive
culture inclusion is when everyone's
unique identity background and
experiences are respected valued and
fully integrated into how we operate
these differences improve our workplace
culture collaboration and innovation as
well as our products and services that
means that all of us need to be aware of
our own biases so that we can understand
and welcome these differences this
awareness of our own biases is what we
call unconscious bias as human beings we
tend to like people who are like us who
watch the same shows who like the same
food who have the same backgrounds and
you may also believe that women and men
should be equally associated with
science but your automatic associations
could show that you associate men with
science more than you associate women
with science animan study done at
Harvard University looking at 900,000
task seekers seventy percent of
respondents had implicit stereotypes
associating science and tech with males
more than with females and as an
employer we want to help people come to
grips with unconscious biases that they
have so we've been working on bringing
unconscious bias trainings to our
employees to raise awareness we started
an internal conversation in 2013 about
unconscious bias and we continue to
invest in unbias in trainings over half
of our Googlers help participate in
these workshops and all new Googlers and
managers are trained in it additionally
we've shared our unbiased materials and
research on our platform we work with
google now anyone from any industry can
create on biasing trainings for their
team the other thing that we want to
talk about is uncle is impostor syndrome
if you're not familiar with impostor
syndrome it's a well-known psychological
phenomenon
whereas an individual becomes convinced
that for example there somehow incapable
of doing their job do not deserve to
have the job that they have and they
will inevitably be found out and fired
even when an individual with imposter
syndrome is successful success is
interpreted as just a lucky break or
something that's not all that much I'm
going to keep achievement in tech the
work that we do is exceptionally
communal at Google there's not one piece
of code that is pushed through
production without being reviewed by
another software engineer coding
involves regular failure if victories
diminish and importance and failure
glooms large it can be debilitating as a
software engineer the bottom line is
when individuals are held back the
community is held back addressing and
talking about imposter syndrome is
something that is important to our
company to ensure that for anyone that
is inhibited with their impostor
syndrome they can feel supported by not
only their peers but their managers as
well so going back to our panelists have
you ever felt imposter syndrome either
in school when you started working at
Google how did you address it I guess
nah I face the most when um let me go
back when I first got the offer to move
out to California and work for Google I
was so excited excellion dream come true
it's all I wanted and then I told my
friends my co-workers thinking they'd be
excited for me too but instead I mean
some of them were but some of them said
things like oh you only got the job
because your girl and companies are all
trained raised and diversity numbers and
that really sucks to hear because I'd
worked so hard and you hear them say
that was like telling me that I didn't
deserve this awesome thing that just
happened for me and for some crazy dumb
reason I actually believed them and when
I first so when I get to California
because I said whatever is Google
Californians so going so I got here and
I almost like I need to apologize my
teammates for being the subpar engineer
that they got stuck with because of visa
versa incentives incentives sorry and it
was a pretty crappy feeling so luckily
though Google's culture we're super open
here there's a
emphasis on reporting for good
performance so soon enough I gone
through interview training and I got
educated on hiring process and once i
got that education i learned that google
would never do something like make a
higher decision based on a diversity
size of a candidate so after that and a
few pure bonuses and great performance
reviews just one day flex I was like oh
I think I'm a good engineer I think
that's knock somebody else oh yeah
absolutely I actually started feeling a
postures in room that was still at
school and I think part of it was that I
had started late so I didn't start
really getting into my CS classes until
my junior year and so that was a leader
than a lot of my peers and I remember
one specific day where I was sitting a
room full of engineers and CS students
and we were having a presentation and
the presenter said how many of you are
to go to IT tech person like through the
support person for your family and
friends and I felt like everyone around
me raise their hands I'm sitting there
and I did not raise my hand and I was
like this is not me like I am NOT the IT
go-to person I don't really know what to
do when things go wrong with my computer
and here at Google there are people who
deal with that and no one expects me to
be able to deal with that that's not my
job my job is to code but when I had
impostor syndrome oses horrible feeling
that I didn't belong and I would be
found out for not fitting in with this
idea that I had about what software
engineers had to be like so tackling
impostor syndrome and unconscious bias
or just two ways we aim to create a fair
and inclusive Google we want all
Googlers to feel comfortable bringing
their whole selves to work by bringing
their whole selves it creates an
environment with Googlers can push
innovation be creative and feel inspired
in our communities for women help make
Google a workplace for everyone our
women at google group is committed to
empowering women and supporting them
achieve a successful and fulfilling
career and our Google women and
engineering group provides networking
development and community building
activities for an engineer
like I was mentioning earlier we as a
community need more women and young
girls to pursue an education in science
technology engineering your math and to
do this Google is committed to not only
providing programs and scholarships that
women and young girls can get involved
in but we're committed to changing
perceptions about computer science so
that everyone can reach their goals and
help change the world to start we also
offer scholarships such as the women
techmakers techmakers scholars program
formerly known as the google Anita Borg
memorial scholarship which is open to
current female undergraduate or graduate
students the generation Google
scholarship provides women with funding
to pursue degrees in computer science
and become active roles in their
community we support women techmakers
which aims to make the tech industry
more welcoming for women and programs
like made with code and CS first
inspires millions of girls to experience
the power of code and technology and we
encourage you watching to get involved
in your community learn more about our
programs and scholarships and encourage
more women and young girls to pursue
their love of science and technology all
these programs and scholarships can be
found on Google for education site
google com / edu and honor creo site
google com such careers / students one
last question for our panelists what
advice do you have for women and young
girls looking to pursue engineering I'd
say definitely work hard develop a good
work ethic and never expect anything to
be easy if you want something try really
hard until you get it and I have sort of
two pieces of advice one is specifically
related to impostor syndrome when I was
having a hard time at school with
impostor syndrome I found that mentoring
and getting really involved with my
department helped me a lot in sometimes
helps to realize what you know when you
answer other people's questions and then
the other piece of advice that I have is
to really do what you love when i was in
school i had a lot of people telling me
oh you have to do this you have to do
that if you want to work at Google if
you want we're going to create
company and what I did was just do what
I loved instead and I'm here and I've
seen it work for a lot of people so okay
don't listen people who are telling you
you need to do anything in particular
just do what you like no works out yeah
awesome and with that let's take some
questions from our audience alright so
the first question is from Andrea what
recommendations would you have for young
women in an older male group so I think
you know in terms of you know like what
we are saying before every perspective
every viewpoint every experience is so
important to our products if we look at
our products from one perspective our
products are not going to be working for
everyone so I would say you know for any
young woman working in an older male
group just remember that your
perspective is important because it's
important to the product or the service
that you're providing for everyone so
just you know stay think about that on
in that case one thing goes worked for
me because i know sometimes i like those
lunchtime you know conversations you can
kind of feel like you don't fit in we
don't know why the kids talked about so
one thing that worked well for me in the
past was just finding that common
interest it was just a game that me and
a couple of the other guys new team
played on our phones and then we talked
about that at all sudden we have this
thing in common it really brought us
together and made us better as a team
definitely I next question is how did
you decide to apply at Google how did
you know that you were ready I didn't
apply you will reach out to me luckily a
linkedin very good to have because
that's how they found me they found me
my profile linkedin and i had applied to
people in the past they knew i was
interested so if those two pieces
together that they reached out to me and
then went for it studied a lot from
there i also actually had applied
previously before and i had applied for
an internship and never heard back but
then when it came time for me to
graduate from college I was reached out
to you by a recruiter and at that point
yeah I would say you know if you don't
hear from
all the first time doesn't mean that you
don't have a shot at Google I would say
always apply again because you never
know alright so next question is for the
engineering practicum internship that we
mentioned earlier if there are not if
they're not holding an internship near
my hometown is there a way I could live
in a place up near where the hole where
they're holding the internship so we do
help give relocation bonuses to all
intern students both EP and software
engineering intern candidates to help
with housing costs so enduring
candidates can receive this bonus before
they start their internship this is
coupled with your celery that can be
used to help pay for housing costs
during your 12 to 14 v click internship
it's fun to go somewhere that's not my
home yet six-course morning notice how
the glaze are out here California's
beautiful here definitely alright we
have another question um what's the most
challenging thing or obstacle you have
faced as a woman in tech during your
career so far and what did you do to
overcome it well I think imposter
syndrome it's definitely one as I wash
and I think imposter syndrome was
probably the hardest for me you know
when I was in school and when I came to
Google at home was very supportive and
so it's just me holding myself back and
sort of thinking that I wasn't capable
of the things that I really could do
very well it's amazing once you start
realizing that you're going up you also
realize that no one else was ever
thinking that you weren't so we have
another question around do what you love
you know around your passions and we
have one particular student who's asking
about like UX design which is something
that they love what schools do I need to
develop so that I'm doing what I love
and catering myself to work there I
would say you know for anything that
you're passionate about um continue to
explore that I think a lot of times you
know engineers and Googlers who are
students who are interested in joining
Google will try to get involved in
everything
versus you know really focusing on you
know certain projects that they feel
really passionate about so i would say
continue to network continue to speak
with other people who might be in the
field that you're interested in and just
continue to grow and develop from there
and you know projects are the best thing
to do really it's I'm with you x-type
stuff it's really easy commit website
that's super visible and then you can
put that link right on your resume
there's also i always suggest like apps
are really great make just do a lot of
projects then you start small finishing
your first product really important get
on your resume and then you try to build
from there absolutely all right I think
that's all the questions that we have
today thank you so much again for
listening in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
