based in the Pacific Northwest and five
or six of them are based right here in
Seattle within 15 minutes of our office
and so we're set up regionally and
vertically on purpose to be able to have
and build this relationship so that we
can just drive down the street and have
coffee with the CMO or with the
marketing team at these companies and
work with them to try to find solutions
to support their initiatives and help
them grow their business recently we
were asked to come in and meet with one
of our partners which is a very large
outdoor apparel company and they asked
us to help them with a challenge that
they had in place which was how do we
effectively promote our new store
openings in large and small dmas because
of limited budgets we had to make sure
that these ads only showed up to people
who were actually in the radius of this
new store opening say 25 miles and we
were able to do that and we drove far
more consumers to the store then even we
thought was possible so what they did
they went back and evaluated the
performance and they were so excited by
it that they decided to employ this is
in part of their marketing mix for every
new store opening going forward in 2007
my name is Aaron rova and I'm the
regional manager for the retail team in
Seattle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
