name is Jeff Moore and I'm hosting our
recruiter tips and tricks first live
hangout on air with my friends brian and
alice from the mountain view office
where we talking about preparing your
resume and what i wanted to do first was
let Brian and Alice introduce themselves
to everybody real quick and then we'll
jump into the content sure thanks Jeff
so my name is Brian Kaminski I've been
at Google for about four and a half
years and I work on the university
programs team in the non engineering
group our team business campuses and we
also work with a lot of students on some
of our internal program so programs here
on campus our internship program our
bold internship as well as some of our
other programs program for high school
seniors called symposium and our
immersion program which is for freshmen
it gives them a week in Google and how
some understand what's going on so our
team works at all that we see a lot of
resumes and we try and find them good
roles at Google for both full-time and
their internship roles and people can
find information about that at the
google.com slash students site yeah
exactly
awesome house wonderful and so I
actually work directly with Brian he
works on the program's end of things and
I work on the in-house recruiting end of
things I'm on the college team and
located Mountain View and I deal with a
variety of master's bachelor's and PhD
new grads mostly on the software
engineering side of house yes correct
awesome cool so what I thought we talk
about today is a little bit about resume
preparation and if you're you know a new
grad or a student who's sort of new to
their job search what do folks like us
look for in resumes and when I did our
the original blog post discussion my
sort of talked on a few things I really
like to see you know I I tell people to
really focus on their strengths so
really show what you know what's great
about you what is it that you've done
that you're really proud of making sure
that stuff sort of pops and then also to
really take really take and dig deep
into the details and so rather than
saying oh I wrote this application in
Java getting into a lot of Utah wrote
this multi-threaded application that the
duh really get into the
the detail so that when a resume
screener or a recruiter or hire manager
looks at your resume they don't have to
wonder what you did you've told them
what they do and then of course just to
sort of flip around and be funny about
it I also tell people to keep it short
so you know the the 15 page resume is
not such a good idea we like to see you
know a page maybe two it's thorough but
not a novel you know spelling errors
stuff like that make sure that you've
spell checked it and grammar checked it
it all makes sense and then know your
target right if you're writing an
objective make sure you're your
objective is targeted to the people
you're replying to and that when someone
opens the resume or looks at the cover
letter whatever they're not going to say
why is this person saying this to me
they're going to open up and say wow
this is a great fit for my team um and
so that was just sort of my my quick
thoughts in the blog and Brian I would
love to hear your take first especially
from an on you know not inch side of
things what what sort of things pop for
is way for you yeah absolutely so the
way that the way that I always think of
resumes is that it's a really short
opportunity to make a great first
impression one of the ways that that
I've always thought is that you think of
it like an ad but instead of an ad for a
product or service it's really an ad for
you it's something that's going to go
ahead and meet the needs of the person
that's looking at it and they're going
to want to make you more and get to know
you a little bit better should be
something that's short should be
something that's concise and it should
help educate the the reader how you're a
perfect fit for the role and a team kind
of like you what you were saying up we
usually like to see them around a page
especially for students right out of
college
we just find that that's a whole lot
easier to filter to the different groups
that we work with and and we also really
like to see them focus on the actions
and not necessarily just job
descriptions we see a lot of students
that talk about what their job
description was is a president or a
treasurer but that's really consistent
across the board where you start to
differentiate yourself as when you can
start talking about the impact you had
and the and the rules that the things
that you actually did while you were
there to sign to set yourself apart from
anyone else that was in it before you
were after you so I think those are kind
of some of the things that we like to
look at
the other thing that we really like to
see in terms of resume is some sort of a
kind of target for it I have we have a
we all have had a lot of different
experiences in our lives so it's a
matter of kind of taking some time
sitting back and thinking how does it
all loop together where does that kind
of put you in a particular direction as
opposed to I'm just going to put on
everything that I did at every company
and hope that somehow they'll fit those
are actually the hardest resumes for us
to look at because our role is to find a
good role for you at Google or any
company where we think you're going to
be most successful and so if you can
kind of help us along that way and can
do some of that groundwork that makes it
a lot easier for us Brian do you like to
see a lot of metrics and data in there
too early or not as much fascicular or
that kind of thing you know absolutely I
think anytime that you can quantify
something to show what your impact was
and why it made a difference and how
significant that difference was I think
that really helps because that really
gives us kind of a basis for comparison
that we can see people that you know
have made a really significant impact
versus people that maybe just did one or
two things and they have the same title
in the organization so anytime that you
can quantify something and set you know
the numbers are great when you can do it
but even just thinking about you know
why did why did whatever you did why did
it matter how did it make a difference
or an impact and be able to talk about
that I think is really important right
and and Alice what do you look for I
mean you and I are from the same little
world but I would love to hear your
thoughts right so going off of what
Brian said I think a you know a resume
is a quick way to basically make an
impression on you know an engineer a
recruiter whoever's taking a quick look
at that resume so it does need to be
short and concise I'd say one page
probably for most undergrads on PhDs
would probably be a couple pages
depending on how many publications you
have and I think that's probably the
difference on the engineering end of
things I say you know don't send up too
much time worrying about objective and
things like that if it's you know first
off for role go ahead and just say that
or for an engineering role Engineers
really just interested in the technical
right they want to look exactly at your
work experience I think quantitative was
a really important thing to mention how
many lines of code did you write in this
project or
in your internship project what
languages did you use and also you know
to save your skills but also know that
the engineer's on this side of the fence
reading your resume you know if you put
expert and Python right we're going to
expect you to be an expert on it so be
you know honest about your skill set um
and I think really in general you know
stick to the technical what they're
looking at is are there enough positive
indicators to show us that you're going
to have what it takes basically to get
through our interview process right so
whether that's a combination of work
experience maybe just some meaty you
know classroom projects maybe you've
just been filling with things online or
an open source all those things count um
you know maybe you've taken some really
tough classes in your university that
are known for being really really hard
it's really a combination of all those
things but you know for the end gende I
always say you know stick to the
technical get right to the point
engineers are the ones reading your
resumes right so to show them exactly
what they want to see so just that on
the same vein what's the one thing Alice
will start with you
they don't like to see like what's
something that you know oh not that one
thing that jumps off the page are you
right I think for engineering roles I
enjoy you know I saw a couple questions
that you know that were coming in about
hobbies and leadership that's definitely
wonderful but you know in what way would
it you know bolster your file as an
actual software engineer right is it
because you have great communication
skills or what what actually you're
trying to listen sort of just listing
all these hobbies or listing all these
positions or Awards sometimes a little
explanation of why they're relevant is
is also really helpful
versus just you know listing a bunch a
laundry list of words and
accomplishments with without any context
right absolutely and Brian what do you
have over there for yeah so I think it's
a little different on the non
engineering side because it's it's a
little bit more challenging to get some
of that specific work experience so I
think one of the things that we will see
from time to time is when people focus
heavily on on their paid work experience
and forget about all the other stuff
that they do during their college
experience that that should count for
relevant role related expertise
so if you're looking for like the sales
roller recruiting role or in advertising
roles think about all those clubs and
student organizations where you've
really made a difference and made an
impact you may not have been paid for it
but you could have gotten they developed
just as many skills from that and made
just as much of an impact from those
types of roles compared to some of the
roles where you may be a student monitor
and I think it's great to have those
work experiences on there but in terms
of a resume it should really be
prioritized towards the roles towards
the roles that you're looking for and so
when you when you can arrange your
experience I don't think it needs to
necessarily be in terms of kind of like
the paid experience before the student
organization experience it's whatever
the stuff is most relevant to the role I
think is the stuff that we want to see
first because in that page you've got a
limited amount of time and depending on
who looks at your resume I spend a
different amount of time looking at it
you really want those those impactful
experiences to really pop out on the
resume as opposed to be buried down at
the bottom where somebody might not get
to them right cool but we're we're about
halfway through our live hangout talking
about interview prep and resume prep and
just want to sort of at the halfway mark
or anybody that's chiming in late to
remind them that we are live on the air
talking about resume preparation and at
the halfway point one two flip things a
little bit we had a lot of questions
come in through our online moderator
page which is awesome and for anybody
out there listening that wants to submit
additional questions either for this
conversation or feature once you can
find a link on the on the blog on the
website so we'd love more questions but
I thought we'd just kick a few of these
out there and talk through them and you
know see what you guys have to say and
go from there one analysis is going to
be right in your ear wheelhouse it says
should I include years of coding for a
particular lat
particular languages I just list myself
as proficient I mean sort of how much
detail do you like there for somebody
and they talked about a little bit but a
little bit more this is for for Mike
sent this one it great I think that's a
great question in terms of languages I
always say list of an order of
proficiency if possible right I mean we
did understand that your first language
or your the first OS that you live
should be kind of your strongest suit I
think if you wanna less ears that's
fantastic it gives us a gauge on hey
this candidate has been programming you
know since he was in high school versus
you know obviously he picked this up in
the classroom during his college courses
and I think that's a big difference
right
and also years also helped us indicate
yes he listed that he you know he's
touched for languages but really you
know his his area strength is Java Mar
C++ or C that way the interviewer can
appropriately focus or questions tear
strengths right and we don't want to
test on something you're not familiar
with I think that's the bottom line
there's no point in that we want to test
you on the area that you're strongest so
I think as much deal detail you can give
on years of experience is great just
because the word like proficient and
expert have various meanings right
depending on if you're an expert at the
causal or an expert in the industry so
so years I think it's a great indicator
for big red yeah and I think and Brian I
will love your take - I think that you
know I personally sort of counseled
people away from doing the laundry list
you know I use basic in college do I put
basic on my resume
absolutely not um nobody wants me coding
anything and you know same with sort of
non-technical skills right like it's
some accounting classes or my master's
degree you know do I want to accounting
no does anybody know and so making sure
that those kinds of things are sort of
you know put properly Brian you have any
sort of tip on that same kind of vein
for for folks yeah I think absolutely it
goes around to kind of those two
concepts of both prioritization and
relevance for us you know thinking about
terms of okay what are the relevant
skills for this particular rule or area
or opportunity and some of that means
that you're going to have to leave some
stuff off you know with a page or maybe
a little bit more than that you get a
very limited amount of space there so
thinking about what's going to be the
best stuff that's going to really speak
to somebody and what's the stuff that
I'm not going to be afraid to get a
question about in an interview but the
last thing that you want to do is put
something on your resume that that says
you know I I'm I'm fluent in German well
if I happen to read that resume and
interview you I spent a year in Germany
I took the language for several years I
may ask you a question in it and if
you're not comfortable answering back
then you know we run into we run into
challenges
along the way is you really want to
accurately portray your skillset for
somebody the second the other point that
I just want to make about that is you
know there's a lot of opportunities a
lot of things that you see around
additional skills that people will put
on their resume and the thing that you
see the most is like I can send emails
or maybe I can to some extent use
spreadsheets and Microsoft Office
products or anything like that Google
Apps even to some extent and we kind of
expect that at this point we're all with
a lot of us you know have been grew grew
up with computers you see young young
students right now that have tablets at
the age of nine I mean we expect sort of
that so if you're looking for areas
where you can save some space that's a
really really good way to leave a line
or two off because we just kind of
assume that that's going to be there
right don't state the obvious absolutely
cool so we have a lot of questions which
is really great and so I've got another
one that I think it's kind of
interesting one that I hadn't thought
about and this is from John Livingston
in Savannah Georgia
what up Georgia this is do I need a
website resume in addition to a paper
one
now we come I can make the jeweler who
has a paper one right I made a paper
copy of my resume in ages but I mean you
know what what do you guys think do you
need to have like a personal website
that's got a link to your resume or you
know is a LinkedIn account enough or you
know what do you guys think Alice I'll
start with you um I think if you have a
personal website or want to have one
that's fantastic only because it's
another avenue if an interviewer is
interested that we can look up your work
right you can list your projects a lot
of students have student sites which is
fantastic is it necessary to get a job
at Google
absolutely not we've hired people above
a couple lines on the resume right they
go through the interview process and
that's all they needed but I think a
personal website is a great way to show
additional depth into your background so
if you have the time to do it it
definitely doesn't hurt especially you
know think about it it's a Google or an
online company right we like to see what
you're doing online especially you know
in this area so any effort you can put
in that I think is fantastic Ryan you
agree yeah I definitely I think you know
a resume is that one page ad for you
with any ad there's there's
opportunities to get
more information if that's one of the
things that you've the time the skills
to put together I think that really does
show some of the other other things that
you you can potentially do do you need
it absolutely not
focus on that resume that great give
somebody and a reason to want to learn a
little bit more that can come from you
know your webpage that also comes from
an interview in those conversations that
you have from there so I you know that
as long as as long as the resume looks
good that's your first that's your first
impression in if there's additional
information that you can link to or help
with the reviewers or the interviewers
or anyone else that's looking at it
that's awesome too but like like Alice
was saying it's the same for the non
engineering side definitely not required
awesome cool but it is a way for us to
find you
correct that's how Googlers find a lot
of potential candidates is actually from
their personal website so something to
keep them win all right so we're going
to jump in we've got a few more
questions here and for anybody joining
late this is just a reminder this is
Jeff Alice and Brian broadcasting live
through Google Hangouts talking about
resume preparation um I'm gonna go
International just because you know
we're international we've got a question
here from Mario and Croatia which is
awesome what up Europe um and he says
you know I've worked on a number of
website projects for businesses over the
years some of them went out of business
should I list them as well as as well
since I can't link to them anymore
externally now I would say yes
absolutely
um you maybe we can find the cached
version all those kinds of things but
you know at the same time I think I
would recommend you prioritize over
other work you've done if the best work
you've done has gone out of business I
think you want to talk about it if the
worst work you've done is gone out of
business and then your best stuff is
still out there maybe you don't want to
talk about that stuff but I mean I would
love to see what you guys think to Brian
you can kick it off yeah we don't you
know with with college students you
don't necessarily see all that many
companies that have gone out of business
that finding we had to resume lines but
but I think it's always important as
long as it's something that's going to
be kind of supportive it's going to be
supportive of you and tell a little bit
more of your story
I think it's important to put that on
there I if you know it's out of business
and that and that comes up in the
interview you can definitely talk about
it what your role was there what impact
you made and and then I mean if some
things have happened after you left if
it I mean that's kind of the way things
go you know there are a lot of big
companies out there that have since gone
on a business and I can't or even small
ones and I think a lot of people would
say I was very happy with my time that I
was there if you were part of the team
that was there when when everything
closed down and you probably got a
pretty good story about what you've
learned along the way so I think all
that adds to your experience and and
what that break what you bring is a
candidate so definitely talk about it
absolutely Shana had anything on that
yeah I I agree I don't think it's
necessary so much you know the title of
where you worked
versus the impact I think a lot of new
grads will list things like I was the
the owner of my self-made startup right
or me and a couple of my friends put
together this website and what we're
looking for is you know what did you
actually do right did you write this
small tool you know in the open-source
community what languages you use that's
what's most important to us on the
engineering and so I don't think it's
too big of a deal if the company's out
of business business you could still
tell us what you did right absolutely
cool all right let me look at some more
questions here we have so many which is
awesome thank you all who submitted it
even though those of you that don't get
that don't get answered sucks of really
awesome question from from Johan in
France and hopefully yo.hannes listening
keeping it European over here is it a
good idea to put a QR code instead of a
picture remember you guys think about QR
codes on resumes and we can all look at
our smart phones and be anybody but you
know else what do you think I think it's
a it's a very classically googley thing
to do if it links to you know your own
personal website wonderful I'm sure a
couple engineers do they see it would
hold up their phone and scan it in it's
not necessary but I I don't think it
would hurt at all I think it would only
be a pro I I have a QR code on the on
the back of my business card
it always it's a good it's a good piece
of conversation if nothing else you know
it gives you another way that somebody
can access your information and if
you've got if it links to just a
electronic version of that website you
know maybe that's something that gets
saved by someone who looks at it whether
that's somebody like me looking at it or
whether that's you know you have it or
or even if you can just pull it up and
say hey or scan the QR code that's on my
phone and that links to the resume if
you meet somebody talking about you in
like some sort of a networking event or
another thing and say it's a quick way
to access your information you might not
always have a paper copy and it's a it's
something that's out there so it's a
it's an opportunity there's all kinds of
cool stuff with technology so being a
tech company we enjoy when people have
sort of interesting in different ways of
giving us that information yeah I think
I want to just add one sort of
cautionary tale on the on the QR code
like you know if you're doing a resume I
think I would probably recommend people
not just send in a QR code and nothing
else or just like you know hey I rock
here's my QR code like okay that's great
um you know I think that that kind of
kind of thing is really a helpful sort
of addition to a traditional resume or a
supplement so to speak as opposed to a
substitute I certainly have seen people
send in cool quote resumes it's just
just a link to like something else like
I okay I don't know if this link is so I
think you want to be you know a little
cautionary tale on that one cool so I
mean I guess we got about five minutes
left we've got one question here that I
think actually wraps up the conversation
really well and so unfortunately not
going to get to take any live questions
this this hangout hopefully we can get
through a few tomorrow but you know for
anybody joining late again we are
broadcasting live Google Hangouts
talking about resume preparation last
one Bryan we're gonna start with you
and I'm gonna hold you guys to this one
is if you had five essential qualities
that make a good resume what would they
be and that was from from Vaughn de
Silva and Switzerland so keeping it
European apparently all the West Coast
students are still in bed that'll happen
it's still a break for a lot of them ah
so five of them well yes I'm alright
well my five would be first and most
important is that your resume focuses
on the impact you've had I think that's
really the key part is that it tells
what you've done and how you've made a
difference the second thing is that it
talks about your actions what you
actually did there and not what your job
description was or what you were
supposed to do because again like I said
earlier we see a lot of consistency in
terms of titles but we want to know how
you were different across the board a
third on there is that it should be
concise that you get to the point and
that you're very clear about what you're
trying to convey the fourth one that I
would say is that it's well-structured
that you break it into logical areas
whatever that works for you and then the
last thing that I would say is that you
prioritize it because from the from the
top to the bottom left to the right you
know you see you look for the
information that you're most interested
in at the time and then as you go down
each area or each bullet point then you
look for a little bit more some people
may never get to that last line of your
resume oh that's awesome
that's disappointing but that sometimes
the way it goes they may look at just
the first two big sections of it or they
may look at just one or two bullets from
each section so just being aware of the
fact that everybody looks at it a little
differently and meet with the most
important stuff so those of you my five
awesome Alice
besides coding coding and coding and
more coding what do I know this one's a
little obvious but since we get resumes
from all around the world and that's
what makes Google great I would say make
sure when you apply to any company that
your resume is in that language of
whatever office are applying to in
general it be nice if most resumes can
be translated to English for Google just
because we are based in Mountain View it
just takes a couple extra seconds for a
recruiter to translate it but keep in
mind you know what I mean you want to
provide all that information up front
and make it easy right um for new guys I
always say make your education obvious
because a lot of times people will list
a university and a some kind of grad day
but we can't actually tell what degree
programs are in or if they've continued
on through their masters when they're
planned graduation data is so keep that
pretty obvious because there are
different processes for different you
know types of grads at Google but you
know intern versus full-time for example
I think for software I always say show
me as much information as possible and
that demonstrates that you have strong
CS fundamentals that's kind of the
number one thing we look for a Google in
addition to coding fields in addition to
great communication and problem-solving
skills but like I said it is you know we
are a technical company show us you know
what what are examples of strong CS
fundamentals is it the grades you got in
these classes is it the work experiences
are you know is it the cool things
you've done in your basement you know
hacking on the Android platform you know
show us examples of that and the last
thing you know for for the engine of
things is really just to keep it
technical right I keep reminding
students who don't bother with lengthy
objective statements and things like
that
engineers are reading it they want to
take a quick glance and see is your
experience relevant to what we're doing
at Google right is he worth the phone
interview or an on-site interview or a
phone call so so keep it as technical
and to the point as possible
and I don't think that's five but I
think that wraps up my end of things all
right so I lied we're going to take two
more questions just to keep you guys on
your toes and I just wanted to add one
point on that the five things for resume
I mean I think you're Brian you
mentioned it the the making your your
best thing show I mean I'm a huge
proponent of whatever your best
attribute your best experience whether
it's I I went to MIT or I went to
wherever I worked at Google whatever
your best attribute is on a pop right on
the top because if you've got you know
you got one chance I want to see that
best thing so we got two more quick
questions and we're going to hit them
really quick so I know you guys have got
other meetings today too and I really
appreciate you being here with me first
one or what are some resume red flag
mistakes that people make that one's
from Greg I'm just going to say myself
on that one
like atrocious spelling errors like like
that one just kills me and it's always
like ah because if even if I don't catch
it somebody else does and invariably
someone else is like this person said I
have great attention to detail and they
smell attention room so that's one of my
big one and Jeff you write on that
that's not necessarily mine the one that
I will look at but it's amazing how I
would
some ways that that can be that can be
something that somebody to look at and
that will totally shape their impression
of a candidate so I mean anything that
you can do to kind of avoid that is
really really helpful one thing that I
would always say is you know take your
resume and read it read it out loud and
read it backwards word by word so that
you spot some of those weird things and
then give it to a friend and have them
ask them to do the same thing because
eventually you know I've stared at my
resume so many times I don't need to see
stuff anymore so they put us blind news
I'm I think the the biggest the big one
for me that in addition to sort of that
some of that typos and things like that
is is reading a biography is when when
people scream paragraphs together
especially from an undergraduate resume
you know it's it's just if I wanted to
read the biography I'm sure that the 25
years from now there's going to be a
great book out there and I'm going to
pick it up but for now you know now
we're looking for something short
concise to the point that's going to
give us the information we need and easy
to find it so really focusing on kind of
that bullet pointed resumes is what I
look for I know she got one red flag uh
yeah I think it's going off the ball
pointed it's listing my big red flag is
when engineers list every CF skill set
they can think of Under the Sun I think
it's because traditionally they're
thinking maybe some kind of robot is
parsing these resumes we review all
resumes at Google by hand so when I see
a list of twenty five words it basically
tells me I have no idea what what this
can its drinks actually are right he
lists ten languages you know 15
operating systems and a lot of you know
jargon words like you know agile and
scrum you know what is the daily basis I
have no idea if I can't tell right in a
quick glance you know what water is top
skills you know what order the languages
you actually using these projects that's
actually a negative so I would actually
you know caution to not list to only
list things he's actually these drives
and it no need for laundry list cool all
right and that really I'll you know last
question I promise this one comes from
Kara and Alice this one's going to be
pretty much for you and I and I'm going
to start it off because you know I
haven't done um and her question is what
I what if I haven't had substantial
technical experience is there anything
I can do to make my resume compelling
enough for an interview and I think
that's a great question it's a really
hard question for me I think that goes
back to detail in your resume right like
explaining in detail what you've done
that's relevant to a technical interview
so that I'm going to want to interview
and really pushing a little bit harder
on that I think the other thing that I
think about is excitement right so you
don't have to have a cs degree or all of
these things but if you're excited about
the technology you know you went up and
you download the Android SDK and you're
learning how to hack on it and you're
getting better at these kinds of things
maybe that shows you haven't had all the
technical experience that we might
expect but you've got the passion and
the fire and rubella to go learn that
stuff and maybe you're worth a chance
and I think that that's the things that
I would sort of recommend don't know if
you've got anything else that you want
to add to that I have slavery I think
it's it's it's showing us how many
positive indicators that we can gather
right from a quick look at your resume a
lot of new grads quite frankly will come
into Google with the resumes that almost
literally have no internships right work
experience all we know is they went to
school somewhere and they're getting
some sort of relevant degree in they're
applying for a software also what makes
us want to interview them a lot of times
it's how much detail they are listing
and you know that super heavy class
project they participated or maybe there
is a random hackathon at school maybe
they participate in this weird contest
online right and then there's a lately
way on any kind of indicator that
basically tells us you've touched or are
interested in messing around with
software I think is a positive thing I
don't think it's mandatory that every
new Greta Google have you know three
internships etc do a lot have them yes
do I hire a lot of candidates with
absolutely no work experience and who
just you know showed a lot of potential
in the classroom for example absolutely
so there is no tried-and-true formula
right we hire bioinformatics guys and
math majors and people you know outside
science sometimes right with dual you
know random dual degrees and music I
think the most important thing is having
touch software at some point and showing
us that you having any kind of capacity
absolutely I just want to honor that ad
what a couple of things on that because
it's it's very similar in the non
engineering side to you know at Google
there are a lot of roles everything from
engineering roles but also on the
staffing programs all those sales
marketing finance those groups that that
you know you can that need some sort of
that needed education experience all
that kind of stuff but maybe not an
engineering degree so if you don't have
that necessary technical experience
there's a lot of roles out there but
Google also offers a lot of programs
where you can get experience things like
Summer of Code Google Code Jam but then
also on the non engineering side there's
the Google online marketing challenge
opportunity where you can get AdWords
money and go find a local business or
something and start learning the system
so there's all these programs out there
lots of companies offer them it's a
great way to get your foot in the door
and learn some of these skill sets that
you might not be able to get from maybe
a professional experience but you can do
on your own I'm taking that initiative
is really really important to people
that are reviewing resumes and taking a
look at them because that shows an
interest outside the classroom something
you're passionate about and excited
about and you've really go on to develop
that on your own time and I think that's
just as important as maybe that
professional experience or professional
technical or professional advertising or
anything like that sort of experience
awesome cool now that those are all
really great tips and we are now done um
we're done just want to thank you guys
in particular for joining the hang on
the air live talking about resume prep
that's really exciting to be doing this
for the first time especially with you
guys which are you know I know which is
awesome and again thank you and for
anybody out there listening that wants a
little bit more of this tomorrow at 1:00
o'clock Pacific will be doing another
hangout on the air time on technical
interviewing and going a little bit
deeper into the technology so again
Brian house thank you guys so much and
they're listening hopefully we'll see
you tomorrow and maybe we'll have some
time to take some live questions as well
and back to you guys later I accept is
gay have a good one see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
