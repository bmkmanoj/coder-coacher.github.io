for everybody that's watching live sorry
for the sexual difficulties this is the
Google resume insights and specifics how
to show project work we are Alex and
Oren we're going to just introduce
ourselves and then get to it if you are
watching live make sure to sign in at
the go link on this slide cool
so I'm Oren I'm a software engineer at
Google I'm on the platforms test
development team which means that I'm
like make sure all the hardware was good
and I graduated from Wesleyan and
Columbia University and had a very
difficult time simultaneously attending
both graduation ceremonies and one thing
I love is that my entire team dances
when we go on an off-site so we all get
down on the dance floor and buggy with
it so that's a lot of fun great my name
is Alex I also work at Google I am a
software engineer in tools and
infrastructure I attended Wesleyan
University graduated in 2016 and I work
for Google Fiber on the platform testing
team yeah yeah cool so you may be
wondering why is your resume important
and don't worry you've come to the right
place the resume is important slide
because it's how we interact with you
yeah absolutely so basically your resume
is your first interaction with Google we
don't know anything about you before we
look at that little piece of paper so
what you need to make sure that you
include is a little bit about yourself
and why you think that you would be a
great fit for the company so you want to
highlight your skills and you want to
explain what roles you think you'd be a
good fit for yeah
so I mean so the first primary most
important thing is we need to be able to
get in contact
right so next slide sorry
next slide that's right so this is so
we're gonna go over resume tips
sorry we're we're playing the slides low
here so we're gonna go over first resume
tips and like things that Google thinks
about resumes and then we're gonna
basically go over like a mock resume
Maria Chavez you won't meet her later no
and we'll take some questions right and
then we'll take some questions and
hopefully you know make some things
clear cool so let's get on yeah all
right so just some general tips to start
out the person that's reviewing your
resume is gonna need to be able to find
all the information about you right away
because you got to believe that whoever
it is that's looking at your resume
specifically has a whole stack of them
that they have to go through right so
you want to make sure that you stand out
immediately right and the first way to
do that is to make sure that we can
actually open your resume true so that's
I just can't tress that enough because
this happens and it's very sad we're
like can it is great this female their
resume like everybody's pretty excited
about it and you know the recruiter
can't open the resume and that's sort of
the end of the line right there so make
sure that that's not you we take PDFs
htmls Microsoft Word or like general
text formats if you've got like
something crazy like you have a latex
you know resume that's great but turn
that into a PDF first send it to your
mom and make sure she can open it or
something like that
absolutely if the biggest thing about
you is that you invented the next resume
formatting text file that's great yeah
that is the first line on your resume
but save it as a PDF exactly yeah so
other things is your resume is like your
first point of contact at Google and
it's it's basically like a quick hi how
are you like elevator handshake sort of
you know over to pitch handshake
whatever and to that end you really want
this to be an incredibly easily
digestible piece of information right so
you want a clear format
you want quick bullet points that are
easy to read you want action words like
I did this I created that whatever it is
you want to highlight yourself right
what you're really trying to do is sell
yourself to so it needs to be you know
what did you do so focus on that right
and I think we actually skipped over
this a little earlier but we're not mmm
nothing you say here is like set in
stone rock solid like this is these are
just some guidelines these are some
things that Google thinks about resumes
thing we see a lot of resumes so these
are some general guidelines and tips but
that doesn't mean that everything we say
is going to apply directly to you
because you might have a different story
than Maria Chavez again so like if you
go if something doesn't really seem to
make sense to you or like you're like oh
but I really like you know this thing on
my resume I don't want to change it or
whatever just do what makes sense for
you and like we're here to kind of give
tips and guidelines of general resumes
that we've seen right okay so moving
forward another thing we want to see is
results and impact are like very
important to us so when we're going
through a resume we kind of want to know
quickly like what have you done and like
how can we best understand that you've
done right you know that's that's kind
of like the meat and bones of this and
then I think we also mentioned this
earlier but contact information probably
the most crucial part because if you are
excellent and we can't get in contact
with you
that's just that's the end of it so
we're email put your cell phone number
put your address in case we want to mail
you something we're not going to do it
when we just might and definitely
definitely put your Linkedin if you
don't have a LinkedIn make a link in
putting their recruitment department
loves linked in huge thing to be on that
github and any other open source
projects you've worked on those are huge
do because again resume that should be
short and succinct and to the point
where but if you want to include
additional resources of all the other
amazing
done but definitely further and we
follow those lives like if we see a link
we are gonna be like okay what's up with
that person we're actually gonna go to
the github page we're not just gonna be
like they have a github so like and
that's actually kind of an awesome thing
because a resume is gonna be like you
know short quick concise gives us an
idea of who you are
github does not have to be that way if
you like want to have like an awesome
github page you basically can like don't
really have to brag about it as much as
resume we're gonna go to that website so
it's gonna be great
alright so education specifically I
believe everyone watching today you're
all still in school so that's where the
bulk of your experience is going to come
from Google realizes that and for that
reason your education should be the
first thing that you put on your resume
after of course your contact information
so as far as that's concerned the things
that you're going to want to include are
all of the secondary education
institutions that you attended it right
which degrees
you got obviously that's major important
right and then when you're planning to
graduate because that's when Google will
be able to hire you if they want to
write we kind of need to see that to
just know that you're in the correct
pool because if you're graduating in two
years and we think that you're applying
for a full-time job but we're gonna
immediately want to know your graduation
dates and put that up at the top after
that you're gonna want to add a little
bit of information about you know how
you did so that we obviously your GPA is
going to be spread biggest indicator so
definitely put that on there and then
also yes so some well I was just gonna
say sometimes you have like a GPA and
you're like this is you know this is my
GPA but it's not really reflective of my
abilities that relate to Google right
like let's say your Mac major you're
like okay you know I I got an okay grade
in art history but all my math grades
are great put down your major specific
GPA if you want to talk about that
that's totally fine you know like to
include that stuff there so we can be
like okay yeah maybe they weren't the
best at art history but their computers
science grades are really good so like
okay right so again you know the GPA is
something that you should definitely
include but it's important to remember
that your resume is all about
highlighting your accomplishments and
where you've succeeded so you know make
sure that if your resume or if your GPA
sorry isn't as great as maybe you hope
it would be you know you can go ahead
and look for those other places for you
to shine further in your resume like if
you're working like three jobs and
that's why like your resumes I mean your
GPA your GPA is like not the best
because you were up late working late
but the fact that you were working three
jobs like somewhere in your resume and
will be like oh there's a this is a
great GPA for someone who's working
three jobs like you you get the idea
we're basically trying to understand who
you are and to that end we want you to
help us build a narrative of who you are
with your resume so like anything you
can do to help us flesh out like your
persona makes our job our lives way
easier and then we can you let go this
person seems we let's talk to them right
all right so after your education should
come any experience that you have only
go back to the other side missed yours I
think I think we miss the project which
I'm the project bullet point which I'm
sure you guys all want to hear about
since this is how to include projects so
we also want to know what classes you've
taken that's pretty important to us we
kind of need to know that you've taken
data structure and algorithms because
those are kind of the bread and butter
right any advanced CS courses that
you've taken or math courses or physics
whatever it may be we kind of wanna know
about that frag frag to us let us know
that you're awesome right we're gonna
want to know about course project work
cool things that you've done while you
were doing quantum mechanics I did
nothing cool while you're doing quantum
mechanics but I'm sure you guys have
like done the awesome stuff and then in
terms of like technical skills we need
your program but we really need to know
that you can program in one of the
Google languages and those are Java C++
C Python JavaScript and then we've got a
host of other languages
like go I mean like we're not gonna
pretend that we don't use the language
that we invented but like the point is
when we talk to you and interview you we
got a we got to know that we're
literally speaking the same language so
and also the order that you put that in
we're gonna assume that that's like the
order that you're most proficient in so
you know please don't put them
alphabetically you know or something
silly like that because we're gonna show
up and you know try and talk to you and
see and you're gonna be like oh actually
I'm best in Python we're gonna be like
okay we got us to swap entities yeah so
alright so moving on to experience
hopefully you've listed everything about
your education all of the important
details now you can go ahead and start
talking about if you have internship
experience or if you've worked on
basically anything that has to do with
the software engineering industry it
would happen outside of the classroom
again this is where you tell us about it
like like like the slide says your
experiences like we want to know okay
you've been to school and what else have
you done to interact with computer
science right like jobs or internships
research open source like collaborative
projects student groups hackathons like
cool class projects those sort of things
and so we we definitely want to know
about them well don't write us a paper
about them because that's like the
recruiter is gonna basically get bored
and move on you want to keep your resume
to one or two pages right on so
obviously there's a ton of information
about you it's all important so you want
to try to keep the descriptions as
concise as possible and focus on the
things that you did specifically so it
should be you know bullet point here's
what I did here's where I interned and
then a couple of maybe additional bullet
points that are just the actions that
you did there so just I solve 20 bugs
you know I created this different
platform notice action words right and
then you're moving on to your next
experience so some
just like a little a little story about
like what's happening the recruiter is
trying to like take your resume out of a
stack of resumes right your rake in it
and you want to make it as easy for them
to like figure that out as possible and
they don't want to they want to do this
quickly because they gotta get through
all of them so like this is what I don't
want to go on and on about that stuff
but then again bring you back
github links for whatever like links
that you click there then you can expand
on that like for every github project
that you're had you can put a readme
file on that and then have like a tldr
on every single project and then they'll
just scan through those and be like oh
but that doesn't have to be on your
resume which is awesome so like you kind
of wanna you know make it easy on them
because their jobs
alright so finally we're moving on to
extracurriculars and additional
information so if you know we've now
talked about education and work
experience you know if like many people
maybe you didn't go to the most
prestigious university or maybe you
don't have a ton of internship
experience that's fine you know Google
is still interested we just want to know
that you've done a ton of work outside
of the classroom in maybe personal
projects to show that you're interested
in computer science you're interested in
software engineering and you're
passionate about doing the work so you
know these can include a lot of
different things student groups are
great if you have you know program at
school where you guys go to a ton of
hackathons that's awesome we want to
know about that open source projects
University Honors a lot of different
schools have you know special awards for
you know if you were the very best CES
person in your entire department that's
huge definitely include that on there if
you've written papers gotten things
published about your personal opinions
in the industry you know that's huge too
and basically it's just any impressive
achievements that you feel like you've
accomplished that you want to highlight
and say hey I'm great I should we're
putting this like again back into the
same context that
man wait brag about yourself into an
area you know build us a narrative if
you have a great scholarship include
that so we can because that's part of
who you are you know like you're very
impressive these people thought you were
very impressive they have given you a
scholarship we would like to know about
that
so just brag to us through this very
clear concise perfectly formatted resume
I mean it's not that hard no we're gonna
we're gonna get there don't worry about
it so right to recap what we have said
education is the first thing we
generally want to see because it's
usually your most recent activity and
that and to that end we're gonna want to
know your degree classes you've taken
expected graduation date relevant
coursework and like technical skills
that you've gained while at university
listed in order of proficiency right
we're also going to want to know
extracurricular student groups
especially leadership positions we love
to like know that you're a leader or
something you can manage because you
know if you write you know if you can't
lead then we're all just gonna fall off
so most important takeaway is that you
need to remember that the person that's
reading your resume doesn't know you
they're meeting you for the first time
through your resume so the goal always
needs to be how can i as quickly cleanly
and concisely show to this person that I
would be a great fit for Google right
and again all the points great way to
format things all right so let's take a
look at a little model resume to be
thrown together
here comes Marie Chavez marinas target
is spoken a lot about Andrea shopping
let's just know right she's so cool
so as you can see her name is right at
the top that's who she is
she then includes a ton of ways to
contact her like pretty much all of them
that's a great idea with her snail mail
address she includes her LinkedIn in her
github so that's a great sign for
whoever's reading the resume to say wow
I can go and I can learn even more about
this person if I look what I see on this
page and again another quick plug for
LinkedIn
because I have a ton of friends who hate
LinkedIn and they're like oh like I
don't have a LinkedIn account and no and
it's like no have a LinkedIn account
that's how people contact you in this
day and age like if you do nothing but
put your resume on there that's fine
that's enough just a nigga lingotek yeah
fun fun tip that was actually how I was
approached to apply to work at Google so
yeah definitely get your Linkedin all
set up because people are looking at
that and it's just a great way to talk
about it so then we also see her GPA
right and that she was on the Dean's
List
look at her brag we'd love to see that
brag we see related coursework we know
that she's taken data structures do we
we don't see algorithms on there which
is kind of sad but I'm sure like she's
taken it with her GPA it's great
and then we see skills programming
languages again c-sharp must be her you
know primary language because that's the
first one and she's got her programming
languages right at the top of her skills
because that's what's most relevant to
the position right so immediately we see
okay
she's prioritizing their programming
languages seems like she'd be probably a
good fit for a software engineer role I
think she's in the right place and then
in fact we also see graphic design in
foreign languages which are not
immediately obviously relevant to like
Google work but that helps us understand
who she is it's impressive and we get an
AI like we get an idea of this narrative
of who she is who someone who's
trilingual and design like that helps us
sort of place her in her head gives us
an idea that she's very person she's
somebody we want to talk alright so
after education we move right to work
experience we see that she has some
internship experience which is great
most relevant one first yep and she
keeps it clean and concise straight to
the bullet points you see those
wonderful action words underlined in
green that's huge
the truth is that you know when you're
listening your experience it's all about
what did I do and the fastest way to get
to the point with that is to just jump
right in with those
words and she also includes if you see
those specific metrics so you know she
includes that she taught programming but
she lists exactly what she taught so she
taught her Java Python scratch that's
great
she says that she created a curriculum
and she says how many people were there
eight to ten mentors that's huge so open
secret is that Google loves numbers like
they just love numbers if you can
incorporate numbers in basically any
capacity into your resume oh man we're
engineers it's great it's what we
understand I know the number 12 I love
this person right so like you talk about
how you like the percentage that you've
increased something or like the number
of people in whatever program like just
if you throw some numbers in there like
people are going to get really excited
about that so that's like a cool
indicator to throw in there and it's
gonna spice up your resume because if
you say like my internship I solved a
lot of bugs we're gonna be like wow that
person's you know who will they self a
lot of bugs both what what's a lot of
bugs like too big bugs like you're like
I solved 50 bugs it's like wow 50 that's
a number I like numbers do you like
numbers Alex I love Oh Alex loves
numbers let's start from this person
right so any way that that's gonna
happen that exact exchange so you should
throw it over you yeah okay so now we're
moving on to projects this is where you
list all of those other things that you
did beyond the you know beyond work and
Beyond school so as you can see she
includes a virtual machine that she
helped to create distributed
cryptography system that's incredible I
would love to learn more about that
basically this is where you know you go
into those other things and she just
keeps she has one bullet point that
explains exactly what it was and that's
keep giving it succinct it's clear I can
learn a little bit about it and then my
interest is also peeps you know now I
want to talk to this person I want to
learn more about their experiences and
this is I mean like this is right here
in the title of our slide deck but how
do you bring your projects
whatever the name of our slide deck is
uh-huh it's like projects are a really
good way for us to understand who you
are and like how you are interested in
computer science you know having an
internship awesome because then we know
that you know how to work in a corporate
environment or whatever you work with
people you know how to team that's great
we love to see that projects we also
love to see it's like you know
individual contributions self motivation
what are your interests like Alex was
telling me just the other day that he
was like playing around and building a
game design yeah yeah so like that's
like now if I see that on his resume I'm
like oh this person likes game design
like that helps me understand who he is
Maria Chavez likes virtual machines so
like there's probably somebody at Google
who's working on a virtual machine light
project and they're gonna get really
excited about this person because
they're like oh man this person is
independently like doing a virtual
machine project I really like that I
want this person for my team I think a
big key there too is that you know maybe
you haven't had all of the same
opportunities Google realizes that what
we want to know is that you're
passionate about the subject and that
you're working hard and independently
towards it so you know if you don't have
a ton of experience in one area but you
have you are able to show that you know
you're doing a ton of work still that's
great definitely include yeah you know
we want to see that the moral of the
story is we want to know that you're
passionate about computer science
because we're all passionate about
computer science and we like to
associate with other people who are
passionate about computer science and
like projects is a top notch way to show
that right so then we're beyond two
awards and experiences that's kind of
like everything else that you couldn't
fit into the other categories Awards
like you haven't mentioned these before
who wants to year awards like again she
chooses a scholarship there so we're
talking about scholarships earlier that
those don't have to go with education
those can go like right down here at
bottom or it's like wow you know the
Rebel Alliance gave her a scholarship
because they love her and she was the
first place in pretend
2015 which is highly prestigious in the
pretend world let me tell you I think
that's a great point to that I think we
should tie back in you know none of this
stuff is steadfast rules yeah so if it
sounds like you know well they said that
we could include this in education but
then we could also include it in
projects you know that's something that
you need to decide on your own biggest
thing about a resume is that it's clear
concise to the point you know so maybe
you know where exactly something goes
isn't the most important as long as it's
visible it's easy to tease out whoever's
reading it can pick it up right away I
mean like look at this century it's
basically other ways for us to
understand who she is and how she's
interested in like computer science or
really just how she's googling great
she's like under Awards we're seeing
Grace Hopper scholarship so we all know
that Grace Hopper is like a big name in
computer science right so we're like
that's I mean y'all the rebel girls who
code organisation that's awesome women
in computer science we would love to see
that gamer Club cool hip-hop dance I
already mentioned that I love to dance
this is why Maria and I are like you
know best buds but it's like that's
googly like we kind of think it's fun
that Maria really likes hip-hop because
I also really like hip hop and like
other people or just we like people who
like things that's kind of how it goes
same for community service like I don't
think in her time at Google she's ever
going to program anything that has to do
with volunteer blanket making but that's
not going to stop us from like being
like oh that's really cool and maybe
when she gets here she leverages like
Googlers to make more blankets like and
that's something we're excited about but
we want people are gonna do cool things
inside and out of community
all right so let's take a look at the
whole resume together as you can see you
know it's roughly one-page she's got her
education right at the top that's huge
she then goes on to list her work
experience projects awards and what you
see is so you know she's got her work
experience first that's sort of like her
oh sorry she has her education first but
once she gets in touch with you
contech and so first which again yeah
huge but you know the biggest thing is
that you want to have your sort of most
significant accomplishments towards the
top and those are maybe the things that
you expand on a little bit more so as
you can see you know she obviously
values her work experience highly so
she's included a few bullets for each of
those and then we move on to projects
she's got you know multiple projects but
with the one bullet for each giving us a
clearer idea but you know keeping it
concise which is very important and then
finally with her awards and experiences
it's more just of a list format to make
sure that she gets everything in there
right and I think that just looking at
the whole thing together the parts like
the best part about this is how easy it
is to parse it's like education skills
work experience projects awards and
experiences like you know anything I
could possibly search for it's going to
fit into one of those categories pretty
easily and I'm going to know exactly
which scholarships might be an education
might be an awards and experiences
pulling the point is that I can scan
these lines really quickly really easily
get a sense of who this person is make a
decision and then move forward right and
if this was just a block of text that's
just dimmable like this is not like
reading a text book which some resume is
kind of look like a text book it's just
like I did this and then I did this and
let me do this this and this there's no
way to find him there are these bullet
points we love bullet points yeah and
there are numbers in there we love
numbers but like most of all we can just
like quickly read it so that's why Maria
Chava is getting a call from cool so now
it's time for questions and again if you
miss the link before it's at the bottom
of this slide we're gonna hang out on
this life for a while so just copy that
you would now do it later but copy it
into another tab whatever you wanna do
so alright yeah so as I see you have
some questions yeah our first question
is from Michelle I'm sure Michelle says
I'm worried about cluttering my resume
by including all of my projects how do I
handle
yeah absolutely
so it's a great point you know if you
have hundreds of projects it's just not
all gonna fit and you know a small space
to be able to kept concise I think so
number one always remember that if you
have a ton of projects and they all have
links on github throw your github on
there say hey you know I have 100 more
projects that you can look at on my
github and throw that link right at the
top that's a great way for you whoever's
reading to learn about all those
projects but as far as the resume is
concerned really you know you want to
try to prioritize which projects you
feel were the most significant that
really showcase your ability the best
and throw those on there and I think
this is a rule of thumb but like just in
general with resumes it's quality not
quantity not saying that like quantity
is an awesome but I'm saying that like
you're gonna want to harp on like your
most quality projects I'm sure like all
your projects are like a roughly
equivalent quality but whatever you feel
most like proud of put that at the top
leave the others for the github link and
again we're gonna follow that so like
don't worry about it make your readme
files have like TLDR at the top and
that'll make our recruiters lives like
way easier but like on the resume keep
it to what you feel really proud of so
I'll take this next one from a crazy
robot girl 51 love the handle what types
of projects should I get involved in and
that is a great question you have to be
involved in this exact one type of
project or if you don't even want to
talk to you at all no okay
so like the answer is just whatever
you're interested great because we just
want to know what you're interested in
and whatever projects you do should
basically reflect that right you know if
you do a crazy project in assembly
language and you never want to touch
assembly again like you can put that
down but like it's a hmm I guess that's
impressive but it's also somewhat
misleading because then we're probably
going to assume that you like a salmon
so what you should do is if you're
looking for projects let me get started
just start
whatever seems interesting yeah like try
you know but look around try different
things and whatever catches your
attention and seems like fun to do
that's what you should do and like
that'll probably go the furthest because
you're interested in it like it and
that's like how'd you get involved in CS
right yeah absolutely I mean start with
something that you're passionate about
and then say you know is there an app
that I can build for this is there an
open-source community that's working on
something similar to this really go from
there it has to start with what your
interests are what you want to do yeah
and just like just start playing around
with it's like anything that seems
interesting you know because that's
that's how you get started like you
don't have to immediately jump into a
group like an open-source project it's
great if you do that or eventually get
there that's awesome
like I have a friend who is like a big
part of open maps she loves like working
with Matt Damon
she loves it and like it's a hobby and a
passion of hers and she's like has fun
with it so she would put that down but
like I don't think she just jumped into
the mat she like started playing around
with map data and was like oh this is
kind of cool look at all this stuff I
can eat with it
she wasn't I'm gonna do this because it
would look good on my resume it was
I love maps I love exploring that field
how can I get right so just it's all
you're interested everybody alright so
our next question is from Jen and Jen
says is Project Work more valuable than
an internship on my resume so you know
obviously a software engineering
internship is a huge sign if you know
recruiter is reading your resume but you
have experience in the industry you're
clearly interested in the industry and
you know a little bit about sort of I
think what it's like yeah I think this
is a bit there's a bit of a false
premise in this question that like oh
one of these has to be valued like more
than the others we're trying to get a
sense of who you are but back to this
whole narrative thing what
most strongly resonates with your story
is most valuable right so if you have a
dinky internship and like a really cool
project that really cool project is way
more bringing the other internship right
and if you have a really cool project
and a really cool internship those are
both really cool we want to hear about
both of those you know make space on
your resume to talk about both of them
because you value them equally important
now Google thinks that it's important to
know that you can work in a corporate
environment because Google is a
corporation and they want to know you
can work with teams you like no how do
you like develop with others and like
have priorities and stuff like that so
it's important it's definitely important
for them to see that like you can work
an internship but you don't have an
internship that's not like oh man it's
the end of the world it's just okay
that's not part of my story I still have
a story right if you are passionate
about the work and you really you know
you feel that you would be a great fit
for Google but you haven't had the
opportunity to have internship
experience you know go ahead and throw
those projects on there Google is going
to see if you have a ton of projects
that you've worked on okay this person
maybe doesn't have industry experience
yet but clearly they're qualified
clearly they care about the role right
any granny give them a shot right and it
also flips the other way where it's like
if you have some really cool internships
and not a lot of projects because you
were doing all these internships like
that's also your story like just tell us
who you are so we've got from ideas fair
how do you measure the quality on a
project I have worked in projects for a
company and I can't show my work at a
website or on github how can I present
my work in my resume that is a very real
question as someone who works on
confidential stuff all the time and like
you have to draw that line between what
can you talk to or talk about what can
you talk about yeah I would say so as
long as it's not confidential if you can
include any measurables like you know
work for this company help to build a
tool that reached
a million people you know ready that's
great anything anytime that you can
throw numbers in that's huge even if we
can't see the actual work that you did
anything that ties back to the six I
think alex is just really cut right to
that point impact is the way to go there
the more like it's fine if you can't
talk about the project you can talk
about the impact that's like pretty much
just as good you're like I did a project
and this was the impact at my company
LED like it made these people's lives
easier it had like by this percentage or
whatever again the numbers so like you
really just want it like I understand
the struggle and do the best you can to
work around it it's cool like if you can
include whatever technical details that
you can but it's certainly not the end
of the world just because you can't talk
about it cuz its proprietary okay so our
next question is from Alec dand and C
they say while applying for jobs I put
in work experience but in terms of
projects I get confused as to whether I
should be adding them as work experience
or should leave them in the resume under
projects especially when the products
are highly related to the job profile I
am applying okay so great question I
think you know this goes back to the
fact that there are no steadfast rules
the biggest thing with your resume is
that the information that you want to
get across is clear and readily readable
so whether or not that falls under
projects or work experience you know
that's sort of up to your own into it up
to your own intuition to decide there's
no correct answer just make sure that
you know you've got your bullet point
it's clear you're showing exactly the
work that you did on the project and
then you know which heading it falls
under is is not the most important thing
all right so from Jordan Schneider
you've got is it okay if I don't have
personal or personal projects open
source stuff if I have a lot of
part-time during your jobs I think we've
already answered this one a little bit
but yeah totally fine whatever is
relevant to you and your story that's
what one
so if you have lots of if you have like
lot like job experience and that's what
you were doing instead of doing personal
projects just tell us about that and
that's part of your story and like we're
gonna understand that and move forward
with who you are not somebody else's
right I would increase you know also I
think a good note is so the headings
that we went over like you know work
experience projects like those are not
the finite list if you feel like you
know you worked a ton in maybe other
areas that you feel somehow tie back
into software engineering go ahead and
try to include something like you know
other work experience where you can say
you know here are the other things I did
and here's how it may be a great leader
or something like that cool so uh lock
show you burma how do you show interest
in resumes about things that we don't
have any experience and that's that's
tough question you can you can show
interest in things like with measurables
and with impact but if you don't if
you're interested in something but
you're interested in it without a
grounding then I don't really think that
Google is gonna take that seriously to
me just totally Frank the best thing to
do if you're really interested in
something go out and get involved in
some way with that activity no sorry
anything that you really love go do it
now and then you will have Explorer or
you know just get into Google and then
on the preference form when you when
they asked you what you wanted you just
put all those things you're interested
in don't throw you on a teeny meta that
does that stop so yeah those do it
alright so our next question is from
taka who asks would my red would my
resume benefit from having non CS
activities such as long hikes or camping
I know some companies like well-rounded
employees that is a good question Google
is definitely interested in you know who
you are as a person and they love to
hear those things but it's important
/ that that's not the priority if we're
looking for a software engineer the most
important thing is not that you love
long hikes in camping include that but
maybe keep it as sort of an EndNote to
your resume if you have a little bit of
extra space throw that on there as you
know personal interests basically like
we love to see it
but if it's if that's the difference
between a one page and a two page resume
just cut it you know but we do we do
like to see it if you can get it on yeah
does it we're interested in right also
you know if you have your linkedin built
up maybe you put that a little blurb
about me yeah also I love hiking and
okay come to work just anything that you
want to put in but camp in the resume
put in the link somewhere and throw
cuddling other resume and we have to
follow it so all right so I think I
think that's all the questions we have
time for thanks so much for joining us
this is this has been great for us guys
are really talking about that I love the
interaction yeah alright so sign up for
those links and I hope this was helpful
alright see you guys
