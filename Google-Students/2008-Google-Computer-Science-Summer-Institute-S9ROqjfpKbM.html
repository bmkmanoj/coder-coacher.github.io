University of Arizona the computer
science Summer Institute is an
opportunity for upcoming sophomores in
college to come to the Google campus and
we Google people learn more what Google
is about this program brought together
people from all over the country and
kind of gave us a sense that you know
we're all learning the same thing and we
can work together and have fun while
doing it there were 17 people in the
program it was like close enough to
where we could all become really tight
but also large enough to where we have
diverse skills that we could go to and
turn to each other for to help each
other out with programming we took 33
courses so some of the activities
included learning JavaScript we learned
HTML Ajax JSON CSS XML we also learned
about the history of computer science
and history of the inner
in computer architecture we also learned
about different industries we talked to
a panel from different companies and
then we also talked to Googlers to learn
how Google works a little bit more this
was the most amazing opportunity and I
would not trade it for anything else in
the world I'm also looking forward to
keeping in contact with the people I've
met here maybe working on projects
together or like just talking about what
we're learning in general
I think with educating people at younger
and younger ages we will be able to
spread the word that you know computer
science is doable and still go for
anybody and it's a diverse field there's
so many opportunities within it and it's
not as hard as people think I mean
basically any interest can be applied to
computer science it it applies to
everything and you can you can take it
into biology you can see get into any
sort of filled and mix it with computer
science the summer has helped a lot it's
kind of just giving me an opportunity to
see what CS is about and to learn more
and now I feel I definitely have an
advantage going back to school and I
will remember this forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
