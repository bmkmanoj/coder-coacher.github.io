found find challenging and particularly
rewarding is the fact that our user base
is so large and diverse our systems have
to run at such a large scale I always
tell people that come in to interview
engineers are come in to interview that
if you're building a system here and has
any kind of shortcoming or rough spot
you know our large user base is going to
uncover that pretty quickly so as an
engineer it's a very challenging
environment you have to build a system
that's extremely robust you have to
build algorithms that are very thorough
and I find that that challenging becomes
very rewarding at times it can be you
know kind of difficult as you're
building up the initial design but then
as you're as you start to implement the
system and you begin to test it you get
feedback on your algorithm and you see
some of these pieces of the algorithm
that you've worked on in your mind for
days was always churning there in the
background it was a little bit
frustrating at the time but then you get
it out there and it starts working and
it's an incredibly rewarding experience
