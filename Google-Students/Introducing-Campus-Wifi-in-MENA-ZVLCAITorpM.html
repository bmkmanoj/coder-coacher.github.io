about um campus Wi-Fi in meaning so I'm
Hisham we are here I'm from the
infrastructure and access team um we try
to bring more people online in in the
middle east and north africa ah this
will be done by reducing access barriers
and making a internet relevant and
affordable for people so um basically we
have several initiatives and projects in
Mena with main focus on universities and
higher education in general so we
believe that internet connectivity is no
longer a luxury and it will allow
students and professors to access
information share knowledge and create
an environment that makes learning more
meaningful so campus Wi-Fi is one of
these initiatives ah let me start by
showing you some of the main axis
internet access challenges inside inside
the campus so the accessibility which
means we need to have access to the
Internet it can be wireless access or a
wired access so sometimes in
universities we have like labs with
desktop computers where we can have
access to the internet but wireless
access is more relevant because now we
have smartphones and laptops the
availability is about having an
always-on a connectivity which means any
time you would like to go to the
Internet make some web browsing or
use google apps to send email we would
like to be always on and to have the
connectivity all the time oh also
quality of service qos is one of the
major and important aspects of campus
internet access because sometimes we do
have access points or wireless coverage
inside the campus but with a poor
quality of service so that can be
impossible even to send an email and
finally security is important security
and confidentiality of the information
in order to send emails and save
documents on the cloud without any
security issue now let's have a look on
the campus internet access framework so
when we talk with IT admins of
universities in faculties in the Middle
East and North Africa and sometimes
wireless connectivity is just perceived
as deploying access points and that's
all in fact there there are four
important aspects for any internet
access connectivity inside the campus
the first one is the last mile aspects
which means the wireless coverage or the
wired connectivity bandwidth management
and quality of service and security the
second aspect is back holding so back
holding is the connectivity between the
different campuses and the different
buildings so what we can see is that
usually the IP connectivity or the
Internet connectivity is provided to one
building in a university and then all of
the buildings will be connected to this
central
location where we have the internet
gateway or the main router so it is
important to have a good backhoe link or
inter-site inter-campus network to
support the traffic that will be
generated by the different campuses or
different buildings also operations and
maintenance is one important aspect here
what happens if one one access point or
the main router in the central IT
location is down so we need to have an
IT Help Desk with ticketing a system in
order to escalate any major problem also
IT admins have to deploy network
monitoring tools to make sure that all
the devices are working properly the
final aspect is the optimization this is
a continuous task done by the IT admins
to optimize the current infrastructure
of the internet inside the campus so in
the axis and infrastructure team we have
different projects to cover at least
four main aspects and now I will talk
about a campus Wi-Fi that will cover
more the last mile aspects of the
internet access framework so
basically this is the campus Wi-Fi we
have the access points that can be
deployed this is the back end or the
axis controller so the access controller
will provide several functions important
to authenticate the users and also to
authorize the users to use specific
services inside the campus so this axis
controller is basically a firewall that
will filter all of the traffic the users
well we'll connect to the access points
with an open SSID without any encryption
the axis controller will intercept the
traffic and the user will be redirected
to a captive portal to enter his
username and password and once the user
is authenticated he will be able to have
full connectivity to the Internet so
this is the first function which is the
firewall now we have a triple-a triple-a
is an implication opera authorization
and accounting server so here we would
like to authenticate the users and give
access to the Internet to the students
and the staff of the faculty and not for
everyone so that's why we will have an
integration between this access
controller and Google Oh of API so the
idea here is to have what we call
federated authentication so instead of
having one username and password to have
access to the internet and then having a
second login and password to
to connect to a mailbox and Google Apps
we can have only one login and password
which is the Google identity a Google
Apps account to access all of the
services that will be provided by the
faculty or the University so also we
have the DHCP to provide dynamic IP
addresses to terminals and the captive
portal of course to use your Google Apps
login and password to connect and
finally a web caching so the web caching
is mainly a server that will download
the most popular websites and videos in
order to serve the users so this the web
caching will basically optimize the web
traffic by caching the most popular
content on the axis controller so these
are the main features supported by
campus Wi-Fi federated authentication
and single sign-on so using your Google
Apps identity you'll be able to access
the Internet your mailbox and all of the
services provided by the University this
is Radio agnostic which means the access
controller can be deployed with any type
of access points from any manufacturer
and we have the traffic shaping
capabilities which means the IT admin
will be able to make some policies to
give priority to the most important
traffic so now let me share with you a
video about campus Wi-Fi
so basically you will be able to access
a Wi-Fi access point without any
encryption or username or password when
you try to login or to browse on the
internet you will be redirected to a
captive portal you will be prompt to
enter your username and password which
is a the Google identity and then you
will have access to the internet using
your Google identity on so this is how
the IT admin of the faculty or the
University will be able to authenticate
and authorize
so now we have we will launch a pilot
and one of the universities in the
region it's University University of
Marrakech the pilot will be will start
deployment by end of end of this year we
have all of the subcontractors and the
system integrator on-site in Marrakech
ready for deployment we will evaluate at
the pilot during the next two month and
we would like and be happy to support
other universities to deploy the same
kind of solution so if you think that in
your university or faculty there's a
potential to deploy this kind of
solution don't hesitate to contact me
and we will be in touch with your IT the
IT admin of the university to see how
can we deploy this kind of solution in
in your university thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
