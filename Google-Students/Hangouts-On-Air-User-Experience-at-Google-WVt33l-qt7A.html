who's tuning in my name is Jessica I
manage the Google students page on
Google+ they work on university programs
team and I'm joined today by again some
of my favorite Googlers who are going to
talk a bit about the user experience
teams at Google so we're going to do
introductions and this is my coworker
hell is going to tell you a little bit
about himself first hi my name is Hal
Morris and I'm on the university
programs team and my client manager is
user experience and so let's hear from
the actual user experience Googlers mark
why don't you kick things off and give
us an introduction how's it going my
name is Mark hem Ian I'm a designer at
YouTube and happy to be here with my we
draw friend and where'd you go to school
and tell us a little bit about your path
to Google ok I went to BYU I studied
business their business information
systems I did a string of startups my
latest one was finally acquired by
google about a year ago and so I was
lucky enough to join google in january
two thousand eleven and it was a bit of
a roundabout secure this path but i'm
here awesome alright kelsey why don't
you go hi I'm Kelsey rushing i'm a
visual designer here at Google and I
currently work with the Chrome Web Store
team I came here through an acquisition
I went to school and got a bachelor's
degree and then a design degree and got
hired with a start-up in Seattle right
out of school and that startup got
purchased by google so ended up here and
made my own way here so been awesome and
you're joined by your horse friend
behind you yeah this is a really cool
room up in kirkland that has horses and
hay bails and it's called galloping
gertie kind of words all right and Doug
hi I'm Doug I'm a user experience
researcher here at Google I work on the
google analytics team my path here I
went to wichita state university my
undergrad and i got a BA in psychology
there and then i went to graduate school
at Wichita State as well and got my PhD
there and then I think I had the most
direct path here allows in grad school I
did
internships at Google working on the
Google TV team and then also working on
some of the advertising teams and so
after that after the internships I
beautiful time great well we're glad to
have all of you here market sounds like
you're already multi tasking working and
talking to us the same time what
Googlers do best right yeah let's get
started and talked to some of our
Googlers here we have Doug Kelsey and
Mark how we want to start off with the
first question sure so just basically in
general we wanted to know what the user
experience teams do here at Google mark
do you want to start that question yeah
definitely um our primary objective of
course is always put these are first and
so within within Google we tend to be
the the folks really putting ourselves
in the mindset of the user in thinking
through how they're using our products
on a day-to-day basis and how we can
make those experiences a lot better and
it's you know I look at it as kind of as
we meet with n JH engineering teams and
p.m. teams they also care great to know
about the user but sometimes I it's up
to us really kind of drive drive that
home as a designer we can do that in a
lot of ways and one of the most powerful
ways we do that is then is in machs and
in prototypes and it's really wonderful
to actually put something down on paper
put some pixels on paper share that with
the team and NC okay I understand what
you're talking about design has this
really special place in my opinion that
captures people's imagination and
captures people's motivates teams in a
way that words and emails just can't
quite do and so as a designer we just
get that opportunity to kind of create
these new experiences and on behalf of
our users and hopefully it's reflected
in our products and hopefully you know
hopefully we're we're always in a ting
we're always pushing forward and trying
to do the next great thing it's um so it
sounds like you guys are interacting
with not just other Googlers who work in
user experience and you guys want to
talk a bit about who else you're working
with and sort of
life would look like in in terms of
interacting with some of those people
she yeah sure I I can go first and
others can chime in everyday we work on
typically for me I work on some pretty
big ongoing projects but in any given
moment for example today this morning I
had a series of meetings with different
teams talking about different I work on
youtube and we this morning I met with a
project manager an engineer from another
team working on the TV product thinking
about you know what are some cool ideas
that we can do with with YouTube on TV
u21 things like Xbox and Playstation
that's not really typically what I do
but it's really fun to kind of go in and
chime in on those ideas and brainstorm
on those a little bit we also meet with
our partners we're just as South by
Southwest yeah we were able to present
some talk some I talk guarding the
design at YouTube and it's really fun
just to interact with YouTube partners
and users get their feedback and so I
look at that is also a part of our job
is kind of listening very closely and
hearing their pain points and kind of
internalizing those and hopefully we can
build better solutions for them that
solve their problems that's great how
about duck on the research side of
things who else within Google are you
interacting with yeah I say from the
day-to-day job role I was out with some
evidence and then I work with engineers
and designers as well so those are the
poor people I work with a lot of my job
is trying to just define what we need
for our products from our users as far
as the way they naturally behave and the
way they usually use our products and
then I have to communicate that back to
our team whether it's designers PMS or
their engineers so that they can make
better decisions about the way some
things to find calcium what about you
yeah so I mean it kind of depends on the
project but the cool thing about design
is that you can be helpful in every
stage of the project like from when
people think of this idea to what and
they're actually marketing it out for
the real world so you can work with
pretty much anyone on your greater team
and I think of my team you know there's
the UX team but there's also the team
that you get to work with your pretty
much
embedded with that team you can work
really closely with PM's and engineers
anybody that's got a stake in it you can
be working with them and offering ideas
and walking up ideas and discussing
things and thinking about how we can
make a really good product for these are
at the end i must say every time i talk
to people in user experience it makes me
wish that I worked in UX but I'm pretty
satisfied in university program so we'll
just go with that right now um so what
about the most interesting project that
you guys have worked on today I don't
know if there's something that stands
out in your mind or maybe a sort of fun
moment that you remember working and
user experience I want I can kick it off
you recently just redesigned YouTube
last year and by far that was one of the
largest harnessed projects I've ever
worked on YouTube gets about 4 billion
views a day all in seventy percent of
those views are outside of the United
States and so tons of challenges with
that all sorts of devices as you guys
know everyone's not everyone has a
mobile phone now and tablets and and so
when you take that all into
consideration you think how do you
design for all these different platforms
all these different languages
accessibility issues come into play you
put that all together it's kind of a big
hairy mess and so it's so that was
probably the largest challenge to date
for me next I guess I can go next so I
think the most interesting project I've
worked on in my time of Eagle with this
on google TV so one thing you'll learn
at Google if you everywhere carrots we
have twenty percent times so you know my
most my time is dedicated who analytics
I do work on other projects so I was
working on the Google TV team and we
were just observing people in their
homes and apartments on how they
naturally watch TV and I do a lot of TV
watching in my spare time like most
people probably know spirits like me and
so it is this fun to actually do get
paid and do something that fun to be
able to watch TV with people and dis
learn how they naturally use google TV
and actually get paid for it did you get
observed
to TV as well or did he just worried
just the observer I was I was a
researcher on the team so I was actually
observing others how they were watching
TV so I would go into these people times
and that watch how they they watch TV
what they do Wow I watch a lot of TV
yeah how would actually a really good
person to other amount of TP he watches
this kind of ridiculous why we love it
why don't you tell seemed um yeah it's I
remember this question from our blog and
it was really really tough to just pick
one thing because pretty much well i
would say every project is really
interesting once you dig into it and
learn about it and start working with
the people who are really really
passionate but there are two that i can
qualify them as more interesting because
there are things that I never ever ever
imagined I would be doing one was just
being able to travel to the Zurich
office it was really casual as like hey
we have this project to you guys want to
help and you know within a couple weeks
I was traveling to Zurich and seeing
that amazing office so that was
definitely very interesting another one
was for a promo like a marketing thing
with celebrity photos for their Google+
pages so I got to edit their photos and
you know who was one step between me and
a bunch of celebrities and like
thumbs-up thumbs-down change this you
know it was really interesting to know
pressure really good idea of how people
is yeah that's great well what did you
guys study in school to kind of prepare
you for the world of user experience
mark do you want to start off yeah I you
know when i when i was i graduated in
two thousand so from ninety seventy
thousand i was in school and i gotta
tell you there the work that i did i had
a minor in graphic design just because
i've always been passionate about design
but they're really really just wasn't a
nice structure around web development
web product development and of course
mobile really wasn't even a thing back
then and so what I decided to do while I
was exploited two things wanted to study
abroad in London did you study the
humanities I figured you know what I
just want to enrich myself was just kind
of what the literature are
and and I go back to that all the time
and just recently when I took a similar
trip to Kelsey house in Paris pulling
these fun projects it's kind of crazy
they're like hey you go on to Paris in a
few weeks okay sure whatever don't I'm
definitely nice yeah it's crazy and so
while I was in Paris you know obviously
visiting all museums all the great
things are in Paris and I'm just austra
by the we have such a rich artistic
history and I feel like as designers
least right now everyone is looking at
each other's work online on dribble and
and there's tends to be a lot of I don't
know a lot of looking glass self you see
one design and then you see something
that's a bit iterative and something
that's a bit more iterative to really
get some kind of original thought on
things I really feel like you got to
kind of deep dive way back and so I
really rely a lot of humanities work
which is a bit of an odd me source for
inspiration that and coupled when I was
in school I also joined a start-up i was
in college i don't know if that was the
best thing to do or not but i was also
working quite a bit just with what i
loved i wasn't getting the right
education for where I went to school so
I decided to find it on my own in a
start-up don't recommend that for the
fan of art still trying to catch up on
sleep to this day so there you go all
right come on time I say yeah going to
school I studied psychology and I think
that's kind of where I got my start in
terms of going to a human factors
program at rich tall state and so I
studied a lot of classes there is on
human behavior and the way we naturally
been cognitively and I think that's
helped me a lot in my transition at
Google as far as like understanding our
users and how they naturally Haven
observing them as far as the most
applicable classes I took I took in grad
school I took a lot of classes on
human-computer interaction and also
related to human factors and I was
actually in the lab called the software
usability research lab so am i working
on the river direction of dr. barber
chikara and the great benefit of working
at that lab is that we got a lot of
contract work with
other companies to do usability testing
for them and so that really got my feet
wet as far as how to do usability
testing and user research and really
helped me with my transition to my two
internships at Google and so then once I
came here at Google is just a natural
fit for me to do user research here
based on my academic background so and
if you guys could go back to your
education is there like a certain class
you wish you could have taken or if you
could have done something outside of
class that would have helped prepare you
is there anything that comes to mind is
like I wish I could have done that or
taking that class I can jump in there um
so my thing is that the program I took
after I got my bachelor's degree was
really intense two years amazing amazing
teachers just pros and I still keep in
contact with them and I still know
people going through the program and
they're always updating their classes
and are always offering new things that
just make me so jealous like if I
weren't working full time I wish I could
just keep going back every year and take
all those new classes like I know right
now they're learning how to design I
design and build ipad apps so I'm sure
next year they'll do something even
cooler so it's hard to say but yeah
anyway if I had to pick just one I'd say
probably html5 because that was just
coming out of the woodwork when I
graduated and I everybody knew it was
going to be a big thing and it's
something that I don't find myself
seeking out necessarily but if I were in
a class and had teachers scaring me into
it it would be really helpful for me
marker Doug yeah I think just for me
since I came from a social science
background study a lot more psychology
and human factors well I would like is
more just computer science classes
disingenuous you and as an undergrad and
as a grad student but I don't think
nearly is enough to have a deep
understanding that would be very Google
sometimes just to understand what some
of our engineers or project managers are
trying to communicate to us so I think
just in general like if you are in a
social science background like as far as
psychology or there try to make sure you
take computer science classes long
good advice quite well I had a question
what do you this is a really hard
question so what do you love most about
working at Google besides the giraffe
second to the giraffe welcome second
well then there's also a slot outside of
my window okay so beyond the slide in
the giraffe I don't know if I really got
into this selection of the blog but one
of one of the things that we talked
about when when our startup was getting
acquired was this idea of freedom you
know Google's is big it's a huge company
and as a start-up person that's kinda
it's in your DNA they want to have
control and to want to have kind of
control your destiny on what you're
building and so my initial reactions
like oh my gosh I mean that's amazing
google also acquire us but we're just
going to get gobbled up into this large
company and not have any freedom or
anything and I was I've been completely
surprised when we when we got acquired
our team stay together and it was funny
because we're kind of walking around the
halls like so what what should we work
on it everyone's like what do you want
to work on like wait what do you mean we
like sure what do you want to build
build something build something cool it
was great the first year a few months
our team was literally left to our own
devices and it we just hit was this fun
little lap and the what's crazy though
is when you launch something at Google
all right in my case YouTube you just
have insta insta crowd you know hundreds
of millions of people using and
experimenting with what you're doing so
that those two combinations are really
what I love we have a ton of freedom
here and then this the impact it is
really hard to wrap your head around the
amount of impact that would the work
that you do and that's that's what i
really really love kelsey yeah so i
figured out a tricky way to answer this
question because it is tough so one word
kind of sums it all up for me of what's
my favorite thing about working here
it's the culture and that kind of
encompasses just people here are
nice like just beyond belief everyone is
so nice and very very passionate about
what they're doing and just absolute
rock stars at their jobs and yet very
humble about it that's really really
great to be working with so many amazing
people and be able to get along with
them like friends that's really cool and
then obviously you know the
opportunities for different projects to
bump around and learn new things and
work with new people and travel all over
the world to work with those people it's
just like the culture is very like you
hear about like giraffes and slides and
all that good stuff but like there's a
real deep feeling of like happiness like
you should be happy here and you should
work with really great nice people and
do things you love doing it's just like
it seems to be something that the
company really cares about three each
each employee so I love it and Doug Wow
how do I follow up those answers all
know if I can so and I think I think
I've marked read my answer on the blog
as if I was like verbatim what I put so
uh anyway like I guess I this on top of
my heads and the stuff I love is this
the fact that I get to work on complex
projects and things that really
challenge me as far as what I'm trying
to do as a researcher you really left to
your own devices this have how to do
things like this product are what you're
going to research and how you're going
to research it and I love the fact that
we have that freedom and the ability to
do things your way to I really like
about people cool those are some great
answers so we're actually going to shift
gears for just a minute and how it's
going to talk a little bit about what
current opportunities are available for
students who are interested in maybe
studying user experience what
opportunities we have available at
Google and then we're going to go into
rapid fire answering the questions that
we got from you guys our fans and
followers on the Google+ page so how I
want you go into a little bit about what
the process is what opportunities are
available sure so currently we're
looking for user experience internships
they could be designers or internships
in research and it's really easy to
apply you just go to
google.com / students and you can look
for all the different openings right
there and you can apply right online and
one word of advice I'd love to give out
to the designers out there is to really
make sure that you include a link to
your online portfolio because that that
way the recruiters and actually UX folks
can go ahead and look at your online
portfolio and assess that way and these
positions are located all around a lot
of positions are here in Mountain View
and you could work with dog it's good of
work to Nam you or you can work in
YouTube with Mark or in Seattle with
kelsey and we also and we also have
positions in New York so cool oh yeah
three hi add the house point yeah I'm a
portfolio piece please please please
that's all I look at I interview tons of
folks it's the first thing I look at if
there is no portfolio I hate to say it I
don't even look at your resume it's
probably bad I'm probably get in trouble
for the arts not recruiter now I'm not a
little cooter but but even if you don't
have any like any best food of
previously when I was alluding to kind
of picking I make a brother Craigslist
or something just something have
something in there please because
there's some wonderful i get a resume
and i can tell there's just wonderful
education and there's no work it just
breaks my heart i know like probably
really cool little smart really
wonderful but there's no pixels so I'm
sorry how I just wanted oh so we've
learned it's important to include your
portfolio for New York definitely cool
okay so we're gonna start in with these
questions that we've gotten from those
of you who are tuning in now hopefully
the first question from Tristan he asks
just thinking about having an
opportunity at Google is intimidating
what kind of criteria are you looking
for within students so he'll maybe from
a recruiter standpoint you can just add
a few notes about that sure well first
of all you should never really feel
intimidated by applying for any job at
Google we've all made it here we come
from a variety of backgrounds we take
students and industry folks from from
all walks of life from all different
majors so you should never feel
intimidated you used to definitely apply
for design roles we really look for sue
studying HCI interaction design visual
design or or related field even a
computer science would be helpful too
because we really wanted to review the
design work in your in your resume you
should have experience with HTML
Javascript and CSS which is also you
should also have a strong technical
background for you for the user research
roles you should have some experience in
school or an internship doing actual
research itself so they the recruiters
really look for that experience as well
that's great I answers that question
let's go to the next one so I'll make on
Google+ is very curious about how the UX
team approaches scalability and I know
this is something I think mark brought
up pretty early in this conversation is
there a lot of thought put into how a
product or design will scale vertically
and horizontally before the process of
designing begins how just talk maybe
mark and maybe Doug want to talk a
little bit about scalability on the UX
side of things yeah absolutely what one
of our challenges that youtube is we
offer you save up in a variety of
languages is something that's really fun
to do actually if you go down and switch
it to arabic the whole site we'll just
flip over the whole thing you know some
really smart engineer flipped everything
over and so how do you design for that
how do you make sure your titles fit
your usernames fit so we build a lot of
prototypes we have we do a lot of what's
called the dog fooding we need our own
dog food and so will will build a
product internally and we'll just use it
and we'll bang on it and we'll go over
we'll find people who speak German and
Russian and we'll go down to that
language selector and we'll change it
and we'll see what completely explodes
and what is okay and we just you know we
just use it quite a bit I think that's
what they're asking about scalability if
they were asking about scalability in
the sense of how do you support many
many many many many users that is also a
design consideration the size of the
thumbnails the amount of data we put on
a particular page you'll notice one of
the things on YouTube we don't actually
have avatars next to people's names
there's a couple reasons for that the
biggest one is spamming
there's spam issues people have used
those avatars the second issue is that's
a lot of page load you know when you're
serving up tons and tons of pages that's
kind of one of the things our thumbnails
on there on our right rail on top when
you watch youtube video they could be a
lot bigger we have mopped amides just
right so that we're not you know melting
through hundreds of thousands of servers
so those are two scalability things that
come to consideration to youtube great I
think from a researchers perspective
perspective when I heard the word
scalability I was more thinking about
our user types and the different types
of users that use our products so a lot
of research goes are into researching
the type of users that use whatever
product were investigating and so we do
a lot of fieldwork going out populated
users a lot of survey work finding out
the type of users as well and then we
really communicate those back to the
team in the exploratory research that we
do to make sure that all products scale
or any type of user this amazing anybody
can take advantage of the products that
we build cool okay here's a question
from Josh on google+ he asked what comes
first or what wins between back-end
technology the product and the UX Kelsey
maybe you can answer this hi Josh so
this is a really good question because
it gives me a chance to kind of explain
how ang and design work together and
that's one of the awesome things about
being kind of embedded in a team with a
bunch of Engineers is that you don't
have to have a winner you can always
butt heads as much as you want and no
one's gonna hate each other for it
that's kind of the fun of working coming
to work every day is that you can
discuss the limitations and the magical
things that certain people want to do
and whether or not it's possible and
hear all the reasons why and you can
really kind of take everyone's knowledge
and work together and at the end i think
the winner is a really good combination
of everyone's ideas and thoughts behind
stuff and you come out with the best
possible product great let's get to
another question and this is from the
fan you on google+ how does google test
UX with mobile apps I know you often use
AV testing
so maybe mark you can answer that yeah
you bet so we've had a huge number of
increase of mobile use for YouTube it
was interesting that just this past week
where South by we asked a crowd how many
folks in the last six hours watched a
video on their phone or tablet I mean
everyone in the audience was like gee
other people is crazy who's this is this
is kind of a front and center of what
we're exploring and in our UX research
folks are definitely spending a lot of
time you know watching how people use
video on their device how do they browse
it is it better to have thumbnails in a
grid in the list do they like to swipe I
ludus the dog fooding a little bit
earlier and so we dog you know we all
have our we hope we have iPhones inside
here we have android devices as we have
tablets iPads be of everything you can
imagine and at any given time you can
pick one of these up and see a random
bill from an engineer and just play and
that's and that's what we do and then we
eventually will release at all of google
internally just you know tens of
thousands of folks 20 I don't know what
their number is now it is 25,000 ish and
and Google errs are wonderful dog food
Earth's are very opinionated and so we
get it just a lot of feedback Cummings
broke we'll figure it out pretty quick
that's kind of how we do it it's not I
wish it was more scientific it's not
it's pretty messy you filled it we put
it on an iPhone we play with it we break
it we fix it we do do what we do it all
over again so I so that's well that's a
good answer I'd say we're actually out
of time and it looks like another
Googlers trying to steal your room mark
so little does he know he's hard and
hang out but it will get to the rest of
the questions hopefully on one of our
Google+ posts so for those of you who
asked questions thank you will get those
answered and send them out hopefully
sometime today thanks for tuning in and
again we'll be uploading this video to
our youtube channel youtube.com slash
