making an impact aqui
I'm from MIT and I'm studying Electrical
Engineering and computer science and I'm
working on a local search quality team
this summer
so the local search quality team we
fight spam on Google Maps and Google
Places you pretty much deal with any of
Google's geo products
so one of the amazing things about
Google is that you get to you get to
work with a small team and you have the
freedom to make decisions and to affect
the product however you want but still
you have the stability and the support
of a large company around you interns
here at Google we have a large impact on
our teams and just the overall
environment of Google because we bring
in a fresh pair of eyes looking at a
product looking at an idea and we bring
our own like ideas and concepts and we
can kind of critique other people like
their ideas and stuff like that and
provide a fresh outlook because when
you're working on a project for so long
or something like that you kind of get
focused and you stop thinking about like
other things from the outside world also
we energize the team as well we energize
the full-time workers and we pray of
like bringing that energy and like
hopefulness
so one of my projects here at Google was
some to create a training material in a
tutorial from one of the languages that
my team uses and originally it was
supposed to just be for my team but my
manager ended up telling um another team
about him and they adopted it into their
training material and then another one
of my teammates told another team and
then they adopted into their training
material and their stuff for future new
employees and it's kind of amazing
because not only it my project has gone
beyond just my team and now it's
affecting three different teams and then
every new employee that comes into those
teams so my impact is gonna last with
Google per for who knows how many years
Google has really impacted me in
something it's given me ideas and the
new point of view on everything that I
work on for the rest of my life in a
sense I've learned so much and like so
many different ideas to think about
whatever you're building or creating
anything as well as it's provided me
it's pushed me to my boundaries and
taking me out of my comfort zone made me
do new things which that's just new
things I never thought that I could do
and now I feel more confident and more
capable so it's been an amazing
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
