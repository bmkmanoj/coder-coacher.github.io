Middle East and Africa headquarters to
launch our inaugural career services so
much we've invited a number of
university career service professionals
and some of our diversity partners to
Google in Dublin for one day so much the
idea of the summit is to educate our
guests about different opportunities
internships competitions that we have
for their students they're gonna tour
the office explore the googly working
environment see how everything is in the
company we're also gonna go into details
such as the recruitment process at
Google CV writing skills interviewing
skills
we think you guys are developing
fantastic graduates that's why we're
delighted to be here with you today but
we think when you add that with the
melting pot that we're creating we're
going to create fantastic careers for
these guys
no surprise that everyone working here
at Google is having great fun enjoying
their jobs like no other office I've
ever been to
well I liked about Google is the
diversity the lot of nationalities who
work at Google's and what I also like
was that they hire people from different
backgrounds so you don't have to be an
engineer or specialist in business
I'm astounded I want to be ruler I want
to be a Googler I think for me the
highlight that stood out for the day was
hearing about the different university
programs because that's the information
that I need to take back to my students
at Carnegie Mellon and Qatar
the one thing that I'm going to take
back is that even though Google is such
a large company is still a very personal
experience for every single employee
that is something they should be really
proud of
it's the fact that Google really puts
time effort and energy into thinking
about their people the company we does
care about their dog Googlers and it
shows
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
