this notion the relatively small teams
can do great things in relatively short
spaces of time so typically we have
eight or ten engineers working for one
or two quarters with the expectation
they can build a product which will
change the world and we've done that in
kirkland with google video with google
talk with some of the ads works we've
done and when I look back over the last
couple of years I've been working at
Google it's just incredible to see what
is such a small number people being able
to accomplish some of the most
successful people I work at a Google
share a fairly small set of
characteristics they're all excited and
good at starting things the very very
smartly spent a lot of time thinking
about how to solve hard problems and
they're passionate about applying
technology to make the world a better
place the vase self-motivated the vase
self-starting they're not going to wait
around for somebody to tell them what to
do but they are coming to Google and
they're going to see this playground of
technology and I'm going to say I can
solve amazing problems here that I
couldn't solve them in any other company
at any other time my name is peter
wilson and i'm an engineering director
with google and seattle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
