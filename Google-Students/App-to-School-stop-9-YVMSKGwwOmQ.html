Notre Dame home of the fighting irish we
are proud to be partners with google and
providing the coolest app to our
students we'd like to roughen the google
bus to campus
you know being in school I get a lot of
emails I like how you can organize
things into conversation and it makes
keeping them organized a lot easier
we feel that cell phone reception isn't
up to what it could be so we're going to
use the Google Forms to send out just a
quick brief survey so we can fix cell
phone reception on campus which is just
really simple to put together but you
can click add a question and right there
add the type of question you want gives
you multiple choice of checkboxes and we
can ask you know five six questions the
students and send it out to everybody
because they all particle apps so we're
really loving this
gtalk has been wonderful I have a
research question and I see one of my
colleagues is online it takes three
seconds just I am them and say hey do
you have this book where can I find it
I like creating different calendars cuz
they're me multi-colored and
color-coordinated I do different sports
subscriptions so I know when the
football games are soccer games baseball
game so I don't miss out on that and I
like how you can choose different time
slots how you can repeat an event on a
tuesday and thursday or monday wednesday
friday because that's how school
schedules are set up and i use my
calendar through my phone and its really
useful because i get an alarm that's
about 10 minutes out for my back telling
me what i need to do next
hi my name is Paul a work with the
university programs team at Google as
you can see today we're here at Notre
Dame talking to students about how they
use gmail and docs and calendar in their
everyday life so now it's your turn we'd
love to hear from you so upload your
stories today go Irish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
