happened have been you know around
solving organizational problems right
because what amazes me here is that
social problems or organizational
problems we just get together talk about
it and we just change it if the some
part of our processes aren't working if
if people think the process is too heavy
right revving to fill out too many forms
we just get rid of the forms um if we're
not filling out enough forms we write
some forms that that's what really
amazes me is not the technical
maneuverability it's it's getting people
to change their ways that that can be
really hard but we just were not afraid
of doing it we had many of our users
switch over from using more traditional
email clients to a gmail and you know
that's a big change for a lot of people
in how they do their lives and you know
we just did it and that amazes me is
someone in IT right in a normal shop
it's really hard to get the users to
change their habits but at Google if
there's something we want to change you
know we just do it my name is Alan
