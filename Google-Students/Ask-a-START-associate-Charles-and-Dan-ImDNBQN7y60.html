and Dan are here to answer questions
that you posted on to the Google
moderator page about the Google stern
program so my name is Charles I went to
Howard University in Washington DC from
a little town and alcohol blog called
lawton oklahoma if you can have a bit
don't feel bad nobody ever has I was the
con major I just graduated in 2009 and
I'm Dan to Brown University in
providence rhode island i studied
economics and psychology and i'm
originally from Washington DC and we're
going to take her questions now from MJ
Bach and Washington State we have this
question what positions within the Start
program are you participating in so
during the introductory part of the
Start program ice opened in both worked
on the job analysis project which is
basically focused on improving Google's
job liners and clarifying what everyone
around the company does so now I'm my
first rotation in a strong program which
is PTO which stands for people
technology and operations so we're now
move on to our second question which is
from Julian Chicago describe a typical
day in the light of a star associate the
typical day for the life of the start
associate is much like a typical day for
any other Google employee everybody in
the Start program is put on a project
with a team on the teams can be an IT
department they can range from as well
as for people to as big as our team on
job analysis was close to 30 people um
there's a few minor differences between
what starters do and all other Googlers
do in that we have a core base a network
of fellow starters that we can rely on
that we can meet with that we can have
lunch with and there's also training
component to the Start program so
there's trainings and classes a couple
times a week that we attend so let's
move on to our third question from
Sondra and Rhode Island what has been
the highlight of your experience thus
far as an associate in the Start program
so i guess the current highlighted my
experience is being able to create a
financial literacy workshop for all the
members of the Start program in creating
that that was something I just came up
with entirely out of the blue after game
1 one of Google senior executives speak
to the group so I was able to work again
with one of the Google senior executives
to put together that financial literacy
workshop and that's kind of Education of
booze willingness to allow its employees
to do things that are kind of outside
the box and do things that piqued their
interest because that wasn't part of my
core job in any way which is something
that I thought would be good so I was
able to put that together and kind of
deliver that content to all my peers
yeah the highlight for me was a i did a
culinary internship here we have a ton
of cafes where Googlers eat and I
decided to work in one of them for a day
instead of doing my core job on job
analysis so starting at eight in the
morning I prepared lunch for a few
hundred Googlers and made from
quesadillas made vegetable tempura which
I had never done before and was hard
work but it's a lot of fun definitely a
highlight of my time here so far let's
move on to this question from Laura in
Italy who you guys graduated in
humanities are there any opportunities
at all for those who have graduated who
have a degree in that field so I
actually graduated with a degree in
accounting so I didn't graduate in
humanities but there are telling people
across the company did well I studied
economics and psychology um but I know
people here who've studied English
you've studied history um and there's no
really prerequisite in terms of the type
of major you need to have a job you need
to get a job at Google you can really
study anything
looking for people who are passionate
who are leaders like to work in teams
and nuts and and I don't think the
company cares that much about what you
actually studied in school as long as
you apply yourself so now we're trying
next question which is from Jun K and
use ill how can I have an internship at
Google there's one big internship that a
lot of college kids apply to called bold
I know in our start class there's a
handful I probably got a third of our
start class came from this bold
internship um but a lot of us including
Charles in and myself did not there's a
ruckus going on outside did not did not
come from this internship I dunno yet
any other internships yeah there are
technical internship programs as well so
for people who are studying computer
science or engineering there are
internship programs outside of the bulb
program for interested in going into
engineering position at Google but the
vast was will some of them some people
come to Google come to the bulk program
for the non-technical aspects but there
are time of internship program so
technical and non-technical for future
potential burglars okay why don't we go
to this last question from Brandon in
Texas what is the best advice that you
have to get accepted into the Start
program so one of the important things
if you're trying to get accepted into
more really in any company at all is to
make sure you try to focus on your
leadership abilities and things that
you've done kind of outside the box
during your educational experience focus
on things that you're really passionate
about and kind of really show your
personality to the people were
interviewing you into the company that
you want to get into yeah I've noticed
Justin Morgan here for a few months that
almost everybody i work with takes
initiative and what they do they find
things are passionate about um and they
and they work hard to see results and
make results happen and they're not
they're not nobody here is really
passive um so I think when you're
applying you should look over the last
few years in college and think about
what have you done to take a leadership
role to make something happen
make change happen either at at school
outside of school during your summers
and I think that's going to help you
stand out when you're applying so before
we go there a couple of sites that would
let it make sure to mention to you if
you wonder apply for the Start program
go to google.com / students and this is
where you can learn about to start
program for recent grads bold
internships for undergrads or
scholarships and other opportunities if
