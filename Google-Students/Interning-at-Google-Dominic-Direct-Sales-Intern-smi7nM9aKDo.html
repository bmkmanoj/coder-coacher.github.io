end of my internship at Google I'm from
Oxford University our study history at
them for the last ten to almost ten
weeks I've been working at the DSA it's
direct sales organization particularly
the retail vertical so that's been my
area sort of expertise at the last month
or two months Google as a company it's
quite surprising because you know before
you come here you associate it with the
tech side but when you get into the
opportunites so much more that on my
first day I was assigned a body which is
essentially a mentor someone who guides
you through it and they make you feel so
welcome you took me round the entire
team introduced me to everyone let me
know how to sort of question our
obsession and really get to grips with
what goes on in the organization over
the last you know two months I've been
involved in sort of client meetings I've
and it gives you a real sense of purpose
about your work you know they allow you
to public projects is through from the
very beginning to the very end I've
constructed on you know PowerPoint
presentations for clients from hmb to
ebay I mean allowed to sit on the
meetings themselves I've also been
allowed to present my ideas to people
hill high up in the organization at I
feel with it gives your sense of
achievement when you realize that what
you're doing contributes to the movement
as a whole I also feel that like Google
over the last two months has really
helped me too i'm sort of structure my
skills they provide these excellent
things called lunch and learns where
you're going you grab your lunch from
the canteen and you go along and
everybody's sitting around like a video
conferencing and I'll have someone is an
expert in a field for example excel
training or arm you know this particular
the business you need to learn about so
not only a um you know develop
developing your original scores but
you're learning new things all the time
they've also got spun side of it like
it's amazing bass were like currently
I'm in Zurich you know how many interns
get to go to Zurich we've had all some
days out we've gone to the London Eye
gone to the comedy club in London as
well but it's just a really really cool
place to work and the food's amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
