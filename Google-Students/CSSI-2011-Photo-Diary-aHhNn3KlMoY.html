attending Portland State University in
the fall
I'm Jonathan Moore off and next year
I'll be attending the University of
Michigan hello I'm Julia hosu and I'll
be attending Rice University in the fall
my name is Vanessa and Romero and I'm
going to the University of Texas at
Austin this year my name is Renata and
I'm going to the University of Waterloo
hi I'm Kathleen and I'll be attending
the University of Waterloo in the fall
hi my name's G I'm going to the
University of Southern California CSSI
is a summer program at Google where we
get to spend three weeks learning about
like how to program and then use our new
skills during the last week we work on
this on a group project that uses all
the skills that we've learned over the
past two weeks and then at the end we
present we did a Python program we did a
tional CSS we also did App Inventor for
Android and we created our own websites
that was pretty fun as well now I know
Python I know lots of other random
things with HTML and CSS we learn
different languages that we haven't seen
before and the instructors taught us
different ways we can use those tools
and the applications that we use
every day we had panels of on careers at
Google and an industry one of the best
panels are CSS I staff have prepared for
us was filled with engineers and
managers from Google they really gave us
a lot of really useful tips and advice
for going to college and for on if we
should like to apply or interview a
technical job in the future and those
two musical the panels are my favorite
part from them I learned a lot of things
especially what Google is looking for
when they interview you and the
technical questions aspect I've noticed
that we've had a very diverse group for
this session being at CSSI being a
female is diversity in itself because
not many females are in the industry to
begin with so seeing the fact that there
were 20 females and I'm males was kind
of a really big deal I'd everyone
launches the programming bit but working
with people you learn so much more by
listening to people and listening to
people with different backgrounds I
definitely feel like I know more about
computer science than I did before CSSI
so I came into CSSI with basically no
background in computer science and I
came out with a great feeling of how I
have to think as a computer science
engineer the progress that I made in
three weeks was incredible I never knew
that computer sciences could be this
interesting on this one it definitely
reinforced my interest in computer
science and I definitely want to major
in it when I came here and I started
learning about all this programming and
I started actually being really good at
it
what kind of changing my mind into going
back into computer science I wanted to
change my major after I got here
actually three days after us I don't
want to change my major
everyone is so willing to help they're
willing to share whatever they know and
take you to the next step in your
programming I had done programming
before CSSI but I've hadn't had the
experience of learning how to learn a
new programming language learning how to
teach myself and so that's what CSS I
really did for me
CSS I has inspired me to learn more on
my own about computer science of
different ways you can use it in your
programs I'm really happy that I got to
be only people that share common
interests and I hope that in the fall
I'll be able to meet more people like
this and that CSS I will carry on to
break the stereotype of the design
students
this has been well through suicide this
has been like the most fun summer I've
had because I get to spend three weeks
learning how to program and so it was a
lot of fun
I really had a really really good
experience and I would recommend this to
anyone to apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
