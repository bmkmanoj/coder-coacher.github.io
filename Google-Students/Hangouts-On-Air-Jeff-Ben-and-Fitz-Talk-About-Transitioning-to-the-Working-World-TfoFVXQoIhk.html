hangout on the air my name is Jeff Moore
I'm a lead recruiter here at Google
working in our Cambridge office and
would like to introduce a couple of my
dear friends from Chicago benefits Ben
once you introduce yourself and then
we'll get going oh sure my name is ben
collins-sussman and as jeff monson Fitz
and I were the first couple of engineers
in the Chicago office and now we are
engineering managers in fact so it's a
lot of fun career growth yeah and Fitz
hi I'm Brian Fitzpatrick and I started
the office with Ben Oh got six and years
and change ago and I work on all sorts
of different things that Google started
Ben and I started an open-source and now
I'm doing data Liberation and free
speech and that sort of thing yes right
did Liberation Front it's my favorite
coffee cup
awesome well guys thank you in advance
for joining I really appreciate that I
have at home I love it there you go
seriously um thank you again for joining
the the topic today is sort of
transitioning to the workforce and sort
of like you know people that are
graduating from school what do you need
to do to get prepared for your first job
and and you know what I talked about in
the blog was some stuff that's like
super basic right like finish your
degree you got a job offer don't fill
out now bad idea right not cool you know
stop interviewing don't like accept the
job and then a few months later call
back so I'm actually taking this other
job just yeah not cool I actually could
list the people who have done that to me
in my career like 15 years ago I was
like right there it's just a bad bad
karma and then you know some of it is
little stuff like just sort of you know
mmm
be ready right like get your apartment
in order get your cable set up like when
you show up to work be ready to work
I'm have brushed up on whatever skills
you're going to need and you know be
ready to work but enjoy those last few
months of being a student and you know
would love to just sort of get you know
what you guys think are sort of a couple
of things that someone can do when
they're starting a new job especially on
the engineering front when you're
joining a new joining a new saw
our engineering team what can you do to
be ready Fitz I'll let you start
can't hear you Fitz I think you're
having technical difficulties I muted
myself I care about that yeah this whole
computer stuff is really confusing so I
think that there's a million things you
can prepare for and then there's a
million things you can't prepare for uh
but you know like like you said I think
finishing your degree is the most
important thing you know it'sit's the
analogy I always use is that if you
don't get a degree you know you just
closed a whole bunch of doors to
yourself and you know at Google it's
that's one of the really important
things that you have at least a
bachelor's degree but you know III I
think there's you have to be willing to
try a lot of different things sometimes
you get your dream job right out out of
the out of the you know gate and
sometimes you don't but you know in many
cases you're not going to get that brain
surgeon job right out of it out of
you're out of college or the perfect job
that you want I went through a whole
bunch of different jobs and tried a
whole bunch of different things before I
figured figure out what I wanted to do
you know I was I was three years out of
college before I forget what I wanted to
do with my life and and so you know I
tried a whole buncha different things I
figure out what I want to then I really
threw myself into it so I think you've
got to be willing to try different
things if you're not already into what
you want to do and you know and explore
different realize you're not committing
yourself to a life working at one
company right you know I mean you might
decide or go work at a big company
decide hey that's what I really want to
do you might decide that you want to
work at a smaller company there's a lot
of different things so I guess it's sort
of it's sort of high-level and vague and
it might seem obvious but those are the
most common mistakes I see with people
you know and so you know when you're
young is your chance to like take risks
I think it's it's a hard time nowadays
with jobs um but I think I think you
know you can do more things like let's
go for it just go do the startup let's
go work here oh let's go do this sort of
thing you know you but you got to work
you things to get experience absolutely
yeah well in my case I mean I agree part
of taking risks means trying lots of
different things and if you have the
bandwidth you can even try them
simultaneously when I when I was first
out of school I really was trying to
she's between two or three different
careers I was trying to do them all what
I'm just interesting but no no one hand
like I took a job is like I'm like an IT
you know for assistant and job because
that was like oh this is the sellable
skill I have on the other hand my buddy
and I were trying to write music and
sort of get into theater and like make a
living as composers for theater and that
meant a lot of moonlighting right which
is which I also I really considered a
second job didn't pay as well and there
was a long time where I'm sort of
balancing the two back and forth so this
is an example of you know just not not
being afraid to pursue what interests
you and be ready to experiment as it
says but under the hand that there was a
trick there don't want your employer to
think that you're not interested or that
you're not paying attention
so so it is an art form to whether
you're within the theater at night or at
the day job doing computers to make it
seem like that that employer is the only
person in the world you carry that
you've oh yeah totally dream now what
would you guys say you know what would
you think are you know sort of like
first week right new to a job you
showing up at the Chicago office so to
speak and you're you know you're gonna
come work on data liberation you know
like do you guys have you know some
first week you know obviously we sight
show up on time all these crazy things
some you know 101 but you know are there
sort of like quick tips on how someone
can show up and just like at the end of
the first week you'll be like yeah this
guy's gonna be great or this person's
gonna really do well there's stuff that
jumps off the page at you I would say
don't be shy
oh no this fits them you there yeah I
know I would
good I was gonna say one of the one of
the patterns I see when people first
start new jobs they're scared to ask for
what they need they're so afraid of
rocking the boat or they're feeling
overwhelmed about being a small fish in
the giant ocean and just like starting a
school or any other place therefore
actually tell their manager well this is
what I actually need right now and
sometimes that means I hey I need a
mentor someone who I can talk to maybe
is your manager maybe it's just a
co-worker you sit next to but someone
who officially expects you to ask
questions right a lot of people don't
get that and they need it the other
thing that I see is a lot of time in the
first week a company will be like
you know why don't you want you go
investigate this thing or go learn about
this thing and it's sort of a softball
it's like sort of like a oh he's new
here we'll give him something really
easy it turns out to almost be too easy
I find that even in the first couple of
weeks of the job you'll often see people
bored
wait they work even not enough to do you
know I don't have you seen it
wait it's also it also can be like
immensely frightening I mean I'll tell
you sir my first week at Google I was
out in Mountain View at the Home Office
right you know sort of going through my
noogler classes as they call him
learning about our infrastructure
learning how Google works and that sort
of thing and I was completely distracted
like I was like nervous out of my mind
I'm like oh my god everybody's gonna
figure out that I don't belong here I'm
some kind of fraud you know and I'm like
it was it was the scariest thing ever
and I was so I was so distracted that I
backed my rental car into a tow truck
and tore the bumper off of it I'm not
even kidding I like went to the rental
car place and I'm like bumpers in the
backseat can I have another one please
and so but but no but you're absolutely
right Ben it's you sort of have to don't
feel like you have to guard your way to
prove yourself I think that's sort of
like that's sort of the freshman like
syndrome right where you're like I'm
going to show you when I'm smart I am
but it's a no don't don't you don't to
ask people you want to find a balance
between like like sitting there and
spinning your wheels and asking at
people around you every question that
comes to your mind so there's two things
that you really need to sort of balance
I think but a lot of it comes down to
Sorina starting to put in a place these
the resourcefulness I think that you
typically got garner with being
comfortable and understanding a place
you you start to know if I need to know
this I can go look over here or that
sort of thing yeah you know it's funny
that you guys the shy thing I mean I
think at a place like Google right where
we really value like open collaboration
and discussion you know nothing is sort
of like figured out in the corner right
or in Ben's basement for example where
you know like you know we really you
know value that discussion to figure out
what the right thing to do and and
that's just sort of having your tail
tucked being shy thing on your first day
you know it's natural at the same time
you've got questions should definitely
speak up it's a pretty vital point yeah
um yeah absolutely and now we've got um
some other questions that have come
through
from our our our moderator page and one
of them you know I hit on a little bit
but I would love you guys is take just
about you know it's from AJ since I've
other I have job offers pending but I'm
still really interested in interviewing
with one particular company Google what
should I tell all the recruiters
involved I mean I certainly know how I
as a recruiter like to deal with that
but you know how do you guys feel us or
you know knowing that someone is you
know maybe joining your team or floating
around there I mean I guess you don't
want you don't turn something down and
you don't want it you want to keep all
your options open as long as you can
right so you want to keep as many
options as open as possible that in any
typically even any company will say you
know we want a response from you by this
date right
you can usually push a little bit and
flex that right and no Jeff doesn't
wanna hear this right but you can you if
you like look you know I really don't
know what's going on I really need a
couple more days or something like that
but if a company gives you a drop-dead
date they say look you don't accept this
offer by this day you know you're out of
here that's a really good indicator how
you're gonna be treated when you work at
that company and that's sort of I would
call that person I call it a little bit
of dirty pool and I don't like that sort
of thing so I wouldn't say that you
should you know if it turns out that
another company Google or otherwise is
dragging along you don't hear anything
for weeks or months you know you
certainly have to to make a decision and
I wouldn't you know carry that on
forever but you know remember that you
are if you're if you have different
companies trying to hire you you're a
good engineer and that these companies
are gonna want to hire you so don't just
you know give it all up just because
you're afraid of some company you know
saying no or whatever not if they've
already made you this offer push back up
as hard as you can then I agree
um there's a delicate balance about not
being not being a slimeball but also not
letting slimeball companies abused you
as Fitz was saying you don't wanna you
don't want to say yes when you don't
mean it you don't want on the other hand
there are some companies that really are
Graci which will which will manipulate
you I can think of for example I think
of a friend once who
she she was applying to a job and it was
it was for a professorship and usually
there's a very specific time cycle when
you know professors apply for jobs and
they get accepted just like when you're
applying for the universities and
there's one there was one particular
university that sort of had this sort of
slightly greasy way of like recruiting
people by by making people apply for
jobs and giving them answers much
earlier than every other university and
you know they accepted her but this
other university wanted her to and you
know it was very it was a delicate
situation right I was kind of like she
was sort of reading on University on but
sort of doing it the other and you know
you could say maybe there was a moral
justification there cuz the first
university was kind of cheating the game
by recruiting ahead expecting everyone
to commit before you know so sometimes
there are thrown in world situations
like that but but you know but it's
pretty obvious when a company is just
messing with you right and you don't
want to be sent yeah no I I mean I agree
and I I think that you know like open
communication is the best thing
especially dealing with a recruiter
right like Tom what's going on I can try
and make things go faster I can make
things go slower I want you to make a
decision that makes you happy and has
you pumped to join I don't want you to
join just because you feel like I talked
you into it you know or that kind of
thing I'd much rather have people
joining their sites and so yeah I told
her yeah yes yeah and you know and don't
hesitate if you're you know I mean we've
worked with Jeff for four years now at
Google and just the kind of person who I
think you keep in touch with people a
lot more you reach out you're proactive
there's a certain company that I applied
to about six and a half years ago that
my recruiter was not very communicative
with me and I want up chasing him down a
bit you know and and I call them like
hey what's up and I'd email and that
sort of thing and so don't be afraid to
chase them down if you're not getting
quite what you need is a level of
communication now I just got a question
in guys that was asking this is actually
really relevant to the conversation
about you know sort of you know once
you're on board and you're sort of
joining a team know what's the what
kinds of things can you do to sort of
you know effectively you know join and
work in like a new group of software
engineers go for a lot of people that
come from academia it's a whole new
world right to work with a team of
engineers so
is there you know there are a few tips I
know you guys have got all kinds of
secret projects and stuff going on but
we'd love to know you know a few tips on
that front what do you say I mean with
least in computer science one of the
problems that Fitz and I have always
talked about is that while you you learn
to do your homework very well you don't
really learn to work on a team in most
universities you know you get very used
to just doing your assignments turning
them in you're done now I understand how
to do this kind of programming or what I
and you get to a real environment with
with a team and you're expected to know
how to use all these tools like bug
trackers and version control systems and
how to collaborate how to do code
reviews with other people I mean these
are things that they don't typically
teach University though I know there's
there's a bit of a skew sort of going
that way now where you know sometimes a
lot of senior projects where you're you
have to collaborate with people but at
least I think that's the most valuable
skill you can pick up if possible and if
your university doesn't offer any kind
of an environment where you're forced to
collaborate with people and use
collaborative tools you can do it
yourself just by participating in an
open-source project for example right
it's it's sort of a free internship
that's how we always talk about it you
wanna fit you wanna elaborate no I mean
I strongly agree I think I think finding
opportunities to really gain experience
work with other people is is key because
usually when your first job out of
college is is when you start learning
that how to work with the people and a
lot of I think your your take on how you
want to work that people is going to
come from that first job and so you know
I mean a lot of it does come from and
been in my case was from not working in
the open source world that's where I I
really started to learn most of my
actual writing software engineering it
was in the open source world and this
was this this model where you just sort
of the way that I got involved in a
project was I came in and I just sort of
heard watching the conversation going on
that sort of thing and I started picking
off things to do that nobody else wanted
to do right I would go through read
tourist code and I find document fixes
and I'd start fixing little bugs and
documentation and that sort of thing and
then I would go through and I'd find
tasks that nobody wanted to do like
really great stuff and I picked those up
and do those right and they were you
know they want anything spectacular
but everyone was really thankful they're
like wow this is great this guy is like
coming in and you know you're not you're
not just gonna come and try and pick the
sweet tasks that everybody wants to work
on and so that's one way of sort of of
you know getting into the groove with a
team I think I think one of the most
challenging things of working with any
sort of team of people is is meshing its
are like the transmission you know and
you see it's it's a problem or some
people they sort of grind the gears
because they can't quite get the vibe of
their new team and finding a way to sort
of you know get into that quickly as a
is a good way to do it I think it goes
for anybody whether you're an engineer
or manager as well jump in find some
grungy tasks and hop on those and you
know not only will people be glad to
help you
I get those done but they'll be thankful
that you you got those done as well I
was gonna say at the same time you need
to be careful not to do the the hero
thing which I think Vince mentioned
before you know that I am gonna show
everybody how awesome I am and you go
off and you try to engineer some
gigantic solution to a tiny problem
right right it's sort of like you know
have some humility and don't try to
solve everything yourself you know like
assume you're still in a state of
learning right and your job is to
contribute while learning not to show
off how you can do everything themselves
yeah I think it's pretty easy at Google
because I mean I came here assuming that
I wasn't fit to take out most people's
garbage you know I'm like okay so you
know there isn't any like posturing here
anything it's just like I got a ton of
stuff to learn there's a million super
smart people around here and let's get
cranking let's see what we can do and
you know it was it was great because I I
got to learn so much at the work with
all these great people we want to you
know ready some some great software and
so that's I think that's just like it's
incredibly it's pretty empowering but it
feels great to be able to pick that
stuff up I mean I think most most of the
engineers I know at Google are
constantly a state of learning like we
have Tech Talks and we have our citizens
meeting group every Friday we're a bunch
of us getting together in the room
levite of paper we discuss it you know
and like you don't do that if you don't
love you know engineering we had a
little it's a little bit of a talked
about this in my plus stream you know
cuz the video that you posted Jeff we
talked about a little bit about you know
if you really look for people who aren't
just working 9:00 to 5:00 we're not
he was at work 600 hours a week look
people who love what they do right and
the the that most of the people here
that we work with love engineering it's
a vocation it's not like a job and if if
it's just like you know a way to earn a
paycheck for you you're at a
disadvantage from the get-go really yeah
I think that passion right I mean that's
a lot of what we're talking about here
sort of lives back to like loving this
stuff and you don't have to love it 24/7
you know no but but really being into it
and well I would disagree with that I
would say okay you have to love it 24/7
you want to like it 24/7 or do but that
yeah that isn't this sort of litmus
tests often when I'm interviewing people
I'd say to myself you know if this
person were a billionaire and didn't
have to work at all for a living would
they still be fooling around on a
computer just for fun right would they
be programming or building things or
whatever like that agreeing that's the
kind of person you want to you want to
hire yeah totally agree everybody has
that bug at Google for sure yeah it's a
funny point but I mean I think about you
know helping people outside of work that
are trying to get a new job that you
know don't have a network and I like you
spent hours talking about networking
it's like god this is just what I like
to do it's kind of scary I guess but um
anyway I'll digress from that topic so
all right so show up be on time don't
feel out of school immerse yourself
communicate to the networking thing I'm
afraid so networking always always turn
me off right to sort of like let's go
schmooze with people and just like get
your name out and get a bunch of names
you can call answer for jobs I mean and
I think it does it has it affect him a
lot of engineers but if you look at it
from a different angle and you can call
it something different if you want but
look it from the point of view if you're
finding other people who are interested
in similar things and you're getting
other people in your field you know
other people that do that sort of thing
we do that a lot here in Chicago with
other engineers at other companies not
just who work here at Google is like
it's like oh my god you know let's go
talk to this guy Ben Ben's building some
like ham radio interface for his Arduino
for his Android phone or whatever not
and I'm like you know and I'm tinkering
over here doing this type of thing and
let's go over to
another company over there and talk to
those guys and see what they're doing in
their spirits linka
it's like having play dates instead of
but you know but you don't you ask your
mom that's real in business cards you're
just collaborating I mean and that's and
honestly you know stuff like working on
things like open source projects has an
effect of networking unintentionally
right you get in there because it's
fascinating or scratching an itch but
you end up meeting a bunch of engineers
who'd be sort of become virtual
co-workers and I have to say I have seen
a huge number of people recruited and
hired for jobs because of people they
knew through open source projects hey I
heard your company's hiring can I apply
over there oh yeah sure we've been
working together for months now let me
let me get you a recruiter you know like
so it's it's it it's very very useful
well I mean that was that was you you
recruited me to work I guess I was doing
I was working on open source stuff in my
spare time and you know and and we were
both recruited through somebody else to
come work at Google so let's yeah it's
sort of how it works it that that was
unknowingly unwittingly a form of
networking right you know yeah but
instead of sitting around smoothing you
know drinking water down drinks we were
all writing software
what's our like the dr. evil audio here
you know sorry it's like it's getting so
we got a few minutes left you know would
love to just sort of hear you know I
haven't talked to guys in ages I feels
like we just love to hear sort of what a
day in the life in Chicago is like that
just for people that you know have seen
you guys as videos and seen your source
work just to sort of get a vibe for you
know what's going on in Chicago what are
you guys doing
plus I want to know so it's totally
self-serving thank you my start sure
sure well that's interesting you know
both Fitz and I started out an open
source at Google working on Google Code
the project hosting service at Google
code and as we said earlier you know
over the years we sort of transitioned
from being engineers to being engineer
leaders to being engineering managers
and and now actually I'm actually
working on an advertising project we
have select at least seven projects now
in the Chicago office you know I'm
working on an enticing product which
which is very interesting I to be honest
I was a little bit
about a year ago when I started I was a
little tentative about switching because
I thought well you know open-source
that's what I've been doing forever I'm
really interested in tools and compilers
and things like that and you know do I
really want to go work on ads right it
sounds kind of dry alright I know it
makes money but and I be honest when I
when I got over it over to this new
project it was really it's the same
computer science problems over that you
deal with in any project right and it's
it's it's really really it's really fun
and I am now managing a whole team of
engineers were very motivated and very
excited to work with so uh I spend my
days basically figuring out what
everybody's working on it's sort of I
talk about it the analogy I give is like
there's a really big boat full of people
moving in a direction and my job every
day is to like talk to them all and then
like steer the wheel one inch to the
left and then see what the ramifications
are next to the next day right next year
we're gonna replace you with a shell
script exactly but essentially like we
know when I left on vacation for weekend
I came back I could tell the boat had
drifted off course a little bit it's
noticeable oh my god it's interesting
very interesting job but Fitz Fitz
you've got the you've got the very I
think the projects that at least are
much more interesting to talk about well
I do yeah I think politically-charged
I'm really yeah it's really excited
about the stuff in doing so that we
started the data Liberation Front here
in Chicago you know back in 2007 there's
our awesome logo at data Liberation org
we make great coffee mugs we also have
bottle openers Jeff I see one of these
bottle oh yeah and some I wallet exactly
where it belongs because it's super thin
so we uh we started basically working to
make it easier for users to take the
data in and out of Google it's a way of
sort of you know shaking loose data
that's getting stuck in Google and other
companies although we're not working at
the companies I think by leading by
example we're starting to see people
follow and it's a way of keeping
ourselves on the ball I'd say so how do
we keep you well we keep you by
innovating and making our products
better not by you know artificially
locking your data in so that's been
really exciting and last year when
Google+ launched we launched a Google
takeout which you can use to download
which at the time you've used to
download all of your social stuff so
that include all oded all of your
circles and your contacting your photos
and all that sort of stuff and then
we've continued to add things to we
added plus ones to it of sites at U plus
one and we've added Google Voice to it
and we've been working really hard to
get some other stuff in and I we can't
talk about what's coming in the future
but you know keep your eyes peeled and
about a year ago I started another team
called the transparency engineering team
that had actually started through some
20% engineers and these guys these 20
percent guys basically we're really
passionate about free speech and freedom
of expression on the web and so they
took a whole bunch of Google traffic
data on a per country basis and
published it to show when companies
countries are doing bad things like you
know shutting off the Internet in Egypt
for example so I formed a full-time
engineering team around that we improve
these products so these traffic graphs
which you can see at google.com slash
transparency report not one word or just
use your favorite search engine search
for transparency report and we we had
these graphs and we there were 35 hours
delayed for for technical reasons that
we were making sure everything was just
in a row and so we worked these team
worked really hard not me that the
engineers did to make that get that down
to an hour and then down to 10 minutes
so it's almost real-time whereas if you
go and look at this so if some country
shuts off the web on the internet or
something or any one of our products
you'll be able to go there and those
graphs and see it really quickly so
that's been really exciting yes and then
we have the government request site
which shows when governments ask for
data about our users and also shows when
government's asked us to take data at
down so and that's actually been
affecting change like members of
parliament in various countries in the
UK in India and other places have used
this as an example of why they need to
be more transparent why they need to do
a better job when trying to be more
careful in trying to get data from
companies so you know I really think
that you know we're a small team of
engineers are under a dozen engineers
but we were I think we're changing the
world over here and it's like it's super
exciting so I do what a lot of what I do
I do a little bit of steering the ship
but these guys are all in little
speedboats and they're like they don't
write where they're going I do a lot of
a lot of talking on the company because
we're integrating with we're dealing
with all of Google product goals
products so it's a particularly tricky
to
I think and I go around the world and
talk to a lot of governments and folks
about what we do and sort of explain why
we do it you know we do this stuff not
because we're nice although you know the
three of us at least are nice we're
there now we do it because it's good for
our business and so that's a pretty
awesome place to be
it's fantastic yeah it's like I love to
take out stuff as a recruiter that I can
follow my stuff out shameless shameless
shameless but I love it it can take it
all it's just awesome it's all about
trust that's right it's great so we're
we're just about at you know an end of
our time together or at least live oh
come on we can talk for as long as you
guys want um but wait oh not you leaving
unless unless you unless you write
unless you know for some reason I get
shut off but um just sort of wrapping up
with you guys wanted to just sort of you
know if you could say three things to
people joining your team joining the
workforce sort of you know what do you
got that I'm gonna put you in the spot
cuz you'll think you're thinking really
yeah three things what's the question
say three things three quick quick
darlings of people joining a choice talk
three quick tips for people that are you
know transitioning from school to to the
team be ready to learn be ready to work
in a team and be ready to show people
you care yeah I'm gonna set it Ben took
all three of mine I'm kidding I'm gonna
say I'm gonna say that one of the
trickiest things to do is an engineer is
to respect people who are good at their
jobs when it's not an engineering job
and that's what Google has taught me
more than anything else we have sales
people here that are brilliant sales
people we have we have recruiters here
who are amazing recruiters you know and
just just the artists in PR and
marketing you're just really good at
their jobs and they're just really good
people like here's one of the things
that blew me away
legal-like guys I work with legal teams
here are just amazing they blow my mind
they're sauce to give lawyers a good
name they really do so that's that's
probably the most important thing I'd
say that counts for two really tips the
the other one is is
I would say is just yet totally keep
learning I know it's really hard to be
put on the spot three tips don't do what
I do you know I would say I'm not gonna
say don't settle do you know but don't
stop looking right so you know go for a
job give it your best see how it goes
and if it's not what you want keep
looking for something else but don't
just sit around expect someone to show
up when they give you your dream job you
know you got to work for though the last
thing is and this is I think one of my
favorite things to say is remember that
you don't deserve any job okay I don't
think I deserve this job at all you have
to earn it I come in every day and I
earn the right to stand here or sit here
I've a sit-stand desk with with these
engineers around me because they're
freaking awesome not saying that just
because they're sitting around me so so
don't expect it don't don't think that
you deserve anything work for it because
you'll never you know you'll be
pleasantly surprised as opposed to
disappointed ya know I think those are
great points and I'll just rehash the
one that you guys both mentioned earlier
about you know be willing to roll up
your sleeves and do that dirty work you
know prove to everybody on the team that
you you can get something tough done you
know that you care about it I think yeah
really great points so like I said we're
just about done again for the 15th time
I want to thank you guys for joining
this is a recruiter tips and tricks
hangout on the air live with benefits
from Chicago and again totally
appreciate you guys coming on and
hopefully we can get you on again to
talk about your secret projects that
hopefully you guys will have done soon
I'm totally hit beating around the bush
if you can talk about what you're
working on with the book yeah talk about
it that's not secret yeah like if I go
on I wanna know what is the reindeer
button on my screen do I've never done a
hangout on air before I'll do it okay
what there's a reindeer button and I'm
really confused if I can you know
there's a reason okay used to be a
moustache button it went away look
confused on my headset
oh my maybe
in Heerlen ratios this is this is quite
um we intimated okay alright now this he
turned at us screwing around on
variously very seriously so thought fits
and I have been speaking at conferences
for five or six years now talk about the
lab coat that's right the lab goes
Google nice lab coat yeah I just stole
mine from an engineer that one one we
started we originally started going to
open-source conferences and Python
conferences and things and eventually
Google i/o and we sort of thought the
will be interesting to give talks that
weren't necessarily technical but more
about social issues right you know yeah
you know if they started as comedic
talks like you know how not to run a
community right or you know how not to
use subversion like and then it mainly
became like how do you protect your
project from from jerks right and what
would essentially happen as we started
getting bigger and bigger crowds because
people all had the same sort of issues
and working in a team so it sort of
tended to like benefits his yearly group
therapy talk right but but it was a lot
of funny true to the next one we'd come
back every or the new you know a new
talk about some kind of social issues
around around collaborative team
programming and eventually our editor it
O'Reilly said hey you know who we worked
with before I'm subversion book other
things she's like look you know you've
got all these talks this this could be a
new book by God right
you know we should write you know write
these these ideas down into a book about
how to how to collaborate on a team how
do these well we haven't quite chosen a
name for the book yet but it's going to
be about software as a team sport
essentially I mean you spend all this
time in university learning about
software engineering and computer
science and there's there are no classes
on how to work with other human beings
you know I've talked to a million
professors about this and the response
is always the same oh sure we do group
projects I'm like you mean the projects
where you assign something to two people
and one of them does all the work and
the other one does nothing you know that
sounds like a great learning experience
that's that's that's an experience of
patience and how to not like you just
say you didn't do anything
you didn't do anything etc so you know
this is sort of a sort of codifying a
lot of that
telling it through stories and anecdotes
the things that we've done and we've
seen so I think it's a I think it's a
real challenge I think it's one of the
most important things we've met tons of
I would say tons we've met a number of
brilliant engineers they just can't
interface with humans like give him a
compiler they can hang out all day long
you human being and they're just utterly
lost I think that's that's probably the
piece of wisdom that we're trying to
communicate most of all is that to be
successful in software engineering it's
not just about knowing the latest
programming language with the latest
tool it really is about learning to
collaborate which which is a skill you
have to learn but it's not something you
should do poo or look down upon I just
assume you'll figure it out you know in
your first two months and I think people
see like famous engineers or famously
people run famous projects or something
like that they like they use them as
role models but like the people that are
I think are most amazing like here at
Google are engineers who are who are
leaders and who are not only brilliant
engineers but they have the knack forget
for bringing people to consensus okay
it's not just like I'm going to order
all you guys to do this because you work
for me or whatever not it's okay I got
this idea I got this vision for this
product and we're gonna do this and
let's get it done and people buy into
that so it's it's there's a lot of
persuasion going on there's a lot of
these sort of you know tricky soft
skills that you know because people are
so improved people are basically a giant
collection of intermittent bugs which
makes most engineers are lazy right as
you walk into one day you tell you a
compiler hi and your compiler always say
hi back right you know you walk in to
the person that can you say hi they'll
so hi one day next day they're like hi
cuz they had a bad night or you know the
description or that you or throw
something I or whatever you know so that
then unpredictability can be very
frustrating especially when you're
looking for that sort of lockstep logic
that you're used to dealing with you
know technology those are all I mean
it's so true right I mean we all work
with a lot of people every day right
it's sort of part of the deal so yeah so
so we gotta finish writing this book at
some point which would be awesome very
close very close we're almost there and
and then we're hopefully having out this
summer I think awesome well hopefully
you know once you guys are alive he can
come back and we can do another one of
these gong shows it would be a lot of
fun to the challenge guys and we'll be
gone here actually I could go get a gun
I'm waiting for someone
turn off the internet and Jeff's office
may have already done that just lean on
the train we're in our own private
little internet right now and everyone
else is gone there's no way to really
tell well thank you Jeff it's me attic
thanks for coming guys your solution it
okay I gotta get to Chicago this summer
oh yeah come on taste of Chicago or
something or JetBlue's faster faster
it's not so pretty right now it's a
little cold right now
it's six inches of snow coming tomorrow
hang in there awesome all right guys
thanks again cheers guys later
is it over I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
