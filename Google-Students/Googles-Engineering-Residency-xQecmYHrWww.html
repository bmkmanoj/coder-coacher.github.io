part of the first eight weeks of end res
with how to be an engineer at Google
Google's Engineering residency program
is for recent undergraduates that have
degrees in computer science and it
provides a great transition for them as
they go from their undergraduate career
to their first job in software
engineering and industry I was pretty
nervous you know what it meant to be a
software engineer in an actual company
and in the real work force and and just
really helped me with that because they
give you the opportunity to learn the
skills you need to be a real engineer
working in a big corporation without the
pressure of being a brand new employee
there are several things that recent
undergraduates have to learn really
quickly on the job here that most
computer science programs don't teach
these are things like code reviews and
unit testing and really the whole
engineering works well and this is
really what we focus on in that first
few weeks of training the program is up
to a year long and the residents been
there first several weeks in training
and that's followed by project rotations
where they are embedded in engineering
teams working side-by-side with Google
engineers on real-world projects one of
the things I was most excited about was
the ability to work on multiple product
areas and multiple teams within Google
when we got our first rotation
assignments everyone was so excited and
was looking at projects and turning
around and asking everyone else what
they were working on and just the energy
and a community in the excitement was
really awesome something that I won't
forget the people who were excited to
bring into this program are people who
are passionate about computer science
and engineering and excited to start
their engineering careers at Google
there are people from totally different
walks of life from all over the world I
feel like my life has been enriched just
sharing all these experiences with other
people from the program before coming to
Google I didn't know what a typical
engineer looked like and I was very
afraid that maybe I wasn't a typical
engineer I think coming here I've kind
of realized that there is no typical
engineer Google is a place that you can
be yourself it feels amazing to be part
of Google I feel like I am working on
really important things that impact a
lot
and I'm growing a lot in the process
it's Google investing in you to teach
you as much as they can in the shortest
period of time and to give you the
connections with your fellow residents
and with other mentors throughout the
company so that you really feel
connected and part of the Google
community and ready to contribute as
soon as possible after you graduate out
of this program I'm going to have 50
best friends on 50 different teams here
and I think that's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
