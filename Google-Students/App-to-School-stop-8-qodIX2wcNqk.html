I'm really excited to be here today at
Indiana University the state where I was
born and raised we're here today to
listen in on how students at Indiana are
using google apps so let's go take a
look and listen in
my entire class of over 3,000 people are
currently using Google Docs to create a
big document so we could present it to a
company in one of our business classes
and the documents over like 12 pages and
it's basically a giant collaboration
tool that the entire class is able to
use and collaborate to make one huge
wonderful document written by the entire
class of over 3,000 kids
we have approximately seven studies that
are ongoing with a functional MRI and
it's really hard to keep track of who's
doing what and who has scanner hours
when so we do is we use G Cal to keep
organized you can see I'm a chart here
for example the kid studies and the
studies i'm on the memory studies in the
novel object studies are going to google
calendar and then the confirmation email
is sent to my boss like a worker john
can check it on his PDA and i can check
it on my iphone on the go
and then when you do the talk quite
frequently for our club meetings when it
gets a little bit too cold in the winter
we usually have like online chats to
actually collaborate
but now we want to hear from you so go
ahead and upload your story and tell us
how you use google apps for your school
