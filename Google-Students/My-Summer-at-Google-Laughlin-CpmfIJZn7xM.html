I've made an impact approval i'm a
senior mechanical engineer and
environmental studies double major at
Santa Clara University in California I
was born and raised in Santa Fe New
Mexico
so I'm working on the street view team
and those are that's the team that's
responsible for the cars that drive
around and take the street view images
that people use for google street view
that's a while ago there was an article
that came out online about workshops
that Googlers have available to them and
they're these workshops where people on
their own free time ideally not work
hours can go in and build their own
projects mechanical stuff electronic
stuff when I realized that that was the
kind of culture that Google was trying
to harness and to cultivate that blew me
away saying that you want to try and
bring out the entire engineer or
scientist or tinkerer embed garage
inventor and somebody to me really
demonstrates the values that this that
this company has even if there's some
half-baked idea this that's got the hot
water to some degree Google was the
company that doesn't hesitate to try and
act on those
it's got the resources and the expertise
to say we think this is kind of a good
idea and it seems kind of far out there
but they're willing to take those risks
and it's exactly that willingness that
has gotten as far as it has today so
it's that culture of not being afraid to
try anything and not being afraid of
failure
I'd like to impact the project that I'm
working on not just from a technical I
helped build this kind of thing but also
from a teamwork and creative
brainstorming and process wait because
it's not all just about the end product
and once you get out of it but to a
certain extent it is about how you got
there I'm certainly going to take away
from this internship a lot of the
culture of risk-taking and not being
afraid to stick my neck out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
