Google students page on Google+
hopefully you are turning in to hear
about Summer of Code I'm joined today by
Chris DiBona and cattleman who work on
our open source programs team and they
manage the google Summer of Code program
so I'm going to let them introduce
themselves and then we'll get right into
what the program is all about and answer
some of the questions that you all
submitted yeah
hi I'm cattleman I work with Chris at
Google's open source programs office and
I'm delighted to work alongside Carol
Smith on google Summer of Code yeah I am
Chris I look after open sources what
does anyone does look after at Google I
do it and part of that is our outreach
team which is what Cal eats and where
Carol works on the Summer of Code and
this is one of the marquee programs of
our group so that's something we're
really excited about great we're excited
to have you guys here today and I think
a lot of students want to know a lot
more about Summer of Code so hopefully
we can answer their questions and get
some more students excited and ready to
apply so let's just start things off how
about you guys give a little bit of a
background Chris I heard there's sort of
a funny story about how Summer of Code
started so why don't you tell us a
little bit about that well it's funny to
be right so what happened also find it
funny too so when we first launched
code.google.com in the dusty the annals
of history in 2004-2005 you know we had
a couple of things on there we had what
was the very beginning of our developer
relations efforts as a company and we
also had our open source information for
our products and the rest so it's sort
of a compliance legal thing that we did
and so the way this was launched so this
is a long time ago at Google so it was
launched after like one meeting and and
Larry came up to me after the meeting
he's like listen I want you to fix
something for me I'm like oh sure what
do you say Oh grand queso boss and he's
like so there are students in computer
science school who over the summer
aren't programming and I think you
should fix that
ready go go take care of that and I'm
like oh okay
and he sort of mentioned a number of
money-wise that we could go with and he
said just go do that I'm like okay so I
came back a couple weeks later I was
like well you know I'm inherently lazy
so I really want my friends in open
source to do this so I called up folks
like Miguel de Icaza and some other
folks I said hey what if I gave you
students what what would you do with
them and we we sort of sketched out what
the program would look like and we came
up with a similar code and that was what
eight years ago now can I mean oh yeah
we're coming up on our eighth year yeah
so it started off with 200 which is then
in when we saw the demand for it
increase to 400 students that first year
and then over time we've grown the
program and now we have heard around
1,100 1,200 students a year taking part
awesome and it's not how the outreach
team started or was outreach team
already doing other stuff with open
source well I was sort of the outreach
team but I was also developer relations
and I was code that cool.com me and nine
so it was just us and now we have like
hundreds of people on developer
relations and I don't want that or
anything that's all under Vic yeah but
yeah that was the beginning of our
outreach I guess you know we had made a
couple donations before then that was
about it
sorry and so so for the students who
don't know too much about the program do
you want to just give sort of a high
level overview of how the program works
and since we not only want to program
your closer you know wheels on the
ground on the side sure
google Summer of Code how does it work
basically Google chooses well open
source projects apply to the program we
choose a subset of those based on a
variety of criteria the most important
of which being how do they plan to
interact with the students do they have
a solid community a respectful community
are they doing interesting work
do they have mentors lined up to do
one-to-one mentoring for the students
once the orgs are selected then the
students around the world have the
opportunity to look at the projects and
the ideas list and consider where they
want to apply and what they want to work
then they apply and the orgs choose the
students based on the number of slots
that we're able to give them then coding
commences and students work with their
mentors all online and have a great
summer and come up with great code
sounds awesome and you know and they get
paid for it too
I was gonna say there's not to be a perk
to not on the student side as well as
getting this experience knowledge
knowledge and actually I mean from a
reference standpoint it's pretty
fantastic I've heard from other
companies saying yeah if we see Summer
of Code in the resume and there then
they passed as a student that's amazing
for us but I know there's there's the
t-shirt - yeah the t-shirt from last
year is on the wall behind me I don't
know if you can see that oh yeah I think
the t-shirt sells it for most students
and that wasn't planned I was just
hanging it's an emergency fire t-shirt
in case yeah crafts me and needs a extra
shirt hey they get great experience
working on open source and what become
one of the companies getting out of this
they just get a summer intern well so
they get paid if they succeed so there
there are three payments one is if
they're exception of the program the
second one comes midterm and that means
that their mentor thinks they're doing
you know they've done about half the
work or whatever or they've met the
mentors expectations up to that point
and there's a final payment as well so
it's five hundred twenty-five hundred
and twenty five hundred is it now thank
you 15 20 50 - 50 - 522 15 2250 so 5,000
total for the student and the Metro gets
a stipend well the mentoring
organization gets a stipend per student
yeah and that happens whether they pass
or fail we see about 15% of the students
fail each year one five one but when you
do that it's 51 yeah one five and I can
write it down if it'll be just over 14
just below 16 okay clear not fourteen
sixty anyway so the point is that it's
very much a merit-based program this is
not just like hey congratulations you've
been accepted and here's your money and
so it's it's pretty remarkable and I
mean we choose orgs based on their
ability to help students and mentors
excuse me the Mentors
what am I trying to say I'm trying to
say we try and set people up to succeed
mm-hmm so while we do fail people we
also do our darndest along with the orgs
to make sure that people have a useful
productive fun summer learning stuff
yeah exactly yeah so for instance if you
look at one of the requirements of the
program one of the requirements is not
that their code ends up in the project
because sometimes you know student code
is is good but hard integrate maybe it's
not quite right maybe it's a plugin that
doesn't go as part of the main code base
so we see about 1/3 to 40% of the code
get accepted and then ship let's say an
Apache web server shipped with a
language and that sort of thing and
these projects you know we have all
kinds of projects too we have everything
from games to systems libraries to
operating systems to kernels I mean you
name it we've got and so what when you
said 15% failed what is the evaluation
process look like for a student who's
participating so at that at that so
obviously there's the bar of getting in
right so they have to show that they can
do this work to the satisfaction of a
mentor right and usually that means they
fixed a bug in a project or they
otherwise interacted with the project in
such a way that shows they're the person
to execute on the idea they're
presenting as their project and then at
the midterm you know basically you know
in software you know estimating is kind
of hard sometimes but it's it's close
enough and remember it's we're only
talking about a month and some after the
beginning of the project and so the
mentor knows by then if they're
executing against the idea so they can
say oh you know they've done you know
about half the project or what I
consider behalf of the work for the
summer and then if that happens then we
pay them that extra you know that next
hit of cash and then and then again at
the end we say ok if they satisfy the
mentor to that level that's great and in
the event of disputes you know our
office we handle that we talk with the
student for Mentors because you know the
reality is in a program this large
you know Mentors you know we'll get
caught in a tsunami they'll get caught
up in some life event now we've had that
happen basically any any big disaster in
the summer that you've heard of we've
had to deal with and which what's
shocking to me is that we have yet to
have someone miss ed miss basically fail
because of a Katrina or tsunami there we
did give someone in a couple extra weeks
for getting cholera once and but but he
turned it in you know he'll point out
what is that yeah I know it's it's crazy
actually want to Kleck these in like a
document somewhere and then when
somebody that I complain so this is too
hard I'm like oh yeah this kid did okay
so maybe taking a step back to the
application process how does that work
for students who are interested in
getting matched up with one of these
organizations yeah um basically and I'm
probably going to harp on this the most
important thing I could say to a student
who wants to do this is read the
instructions we have actually written an
entire manual for students like a book a
book a whole book I realized telling
somebody to go read a book might be a
little intimidating but your chapter
headings it's really easy there's an FAQ
you can start with we have a mailing
list where you can get questions
answered we have an IRC channel where
people are on there 24/7 it's wacky how
they're going and the book is very
specific about things like how do I tell
if I'm good enough how do I pick an org
how do I write my application in terms
of how do you choose a project people
ask us that a lot I always tell them to
go back and think about what they're
interested in one thing about open
source in general is you have to be a
self-starter if you're looking for a
situation where people tell you exactly
what to do every step of the way this
isn't going to be a good fit for you
you're going to be frustrated the
mentors are going to be frustrated but
if you're the kind of person who's
interested in things and passionate
about things then pick one of your
interests and
go to the website let's see that would
be melange
- google.com just XRF code into google
yes
URLs there so 1988 I forget about this
search engine thing something think
about what you're passionate find an org
it's really easy to sort through the app
and by operating system by language by
general kind of topic area and then look
at their ideas list for the kind of
ideas that they'd like to see students
work on sometimes they're very generally
it would be nice if sometimes they're
very specific things that the
organization wants for the project and
pick something that interests you don't
apply to too many different orgs you can
apply more than once but quality is more
important than quantity and each org
usually has a list if not a form that
the student uses to apply so be specific
and follow the instructions yeah and the
FAQ on the website is a great place to
start I know it's so easy to say that
but yeah students who read these
documents they do well you know because
they all say that honestly there's no
real secret you know and how to be
accepted the Summer of Code if you can
program and you want to do it and you
read the FAQ and you read the parts of
the book that apply to you I mean it's
it's pretty straightforward if you can
execute you know so and you'll learn a
lot you know you'll get to work with
real projects on real problems that they
have real problems with their users have
and that's that's almost irreplaceable
experience because computer science
school you know they teach you theory
they teach you programming but they
don't teach you users you know and so
it's kind of its kind of remarkable
honestly you know in the ways that
open-source is remarkable and what are
the sort of background qualification so
you said someone obviously you know set
a program is there do they need
experience with open source or anything
specifically no I mean being a decent
program or sure does help but no
experience with another open source
project isn't required
you know what we see like I said the
Xuan's for these projects seem to be the
people who say oh I really want to be
someone code this year so I Neal fix the
bug and get used to how they code so
that they know who I am so the 100 that
that guy will or that guy you know will
accept them immediately you know so yeah
showing that you can do it yeah how you
get into the summer code yeah it sounds
like a lot of the students who had
success were engaging with these
organizations before yes applications
even opened that's right that's right
and all that information is there yeah
and they don't necessarily have to be
the best programmers one example was a
woman who did Summer of Code for Drupal
some years ago new to the project not a
lot of experience and backgrounds so she
designed a project that addressed a need
for the Drupal community but was at a
coding level that she could get her
teeth into and learn as she went and at
this point she's not only a committer
she's like on the managing board of the
project and flies around the world
teaching people how to use the software
so you can't start as a beginner and so
maybe let's take a step back and think
so what's in it for Google with this
program that sounds great for the
companies great for the students what's
what is it it for Google so there's a
couple things so if you look at Google
and and how we create our software here
that people think of as being Google
right there's actually a lot of open
source code inside Google the leaves and
so it's sort of important for us that
that software continues to get developed
and created and is for kept up to date
and one of the things that I found in my
career and it cats out to use nicks
where she worked before Google you know
you saw a lot of the same people over
and over and over again and that was
that was kind of disappointing because
as people age out in the business as
people age out of programming as they
have kids why is everything and husbands
you know it pulls
those people out of open-source - so how
do we refresh open source here on your
so so that this is all part of the goals
there's there's a small recruiting
component you know people who do this on
our code I'll often see them come in as
interns at Google and another tech
startups and technology companies
there's an aspect of PR you know we want
to be very clear how we feel about open
source software we love it
we think it's really important for a
free and open Internet and for that to
persist we want to help it however we
can that make sense for us and make
sense for open source and and in the end
the coin of the realm our developers in
code and the Summer of Code creates both
so we wanted to make sure that open
source gets help from us much as we've
gotten help from that and it's and it's
a very popular program internally so you
know everyone's file wants and you say
well how do you justify this and I just
give them the list and I say there you
go and it's it's you know all the way up
here at Google people are just crazy
about the program and we have so many
engineers who are both mentors and who
were students before or who were admins
and projects and it's just it's great
it's just fantastic yeah I leave running
the program for a year so I've been here
for about eight years and seeing
students who were you know freshmen in
college who had end up working here or
working at you know other companies
right here and hearing their stories
about summer code it's just it's
fantastic you know it's a kind of
internship that's actually better than
most internships in some ways because
internships are kind of marketing - but
summer code it's about coding it's about
doing this work and it's it's it's sort
of like a what's the right word it's
sort of like a boot camp sort of
experience you know people bond over it
and they say oh you lived through that -
yes so tada you know yes it's it's
really cool so speaking of interns can
students who already have internships
lined up participate or if they're maybe
on a different seasonal schedule so
maybe it's winter for their summer so we
get this question a lot and it's a good
question because obviously there are
some people who were in alternative
school schedules or are in summer
programs and that kind of thing and what
we tell people is that okay so in the
case of internships and
working for other companies while doing
a summer good thing the problem is a lot
of companies will have an election
property agreements that you sign when
you go into to serve as an intern so
we've had people who like internet
Microsoft or or whatever and they also
want to do this and we're like you
should ask your boss because what
happens is they think that they have
rights to the work they do but they
actually don't so so that can be a
problem also the time commitment you
know some code is not a joking-around
kind of program it's the real deal so we
do require a lot of your time so when
people have had full-time jobs and the
way we find out about it is because they
fail yeah you know if they don't want to
tell us and if there are certain time to
admit that the organizations are
typically expecting I mean if it's is
this just a 40-hour Work Week kind of
thing where it depends on the project
well it depends on the project but yeah
yeah I mean every year we do have
participants from the southern
hemisphere it's not something for them
they are in school because they have to
be in school to participate in the
program and people manage it but they're
working themselves pretty good yeah it's
only no good what everyone's doing all
of your research before you sign up for
something like this and knowing as much
as you can about the program that's true
and also statistically speaking you know
we did a study of where people are doing
computer science programs and education
even though you can do it as an
architecture student but independent of
that and what we found is that the
number of people in computer science
schools in the world are overwhelmingly
you know northern hemisphere people so
you know so that's worth knowing and
what about for students who were
interested in maybe don't get accepted
what's it sort of just tips on getting
involved with open source oh yeah Chris
no no you got some cat rush Carol is
here she's really good to us but yeah
that's one thing that the whole Summer
of Code program does it is make it very
easy for people who are interested in
contributing to an open source project
to find a project that interests them
and get an idea of the kind of work that
they need
all their contact information is laid
out its sortable so just because you're
not accepted in the program we still
really encourage you to go out and
explore find something you feel
passionate about and contribute to it
and there are other programs out there
modeled on google Summer of Code
Janome has one specifically targeted for
women a number of other organizations up
to and including the European Space
Commission had a program they modeled on
it so if you're interested in this kind
of internship and open source get on
your favorite search engine and look
around and go ahead and use the melange
tool to look at the various
organizations and get an idea of what
you might be interested in
yeah those ideas lists are perennial
it's it's not like you know if this idea
is is worked on by some summary code
student doesn't mean you can't look into
it yourself I mean those ideas lists
they're maintained all the time by a lot
of these projects as a way of welcoming
in the new developers and that's pretty
awesome actually
and yeah we use this word internship I
want to make sure a couple of things are
clear though it's not like you're going
to be sitting in there in an office you
know what folks you know it's done
wherever you live so if you live in you
know some house in the middle of New
Zealand well that's what you'll be doing
this wrong you know sometimes people
will do things from the dorm sometimes
we'll do it from whatever you know so
but you know it's very rare for you to
actually end up even meeting in person
your mentor although sometimes we have
these office visits where you know
everyone in in say country acts like
India or something you can all come
visit our office in Hyderabad Rangel or
you know or everybody in and kit you
know California comes us here it's
pretty good and a couple of other things
too I mean you guys hear me yes oh froze
on me for a second for you this is
University students right maybe we
should have started with that it's 18
and over 18 and over and university
students its post-secondary education so
we've had participants or in junior
college in technical or specialty
schools we get a few postdocs every year
mostly undergrads but it goes up
includes masters PhDs and postdocs and
the word student is flexible to date our
oldest Summer of Code student was 56
yeah so you don't have to be young you
just have to be over 18 11 an accredited
Confederation and all of this
information as we've said before is
listed on the Summer of Code site which
hopefully plenty of students will go
read up after they yeah Kat and I are
largely redundant it's true
hey but sometimes that's what you have
to do to get across the pool yeah
different learning styles also you don't
have to be a computer science student
yeah the majority of students are in CS
or I Triple E but we've had lots of
linguistics students some political
science majors performance dance majors
fair number of musicians becsher
architecture art history all different
kinds of people are interested in
computers people - it's true yeah pretty
much as long as you're enrolled in a but
post-secondary university in a
university and over 18 everything kind
of program you're pretty much applicable
to apply you go awesome well I think
we're going to start wrapping it up do
you guys want to just end with maybe a
couple pieces of last-minute advice for
students who are interested or your last
push for maybe those who are sort of on
the fence for applying or if you aren't
really shirts for them sure they'll I
think I'd say it's you know we have all
kinds of projects all kinds of languages
and some of them all kinds of littles
ability you don't have to be some
computer vision Linux kernel nerd to do
the Summer of Code and be successful so
you can you can find your passion
somewhere in the hundred and seventy
projects we've accepted this year so you
know there's plenty of folks there who
are waiting and eager to work with you
so apply yes yes please okay so I think
we're just about done thanks again for
joining us and for those of you who are
watching this is being recorded and will
be uploaded to our Google students
YouTube channel
we have a playlist already if you want
to check it out it's just at youtube.com
slash Google students and has all of the
Hangout center that we've done in the
past and this one will be added this
week so yeah thanks again Chris and Kat
and we look forward to seeing a surge of
applications for Summer of Code great
you have until Friday okay applications
are due Friday that's probably important
to include for the next year well yeah
exactly
oh oh one last thing we also have a if
you're younger than 18 we have a program
called Google codon for folks who are
what thirteen to seventeen cat right so
and that's held over the winter break so
we could ruin your holidays as well we
ruin your summer now no we can enhance
you're really selling it here you know
and yeah programmers know that we have a
calling and it's calling can often be
more important than Christmas you know
okay well now they have a well full
information that I'd write back and go
research okay right alright thank you
