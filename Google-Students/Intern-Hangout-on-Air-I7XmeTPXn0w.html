google hangout on air my name's
christine dynamic university program
specialist that means that i travel

our job opportunities Google and Google
culture and hi my name is Yanina I'm an
intern recruiter and I'm super excited
to be talking to you today about
internship opportunities at Google so
here's what is here with us a day it's
been Ben Conway been used to be an
intern at Google and now she has
retained as a full-time employee in our
small and medium businesses in and in
sales hi guys I'm ban as she said I'm
from Dublin and wearing me a
headquarters are an excuse the address
I'm dressed with me today because it's
Halloween so excuse the wings and also
with that we have to move to a potato
who is joining from the amazing office
in Google from being abroad for Poland
and Tim were used to be an Internet well
and he joined Google as a full-time
employing the global customer experience
team welcome to her oh thank you thank
you very much Christina hi folks thank
you for joining our hangout well again
my name is Timur I'm originally from
Azerbaijan I was lucky enough to have an
intership last year in google in
bratislava and after one year of
graduation I was offered a full-time
position to come back here so here I am
amazing welcome everyone and so today
today we will be discussing about the
life for google business attorney we
will be deep diving then our small and
medium business sales team in the global
customer experience team and but us some
of you may know we have we offer variety
of internships in different teams and in
large customer sales team marketing
finance legal Google for work and
product quality operations and we will
be also talking about the application
process how you can apply what are we
looking for and and also we will be
giving you some tips on our some tips in
order for you to be Google ready and
prepare you to be and for the interview
process at the end we will have a very
short Q&amp;amp;A and so you have any questions
we will be responding to be answering
some of your questions and so since timu
and
have been interns at Google um you know
how was what is the scope of the
business in general then I think I'm
gonna let Tim or take this one I think
you had a better experience in the way I
think being an unknown business internet
Google gives you a really great
opportunity because you get to enter
because you have to get work with two
main important parts first of all it's
AdWords one of the core Google products
and you really really learn how digital
marketing works at the other side it's
you work with customers and its
customers a Google's most important
assets you really understand how your
work can affect the development of their
business you really get a larger
overview of how Google operates what
makes will go successful that's great
thank you thank you two more and so both
of you you have returned at Google as
full-time employees so I guess that you
enjoy your time here as in turn and what
what is say one thing and that made you
choose Google well for me personally I
chose come back because i love the team
i was working with and that really won
me over and also the people the people i
as i said the people who work here I
really great and the work is really
interesting and you know what there's
never one and one day that's the same
and it just was a really great
experience plus I had experience in
business and marketing and sales so it
was really perfect match for me from my
side I would agree with Ben that's one
of the best things about Google it's the
people that surround you in indeed
google has in the Google actually
employing the one the smartest people on
earth and for being here I never stopped
learning I was always finding someone
talking about it to say topics
developing both professionally and
personally and another side there is a
lot of flexibility in working with in DC
if you have an analytical mind set you
can always find yourself a role in the
team in which you will be working with
and processing information in my cadence
I'm not I don't like to work with a lot
of information but I rather prefer
personal interactions with agencies with
businesses so that's what I do in my
team so there are a lot of things to do
and you can choose what you actually
want to be developing it that sounds
great and so a lot of students final
is and and I have different events with
different a lot of students they're
asking me what you know if they shoot
and have a deep knowledge of what alpha
or the wood products and in general like
what kind of training do you take when
you join us an injured and well when i
joined essentially you've one week of
nuclear training which is new Googlers
it's a short and everything but at so
nuclear training and that's really great
so you got a bit of product knowledge
you get to know a bit about the business
the culture and you get to meet everyone
that you start with this loads a
Nightside activities planned and it's
all it's a really really good fun and
then once in when i was in the team i
got some more product knowledge with
lots of one-to-one teachings which is
really nice with em senior racks on the
team who saw dust and i went to your
stuff with us and then we did for
adwords fundamentals so it was really
really thorough and i learned so much
and tim or is it is it the same for the
girl customer experience team definitely
I mean when you come to the team you're
not expected to have any pro any
acknowledged in other words or any
knowledge about so it's any pro product
specific knowledge at all all you need
to do is to have passion and be willing
to learn and google has all kinds of
trainings personal skills training soft
skills and hard skills charts skills
trainings and if you there are so many
resources in the end of the day we're
the largest informational company in the
world so there are a lot of places to
learn all we have to do is just to ask
and search for this so there are rumors
and going around the Google culture the
benefits and all that we have so what
what is one thing that surprised you
most about the goofy culture I am I
think from you think elusiveness and the
ability to an encouragement to try new
things so you know if you want to try
something underworld enough and you make
mistake it's the important part is how
you pick yourself up and dust yourself
off and you're you're actually sort of
valued more highly the more you try and
that's a big part of what I really like
enjoy divide it they encourage you to
think big which is great and for my side
I would say that the most really really
liked in Google's culture is everything
around you encourage you to get
questions when you do when you don't
know what
to do you always go to your colleague
you ask them and they will start what
they're doing just to help you and
clarify the issue for you so this was a
really great to me compared to my other
words I was Internet where you have to
do do it all by yourself Google culture
is always supporting you to be part of
the team sounds good and so also Google
intern you will be probably based at
place in an office and summer anemia and
and most of us here we we're not from
from Ireland so I've moved in Ireland
from from rescanning able to hear to
each island from from Germany empty
where you are from violence idea I
studied in Bulgaria you started will go
that's amazing so most of us have been
relocated here and in Ireland and and
you know some some students and asked me
and you know we don't we won't really
know anyone when we moved to this
country so how is it was it for you to
get to know people and I get to know
your host country actually this is one
of the best things about the intership
you move to new office new people
everything new and the best thing is how
people are on PCP perceive you because
they realize that you were coming to a
new country and they really want to make
sure you feel comfortable they take you
out they take you out for us with my
friends I went for football games we
went to the theater we're going to play
video games so everything depending on
your interest people around you are
always very happy to take you out show
you the city to make sure you're
comfortable with their friends and when
you really feel that people are around
really like you you know they don't talk
to you just because you're their
colleague just but because they feel
that you are now part of the Google
family it makes your adjustment to a new
country very easy very smooth you start
to enjoy it more say now I'm I'm back
when I wasn't even an intern in poland i
started to learn polish you know just to
feel the culture and I think it's really
great and absolutely it doesn't matter
which country you are coming from when
you come to it doesn't matter which
office you're coming from the google
culture is universal so you will be very
welcomed that's that's really cool and
so tumor
and since you have been having a major
here at Google what would be one piece
of advice that you would give to a
student who is listening right now and
will love to join google apps nature
well for the application process or the
interview process I definitely just be
confident and in your abilities and give
it all you've got because they celebrate
anything different here which is really
great and then if once you get the
internship I'd say we're card would
enjoy it it is the probably the best
thing I've ever done of my summer and
I've traveled all over the world for me
again I'm a lot of people they free hey
Google is a big company I'm not good
enough I mean those are the things that
you should really get rid of I will
choosers really great people and you're
also smart and hardworking so definitely
apply prepare your CV preparing your CV
you talk to as many people as you can
about google talk to your recruiter in
the beginning what's necessary to apply
and then just during the interview
process be yourself don't be don't be
someone who you're not talk about your
interests talk about your passion stock
why you actually want to join Google
because as Ben said diversity is very
much valid within the company so just
won't be afraid become for that
confidence is king and apply and it's
all going to be great that's great this
looks great advice thank you both and so
since you both mentioned the application
process I think it's it's time to come
back to dive into that so Yanina what is
the application process yeah so am as an
intern recruiter and I'm obviously super
excited to be receiving all your CVS
over the coming weeks and please make
sure you send them in as soon as
possible because and the application end
date is coming closer and closer its
first of December and as we previously
mentioned we have internships available
all across europe middle east and africa
and actually a question that you receive
quite often is how flexible we can
really be in terms of duration and start
dates and i'd say and we work as well as
we can with your availability and on
average and most of our internship start
in the summer and that's somewhere
between 10 weeks and six months long and
well we talked about SMB sales and
global
customer experience earlier but actually
we have a lot of teams across the
business that are really excited to be
working with bright young students like
yourself so and you could be working
with people in marketing and large
customer sales and you know legal
finance there's a lot of teams that we
could place you're an amazing and who
are we looking for what's the criteria
in order to be usable for a business
interested here at Google yeah so I
think we prepared a little slide for you
there and it's very straightforward and
you need to be a current university
student and returning to university
after completion of your internship and
ideally graduating in late two thousand
sixteen or in 2017 you could be studying
anything from business to communications
to computer science or humanities what
you're studying is ultimately not as
important this and that you have an
interest in one of the following here on
the screen so that would be sales
customer support account management
marketing or consulting that's that's
really cool so if they're students out
there listening to us and they're
eligible to apply how how do they apply
it's very easy as well and we have a
short link here for you this sheet or
college interns amia when you go under
you'll find the job description for our
business in turn role and if you like
what you see please send in your cv by
first of December and make sure to
include your availability your language
skills and a gmail address because we'll
be using that later on to schedule your
interviews and yeah oh we don't need a
cover letter and we don't need any
official University transcripts at this
point it's really straightforward and as
soon as you click Submit will receive
your application plus that's very
straightforward and so if someone is
interested and applies online what is
the next step what's happening after
that yeah my team will be reviewing your
applications from now until spring and
on a rolling basis and will work really
hard to try and match the skills and
experience that we find on your CV with
one of the projects that we are hiring
for and if we do see a mesh and we'll
reach out to you one of us will be in
touch
then it asked for more information or
immediately schedule a phone interview
with you if you get to phone interview
stage that's amazing that's already half
the battle won so am pleased expect to
phone I hang out interviews and will be
looking for the following four
attributes
so we have and will be looking for how
you think and will assess your
leadership skills will ask you some
questions about your role related
knowledge so that includes anything any
work experience that you've had today at
anything that could be useful here at
Google and finally we'll assess
googliness and which basically means
we'll try and find out how well you will
fit their fit in here at Google that is
great also very helpful and good to know
and so we do have some time and for
questions and we will be taking some
questions and from from few from the
audience so we have a question from if
you see well it's from and one from
France and other one from frost is
asking how can I better prepare to rock
a Google interview that's a very good
question which one and so I think Nina
that's probably for me yes and so what
we often tell candidates is to look up
the star method and to use that to
answer any questions in the interviews
and if you don't know what it is google
it they have lots of information about
it online it's basically describing the
situation that you were in the task that
you were given and the action that you
took and the results that the end
results that it led to and another thing
a lot of people think that we use brain
teasers here and which is not the case i
know some companies use these but we
haven't really found any values of all
of our questions are going to be somehow
related to what you'll be doing here at
Google and what you've previously done
in your other internships or at
university that's very good to know
because a lot of students asking me and
during events to widget bring thesis
question Lobel so that's very very
helpful and so thank you for that and
then another question we have another
question from Ronnie from Israel and
Ronnie's asking that's the question from
formality more so Ronnie's asking what
does a Saturday look like at sales and
the global customer experience team and
well for sales at you come and have your
breakfast go through check your emails
then there's a cook I would get on
and the phone and I do a couple priests
consultations which were pre-scheduled
with some of our advertisers work on
their digital marketing strategy and
then but then it'd be time for lunch to
go for lunch with some friends and then
after that we would I'd probably start
on my project so I worked on a project
at bringing customers into Google to
teach the more our workshops to teach
them more about Adwords so that was
really fun so that was pretty much my
typical day and as I said no days ever
the same so you know variations on the
on that tumor
okay so for me well I come to dogs a bit
earlier well has really great facility
so I make use of them I go to the gym
and run and workout in the morning then
I can have the really great breakfast
the healthy one and then I get talking
with a client with the clients clients
on the phone over email and maybe I
receive the emails from them trying to
solve their problems I also do a couple
of consultations for them how to develop
their marketing strategy how they want
to build a relationship with Edwards
after that I'm having lunch after lunch
I'm doing more are working with clients
GCI has spent a lot of time working with
clients and then in the end of the day I
always try to live at least 23 hours
just to work on my project since I
mentioned in the beginning or or maybe I
didn't but i will i am very interested
in developing a business development
skills and strategic thinking something
consulting related so as part of my team
we are now developing the new market
goes belarus and kazakhstan google is
just beginning to enter those markets
and me and four of our colleagues we are
very happy to be the first one of the
first ones to engage with the agencies
to educate them about Google products to
educate them about how to really
effectively use Google to grow their
business um and then in the end of the
day you as I said Google is a great
community so you just take some of your
friends and we go to the movies or we go
play some football or spending time in
the office playing video games so when
you're cleaning a google as an intern
that means you are working both and auto
project and then both are they you're
doing the cordial yeah so it's 5050 so
we and I had and as i said i was in
market i probably should have mentioned
up for I work for the Irish team here in
Dublin so we brought in a lot of Irish
customers and had to educate them as
well as I'm trying to grow startups and
so and it was it's all very well related
but also
it's sort of something that you can
bring your own sort of shine too I
suppose but yet 5050 at which is great
that sounds amazing and it seems it
sounds a like both of you you were
working very very cool projects yeah
definitely as the best thing about the
intership that you have a lot of free
time just to work on your project to use
your creativity in my case I was working
with social media so I was working
creating proactive contact for Russian
Twitter and Russian twitter is I think
the largest Google's Twitter it's over
250,000 so it's like one quarter of a
million so it's really huge yeah and I
was developing on restructuring how my
social media market are basically social
media team works so it was a lot of they
gave me a goal and it was absolutely up
to me how I'd like to reach the skull
which is really cool because I got to
know a lot of Googlers from other
offices from Dublin from Moscow from
London just to get experience from them
and this network has taught me a lot
that if they really helped me of my
project will help me to look at the
bigger google so it's a great chance
guys definitely and the lezzy for today
