video on how to prepare for a business
interview I'm Rachel I'm one of our
business recruiters I'm Siobhan I'm also
a business recruiter and I might say I'm
one of the HR recruiters that support
the business and we are here to provide
some tips and tricks on how to best
prepare for your on-site interviews with
us first a few pieces of context that
may help in terms of what to expect the
first big question we always get is what
to wear for your interviews so you'll
notice we're sort of dressed how we are
at work every day um your interviewers
made me dress similarly our best piece
of advice is to check with your
recruiter and he or she can provide the
best advice as to how you should dress
for your interview the other thing that
you can expect is that your interviewer
is going to be taking lots of notes so
if they're looking at their laptop if
they're writing lots of notes on a piece
of paper
don't let that stress you out we really
just want to make sure that we're
capturing as much as we can from the
conversations that you're having
throughout fitting
as soon as you get the call to interview
start preparing the key is really
preparation so think about what
questions you're likely to be asked
questions like why do you want to work
for Google why are you a good fit for
this role
if you can't think of any good questions
Google most commonly asked interview
questions take a look at that list and
write down 20 of those questions
literally don't just choose one or two
after you choose those questions write
down answers to those questions and
practice those answers out loud you
really want to make sure that the
answers to those questions are stuck in
your brain so if you thought that was a
lot here's some more for every question
that you have write down three answers
from our how we hire video you learn
that you'll have multiple interviews
you'll need to have a different equally
good answer for each question because
the first interviewer might not like
your answer for your story you want the
next interviewer to hear a different
story and become your advocate it's also
important that every question that you
have should be answered with a story
that demonstrates you can do what your
being interviewed for news data use real
examples that have concrete outcomes for
example a question of how do you lead
should be answered with I am a decisive
collaborator whatever leader and let me
tell you about a time off when I did
this
everyone can become great at
interviewing the key is really just
preparation in practice the more you
practice the better you'll be it's also
important to remember that we care about
you as a person entirely so for us
googliness is super important we really
want you to bring your whole self to the
interview process and to work as cliche
as it sounds just be yourself and to add
to that remember that if you're being
asked to interview with Google it's
because we believe you're qualified for
the job so don't underestimate the power
of being confident we know that so much
of interviewing is just being confident
and being yourself like Siobhan says so
you have earned this opportunity and
we're really excited to meet you on site
thanks again for watching our video and
good luck good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
