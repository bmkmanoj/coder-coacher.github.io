tips to help you get the most out of
your applied CS workshops as you may
know already applied CS units have two
components the independent groundwork
and the workshop groundwork is completed
by student participants in their own
time while workshops are the in-person
sessions facilitated by you make sure
you are prepared for each workshop by
reading the facilitator notes watching
the unit videos and familiarizing
yourself with the learning objectives
you'll also want to make sure you have a
way to take attendance
we encourage student facilitators to
work with their University contacts to
plan and confirm workshop location and
times well in advance once the program
starts ensure you and your participants
have the correct time and location for
the workshops at the beginning of the
workshop introduce yourself take
attendance and present the briefing and
videos for the unit you are facilitating
place students in groups and monitor
them as they work through the tasks
remember to take breaks as necessary or
encourage students to step away for
individual breaks stick to timings each
week so students know what to expect
encourage a collaborative environment
getting students to help each other and
other groups when they are stuck
encourage good clean coding practice and
a hands-up approach meaning it's okay to
ask questions remind everyone that no
one is expected to get everything right
the first time if something breaks or
doesn't run that's okay
encourage students to be patient debug
carefully and help each other out resist
the urge to take control of student
keyboards and complete the task for them
pose questions and give hints that will
bring them to the answer on their own if
you notice that several students are
stuck remember that you have the
authority to pause explain or walk
through the problem as a group everyone
has different learning styles so
alternate between explaining showing
videos and using metaphors to ensure
everyone understands and finally
remember to close out the session
together and remind students about where
and when the next workshop will be held
take time to also celebrate successes
and share any problem-solving tactics
you're bound to face some challenges so
share them with the growing community
remember there are lots of resources to
make sure your workshop is a great
success</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
