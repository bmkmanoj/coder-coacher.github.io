applications were out for this program
and let's say I got in and I was super
excited to come here 33 weeks I learned
about the SSI through my AP computer
science teacher he told us about this
great opportunities at Google's hosting
well searching around for scholarships
on Google who ironically and I came
across the generation Google scholarship
and that's how I got connected with the
SSI Google started the SSI which is the
computer science Summer Institute and
the three week long program for incoming
freshmen in college who are from
historically underrepresented groups in
computer science it is a project based
corrected we focus a lot left on on sort
of ideas and a lot more on practice one
of the things that students are most
surprised by when they come to see SSI
is how much software engineering is a
team sport
you're always collaborating with others
and talking with others and reviewing
each other's code I really do feel like
you learned so much learning environment
was something that kind of helped
connect people of all different levels
or I felt in the level where I can meet
other people CSS ID has given me
confidence going into school this fall
and it has given me a foundation on
where to begin
outside of coding and development we're
also learning life skills that are
associated with our whole person such as
resume building interview prep skills
this program emphasizes how life skills
are just as important as coming in and
making a website they talk about
googling news and that's something I
really saw here a very creative
environment at the end the project was
to work with two other people and
combine their skills to make a final
product that shows each of our strengths
full functioning web application and
four days I can never have done that
we've been expanding to more and more
sites each year and are now partnering
with universities to bring the
curriculum and developmental
opportunities to even more students
across the country I don't really think
I've seen anything quite like it in
another computer science course I feel
like I have a foundation now on going on
to computer science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
