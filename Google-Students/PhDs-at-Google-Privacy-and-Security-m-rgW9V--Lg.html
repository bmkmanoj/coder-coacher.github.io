security youtube live session is the
last session of our series for PhD
students I'm Maggie acres I'm on the
University programs team and this is a
vajay dasilva he's going to be our
speaker today and I'll let him introduce
himself in just a few minutes before we
get started I want to point out the chat
box on the right-hand side of your
screen it's moderated by a few of my
wonderful colleagues who are more than
happy to answer any questions you might
have throughout the session and we'll
save a few questions for a good day at
the end I'd also like to highlight the
opportunities we have for PhD students
at Google we have a software engineering
internship for PhD students and the
application closes january thirty first
if you haven't already applied be sure
to do so by the end of the month we also
have a full-time software engineering
role for PhD students that application
is always open but we do recommend that
you apply sooner rather than later we'll
talk more about opportunities and the
application processing Google later on
in the session but for now I'm so
excited to hand it over to the day he's
going to talk more about privacy and
security at Google thanks Maddie and
thanks everybody who's tuned in I'm a
software engineer in the privacy and
security team here and i'll use our time
today to tell you a little bit about the
journey that took me why research to
being a member of the privacy and
security group here in google and one of
the major surprises for me was that
there was a lot of outlet and
opportunities to use the kind of
training and skills i had acquired in my
PhD and i'll tell you a little bit about
that in this talk and and towards the
end we'll talk about the application
process so i started out as an undergrad
in iit bombay in india where I learned
and did projects in circuit design and
later I was a master student at the
University of Zurich in Switzerland
where I started learning about logic and
I got really interested and decided to
pursue the study of logic more
in my PhD which was largely theoretical
i should say entirely theoretical
actually and towards the end i was
curious at first to know does the kind
of work I was doing have applications
and secondly also will I ever be able to
find a job doing this kind of thing
which is why I got a postdoc at the
University of California Berkeley and
throughout this process I assumed that I
would be an academic long-term because I
really enjoyed things like reading and
writing papers teaching interacting with
colleagues who were doing the same thing
but also had a broad range of interest
but the reason I started questioning the
assumption of being an academic was what
I perceived as negativity in the review
process and uncertainty about where I
would find a job and also how long I
would have that job as well as just
realizing that there were demands on my
time as an academic which I had not been
aware of and maybe wasn't entirely how I
wanted to spend my time to fight with
choose if you read articles and listen
to talks on this topic there are a few
more things that people will talk about
like freedom and the ability to do
long-term research and I encourage you
to read articles and talks given by
other people such as the ones on this
slide and form your own opinions but
what I will say is that there are a lot
of issues where there isn't a simple
clear-cut dichotomy between having a job
in a university and having a job in a
company like Google there are
differences in priorities but my
experience is that there aren't
activities that are fundamentally in
opposition and I put a lot of that on
the slide and hopefully you all can come
back and ask me about this at the end
but first let me tell you a little bit
about security and privacy work in
Google this is not a comprehensive
overview by any means it's just let me
give you a few snapshots here and there
and I encourage you to go and read about
this on our website so what is security
and privacy rather than explain from
deaf
editions I think we all have an
intuitive idea what it means for data to
be secure or our information to be
private when it comes to something
sensitive like conducting a financial
transaction or buying things online but
security is involved in nearly every
interaction you will have with a
computing device say you go to a cafe
with a friend and you log on to the
wireless network there then the natural
question is and the person who owns that
wireless network find out which websites
you're visiting and suppose the portal
for the water for the cafe wireless
gives you helpful links to where you can
check your email is it safe to actually
click on one of those links now it might
say something like gmail com but that
all might be an English 0 or it might be
something that looks like an English oh
but is omicron in the Greek alphabet so
if you might click on it and go there
and see something that looks like the
gmail page but it might trick you into
getting your password and this is an
example of what is called a phishing
attack right and now those are things
that target everybody but there are also
somewhat more dramatic scenarios suppose
your phone is stolen and then recovered
or one of the people in that earlier
picture suppose they're a vice president
of engineering at a company like Google
then a major concern is did the person
who stole the phone use it to access
sensitive data or information about
Google did they use that to log on to
our networks and the way we would
determine this is we have forensic
investigators would go and look at this
device and try to reverse engineer what
happened and what I have found
fascinating is that the same kind of
techniques and knowledge exists among
forensic investigators and save law
enforcement and they also use and share
similar tools and techniques so I'll
give you a snapshot of the projects we
will be working on you can find
descriptions of these and more at
research to google com and specifically
there's a section of that site that
talks about Google security privacy and
abuse research now one of the
long-running projects that we have is
called
safe browsing so to go back to the
example of clicking on a link that
tricks you to get your password that's a
phishing site there are other sites that
may try when you click on them to
download a package to your machine and
they might also try to install software
on your machine that gives an attacker
access to your machine so that they can
either steal your machine or use your
computing resources to perform a tax
elsewhere so there is a big concern
about protecting users off the web from
malware and phishing sites and Google
since at least 2009 has an effort called
Safe Browsing that studies and
categorizes these as well as documents
them in an API so if you ever access the
web using Google's Chrome or Firefox or
Safari you have used the results of the
Safe Browsing team's research which is
also reported in their transparency
report so if you look at the graph on
this screen you will see that there is a
red and a blue line and it's not
entirely simple we would like to believe
that our efforts have led to a decrease
in malware over time but another aspect
of security research is that attackers
are human being then are also motivated
by many things so every time we come up
with the defense they come up with
another way around it and continuous
research and engineering is required to
deal with it and our teams have also
written papers about this that study not
just the attacks but also the economy
that funds and fuels this and an
understanding of the economy is behind
what are called rewards programs at
Google to suppose you start at one of
Google's web sites and you are able to
reach a situation where you can run your
own code without any authorization on
Google servers I believe and you will
have to check our website for the
details that Google will pay you up to
twenty thousand dollars as a reward for
finding such an exploit so there is a
wide range of exploit and Google
supports vulnerability researchers and
recognizes that they want to be rewarded
monetarily for this kind of work and
since 2010 over six million dollars has
been paid for
or such work and in fact in 2015 alone
over 2 million voters was paid for as
one durability rewards so google also
has programs to support researchers
while they do this kind of work not just
after they found the results so that is
one kind of work that we engage in we
also have our own teams of researchers
that are continuously looking for one er
abilities and also making it easier we
hope for other developers to secure
their own software so one example is
cryptographic software cryptography and
encryption algorithms might be developed
with various mathematical assumptions in
mind and researchers over time have
learned and discovered and published
that even if an algorithm is proved to
have certain guarantees under some
assumptions when you implement them
there might be details because of the
programming language the compiler and
its optimizations and the platform on
which the code runs that violate those
assumptions and this then introduces a
vulnerability in that software so in
December last year or Google release
project which proved who's following you
can see on the slide which documented a
lot of these known implementation
related bugs and found over 40 security
related blogs and I encourage you to go
and look at the code on github but also
the documentation where you'll see that
in order to write that tool people had
to really read and understand academic
research papers but also have an
intimate knowledge of the engineering
platforms for and the standard libraries
that were used to implement them so
those are those might seem like pretty
low level security work I'd like to
emphasize that security something that
occurs at every level of the technology
stack so to go to the networking level a
continuous concern for people is what is
called a distributed denial-of-service
attack these are often always in
progress where attackers get control of
many different machines and generate
traffic that targets one or a group of
servers and the idea is to overwhelm the
servers and take them down and on the
slide you will see a visualization of
denial of service distributed denial of
service traffic targeting Brazil during
the summer olympics of 2016 and this was
work that was done in collaboration
between a team called jigsaw and google
concerned with security and a big
picture team in book and a team called
big picture in google which consisted of
expert many with PhDs in data
visualization and this also speaks to a
concern that I had before coming here as
an academic which is I had very broad
interest and I wanted to learn many
things like data visualization but I
thought as an academic I would not have
the time to specialize and contribute to
such a few but your i found that i'm
able to find such teams and engage with
them and it gives me insight into their
research so security and privacy are not
the only areas in google where research
happens i'll take a few minutes to
highlight a couple of other activities
within google another concern I had
before I joined here was that I spent a
lot of my time as an academic first as a
researcher in circuit design and then in
logic and I wondered a lot how they tore
my brain away when I go to Google will
all that knowledge and years of training
be useless and what's been very
rewarding for me to see is that there
are researchers in all those areas they
continue to do research and I can go to
their talks and read their papers and
stay abreast of research in those areas
one example being this study of
programmers errors done by some of our
engineers in 2014 but they looked at 26
million bills that Google engineers had
made over a period of six months and
they look they classify the analyze they
studied all the errors how long it took
to fix them and then they published a
paper about this they also use that the
results of that analysis to develop
tools that would then improve the lives
of google developers internally and this
is something I found really cool that
not only did they do this kind of study
used it to of to influence our ingenuity
a fairly different type of research
project which is almost a meta science
project is from is the nips consistency
experiment in i believe 2014 Karina
Cortez who is a researcher in Google and
new Lawrence who is at the University of
Sheffield were co-chairs of a conference
called nips which is one of the leading
venues in machine learning and
artificial intelligence research and
it's a really big wedding they get a
very large number of submissions so they
had to program committees and the
co-chairs conducted what is called the
nibs consistency experiment they took
ten percent of the papers and they gave
them to both committees and then they
analyzed and compared whether the
Committees of greed in their evaluation
of the paper and I encourage you to go
and read more about this but what was
amazing to me is first that this
research was done which to me is very
deep fundamental research because it is
about the science of how we produce and
expand knowledge and secondly was very
comforting for me to see that one could
be in a place like Google and still
engage in such activities so going
further away from the traditional
academic and publishing scenario a lot
of people in Google have research
background so they appreciate that in
order to do research even in other
places you need access to good data and
tools to look at and analyze that data
so there has been a lot of activity in
collecting curating and releasing data
sets you can find a lot of different
data sets on our research website this
is an example of a visualization taken
from a tool called and pageant embedding
projector using data from something
called word to back which turns words
into vectors in euclidean space so that
closely related words appear close
together and both the data the data has
been used by many different teams the
tool is more recent but I encourage you
to check it out it looks pretty cool
so those are all somewhat technical I'm
not going to speak very much about non
technical things good in Google if you
are interested in say social and policy
related issues and want to use your
technical background I was surprised to
find that there were opportunities for
that as well and one example is the
Vashon our agreement which is an export
control association sorry the Wassenaar
arrangement which is the name of an
export control association that the
United States is a member of I believe
this arrangement has been in place since
1996 but they release some changes in i
think around somewhere between 2013 and
2015 and these changes we're going to
cover software and export of software
and what they called intrusion software
and there was a lot of confusion and
head-scratching among security
researchers and the open source
community as well as companies and
within who will security expert sat at a
table with policy experts legal experts
and they studied this they wrote about
it they decided what Google's position
was and communicated that to the general
public and so this is also the type of
work that can be done here using our
research and Exposition skill that you
might acquire during a PhD so apart from
directly doing or communicating research
there are several avenues that I was
pleasantly surprised to learn for using
research skills and one of the main ones
here is why Google itself so when I
first joined Google I was a very junior
engineer and there were several managers
and vice presidents about me all the way
up to Larry Page and what blew me away
was that every single one of them had a
PhD this is not to say that every member
of senior leadership in google has a PhD
or even needs a PhD but I did not expect
that people with technical and often
computer science PhDs would be so well
represented at that level of
and their background and their skills
have been fundamental in determining
Google's engineering culture as well as
general culture so all these people have
participated in defining what's a code
review looks like in Google but also
what are hiring practices and policies
should look like and that has created an
environment where I found it very easy
and natural to settle in as an engineer
and you know set a kind of tone for work
that made it very conducive to the kind
of skills I have so apart from doing
day-to-day google work if you have a PhD
if you're involved in active academic
activities you can also continue those
activities here I was a fairly junior
academic I would I did paper reviews
before coming here I have continued to
do paper reviews here and many Googlers
serve on program committees on editorial
board and that has been a source for me
to receive papers to review people serve
on program committees I mentioned karina
cortez as one example as chair of the
nibs conference there are several other
people who have been chairs of
conferences I know more senior Googlers
who've been editors for journals or even
written books this is not to say people
come here and spend all their time on
such activities it usually requires
agreement from a manager and some amount
of time spent doing things that Google
really cares about but all of this is
possible so one thing I really did not
expect on coming to Google is that I
will be able to continue to teach or
interact with students because that was
something I really enjoyed and I had to
reconcile to myself that I will give
this up and I was pleasantly surprised
to first discover that google has and
internal education infrastructure where
people conduct courses and others can
attend them and it's really useful for
learning about all the systems that
exist here but also simple things like
just how to program in C++ and so on our
rather let's say Google grade C++
programming
and I was also allowed to teach at
summer schools externally not organized
by Google so this was fine i was able to
get permission from my manager for that
i know of other Googlers who have guest
lectured at universities and some were
even adjunct faculty so all of that is
possible there are both faculty visit
programs and mentorship programs that
allow people to supervise students I am
a Google industry mentor for a PhD
student who is funded by Google I also
have another student who is not funded
by Google but you know that's also fine
to continue doing and yeah i was amazed
that that is all consistent with being
here and doing my main engineering work
so with all that said there's also what
I learned is at Google is to broaden my
conception of what constitutes research
and contribution to the community Google
invest very heavily in open source
related work and there are many
different projects there and you know I
have been encouraged to think of doing
open-source work also as a way of giving
to the community and participating in
research so with all that said as Maggie
mentioned right in the beginning I hope
some of you will consider applying
please go to I guess are so one is there
are software engineer positions that PhD
graduates can apply to there is no
deadline you can do this any time of
year there's also keeps the internship I
mentioned earlier that my PhD was
largely theoretical I did only research
internships I really wish now that I had
interned at a place like Google because
that would have just given me more
perspective into the kind of options
that I have and from that point alone I
would encourage you to do that so
applying to Google they tell me I talk
to the hiring team is that easy as 123
so go to google.com / students and you
can look and search for the best role
for you all you have to do is upload
your resume and submit so with that said
I would encourage you to also prepare I
was very worried when I apply
because I did almost no coding in my PhD
so I consulted Google Sky to technical
development which you can find online
there are several texts such as cracking
the coding interview the algorithm
design manual programming interviews
exposed and I think this one for 300
problems or so I did a lot of
programming I learned to enjoy
programming it was very useful and there
are many ways to practice so with that
said I hope you'll consider us good luck
great and before we go we do have a
couple of questions from the chat um so
our first question is and what ways are
circuit design and logic relevant to
Google okay so Google Google makes its
own hardware I think sometime last year
they announced a tensor processing unit
and they have had various other kinds of
hardware projects in the past at
different scales they may not always
have you know released consumer devices
related to hardware but there's always
been some well why always I mean there
is Hardware work going on so that
requires circuit design knowledge and
there are teams doing that and when you
reason about circuits if you if there's
an error in your circuit and you go to
silicon and you fabricate that and
discover it at that stage it's very
expensive to fix so validation and
verification of circuits is very very
important and so Google invest a lot in
this one sub area is formal verification
tools which are part of validation tools
for circuit and that is one place for
people with circuit design and logic
backgrounds do work in Google our next
question comes from Shen and it is is
there a group doing research on compiler
or program analysis oh yes absolutely so
and thank you for asking that that's the
area in which I did my PhD and even
though i'm in a security group here i
have a soft spot for that I google has a
concept of twenty percent time or you
can get buy-in from your manager and
work on some other project
and I have always used my twenty percent
time and always used it for compilers
and program analysis related projects so
there is a lot of work happening there
there is for example compliation work
within Android there is compilation work
within the chrome team there's work on
virtual machines google also contributes
heavily to the llvm project you can just
move this an open source project and you
can look upstream and you will see that
there are commits from google engineers
happening all the time i gave one
example of a testing tool for security
software but we also have a lot of both
internal and extra external
infrastructure so if you look at the
terms emsam which is msan which is
memory sanitizer tese and thread
sanitizer these are also open source
projects for fine during memory and
concurrency bugs which involve you know
knowledge program analysis and yeah so
there's a very wide range of things
there please apply all right great our
next question is from Taha and it is
what does an industry mentor do I know
that you mentioned that you are an
industry mentor for a couple of students
right so I have been an industry mentor
in two different capacity so I have two
students and they speak two different
things that I do in one case the student
was working on analysis of concurrent
programs or his actually and wanted my
input because I had expertise on logic
based at me so I was providing that kind
of expertise there and in the suit that
was more informal it is not explicitly
through google or anything it's just
that my manager is fine with that in
another case there was a person who
received a google fellowship and then as
part of this they can if they won't have
an industry mentor and what i did there
was the person then came here for an
internship i hosted them we work
together and you know so there i
participate in their development of an
engineer but also during their PhD when
sometimes they have implementation
choices or they are wondering what
systems to contribute to then i might be
able to point out while he
are some open source project that we
also contribute to and you know I might
be able to run experiments for you at
some stage if you want to write a paper
and so on so all of these are activities
that I can participate in as an industry
mentor our next question is from David
are their positions at Google that are
closer to the academic blue sky research
that you can talk about so I am not
entirely sure what academic blue sky
here means because we do have long-term
projects so already Safe Browsing was
one example it is definitely applied but
something in shares with some academic
projects is it's been running for more
than seven years I believe I know that
there are people with you know PhDs and
say mathematics and fundamental sciences
and we do have life sciences teams that
do research in those areas within
computer science and not entirely sure
and you know I should confess ignorance
here I know that there are people who
have done things like post quantum
cryptography research which I believe
are not about you know producing
production systems because we don't have
production level quantum computers here
so that that is an example of something
i would consider blue sky academic
research but as a rule that's not what
people in general even people with PhDs
do want to be next question could you
tell us more about why you decided to
consider coming to Google and what
factors and considerations led you here
right so a lot of it was about personal
happiness and personal effectiveness so
I try to say well you know what
configuration of my day-to-day life
allows me to maximize my research output
engage my brain in ways that keep me
happy and productive and able to
contribute to the community or the kind
of you know sea of knowledge that I
would like to give back to but also keep
me happy in the process so something
that really bothered me is
there were some topics that I'd like to
lock work on at the intersection of
logic and algebra which weren't very
fashionable and it was very difficult to
publish their and so I wanted to not
have the kind of research that I did be
necessarily tied to my ability to put
food on my table right so I wanted to
decouple these two and I found that very
liberating after coming here that there
is work i do and i enjoy doing and i get
paid for and i can set time aside to do
any kind of research any kind of
absolutely fundamental or esoteric
research that I want and I can also do
more applied research as part of my
regular job so that that was a very big
factor for me the other factor is that I
was a researcher in programming
languages and often we would write
abstracts or introduction saying well
these are the kind of problems engineer
space in industry and I well you know I
need to find out if these are really the
problems that enter your space and I
want to go out there into the field in
the wild and be an engineer for a while
and see what it's like so I didn't come
here thinking I would stay here for as
long as I have I came here mainly to be
a sort of alien visitor and be able to
go back and write in my papers like well
I have seen the truth and you should
listen to me but I was happy enough and
able to do the things I wanted to hear
that I continue then stay oh really glad
you're an alien consider just a couple
more questions what are some of the
biggest challenges your team expects to
face over the next couple of years um so
Google is investing in a large way in
everything related to the cloud I'm in a
team that is concerned with security and
privacy and developing tools for
security and privacy so you know a
challenge that we always have at the
back of our minds is what our security
and privacy issues related to
cloud-based services and that's that's
the sort of big picture thing that
you're thinking about now and the other
thing that is inescapable if you've
listened to any technical messaging from
google is machine learning so Google
invest a lot in machine learning
produces a lot of machine learning
infrastructure and we are also
constantly looking
four ways in which you can make systems
more secure and safe using our machine
learning technology and then the last
question I know you mentioned this in
some of your earlier slides about health
freedom can be complex but how much
freedom do you have in choosing the
direction of your work so typically what
happens is our organization is working
on certain projects as expertise and
certain project and so we will work in
that area and there are certain needs
that come to us from more senior
leadership but I have found that and I'm
usually at least my inclination is I'm
happy to work on anything I have been
able to find research level scope and
whatever problem has been given to me
and nobody has told me how to solve a
problem I've been usually told well
here's a problem that we need to solve
and I usually have flexibility in
choosing the exact way in which I solve
the problem this applies to projects
where you largely start maybe from the
ground up or only a little bit of
infrastructure exists sometimes a
project has been running for a long time
in which case you can't just you know
put on everything to the ground and
start from scratch and there are many
more constraints especially depending on
you know what infrastructure has been
used and was using that kind of project
and that's that's just part of the job
well thank you so much thank all of you
for watching and a huge sinking of a day
our wonderful speaker one last reminder
if you are interested in opportunities
for a Google the software engineering
internship application for PhDs closes
january thirty first and we do have
full-time software engineering roles
available for PhDs all of these roles
and all of our other rules can be found
