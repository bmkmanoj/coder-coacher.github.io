countries from all over Europe and
Russia from 36 different universities

all the ears the things that we do in
google movement anything is worried
about the caliber of the people that we
bring into our team it's incredibly
important to us we want the very very
best and we want to try and change the
world in the future we've been very very
happy with the caliber of students you
know usually we get very very
inspirational see students who do want
to be leaders who want to be inspired

today it's not an exception would have
really really good bunch of very
motivated people
I'm really excited to learn more in
depth technical aspects of Google a
company like Google it's not hard to
market everyone knows you know it's
google it's amazing but you have to
really be the face of that you have to
make sure you're aligned with that and
that you have that initiative and that
enthusiasm and creativity that they're
looking for
i'm looking forward to learning about
both digital marketing and computer
science being from a computer science
background I'm interested to know what
Google can show me anything new
different products Google is developing
here and what they can offer for
different universities well first of all
you get to actually experience the old
google philosophy all the enthusiasm
types in here even from the top managers
that have talked to us at Google you
really see that all the statue here and
the internet it's is actually like that
and so I really want to bring all the
enthusiasm from them directly to the
University</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
