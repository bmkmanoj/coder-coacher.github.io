another Google hangout on air by the
Google student site pretty excited to be
hanging out with a bunch of my buddies
from our Belo Horizonte office somewhere
I haven't been yet but I'm looking
forward to being invited there maybe or
maybe not after this conversation but
regardless wanted to introduce everyone
Brian why don't we just start with you
you can introduce yourself and we'll
just start chatting about what it's like
Donna Bella all right
hello people my name is Brian Zacky I
lead engineering recruiting for Latin
America I've been working at Google for
a little over six years now the first
two of those years I worked in Google's
New York office and a little over four
years ago I transferred to Belo
Horizonte awesome Lauren you wanna show
yourself - hi I'm Lara I'm soft engineer
I work Bello ever since I started
working at Google in three years ago I
grew up in Bell and I've also had a
surgery Ethel before I John Bell in
Malta - yes cool we're going to talk
about that later
Rafael yeah say I'm Rafael I'm actually
from by year in a move to Bello - to
join Google four years ago I'm a
software engineer working on Google Plus
and Fred okay my name is fragile
Federico I started in Google four years
ago I used to be an engineer in the ads
team I just moved to the search quality
team I went to ufmg my studies awesome
that's very cool and now um I mean I
guess so the first I want to talk about
is you know what's it tell me a little
bit about the you know the area and the
office and stuff I don't know maybe Fred
you want to get us started just sort of
what the office is like and where you
guys are located in time ok so hello is
a disaster
kind of is mojo medium-sized obviously
we have or big areas here which are
search quality social do
and adds well I think the opposite looks
like a family and we have few groups of
Googlers that hang out every week
together we have a few group group of
Googlers who plays sports together like
volleyball soccer climbing and we do a
lot of fun stuff here very cool and I
mean is that a lot of as a lot of that
stuff sort of in the office or is it
stuff that you guys are organized on
your own anybody can answer that it's
mostly stuff we organize on our own and
and but usually we live the support of
the office and with the people at the
office and there's because it's the
offices look at it in a really nice
neighborhood and there's a lot of stuff
around you it should be like like
climbing the you know soccer courts and
volleyball courts very cool and now
Bryan I'm guessing this is kind of a
question for you know a lot of the
people that we hire in the Velo office
today are they local we relocate a lot
of people sort of a mix of both what
sort of so the office started about six
and a half years ago and I would say in
the early stages we tended to hire a
little bit more from local areas in belo
horizonte minas gerais as we began to
grow we branched out a good amount I'd
say now the majority of the engineers
hire relocate here from other parts
other cities in Brazil or other
countries so we have a pretty
international feel now and we have
Google is obviously in Brazil we also
have Googlers from Peru Colombia France
the US Germany Holland it's a pretty
international feel here and a nice mix
between locals those from other parts of
Brazil and international engineers cool
and now Laura you're from Belo has it
been was it kind of an interesting it
like wow there's like this Google office
in my hometown kind of thing or how did
the how did that go for you yes
that the office lucky is my towel but I
was also pleasure to know that many of
my coworkers are not from Balaam and so
they are living here and in life here
they love you I mean I'm pretty wise to
talk about the city does it go at you
yeah that's why you're here with us cuz
you're behind us right absolutely
I'm feeling a lot better looking for for
having Google here in my series on close
to my family but in the other hand I
have made many friends from our Brazil
and also from India and France and you a
sauna yeah thank you
like Rafal to reload there yeah so I
moved here four years ago and I actually
really love the place it's a really nice
city to live in and it's big enough it's
there's a lot of stuff to do there's a
know like theater of bars restaurants
and a lot of stuff to do on the other
hand it's not too big like traffic's
still manageable we actually live near
the office so it's not like a 40-minute
commute or anything like it's it's a
really good balance it's just like the
Boston office not cool now I want to
just sort of jump around a little bit
and hit you guys actually all with the
same questions I'm kind of curious as to
what you're gonna say and we'll do Brian
last because I'm sure he has a lot to
say because he's recruiter so we'll
start with Fred I guess sort of you know
when you're thinking about the office
right and all those sort of cool stuff
in there is there sort of one thing that
when you come in you're like yeah that's
that's the coolest thing in the office
you notice it I don't know what it is so
I'm asking okay mmm tough questions yeah
this is hard work
besides beneficial odd Oh on Friday can
I go first well he didn't end with my
answer no I hate this I really like the
people I work down here especially I the
old guys I did the old Googlers from the
batteries
chop see they have a lot of their ever
have helpful right they when you start
here you'll have a lot of help from
these guys they are really willing to
make you feel like you are part of the
team you are important here and they
have a lot of knowledge to share and
they teach you a lot I think this is
very available cool so really good sort
of team building here tight environment
cool lore about you ok so I really like
lots of stuff lots of stuff we have the
offices the food here is amazing it's
really good that means I've been to many
Google offices and I'm really lots of
food here I mean I'm biased again it's
fantastic food and massages I mean what
more could you ask for at work
yeah and I also I feel that because the
offices is mall I know everybody's they
also I have like the freedom to talk to
anybody I want like three lunch we
pretty much have a event because
everybody just talks everybody cool I
didn't love working how about Rafa how
about you your product and it's gonna
tell me all about your cool project and
how you just like to work all the time
yeah exactly yeah someone has to like to
work part of it no no honestly like I
think Fred put it really well like the
people the people that were here before
I came we're really welcoming so that
was really good I really like the fact
that what we do is hard and challenging
and it actually matters it affects like
millions and millions and hundreds of
regions of people so that's really
rewarding and I really like the
atmosphere of the office so it's it's on
the one hand it's really challenging and
real impactful on the other hand it
feels like home because the people that
were here already
we're really welcoming and the new
people that come here always looking you
know like to make friends so so it you
get like this really good balance of
like doing things that matter and
feeling well at work awesome
it's great Brian do you have anything
you want to add to that before we yeah I
definitely like the fact that the office
is still a size where we all know
everyone and there isn't somebody else
that still very much a family feel to
the office at the same time I like the
fact that I can still have that kind of
a global impact while working in an
office with a small family feel so
moving from New York from the Google New
York office to Bello you know it was one
of the things I wasn't really expecting
but I'd say the impact that I have on a
global scale is probably larger after I
transferred then even before so that's
one of the things I like I'd say another
thing I like is it's a collection of
really smart people here that are in a
loose structured environment I don't
think this kind of loose structured
environment would work at all companies
because sometimes when you lack
structure you have some people that kind
of you know you have a lack of I know
but the fact is based on the profile of
the people that we hire we tend to hire
people that are very very intelligent
and motivated so putting that putting
them in that environment with kind of a
lack of structure kind of enhances their
creativity more and allows them to
produce more so there's nobody ever
standing over your shoulder here but
nobody needs so I think that's really
one of the nicest things for me working
here cool very cool and now now that
we're sort of now we're starting to get
into the meeting of like you know
producing I want to chat a little bit
about sort of some of the work you guys
do and you know Laura I'm gonna start
with you because I'm gonna pick on you
now um you know would love you I know
your software engineering you work on
Google Maps just sort of tell us a
little bit about you know what you guys
do and you know why it's so cool besides
all the obvious reasons that would be
really helpful um well like a like
Raphael and Bryan said like it's daytime
we can work in this mall office and it
was so much impact all over the world so
in the beginning my team was Fox focused
on a lot and to prove Google Maps for
Latin American countries but now every
project we do we are focusing
so we always tried to prove to everybody
not just us here I really loved it right
so a lot of the work you guys are doing
is not you know localization are sort of
just specific to Brazil but you know
global Google products that are sort of
being worked out of that office which is
awesome
yes very cool usually starts with the
problem we have here but we can
generalize it in the fly - oh cool
that's great and Rafael you work on
Google+ yes the Hangout feature can you
talk about what you do or is that yeah I
can talk a little bit so we actually
work on a few features on on Google+ we
work on you know like pages and and a
bunch of other features that sadly I
can't talk about it's it's very fun it's
it's really good and and the fact that
it's it's a global effort and it it you
know hits millions and millions of users
and it's a really high energy
environment really like Brian mentioned
like high creative creativity so it's
really rewarding cool
now see I feel next time I asked you if
you invented something you totally take
credit for Fred you work in search there
right yes that's quality no that's
probably all you can say right yeah
that's it seem bad they scare up
google.com right cool and if you do a
lot of work with other offices inside a
villa or just yes we do a lot of foreign
cliff mountain field these days okay and
but in the past I used to work on the
Adsense team which is the team that
takes care of Google money and at that
time we did a lot of work with the New
York of C and also the bank dollar off
see from from India and my
okay cool and Brian you recruit people
yeah that's next question cool well
we're actually if you guys can believe
it about halfway done or hang out
so I'm flies in these things as we found
and what I usually like to do at the
halfway point is just sort of remind
people that are joining us late that
you're watching other hangout on air by
the Google student site talking with a
bunch of different folks from across the
organization in our Belo Horizonte
office and what I like to do is start
taking questions live so we have a bunch
that have come in and they're queued up
and usually I found the best way to do
is just sort of poke around and take up
one by one and we'll just have a little
bit of fun and answer some questions
from people who are out there asking
questions and Brian this one probably
starts with you
it's from fleet and he's actually in
Bello and he wants to know what kind of
jobs did the engineers do which I think
we talked about a little bit of time
with the projects but sort of at a high
level what kind of jobs to the engineers
do and has sort of follow on from there
so they do they develop or update
services for all Google and I think
we've talked about that too but just a
little
a little brush-up from they would be
great yeah so it's um the work that we
do here it's it's not oriented around
taking products and features that exist
and putting a you know Brazilian or
Latin kind of swing on it right this is
core product development that we do here
that has an impact on our global user
base so the efforts that we make on our
core products and projects that we work
on they're affecting users all around
the world so and we talked a little bit
about the projects that we work on in
the office and I think we have pretty
balanced representation from all of our
teams yeah I'd say that's a pretty much
of a lot of the software engineering job
do you guys have a lot of them sales or
are there opportunities um no we don't
actually our sales and marketing office
in Brazil is located in Sao Paulo here
it's predominantly engineering with some
product management some design and some
support positions as well like Human
Resources facilities but it's
predominantly engineering here okay
cool we have another project and other
questions about projects and
opportunities which will sort of poke
through it's from Nikolas he wants to
know what projects engineers work on and
we talked a little bit earlier but I
guess I'm gonna spin it a little bit has
anybody and I don't know the answer I'm
totally not prepped for this has anybody
or any of you guys worked like 20% time
on other projects within other groups or
that sort of thing have you you know
outside of your core job if you had a
chance to work on other Google products
Fred you're nodding your head so go do
that okay so during the last two years I
worked on a project with two other
engineers it's completely outside our
our job and it's mostly focused on
research and well we just published the
paper in a conference it's gonna take
place in two weeks in France in Leon
that that was the product of our
research and it was a 20% project cool
mmm Lauren maybe you guys we've got
sentronics on project before sort of
thing cool
fair enough I don't mean it's one of
those things that sort of comes and goes
right cool okay like it not yeah right
exactly right you're baking something
we're gonna get it together something
with Brian to help recruiting we have a
question from Leonardo that I think we
can talk about a little bit the question
is is Google always looking for the
perfect match and Brian you're drinking
so I won't start with you you're always
looking for a perfect match I'd be
drinking a lot more I guarantee no the
fact of the matter is if we were always
looking for a perfect match we'd have a
very very very small office right so the
work we do developing internet products
on this scale that we develop and for
the user base that we develop there
aren't too many people that come from
that precise background so what do we
look for instead inexperienced
candidates we look more for what we
consider transferable
right there's going to be ramped up time
to kind of call it to speed but if we
feel the experience can transfer well
and math well to us that's something for
students on the other hand we look for a
strong mastery of computer science
fundamentals a good understanding of
algorithms knowledge of data structures
in how to apply them strong programming
skills understanding of complexity
analysis not only the ability to develop
solutions but also to develop them
keeping in mind system constraints
trade-offs these are things that are
critical when we're working with the
user base that we're working with in the
products on the scale that we develop in
terms of new graduates obviously we're
not expecting the full picture
we don't expect new graduates to have
experience designing large-scale systems
on the scale that we do again is
transferable experience having a good
understanding of computer science
fundamentals and being able to apply
those computer science fundamentals to
real-world problems cool yeah an extra
grind we just had the question come in
sort of real-time while you're talking
specifically for you um your famous man
um like the question is what sort of
opportunities are you know are you
actually recruiting for now is it
full-time internships you know software
engineers new grads what you know what
are you guys looking for I know yeah so
we're looking for software engineers who
were experienced I'd say the bulk of the
hires that we make here are new
graduates campus recruiting is a large
part of our recruiting efforts for a
year and we also have internships here
in software engineering we tend to look
for graduate students in computer
science those pursuing a master's or
maybe a doctorate that tends to be the
profile we look for for internships and
given that we have four main projects
that we work on here I'd say the number
of internship opportunities that we have
is limited but we still do have
internships available okay awesome and
we actually had another question come in
while we were talking again
that that you know I think that we
actually can we're going to not have
Brian enter first we're gonna start with
with Raphael it and you know just
something quick it doesn't need to be
crazy but it's the the question is do
you have any any you know tips to offer
us related to the hiring process or how
my resume should look that kind of thing
I mean you know do you have something
Raphael that when you see a resume go
yeah that this is going to be at your
candidate I think I think having
real-world experience is good like
programming if if you're still in
college try to try to I don't know open
source projects or try to actually do
real world coding that's always good and
having a strong like algorithm
background is good programming challenge
competition like a lot of people here
you know I did them while they were in
college and they're really good at jam
or something like that so Jim yes yeah
yeah and yeah I think I think those are
really late for it especially for new
grads right which is Brian mentioned
like a lot of our a lot of our incoming
people are new grads I think I think
those are really good like things
producing that you know resume awesome
Lauren do you have any things that you
camp out again I guess I second what I
fell just said believe a technical
background is the most important there
and I get I guess you can't get that
from Yoko
really yeah so I guess my way of getting
the real work Cody was by doing my turn
chief Atlee
because I went to drama school and so
you interned in the Mountain View office
before going back develop hmm yes cool
did you have a lot of takeaways from
that experience you must have must've
been quite that all right the tricks
yeah you must find a treat always live
in Bello and then I spent six months in
Mountain View that was great I learned a
lot but I still love working here
absolutely now Fred do you have any any
tips for folks that are looking to apply
the resume or in their interviewing sure
so as hi file said I think it's
important to to make sure you had some
real work done so if you had the
opportunity to work and open source
private products or projects you could
link these in your CV also if we're
doing a masters or a PhD and you have
the potential to work on some papers are
joining conference
you should also remark these on your on
your CV
and the other thing is that but to make
a simple CV simple to understand and
become right through the interview don't
be afraid of the engineers because we
are cool guys Brian D of anything you
want to add to those those are pretty
good yeah I think they covered pretty
much everything on this this is where I
shamelessly plug the recruiter tips and
trick blog that we did last fall there's
actually a lot of information on the
Google students blog about preparing for
interviews and writing a resume and that
sort of thing and that's not good
resource - so cool all right we've got
another question that just came in it's
actually a pretty easy one what sort of
the typical size of a team in the Bello
office is it you big small medium
anybody want to tackle that one oh cool
so typically all the teams are very
small and so for instance I work
directly with two other guys plus some
guys who are in Mountain View these days
so the fact that the team is small it's
good for speed right - for
decision-making it's it's very selective
on these two guys that you are right but
you guys roll into a bigger team right
so you're able to have that really big
impact for being a small team yes
yeah so usually try to do that just play
it like big teams that work on big
things into small chunks that plate
focus teams can work on and with our
main focus areas that we have here there
are many subgroups within those areas
right so multiple projects underneath
for bigger projects then I'll roll into
a much bigger initiative so you can have
that big sort of global impact with a
small local team you guys are all
nodding awesome
very very cool and we have another
question from Victor which is the office
have trainee jobs on a Brian if you want
to start to tackle that one real quick
yeah I mean if the interpretation the
question is internships yes we do and
given our size we don't have a very
large number of internships but they are
available and then we kind of discussed
the profile a little bit before yeah I
would imagine to a sort of a trainee job
is kind of a entry level you know
someone's graduated from school they're
relatively you know fresh out of school
you might consider that a trainee job
too so it seems like there actually are
a lot of opportunities for folks yeah
cool cool cool so we are actually just
about done there's like two minutes left
in our hangout and this is when I make
up questions usually and so what I
wanted to do is just if you guys could
give me you know one sort of tip for
people that are that are listening as to
sort you know why they should come to
Brazil enjoy the Belo office what would
it be besides working with all you guys
and uh Fred we're gonna start with you
because you laughed at my jokes oh you
one tip one one reason is that Brazil is
growing a lot so is our op C and er have
a lot of nice projects to be developing
here and we have nice guys like us a
beli reason
sounds good good answer Laurie gonna
tackle one I'm sure I guess adding to
what Francis said I mean the office
itself is amazing there is lots of work
working here yeah and you get to work a
very cool project and you go up there so
it's awesome yeah you know uh Raphael
yeah it's gonna be repetitive I guess
it's okay I think the main thing is that
it's it's the really nice place outside
and inside the office so it's even
coming from a different city it's it's a
really nice city to be in and if you're
coming from another country people say
Brazil is a nice place to and we have a
lot of foreigners here and I enjoyed to
move so I think that outside the office
is a really nice place to be in and
inside the office is it's just awesome
it's it's awesome people it's by great
projects with impact and challenges
every day and it's a really nice
environment great food the eventual
massage you know I think it's a it's a
pretty compelling package cool awesome
Brian you want to finish this off with
that last question or I think for for
foreigners living here and I can speak
from that perspective like Fred said
there's there's a lot of energy in
Brazil right now you know you can feel
the energy everywhere around the economy
is building and growing I'm an exciting
time to be here so being a part of that
is a really nice experience for me I
think in terms of those who live in
Brazil one of the nice things is you can
continue to work in Brazil and maintain
that proximity to your friends and
family at the same time working on
global products with huge impact and
having an international experience in
terms of travel opportunities there's a
ton I mean I think this is the first
time I've seen Hoffa in the office and
yeah there's a lot of interaction
collaboration with different offices
across the globe
and you're going to travel a ton if that
you're looking for while maintaining
Netflix and video friends and family and
working in office with a family feel
awesome very cool well we are officially
done so before I head in the broadcast I
just want to thank you guys for spending
the last half hour with me really
appreciate it it's uh it's uh I mean
it's an honor for me to be honest to get
to chat with people from all around
these different offices it's so cool so
thank you very much and again this is
Jeff Moore just wrapping up our hangout
on air with the Belo Horizonte office
and you guys have a good rest of your
day and hopefully I'll see y'all soon
thanks thank you Jeff see you guys sir
ah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
