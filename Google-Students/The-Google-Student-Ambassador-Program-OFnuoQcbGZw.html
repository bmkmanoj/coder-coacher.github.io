for students to be liaisons between
Google and the University essentially
they're gonna be the Google
representatives on campus we have 125
ambassadors from 85 schools having all
the ambassadors in one room was just
amazing to see my name is Jessica levis
I go to Emory University Brian Gomez
Duke University my name is Robert
Fischer I go to San Jose State
University my name is Jessica I'm a
senior at UC Berkeley the University of
Chicago my name is david icke inin my
name is min Jae Lee I'm gonna be a
junior and northwest university this is
a network of 125 really motivated really
smart students who are well connected on
campus I mean these are the people with
the power so you tell them something
that's cool and interesting they tell a
hundred of their friends and it's just
this network that continues to multiply
the Ambassador Program is basically the
eyes and ears for Google on our campus
it essentially enables them and empowers
them to go out to their campus and
understand firsthand the needs and
challenges that they face on campus and
actually execute change he's the
ambassador's or extensions of what we're
able to do to get the word out about
student opportunity for the students
it's a great opportunity for them to
learn more about google and to kind of
you know have a venue to and channel to
kind of express their passion for goal
and really channel that into something
that's beneficial for both their
campuses and for us and you know they'll
have so much fun doing it
we have a story to you on campus so I
think on that front we're ahead of other
campuses but i'm looking into a lot of
product demos for a lot of these new
apps that are coming out our group when
we were planning events decided to do a
water balloon fight and kind of fun in
the sun events so really incorporating
fun which really is a main component of
Google's culture with promoting their
products now our products are so viral
and our programs are so viral in nature
that it really only takes one one true
fan to kind of like this whole fire at
schools that we don't go to and there's
quite a few that we don't just because
we can't get there we can use them to
brand so they can get out there they
have all this knowledge they've been at
Google they understand it they drank the
kool-aid they know what's up and they
can get out there and they can talk to
students in their own words we are
saying an increase in the number of
applications that come through I would
definitely see more attendance to
on-campus events like technical talks or
ice cream socials where we're using our
ambassadors and partnering with them to
build awareness around when we do come
on campus we had a activity for the
student ambassadors where we sent them
all docs water bottles we sent them a
list of activities and we said give
these docs water balls away from free
and then we looked at the results to see
how many more people were using Google
Docs which was way beyond our
expectations some of the most successful
events I held word doc Ock's and gmail
and other Google product training
sessions after I got a lot of forms
filled out from a lot of students I got
tons of people to come to this event
there
forms we have pizza I they asked me to
talk about the Google internship program
I was the first intern from my
university as well so it was like very
engaging I felt like it was like an hour
and a half to our event when I was
scheduled for just 30 minutes The
Ambassadors in the student population on
campus is our next group of users so if
we're not focusing on those students
then we're essentially missing out on a
huge user group that's 120 Google
enthusiasts who are really excited about
talking about Google products and they
know a lot of people and there tend to
be student leaders and it's basically
the perfect audience to be promoting
your products to we have more
ambassadors this year than we did last
year we have double the number of
applications I think these students seem
so fired up that we're gonna have way
more events way more enthusiasm I'm just
excited to be a campus ambassador I'm
ready to get back to school and might
still be part of like the Googleplex we
love you google
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
