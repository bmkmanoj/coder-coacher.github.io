the third and final part
go MC learning series for those of you
just joining us the gon c learning
series is essentially a you know a
program we kind of started to you know

you know how adwords works and how to
optimize you know your campaigns and
things of that nature for those of you
just joining the go MC process or
interested in participating in the
Google online marketing challenge

marketing and utilize Adwords and
Google+ in kind of a real-world way so
there's a pretty great prizes and about
50,000 students have participated so
pretty neat opportunity for everyone
here so coming back to the kind of
learning series here today we're going
to talk about measuring your success and
a little bit about optimizing your
campaigns optimizations pretty important
because it basically you can utilize
your data to hopefully make your
spending a little bit more efficient my
name is Brian and AJ as well as joining
us today great so if we go to the next
slide I wanted to talk a little bit more
about you know kind of our agenda for
today the first thing is to talk a
little bit about what are optimizations
the second thing is to talk about you
know what are some of the campaign
settings you can adjust to help with
optimizing your campaign the third thing
is kind of utilizing the the numbers
right the data and how to react to it
and you know the final thing is just
talking a little bit more about you know
what are some of the secret ingredients
to success or the google on my marketing
challenge next slide alrighty hi
everybody like Brian said my name is AJ
I'm a part of the AdWords team here at
Google and I'm also part of the Google
online marketing challenges so I'm happy
to talk to you guys today so what is an
optimization as you'll see here there
are a couple important things that you
should consider the first is the
advertising goal does the business
you're working with r instance just won
a lot of clicks do they won't travel to
their website or do they want people to
sign up to their newsletters or purchase
the products that they sell I'm from
there you want to consider a count
structure
then you want to look at keywords and
bids add text and ultimately CPA by CPA
we mean cost per acquisition so for
those of you that are tracking the
selling of products like hats or
backpacks you want to see if you're able
to sell those products at a price that's
profitable for your company so those are
all the things on the higher level to
consider when optimizing the campaign
next slide please great so how do how do
you decide what to optimize so
essentially you want to look at three
big factors to figure out which
campaigns are kind of right for for some
changes the first is low click-through
rate so essentially if you're seeing a
the benchmark our benchmark
click-through rate is around 1 percent
but depending on the business it could
be a little bit higher a little bit
lower depending on the settings and the
keywords but if you do find a campaign I
could use a little bit more work locally
through rate is one one metric to look
at on the second thing is too little
traffic so if you if you find that
you're not seeing the the number of
impressions and clicks that you would
expect to get based on how your bidding
this would be a good candidate for the
kind of optimization I'm in the last
thing which again goes back to cost per
acquisition is if you see a high CPA so
if you've spoken with your business and
they say that for each lead each
backpack each shoe that they want to
sell they want it to cost ten dollars
per per backpack they sell if you see a
campaign that is you know has a CPA of
twenty dollars per backpack then you
want to look inside of that campaign and
see what you can do to hopefully improve
performance there next slide please sure
so after talking about that now we
should talk about a couple areas for
optimization here you'll see there are
three main buckets location products and
seasonality and just to speak a little
bit more about them in terms of location
you can consider things like geographic
settings or keywords I'm so you might
wonder in order to optimize you know
where is your campaign performing best
if you're targeting all the United
States is it performing better in
certain states like California or Texas
if so what might you do creatively to
improve performance in those key states
since it's doing really
for you I'm in terms of products here
you want to look at things like ad
groups keywords and bids so if for
instance you have one ad group that's
doing really well you might consider
investing more in the ad group raising
the bids or adding a couple more
keywords I mean lastly seasonality so
these are the external things that might
affect the performance of the campaign
so you might want to consider time of
year for instance if you're selling
backpacks you might be selling more
right before the school season starts or
you might be something more Christmas
gifts so those definitely are different
variables that affect the company's
campaign on the next slide please great
so you know when it comes to seeing
where the you know what geographic
locations to target the dimensions tab
within AdWords is a really good way to
see which states cities countries are
doing well for you it's kind of in the
middle row of great times it's all the
way on the right and you can sort by
different either by day or by time
there's a little view drop-down and you
can click on so that you can see the
geographic data and that's where you can
kind of been sort and see like it click
through rate is the most important thing
for you and you want to find the state
cities or countries that have the
highest click-through rate you can sort
by that find those states or countries
and then create a separate campaign if
that's the strategy you want to pursue
or you may want to just raise bids on
you know ad groups targeting those
different localities so there's a lot of
different things you can do with the
data but we wanted to kind of point out
where you can find it next slide so here
like we talked about already some ways
that you can optimize or for just to the
keywords so if you look at the left
you'll see a funnel so at the very top
or all the people that are on google the
very bottom or of the people who are on
google which ones click your ad in order
to make sure that you successfully get
the right users on google to click on
your ad you obviously want to make sure
that you have the right keywords so a
couple questions to consider here are
you know who are my potential customers
and what keywords with a search for in
google if you're selling you know shoes
and what kind of keywords are they
are they searching for is it by shoes
you know where to buy shoes etc and then
in order to determine how well your
keywords are doing you want to look at
some key metrics so you'll see on the
right side we have click-through rate
and search volume and impression share
I'm so click the rate for example
explains up the times your ad shows on
Google how often does a person click on
it so a one-percent click the rate would
mean you know one percent of the time
that your ad shows somebody clicks you
want that number to be higher so use
that information to determine which
keywords need to fix if you have a
really low click-through rate you might
need a new keyword instead next slide
please great so you know based on that
information you've identified keywords
that have high click-through rate low
click-through rate high you know traffic
load traffic etc what are some of the
levers or key tools that you can utilize
within AdWords to to kind of optimized
or you know focus on what's working so
the first thing you can do is add
negatives that was something we
mentioned in the previous previous
learning series and so essentially what
you can do is identify keywords that
have no you know low clicks or no clicks
things of that nature and then add them
as negatives or pause them the next
thing is focus on what's working so if
something's driving a lot of traffic and
your client is saying this you know
we're getting a lot of good results from
this keyword or the set of keywords you
might consider raising bids on those
keywords localize if you know there's an
ad group or set of keywords that are
spending a lot of money but not
achieving your business goals then you
might consider lowering those bits or
pausing not angry you know one thing
that you definitely want to keep in mind
is not have duplicate key words across
your account so each each keyword should
be bucketed within one campaign and so
that way you know which which keyword is
working without having them split apart
and separated from each other the final
thing is you know once you've added
keywords your job might not be done you
might consider adding new keywords just
like you consider you know taking out
keywords with negatives so if you know
you're not getting enough traffic you
might
so adding some more relevant keywords to
hopefully get more business for your
client next slide please sure and as
pointed out before you definitely want
to make sure that you can optimize based
on seasonality again those are the
external events that that might affect
the performance of your AdWords account
so for something to consider would be
you know real real world events if
you're selling a product like umbrellas
I'm going to know that it's going to be
no rainy in the location you know where
you're actually selling that product you
might want to spend you might want to
focus more you know on that campaign you
might want to add a couple more keywords
make expand your ad scheduling because
you know you're going to have that much
more traffic I'm next please and then
you'd also want to consider vacation you
know are the people that you're
targeting traveling if so let's say that
you're targeting during spring break you
might want to consider targeting your
campaigns in a different location you
want to find where your customers are or
where your users are to make sure that
they're going to see your ad at that
place next please and then you also want
to consider other factors so here you
should think you know creatively out of
the box to see what else you could do to
adjust your AdWords campaign in order to
improve performance I'm let's say for
instance that you know a technology
company like Google is announcing a new
product and your advertising something
you know related to technology or that
product you might want to talk about
that in your ads add some keywords
related to it because you know people
will be on google com looking for
relevant information that's a way to put
your product or your ad I'm in front of
the very users you'd like to attract
next please and lastly are shopping
holidays you know our users interested
in your clients products or services I'm
so let's say that you know its fourth of
July and your product has some value for
that holiday I'm not something you want
to consider maybe you should write some
ads that talk about what july and how
your product can be used during that
holiday I'm clearly seasonality offers
you many different ways in order to
adjust your AdWords campaign to perform
better next slide please great and then
the kind of final word that we wanted to
talk about and I think that's
probably one of the keys to success here
is experimenting so data you know can
give you a bit of the story right but as
AdWords optimizers as you know being
representatives for your clients you
want to make meaning of that data so if
click-through rate is high how do you
act on that how do you build an online
marketing strategy that you know focus
is on what's working and what's not so
that's one way to kind of look at you
know how you expand that the next factor
you want to make sure you're doing is
getting statistical significance so you
try a strategy I would also recommend
you know letting it run its course for
at least a few days just to make sure
that you know we've factored out
seasonality and that we're making sure
that you know common variables kind of
smooth themselves out and then you know
then after you've gotten some
statistical significance then you can
look and see if you need to change your
strategy or pursue it further and lastly
is creativity so I think you know some
of the most successful campaigns out
there in the online marketing world just
have a little touch of creativity that
you know maybe someone hasn't thought of
yet or it takes you know kind of takes
advantage of a piece of information in a
really new way so I think that's really
kind of the key to success is being
creative making a little of your data
and making sure you have statistical
significance to make sure you you know
you focus on what's working next slide
please and so I think that kind of wraps
up our Google on my marketing challenge
