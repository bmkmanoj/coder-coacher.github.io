Google ambassador just to help raise
awareness of Google products basically
just to sort of share my passion with
others and also like get people excited
about it I'm here to understand more
about Google's products what Google does
in a behind the scenes and get more caps
as involved in various different
programs really really exciting stuff
happening here at Google Australia are
going to learn a lot about in the coming
days as a student I guess it really
makes a lot of sense so you're using
Google's products i love google products
because they make my life easy dead
simple straightforward to use by helping
other students and staff to realize that
it will also make them it's a lot easier
so that's the plan over the next few
years you're going to see some pretty
amazing things happen where your social
network is going to basically inform
your decision making so social will be
integrated in absolutely everything you
do Google Apps to get up and running
especially for small businesses is
really simple it's obviously completely
mobile it's very much about social and
of course very much about the cloud
I guess I get to go back to my campus
and tell anybody else that result the
throat of the insulin campus and just
get what we already have in hand for
everybody Google is a little bit crazy
and that's great that's awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
