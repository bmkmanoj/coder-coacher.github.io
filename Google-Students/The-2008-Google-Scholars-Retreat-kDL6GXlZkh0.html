community of students to get together
and talk about technology one of the
great things about going to these kinds
of events is we get to revive our own
energy and interest in the field and
what the promise is of tomorrow another
thing is that we're able to support
students in their studies with in a
financial way but also in creating
global and local communities diversity
is fundamental to everything that we do
at Google our overall mission is to all
the world's information useful and
accessible and so that we mean all the
world and everybody and every person
would be able to access this stuff if we
want to have products that work for
everybody in the world we need to have
all kinds of people on our tapes because
we need to have different points of view
its skills and talents and and all of
that here we have the privilege of
hosting 88 students today that represent
really a cross-section of the diversity
of our computer science industry
I've always loved technology when I was
younger my mom said she always knew that
I was going to be an engineer and it
kind of stuck with me so when it was
time to apply I knew I liked computers
so I checked computer science and
engineering I'm trimming get so excited
um at heart I'm an entrepreneur so being
here with Google and thinking about what
Larry and Sergey did just out of
Stanford just like me is really
extremely exciting they get the
opportunity to interact with people
beyond the academic sphere and also in
the professional sphere and see kind of
cutting-edge work in the computer
science field and also interact with
peer mentors so they have the experience
of both appear and professional mentors
speaking and asking questions with the
panelists but at this point I'm really
excited because I'm hoping to become a
professor and a researcher and I want
really want to continue to mentor
younger students at the moment I'm
working with a lot of middle school
girls but I hope to work with high
schoolers and eventually college
undergrads to excite them about feel the
way that I'm excited what we really
stress is the opportunity for them to
get to know each other and to meet each
other so Google in a sense is
facilitating this but it's really all
about them one of the things I've taken
away from it is how everyone is very
passionate about the things that they're
doing and the ability for them to work
together in a community environment and
to be able to collaborate with each
other and have the freedom it needs to
have that collaboration and not have
barriers built up that are in
workplaces I think it's wonderful when
the people who sponsor these
scholarships you actually get to meet
with those people because you know you
do want to thank them and you do want to
show them that youth they made a really
good investment in you and so just being
here at Google and getting to meet the
teams and getting to actually see the
google culture it's actually been an
invaluable experience so I'm really
excited to be here
and so we've got three different groups
here actually we have our needlework
scholars who are women studying computer
science who were supporting we have our
scholarship recipients through our
partnership with the United Negro
College Fund and the Hispanic college
fund as well and by bringing them
together we're celebrating the
achievements of these students who are
underrepresented within the field but
are getting recognized by Google and we
want to be able to support that and help
them network and form a community with
each other we have now graduated really
over 360,000 students in our in our
history and these are more students that
we're going to be able to count as young
people who are going out and doing
something in the community and doing
something for for our economy and doing
something for our world when you have to
provide support to a student who's a
woman and she's still alone at her
institution that may not have the same
impact then if you bring all of these
women together and they start developing
a network and so this is part of their
plan to have these scholars come
together and get to know each other we
hope for the 88th students that are here
today that they get a chance to see a
great community of computer scientists
people who are excited and engaged by
technology and how it's being applied in
the world a lot of our engineers here
are so excited to meet them as well
because they're working on the best
technologies it's going to be you know
the products that we use tomorrow it's
challenging but I really like what I'm
doing and I know I make a difference
because I don't look like the
stereotypical computer scientist and
then I walk in the room and I just
smashed all those barriers and it's like
I do have the technical background and I
mean I'm I really enjoy what I'm doing
and I have a passion and I just give it
off to others so I fight those
challenges every day but I know I'm
making a difference for the people
behind me and I'm just gonna make it I
have to be visible because no one will
know I exist if I'm not
showing myself
