about how to prepare for a technical
interview I'm Shawn technology and
engineering recruiter I'm Allison I'm a
software engineer I'm Jess I'm also a
software engineer all of this video is
going to focus on the technical
interview definitely check out our
partner video on how to prepare for the
business interview as well it absolutely
applies here but without further ado
let's get into some tips
first things first make sure you're
ready to prove what's on your resume
we're going to want some critical pieces
from you including the bread-and-butter
of software engineering data structures
well you could argue with me on that
data structures and algorithms so we
want things like hash tables stacks
arrays as well as algorithms space and
time complexity we also want things like
be prepared to code on a whiteboard this
is very different from coding on a
computer so it's highly recommended to
go out find a whiteboard or a chalkboard
and try coding something up it's a
little different and finally we want to
make sure that you're brushed up on
system design as well as object oriented
programming in general you want to show
your problem-solving skills to the
question you are asked if it's a coding
question providing efficient code a
short time frame is key if it's a design
question work with your interviewer to
create a high-level system and if
applicable delving into deeper issues if
it's a general analysis question so you
understand all aspects of the problem
and if necessary offer multiple
solutions discussing their relative
merits in the end the interview wants to
know if they'd be comfortable working
with you on it
specifically you should focus your
preparation in the following areas
coding so you're going to spend the
majority of your time actually writing
code in interviews we do ask that you
are pretty familiar with at least one
coding language typically we'll
interview you in C++ or Java you may use
Python or C in different projects here
you will be expected to know api's
object-oriented design and programming
how to test your code and be able to
come up with corner cases and edge cases
for yours and other people's another big
thing is algorithms I mentioned this in
the beginning and it's coming up again
because surprise it's important all
right so you also want to know how
complex your algorithm is remember it's
time and space complexity as well as how
to improve or change it if you give me
an O of n algorithm and then you give me
an O of n factorial or oo of N squared
and you tell me it's better this is
going to be a little awkward so another
thing if you get a chance to study up on
other algorithms like Dijkstra's or a
star it'll probably help you to
something is incredibly important
candidates of three or more years of
industry experience should have hands-on
testing experience if you have less than
three years within the industry we're
just going to test you for your testing
aptitude you can expect questions such
as how would you unit test the code
would you write what interesting inputs
or test cases can you think of and we
may also ask you to design end to end
integration load and performance or even
security tests for real-world systems
such as Gmail for example data
structures so you should study up on as
many data structures and algorithms
assumingly possible you should know some
of the most famous classes of
np-complete problems like the Traveling
Salesman in the knapsack you should
definitely be able to recognize some of
these very famous questions when asked
in a slightly different way also try and
find out what np-complete actually it
means you should absolutely know trees
some basic tree construction traversal
and manipulation algorithms hash tables
stacks arrays link lists and so on
also math some of our interviewers will
ask basic discrete math problems don't
worry they will be very relevant
counting problems probability things
that happen in everyday life so before
you come in spend some time refreshing
your memory on these things or learning
the essentials of probability theory and
combinatorics you should be pretty
familiar with n choose K problems and
the like
recursion many coding problems involve
thinking recursively and maybe coding a
recursive solution prepare for recursion
which can sometimes be tricky if not
approach properly practice some problems
which can be solved iteratively but a
more elegant solution is recursion
operating systems you should understand
processes threads as well as concurrency
issues and everything related to that
such as semaphores new texas locks
things like that you should also
understand resource allocation so what
resources a process or thread might need
another thing context switching just
brush up a little bit on that understand
that it's initiated in the and the
operating system and underlying hardware
and then one last thing maybe you might
want to know a little bit about how
scheduling works system design
candidates have been in the industry for
more than five years should have
experience with systems design these
questions are used to see your ability
to combine knowledge theory and judgment
towards solving a real-world problem
sample topics include feature sets
interfaces class hierarchies distributed
systems and designing systems under
certain constraints you should also have
an understanding of how the internet
actually works and be familiar with the
various pieces routers domain name
servers load balancers and firewalls
also understand the basics of how search
works
now that we've talked a little bit about
some of the knowledge areas that we
expect you to know we want to offer you
three final tips to really be successful
in your interviews first explain and
clarify it's extremely important to talk
through your thought process during the
interview it is much better to say what
you're thinking when to stay silent even
if you're discarding ideas along the way
your interviewer wants to know your
thought process which ideas you're not
going to use and which Ivo you finally
settle on clarifying the question is
also important that most of the
questions like Google are intentionally
vague because the interviewer wants to
know what questions you would ask if
you're in a real world solution that had
a vague question an example of a
question you can ask for clarifying is
are there any time or space complexity
requirements secondly we want you to
keep thinking we know this is really
strenuous interviewing is really long
but the first solution that you come up
with might not be the most elegant so we
encourage you to keep thinking through
the problems think about your current
solution and how you could potentially
improve it finally practice make sure
that you practice physically writing
your code you won't have an editor no
color code for comments no autocorrect
be sure to test your code be sure that
it's easily readable without bugs find
problems write code solve them there's
no better way of practicing than
actually writing out code rules that's
it for today thanks so much for joining
us okay
