week and it was a really great
experience because not only do you get
to learn a ton of stuff it's probably
most I've ever learned in a week and you
get to meet really cool smart people
both kids in the program and also other
engineers I could go in and just get a
feel for what it's like to be at Google
hundred camp program really drew my high
because that was the best opportunity
for me to sort of learn how I did work
so who better than back to makers we had
a lot of learning sessions we learned
about Android and then we were in a
group and we made an Android app because
of the program I was able to contribute
at my internship last summer I was able
to make two fully fledged Android
applications I never really actually
done any programming in it before
Android is such a useful thing now
because so many people use it so many
people have phones and to make apps that
can affect all those people who use it
is really great it's a really valuable
skill and it also helps you in other
areas of program just knowing something
really well you don't lose anything by
applying and if you do get an
opportunity then it's really great and
people at Google are so nice and helpful
absolutely give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
