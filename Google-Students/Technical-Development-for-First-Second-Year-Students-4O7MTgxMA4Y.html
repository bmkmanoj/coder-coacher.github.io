students to live series and today we're
gonna be talking about technical
development for first and second year
students so just a reminder if you're
watching this live please please please
fill out the RSVP RSVP form if you're
watching this is recording ignore
everything I just said and enjoyed the
 so also um we love questions we
have some chat moderators Taylor and
aquiline they're in there ready to
answer your questions we'll save some
time at the end to answer questions but
feel free to ask away
okay so today we're gonna start talking
about your career in CS and we're gonna
give you some tips and tricks on skills
and resources you can use throughout
your college career so you might not be
in your first or second year or you
might not have an interest in software
engineering totally okay to say some of
this information could be useful to you
but just understand that we're gonna be
sort of more geared towards first in the
second year students okay also introduce
myself
hi guys my name is Ben I'm a software
engineer at Google I work at the
Sunnyvale office on internal tools for
Google's call centers so my story I sort
of graduated from sort of I did graduate
from Stanford with a math degree and
then I took like one grad level math
class oh my gosh is so hard so I stuck
around instead and got at CS master's it
was a great decision fun fact about me I
collect ukuleles and sterkens okay guys
Christie hi I'm Christie I'm also a
software engineer I'm on the Android
team in Mountain View I went to UC Davis
and I just graduated last spring um I
was an intern the previous summer at
Google which was really exciting in
Canada actually and I absolutely loved
movies that's my fun fact I've even
really really boring ones once locate
all the movies super heroines I love -
all right so what does computer science
to you well it means a lot of things to
different people but some of the three
things that we think but at Google are
impact community and being an adventurer
so impact means making the world better
having a really drive to see the world
become a better place because of your
soccer HIV or um you can have an impact
in lots of people's lives by being a
software chair so that drives a lot of
people there's also a community around
CS people think coding is really
solitary and alone all the time but your
team actually worked really closely to
another and you can come very close to
your team so it's not a solitary as some
people think and that sense of belonging
to that community will continue a large
and your smaller team working and
development um the one that for me is
really the big one that drove me to join
CS was being inventor kind of seeing
something grow from nothing to just a
theory or a design to something fully
forms that you can play with you can
point to and say I made that that's
because of me and working really hard in
a problem hitting almost build failures
in those bugs and then finally seeing it
to come together as a working in product
it's really rewarding and that's really
weak reasons why I really like see us so
some things to consider your freshman
year obviously you're gonna be focusing
a lot of coursework one of them that we
recommend is definitely focusing on a
language like c ec most of our Python
this usually will be an interrupter ECS
class may be a sequence of them but
definitely become really strong in at
least one language core math courses you
may have taken in calculus in high
school but continue on with that you can
also do linear health club or
differential equations some of those are
popular linear algebra is actually
really interesting for machine learning
so thing you're interested in
definitely focus definitely do a CS
product outside the classroom we tend to
focus a lot in college on the classes
and getting that great GPA but doing
coursework both excuse me
doing coursework is not the only answer
you need to do work
outside of the classroom to build up and
practice those pistols so doing one
chance project like an open-source
project or just a project for yourself
is definitely really see we also want
you to have a theoretical understanding
of CS so they can compare architecture
or boolean logic or discrete math so
tinea class in one of those fields is
document leave something you can for
your freshman year well be up an
understanding of git and version control
and even using the service github to
kind of build up your profile of
different projects that you've created
is also something you can start your
freshman years you can build on that
your sophomore junior and senior years
so we're really fleshed out portfolio so
getting experience with github and
version control early on is really key
and then of course beginning to read
others told you don't work in a vacuum
especially at a place like Google or
really anywhere and so you have to work
with other people's code and kind of
understand it and be able to add on to
it a lot of projects in college you're
working alone with a very small group
and you don't have to consider the
implications on others or their
implications on you so really
understanding how high quality code is
created is something that you want to
start your freshman year basically so
developing those skills outside of
classrooms some key areas to focus on or
computational thinking and
problem-solving so kind of developing
those algorithms and that logical
ordering to your thought process is
really key make sure that create
solutions using the algorithmic process
so maybe taking an algorithms class or
just starting to think in a more logical
way like computer does is really helpful
and code efficiency this is really only
you only able to grasp this to practice
seeing what is less efficient both like
say Big O notation which is a
determinate ER of complexity of your
core which you may learn later on in
your CS degree and also just how it
readable it is is it can someone
understand it coming in the future so
those kind of more not fostering based
skills are also really good to devolve
early on
so maybe you're saying I didn't do any
of that I am a sophomore and I didn't do
any of that my freshman year I'm not
ready you know what it's totally okay
there's plenty of time left in your
college career and these are just
guidelines and suggestions they aren't
hard and fast rules so maybe you saw
something that you think you might want
to improve on go ahead and do it now
there's plenty of time left and if your
sole freshman definitely focus on that
is really if you can to build up that
knowledge and that that's go set
so when to stop career I don't think you
do that so yeah just some things that
we're hoping that you got to by the end
of your sophomore year and a lot is kind
of what Kristi's already talked about
from from freshman year they're just
sort of having it down really well so um
by the end of your sophomore year really
hoping that you have a good
understanding of data structures and
algorithms so you should be able to do
some kind of algorithmic analysis like
like big o-notation at this one cuz it's
important to understand not just like
which algorithm is the best algorithm
for some particular situation but why
that algorithm is better than another
algorithm and like under what
circumstances so most of my job when it
comes down to like building stuff and
design it is really just like
brainstorming a whole bunch of solutions
then picking out the best one I never
ever work on a problem where it's like
oh I need to use Dijkstra's algorithm
and then I just plug in Dijkstra's
algorithm there's I rarely just look up
standard solutions
let me just another thing it'd be great
if you're really proficient in at least
one programming language and again
that's like C C++ Python Java it's a lot
of people that I'm totally guilty of
this do you like you learn a new
programming language you write a few
lines and then you like put on your
resume proficient when we say
proficiency what we mean is you should
be able to investigate and then solve
problems with that language so you
should have at least one language where
someone can say like one of those cool
data structures are algorithms right and
like the last bullet point
like coat it up and yeah no problem I
got that and you can just talk about so
also proficiency is it really is about
being able to share your code with other
people so it doesn't help anyone if
you're the only person who can read
you're special type of python that just
doesn't help at all so if you're looking
at your friends Java and you can't spot
the nullpointerexception in their code
it's just not that you don't really you
aren't proficient in Java um so one
other thing really important do try and
have at least one project outside the
classroom like you know an open source
project or something where you're
testing your code you can debug your
code you're looking at a really big
codebase this I think is such a good way
to get a feel for what it's like to
really be a software engineer so in in
my in my life I work as an independent
contributor pretty often on small
independent projects but then also I
work with my teammates my pair program
and we look at the same code at the same
time when we like we talk about what we
want to do in it's slow and it's hard
but you know we build a feature together
it's not solitary anyway also look into
you know if you're looking for open
source opportunities you can look into
something like open hatch or little
Summer of Code and they're the really
great opportunities to work on a bigger
project on a small or big role on a
bigger project so there are a lot of
ways to get this kind of technical
experience outside of the classroom so
you know there's there all these
computer science clubs and societies and
programming competitions and if those
aren't available to you um you can start
those you can start those at your school
so the ACM has its own guide on how to
start a chapter at your school this is
something that you can do you can look
into app development and work on open
source projects again like your github
profile sort of becomes your portfolio
over time there's a lot of great online
competitions out there that you can join
one that's not on
list that I would recommend his cattle
which is really interesting for data
science personally for me I got a lot of
great technical experience just from
teaching and teeing during undergrad I
mean even as a math major I was always
really interested in teaching and I
found there are a lot of great
opportunities in teaching computer
science and that really made me it
forced me to learn how to actually write
code I can't fake it anymore because you
have to teach it to people and I had to
learn how to read other people's code
and I had to have solid fundamentals
myself before I could try and pass those
on to other people
um so Google does offer some great
opportunities for you in your first
couple years so you should look into
these are sort of ordered in time and
Google Code Jam is coming up really soon
the qualifying round starts on April 7th
in a sort of continues throughout the
spring and the idea with the code Jam is
that you're given like a challenging
problem and you have to code up a
solution I've never done it I'm done any
of these things full disclosure but I
have with you some of the problems and
they look really fun they're also great
practice for interviews the google
Summer of Code and now this is this is
actually coming up sooner even though
it's a summer thing the application is
open from March 20th to April 3rd so you
should look into this soon if you're
interested the idea and I'm sorry I
should say this is a really good
opportunity for you if you have an
already lined up like an internship or
something for the summer the idea here
is you find an open source project
listed on the website you don't have to
find it all on your own you can just go
to Summer of Code dog with Google comm
and you apply to work on that project
and then Google pairs you with a mentor
and then the mentor helps you to work
for like it for three months on that
projects it's really great experience
the last thing is ignite CS and this is
really about giving back to your
community through
mentorship in computer science so it
works like this you you grab an advisor
and then you grab some friends and then
you find like a local school or
community organization think like the
YMCA or lik Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club to plan a
mentorship program in computer science
then you get to come up with a budget
propose it to Google and then Google
foots the bill for you so one great
resource for sort of the whole your soul
your whole undergrad program is a
google's guide to technical development
um check that out it has sort of like a
rough outline of suggestions for your
whole time as an undergrad aside from
that these are the three resources are
more for coding interviews I would say
so
Google recommends the cracking the
coding interview of the sixth edition
I guess now look at practice questions
on the top coder website also elite code
I love project Euler that was so much
fun I mean I'm kind of a math guy so is
extra fun but the idea is you have all
these math problems and you solve them
by coding oh I thought it was so cool
definitely check that out okay uh it
looks like it's time for Q&amp;amp;A okay so
looks like Cookie Monster and sera those
asked I want to start contributing to
open source projects and below my
portfolio I don't know where to start
any suggestions
well good place to start a small app on
github for smaller projects maybe you
can find an open bug fix or class today
you can contribute to right away you'll
obviously want to know the language that
that project is programmed in before you
start looking into that but that's a
great place to look um you can also
start your own there's no problem with
that if you have a great idea for
something that might benefit the wider
community you can go and give up and
start your own private
thank you also open hatch and Summer of
Code are both like more structured ways
to get involved to where you can get
here paired up with a mentor so it looks
like Ian asked what's a good stepping
stones we fans in the field of compares
- so obviously your coursework first go
to class learn a lot those are the kind
of key fundamentals to learn a lot but
CX um but then you want to move out into
your own areas like if I would find what
your school is really good at maybe your
school is really strong in machine
learning or graphics or security or
something like that and really you can
use your university strengths to find
different areas you're interested and
then maybe you have research areas I did
some research
while I was in University which is
really cool um you can do other things
outside of the classroom as well like
start your own github open source
project kind of my thoughts on that if
you had been yeah I mean I think I would
also say that my my personal experience
was not was this was pretty different
from I think a traditional computer
science background because I I started
in math but I know a lot of people who
who have had similar pathways to to
working in computer science you know
where they they're working in biology
and they discover an interesting problem
in biology that led them to needing to
code for it and then that writing codes
like got them interested in computer
science as a field so I think whatever
whatever passions you can bring along or
to computer science are really helpful
another question so what's one course or
project that you're most proud of from
your computer science undergrad
experience and why okay so I took a
class that was the possum on let's see
well okay I took so many awesome classes
but I'm gonna say
the one that I'm most proud of was a
systems class in operating systems class
where we we started with sort of just
like a skeleton an operating system and
then we had to build things like virtual
memory and file system it was so harder
so it was in many ways it was one of the
worst experiences of my life working
these 40 hour weeks just trying to get
code to compile and run and eating stale
Donuts at 5 in the morning but it was so
so so satisfying it was like just the
best feeling like being able to point at
something in like in your computer
inside the computer and make it run it
was so great she didn't even do research
really I didn't because I didn't went to
him that day so I couldn't go when I was
one of my colleagues posted or presented
my said but it was really awesome so I'm
just really utilized opportunities are
available to be a TA you can as an
undergrad do you research get
internships really there's a lot of
opportunities out there if you set for
them you have another question
umm what are the areas they need to
develop in technical aspects to get a
job at Google as a flashlight well to
get a job at Google or an internship at
any level in your efficiency career you
should have a very strong command of at
least one language because you'll need
to interview in that language um but
also you want to have strong coursework
in other areas too like computer
architecture and things that build on
that foundation um you can also do like
I said before outside projects that will
give you that practice and experience to
get ready for those times
we have a question from Shane Lane what
would be a good programming language to
be proficient in Java or C++ um you know
so much of working as a software
engineer is not about knowing the right
language it's about knowing how to learn
languages you need to and how to like
use the tools that you have at your
disposal so officially Google is like a
Java C++ Python C and a few other
languages house but it's important to
just pick a language and get good at it
and then learning other languages
there's no one language that's the best
yeah I definitely agree my first
internship was in an area that I had
never done before and in just a couple
of weeks the beginning of it I really
needed to pick up those skills so that's
one of the things you really need to
focus on is be able to grasp those
concepts of all three and languages that
you can apply to new ideas and currently
which is right off the bat so you can
adapt easily so semaine ask would you
guys recommend building a tech startup
although it would may adversely affect
your GPA will definitely do both you can
have a high GPA and it started at
startup um so uh you know remember that
your GPA is a reflection of how much you
learned hopefully and the baby is part
of your overall candidate profile but
that we do look outside of that to your
step outside the classroom so if you
feel like it would really advantage you
to learn how to start a start-up and
really just not go for it just make sure
you have a good balance between your
outside of court or classroom work and
your GPA another question what's the
best advice someone gave you during your
CS undergraduate career oh my gosh
that's so tough I can't think of
anything
specifically that anyone told me but I
think that the best advice that I can
give someone else is to to really follow
what you're passionate about if you're
interested in machine learning
find someone doing machine learning and
you research with them if you're
interested in like taking math classes
take more classes and then see how you
can make that work in computer science
yeah I don't really just take advantage
of every opportunity the reason I got
the research position was because I've
been a tutor for that professors class
but that quarter before so if there's an
opportunity go for it jump on it just
really make good use of your time so we
see Tim asked would you say it's better
to focus more on learning other
languages over the summer or try to get
experience in the field research for
internships both are definitely great
you definitely want to learn more
languages and more skills but you also
want to get practical experience because
you may find that certain areas of test
more suited to you than others and
definitely just get that practice
because practice makes perfect so if you
can do both that's great I don't know I
really I'm kind of on the side of
getting more experience because through
getting experience you'll get more like
same languages and skills it was about
look like build systems and things you
might not just by focusing on a single
language so I would probably say
personally to go for the experience that
bones are great yeah it's like in that
one definitely experience
oh boy um Jingwei asks my team and I are
working on machine learning related side
projects we're interested in learning
tensorflow and found the Udacity course
what are good resources you know I know
nothing about tensor flow and which is
unfortunate love to learn more about
tensor flow but my understanding is
aside from the Udacity course I'm pretty
sure that Google offers some reasonable
tutorials but my guess is that if you
were to if you were to look at
communities like kaggle there probably
are other people very using tensor flow
where you can ask them questions and
sort of like be a part of that community
but I don't have any great suggestions
for you sorry but I did take a mystery
machine learning course at college so
check if your university offers data
plans or machine learning that may have
either professor that's available to
help you or some other resources so 5 pj
and be asked looking back now when your
biggest surprise or things you wish you
had done in your first couple of years
of college new regards to courses or
opportunities etc and that's a good one
that's a good one
oh you would take this never go I think
I kind of wish that I never show you
taking more CS classes and I wish that I
jumped into like an internship somewhere
along the way so I I did not do any
internships I did like one internship at
a friend's company that was that was fun
and interesting but I did that like
after my senior year so up into that
point I didn't really like I said I was
a math major I really didn't do
internships and I wish that I'd done it
because I feel like it would have been
like I thought that I I thought that I
couldn't do it in retrospect I
absolutely could have done it so I think
that would have been a good thing to do
that I probably could have done
I'd say looking in the classrooms that
are kind of related to your major but
maybe just are really interesting to you
I feel like a lot of my education was
folks like yes related stuff and it
wasn't really the kind of other things
where am I so definitely focus on CS but
also other things that interests you
outside about you okay so Shane is
another question for us what are some
ways to get interviews I applied to
several positions but never heard back
from recruiters okay so that's okay
everyone knows internships are
competitive don't be discouraged keep
building your skills working on um you
know your resume and your portfolio and
apply again I cannot tell you how many
jobs I applied to and got rejected for
before huh a job at Google um it just
takes perseverance so one thing you can
check out is there's a resume video
that's on this same Google students
YouTube channel and there I think there
is at least one or two other videos that
you can check out that should have some
informations on our interview process
and also you can prepare so it looks
like we're gonna wrap up but just a few
final reminders please please please
check out our other videos on the Google
students Channel and remember to look at
the Google guide for technical
development and thanks for tuning in
we'll be back with other videos in the
next couple weeks thank you guys for
participating
