because you get to impact so many people
as an associate product marketing
manager at Google I work on a product
called Google Adsense when I first
started at Google I went to a conference
here called search engine strategies and
I'd only been at Google for maybe about
two weeks and I really actually didn't
know too much about Adsense but what I
was there doing was I was taking video
testimonials from some of our publishers
who was there who were there and what I
was doing was trying to get a sense of
why they chose Adsense and what it's
done for them and hearing their stories
actually really educated me and made me
really aware of what Adsense is possible
to do I spoke to one publisher and he
told me that he started his website for
fun and he put Adsense on there just to
try to cover the cost of his hosting
costs and now he said that he's making
so much money from Adsense that he's
actually able to put his kids through
college with his website and another
example was a girl who had started this
website in her dorm room and all she had
done was you know essentially done
celebrity news and gossip and it was
just something that she thought was fun
to do and she put Adsense on there and
she started making money and she
actually started making more money
through other advertisements and now
this was her business she had five
employees and she was so grateful to
Adsense for making this possible for her
and really seeing those stories come
from Adsense was really excites me about
working on the product my name is dan
Friedman I'm an associate product
marketing manager at Google Mountain
