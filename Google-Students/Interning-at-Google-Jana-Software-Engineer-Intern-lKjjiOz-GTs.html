Czech Republic I study at Charles
University in Prague and I work a
software engineer intern in Surrey when
I applied for the internship I didn't
really know what to expect but I was
very surprised
I work in s quality team in today so our
job is to make the edge that you can see
next to web search results more relevant
so it has a lot to do with natural
language processing which is my field of
study so I really enjoy what I am doing
here and what is the most amazing fact
about my job is that people all around
the world can actually see the ads I
work on so you can change the experience
of people of their everyday experience
but it's not only work it's also the
people I work with because Google really
hires very smart intelligent and people
who are fun to be with so during my
internship I had lots of fun here I
played chess with my teammates we had
dancing classes we went to a Metallica
concert so it was great fun here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
