ANASTASIA: Hi, everyone.
Welcome to the kick-off session.
My name is Anastasia Mariussen.
I'm the account manager
on the original CSC LCS
stands for launch
custom sales and that
means that I primarily
work with the launch
advertisers in Zurich.
I've been at Google
for two years now.
All the while staying in Dublin
and really am enjoying it.
So together with me I
have Tim and Kavjan.
Guys, would you like
to introduce yourself?
KAVJAN: Sure Tim, you go ahead.
TIM: Thanks.
My name is Tim.
Tim [INAUDIBLE].
I'm Dutch.
I'm a sales manager for the
Norwegian and Finnish markets
here at Google.
Been here now for
five and a half years.
I used to be an account
manager working [INAUDIBLE]
and got the opportunity
to become a sales manager.
That's what I'm doing now.
That's it.
KAVJAN: Perfect, thanks.

And my name is Kavjan
and I work as an account
manager in the Danish team.
I'm Swedish but I work
in the Danish team
because we are required
international as we call it.
And I work with the largest
advertisers in the travel
sector in Denmark.
I've been here for
almost 2 and 1/2 years
and just as
Anastasia, I'm really,
really enjoying my time
here and I look forward
to have this program
to get with you guys.
Anastasia?
ANASTASIA: Yes, so
on our agenda today
we have quite a few
different things.
So we thought we would
start by giving you
a little bit more details on
what Google Online Marketing
Boot Camp involves as a program.
So the types of things
that you can expect,
sessions that would
be coming, and also
how Google Online Marketing
Boot Camp is actually
related to Google Online
Marketing Challenge.
We have been receiving
some questions on this
and I thought it would be
nice to actually just start
by giving you those details.
Another thing then,
Tim has kindly
agreed to come join us today
and tell us a little bit more
of the Google story.
So where did it start
as a company was always
so interesting.
It's the first
session, and yeah, we
thought it would
be fun to give you
a little bit of the
background-- where we come from,
where we stand now.
And also Tim will
share some insights
on what it's like to be in
the EU headquarters in Dublin.
In case you decide
to come and visit us,
if you do so you're
more than welcome.
We are happy to
organize a tour for you.
Or maybe this could
be interesting,
even if you decide to
apply for a job here.
Then after Tim, you're more
than welcome to ask questions.
By the way, there's a live chat
and we will be happy to address
your questions
either afterwards,
depending on how many will come,
or if you don't have the chance
to cover all of them we will
come back on our G+ Community.
Sorry, going back
to the agenda again,
Kavjan will take us
through and give us
an introduction, a brief
introduction to each tool
marketing, and he
will also share
the so-called micro-moments
woman's perspective, which
we typically use when we
find our clients on how
to select the most relevant
channels for their finals,
or their final users.
So let's jump into this
and start a little bit
with the GOMB program.
The GOMB program-- the
Boot Camp-- is actually
a program that is developed
by Googlers who's world
is the one that
myself and Kavjan
would be having,
so it's developed
by Googlers who are actually
working with real businesses.
We are facing our advertisers
and big companies every day.
Throughout the
program we would also
be inviting the specialists
with very high expertise
on the different subjects.
And the whole idea is that
they would be both ourselves
and those specialist will be
sharing the best practices,
the tips, the
recommendations that they
have acquired through
their experience with you.
And again the idea
is, to help you
plan the most effective things
and get the best results
for the companies you
will be working with.
So the aim of Google
Online Marketing Boot Camp
is A, to equip you
with the knowledge
that you need to really
successfully participate
in the competition, and
B, it's to guide you
through this competition.
So on one hand, we
realize that we do have
a lot of different solutions.
There's a lot of
options and once you
start diving into this,
and reading up on this,
and going through
the investigations
you will see that there
is actually quite a lot
to take in.
So the idea with those
sessions is really
to filter out that
knowledge and help you
with trying to understand
the things will be right then
for yourselves.
And so, just once again, the
GOMB you should now understand,
and GOMC, which is the Google
Online Marketing Challenge,
are two separate things.
These are two
separate initiatives.

The Google Online
Marketing challenge
is a competition-- the
global competition--
that has been available and
has been there for many years.
The universities
globally can join
that competition and
practically any students
from those universities
can participate.
The idea of the
competition is again,
you find a real business, you
create campaigns for them,
and then you run them,
you optimize them,
and you evaluate the
performance of them.
Whereas the Google
Online Marketing Boot
Camp is something that we offer
on top of the Google Online
Marketing Challenge,
meaning that
this is an additional
educational package.
Again, to just help
you successfully
get through the
actual competition.
Actually, can we go
just a little bit back
to the previous slide?
I just wanted to focus a little
bit on really the benefits
of this program.
All of you who are
enrolled into this program
certainly have done
the right thing.
And I would say, because
by not only listening
to what you potentially can
do, but by actually doing this.
We're actually working
with the businesses,
collaborating with them,
advising them on the solutions,
and actually implementing them.
You are really getting a
very, very good understanding
of the digital market ecosystem.
You would also be
able obviously,
to get very hands on experience
with the actual implementation
of those campaigns.
So it will not be a
theoretical knowledge.
You will actually be able to
start a job after you have
finished and you would be fully
able to do those kind of tasks
from day one.
There will also
be an opportunity
to take AdWords certifications.
We would definitely
recommend you
to have a look at
AdWords Fundamentals
and Search certifications,
Advanced search
is probably the minimum.
And quite honestly if I was to
give you very personal advice,
I would say definitely
grab this opportunity.
You will be going
through the materials.
You would have enough knowledge
to actually pass those exams.
And if you pass those
exams, obviously that
will make you a very
attractive candidate
once you start
applying for jobs.
You will be working
throughout this program.
Obviously you'll be
working in teams.
So that in itself can be a
very valuable experience.
And because you will have to be
dealing with real life problems
and you will also be able to
develop your leadership skills.
And the fun part
of it is that there
are prizes involved as well, so
if you become a global winner
you will get a trip--
a seven day trip--
to our headquarters in Mountain
View, which is pretty cool.
And you will be able
spend a day there.
If you become
regional winners, you
can come to our regional office.
For example, you will be
coming, if you were to win,
you would be coming to Dublin.
And there's plenty
of Google swag,
and like other
kind of fun things.
I'll come back to
the swag actually.
Now a little bit more.
I know it's little bit--
a lot of administration and a
lot of information to take in,
but I hope it helps you
to understand again,
the differences between
the GOMC and what
we are giving you with our
package, with the GOMB.
So let's go back to the
GOMC because after all, you
will be participating
in the competition.
So If you haven't studied Google
Online Marketing Challenge
website yet, I really
recommend you go.
And maybe it sounds
very old fashioned,
but quite honestly I would
have said print out the pages
from this website, including
the frequently asked questions.
Go through them with a marker
and just really identify
and find the answers.
I can guarantee you that a lot
of the answers to the questions
you probably have around the
competitions are already there.
So please do study it.
You will also have a
recommended timeline
with the different steps.
And I think they have 10
steps or something like that.
But if we were to boil
this down to stages,
I would say there's four main
stages in this competition.
So the first thing
you have to do
is you have to form a team
of three to six students.
And then together you
have to select a business.
Now, just to make a
note on forming a team.
You should ideally be forming a
team together with the students
from your own university
so please try and do that.
You can definitely use, if you
don't know somebody else from
your own university, please use
our G+ Community and we will
try and help connect
you with your peers.
There is also an option
of actually participating
with students from
another university,
but then you will have
to register under one
of the same professor anyhow.
Again, those are the
details that you're probably
should know or you
can, or you will know,
once you have actually
gone through the rules
of the competition.
And then you will be
selecting a business.
On the business itself,
there's a lot of advice
that is already given.
So please again
review the website
because you'll find the
recommendations on which
businesses we suggest
that you avoid,
and which businesses
actually can be
very good for this competition.
So once that is
in place, this is
where you will start preparing
your Pre-Campaign Report.
The Pre-Campaign
report is basically
a plan for your business
where you describe and give
an outline of all the activities
that you have planned,
and the proposed
AdWords strategy.
There are particular
requirements to that.
Again, they're
very, very specific.
Please go through them.
If you have questions on the
reports or things like that you
can also go to the G+
Community and ask us.
Once you have submitted
the report to Google,
you will get your
credit of $250 and then
you are ready to start
planning your campaigns.
You can run your campaigns
for up to 21 days.
Again, read the rules please.
And then once you have finished
this, throughout the process
you're working all the
time and making sure
that the campaigns are making
most of the budget, that they
are fully optimized, and that
you have really done everything
you can with the campaigns
to make sure you maximize
the performance.
Once you have
finished the campaign
you will write your
first Campaign Report.
And this is where you would
be evaluating the results.
You'll be telling us a little
bit about how you were actually
optimizing that.
So this is pretty much it.
So you have your
team, you prepare,
you find your business,
you talk to the business,
you find everything out about
the business-- their objectives
their key performance
indicators,
the industry they
are operating in.
Then you make a
plan, you submit it,
you get it ready to
run the campaigns,
and then you evaluate
the performance.
So this is GOMC.
Now where does GOMB
come into the picture,
and that's our program.
So you have probably
already seen the timeline
that we have developed
on our website.
And you can see
that all of you will
have a face-to-face session.
At least one
face-to-face session
where the different
representatives
of those who are
involved in this program
would actually travel
to your universities.
So some universities this
has already taking place.
For some, this is
still to happen.
So you can be looking
forward to that.
And then apart from the
face-to-face session,
there will be four
YouTube live sessions
just like this
one, where we will
be covering the different
topics which we believe
you need to understand in order
to be able to start planning
your campaigns.
In order to be again
better equipped
and really make the use
of the different features
that we think could be relevant.
So everything will be tailored.
We'll give you an overview of
the different opportunities
out there.
But also we are very conscious,
and we will try of the context
that you are in, and
we will try and really
make all of our recommendations
relevant to your types
of clients if you like.
And this be when it comes to
the scale of the campaigns.
So we will start next week by
I will have experts joining
this session again
where they will give you
an introduction basically
to how search even works.
How does paid advertising
via Google work on search?
How do ads get out there?
How's ranking organized,
and works, and so on.
And as you can see from this
time line for every single week
you would have a topic that
we will be going through.
But additionally,
we have also tried
to link in the steps
which you should be going
through at that point in time.
So for example,
next week you should
be really thinking of which
business you would select.
And you should start learning
about AdWords, and also
more about your client.
And so on.
I don't have to take
you through all of it
but you can see
the timeline there.
Now it's one important
note to make here
and that is, this is a
recommended timeline, OK?
You should remember that there
are different universities
and different classes that are
enrolled into this program.
For some of you this program
will be actually integrated
into the modules and
would be obligatory.
So you may have
your own deadlines
for when you should be
submitting the reports,
or when you should be done
with the different things.
At the other universities,
this can actually
be more as an extracurricular
activity and this is
where you can be relying
on our time line.
So this is recommended
if you have a look
and if you have studied
again the GOMC website,
you would notice that the
timeline there is a little bit
different.
So the deadlines
for example, when
you can see Pre-Campaign
Report or Post-Campaign Report
can be a little bit different.
It is totally up to you.
We recommend you
follow this but if you
feel you need another week,
a little bit more time
to actually get through
this program, that's
totally fine with us.
But please make sure that you
don't miss the deadlines that
are actually mentioned
on the GOMC website
because that's really important.
Right.

Just another note.
I've been talking a lot
here for half an hour.
So very quickly I promise.
This is very administrative.
There'll be more fun here.
But if you have questions
throughout the Boot Camp
and your competition
and participation in it.
First of all, this
is also the way
how most advertisers
would be working really,
when we work with our solutions
and use Google for advertising.
There is a lot of
support center articles
and they will also be a part of
those certification materials
that will be going through if
you want to take it and examine
the AdWords certification.
So please always try and find
the answer to question first,
then obviously, if you
can't find the answer,
do come to G+ Community.
Post your question but equally,
if you see somebody else,
another peer from
another university
or your own university
asking questions
and you know the
answer to the question,
please do help them
and just answer.
Don't always wait
for us to come.
We'll be trying to be as quick
as we can but as I mentioned,
we also have other things.
We would love to help you
guys but please do support
each other and help each other.
TIM: It's a community right?
ANASTASIA: Yeah
it's a community.
And this is how we work.
This is our every
day as well, right?
So it's all about
helping each other.
And actually every week, we
thought we would actually pick
the most active contributor
on the G+ Community.
And maybe you will have some
surprises for you in the end.
But we'll keep that till later.

I hope that has given you a
better understanding of GOMC,
GOMB, and how we are linked.
If you have any questions
we have a live stream
which I hope you can see.
If you don't then
you will probably
will have to go to the
YouTube channel itself
where the streaming takes
place and then go find it.
Please ask questions.
We will address them in the end.
TIM: I think all the information
is also on the website, right?
ANASTASIA: Yeah.
TIM: All that you mentioned.
ANASTASIA: Plenty.
Yeah, on the website.
Yeah, there's
actually two of them.

Shall we move on and
have a look and speak
a little bit about Google
and our life at Google.
TIM: Sure, sure.
I can do that.
And even before we go through
the slide, as I've said,
always great to be here.
A great day, great initiative.
And I was asked to share
a few things about Google
as a company and a few things
about living here in Dublin
and working for
Google here in Dublin.
Let me start with
the Google thing
first and then go
into the Dublin thing.
This ads to anything I say.
Let's even go way back when
Google started in 1998.
It was founded by
Larry and Sergey,
two friends from university
from Stanford in the US,
in California.
And what they saw
happening is that they
saw the internet coming.
They saw lots of access
coming into the world.
It was an organized
chaos, right?
There are lots of cool sites
evolving and being made,
but no one really knew
where to find them.
So they said OK, let's
make a website where we
can kind of organize all this.
And they built a mission
statement around it
which is to make the ads safe,
organize rules information
and make it universal,
accessible, and useful.
And to do this they
created a search engine
that would exactly understand
what you mean and gives you
back exactly what you
need in the moment that's
relevant for you.
It was interesting because
was almost 20 years later.
It was company was
founded in 1998.
At 20 years later I think
this mission statement
of organizing information
and making it universal,
accessible, and useful is
still applicable for all of us
nowadays.
So that's interesting to see.
But of course over
the best of may years,
everything has evolved
quite a bit, right?
I think where it started,
everything the internet also
when I talk about ourselves,
and plus, somewhere in the attic
my dad had a computer.
And it was the only
computer in the house
and you had to dial in.
No one had to make any calls
because then my game crashed,
and that's where we came
from back in the days.
And if you see now I think
everyone has a computer
with then as we speak, right?
And we're on this mobile
device and in your pockets.
Everyone has their own
computer and there is no just
one thing that only
gives one result
and each is same for everyone.
Which came from pretty far
and how it has evolved.
And not only desktop
but also mobile.
And in general we'll see
if you to search that even
though the science
still comparable,
things are not so kind of
changes and tweaks in--
if you have a higher website
it speaks for itself.
And if you go to
one of the examples
I have on the site, for
example, see how we use synonyms
and how we can start
using them in giving
better results to our users.
And so here you can see a few
examples on the left of queries
that people put into Google.
We'll have the
synonym cs in there.
But if you look
to the right, you
see that there are lots of
things that a cs could mean,
from pastries to counter-strike,
through central station,
anything.
And at some point the system
started to understand,
like hey, these cs things
can mean different things
so we also need to show
different results on the search
page. a very
obvious thing to do.
But of course a little
bit more tricky to to
make on the back end.
That's an example how we
get the evolving search.
And our end thing is
when you for example
see is when you Google
something, it kind of auto
starts to come up with solutions
they think you, I would say,
it starts filling
out your sentence.
You start typing car,
space, and for example we'll
say rental, or car
buying, or something.
So we kind of see which
words people combine
and by doing that we start
filling your sentence for you,
or saying OK, I think you mean.
So I think a few
examples of where
we keep on evolving at the
core of our business, which
is search.
And if you talk
about search, I think
a few relevant
numbers to mention
is that every month we
have over 100 billion
search terms being Googled.
So that's an
enormous amount to do
and it's unbelievable to see
that what speeds we can deliver
results to you, right?
Because also on the side with
looking how fast all this is
given to us.
But it comes a lot of
back end algorithms
needed to give these results.
And if you look to
all the search terms,
and that's what you just saw on
there, on the previous slide,
is that 15% of
all of these terms
are knew for us, are new for
Google and which is again,
interesting to see
because back in the day,
someone would for example say,
I know, loan, or get a loan.
People will now type all
questions into Google
and say like, how do I
finance my television?
So we also see that the
behavior is constantly changing
how people are using search.
They start to talk to Google,
or maybe on their phone.
And also the type of
questions is kind of change.
So ever Google, how
Google is evolving
and what you can also see
is that the kinds of devices
are changing.
So back in the day as I
said in my personal example,
it would be the one
computer at my parents place
for me to go attic
and we had shifts.
My sister and I could use
for certain hours a day.
But now everyone has
a computer with him
in the form of a mobile device,
and on average we do 150 times
per day on our personal
computer, on our mobile device.
The first thing you do in
the morning as an alarm.
It's the last thing you
do when you go to bed.
So it's crazy how also, the
way of how we are using it
and has been changed
over the years and it
will only get more.
I think the number you
see here on the slide
is an expected five billion
mobile users by 2020.
Today all people that are
connected to the internet
and will use Google
as their opportunity
to provide information.
And this could mean
a lot, I don't know.
If you take the local farmers
in some faraway regions
and finding access
to information,
how to grow their lands, how
you make them more productive.
It's quite, quite impressive.
ANASTASIA: And it has
a tremendous influence
on how recent we communicate
to their final users--
their customers.
Think of the world in this
mobile way and it changes.
TIM: Exactly.
The expenses drop
dramatically, right?
Where back in the day, had
just one shop, in one city,
and that was it.
You would sell to the city.
I think now the whole world's
a big cultural market.
It's impressive to see.
And what you also
see is that Google
is becoming more and more clever
in the sense of understanding
what we mean with
certain searches.
So if you again, go
to your mobile device,
and I will take a very
local example of something
here in Dublin.
And I would ask by typing or by
talking into my mobile phone,
what's the Dublin population?
The phone understands
that Dublin a city.
It understands that I'm
interested in the population,
obviously.
And it's kind of proactive.
Gives me a time
of how you say it,
a graph so I can see
the population growth.
And we also started
after people Googled
this, but total population
that people quite often
we're also interested in
the population of Amsterdam,
or Cork, and other
cities near Dublin.
So we also will find
that information.
Why?
Because that assembled the
best people-correlated searches
on Dublin, and then jumped
quickly into the only people
listed in Amsterdam.
So what we do see
changing in Google that's
right back in days
was an engine that
only gives you straight
information, exactly what we
ask for it.
And know we kind of tried to
go a step further and give
you even more and
then you asked for,
but what is wholly in line
with your expectations
and your needs over
a balanced view.
And that's not only
with whole population
but also things
with soccer, right?
You know I'm personally
invested in Chelsea.
Great club.
When I will Google
it I'm of course
interested in their
matches that are coming up.
That's something that
Google understands.
It gives you match updates
when they're happening.
What you see right
now are on the screen.
But it also gives
you information
about how they were jump in the
news, or how they are standing,
and the scores in the pool.
So it's great that
Google not only gives me
the answer I'm
looking for, like I
know when it's
Chelsea playing at,
but it also gives you
all the other information
that I as a summer fan,
find very interesting.
I now have this reach
absolutely because go
other place, full path
integrated in search engine.
KAVJAN: Just a small
note there, Barstow's
actually better than Chelsea.
TIM: We can talk about it later.
But it's Barstow might have won.
Anyways, so that's what you
constantly see happening.
We tried to keep reinventing
the wheel over and over
by integrating things
like what you just saw.
That kind of an in-app
experience in the Google search
Engine.
Those are things like Twitter,
a very popular medium by it
picks some very famous people
in the world right now.
And what you see is that
we kind of incorporated
this in our search results.
If you will jump in and
dive in now Twitter,
you can see the
live feeds of people
using the hashtag
for [INAUDIBLE]
and see what's happening there.
So we also try to be clever in
integrating different sources
into Google to make it relevant
and accessible for the user.
So I guess it's interesting to
see how we keep on reinventing
the wheel and do clever things.
And think a last example--
it's not on the slide-- we
just want to share it with you.
For example if you Google
something on our mobile phone
you get some
results on the page.
And we know that the
chances that say 90-95%,
you're going to click on
any of the top links there.
So at the back end we already
load these pages for you,
so if you click on them
and you go way faster
to these websites.
So it's again an always
site thing to do,
but it's kind of difficult
to arrange in the back end.
But it makes the user
experience again, way better.
So that's a few
examples about how
we kept on improving Google--
Google Search Engine.
Other things we did.
Anything on the slides
are a few examples,
but I don't have to
go in all of them.
So if you flip to the next one.
What does it mean for me, right?
Me as a Googler,
if I'm searching
something it could be complete
different context, right?
So if you, for
example, are in a city
center on your mobile phone,
it's 7:00 PM, and I want pizza.
They might be looking
for pizza restaurants.
If you type in pizza--
again it's 7:00 PM,
but you're at home at your
desktop when you type in pizza,
you might find a pizza that
delivers to your place.
So it's a different context.
It's a different place,
a different device,
but it's the same key word.
But by looking at all
the different signals
we can define what
the user wants.
Do you want to find a pizza
restaurant when you're
in the city on your
phone, or do you
want to have a pizza
delivered to you
when you're on your
desktop at home.
Completely different context.
And if you go to the site
there's also an example there,
that if you would for example
be in the United States,
you would ask Google,
who's the President?
It understands you're in the
US, so it understands it should
show you the President of--
that was back in the days,
and we can have only this one.
And an interesting thing
is, that it remembers
the topic of your question.
So after you ask this
president you will try and ask
the Google, how tall is he?
He understand that
he is the president,
meaning Barack Obama.
So it's also interesting
to see how it again, tried
to make it for the user,
easier to follow up
with the following
different questions.
Same trick, if you
go to Paris, right?
It understands the phone.
If you have your
geolocation sharing on,
it understands that
you're in Paris.
And if you're close
to the Eiffel Tower
and you ask how tall is it?
It understands that you are
talking about the Eiffel Tower.
So it's again, a few
examples where you can see we
are constantly evolving and
I'm sure you're experiencing it
and making it better at that.

Another thing that I think
is pretty cool is that,
what we saw with the
previous example--
integrating in Google Search--
it that we also have
something called
Google on Tap, which
is pretty rich,
so you should be able
to be in a conversation.
You see an example
here on the screen
talking about going to the movie
and talking or going dinner
somewhere.
What you could do is that if
you hold down the home screen
button-- that is
kind of the circle
you see on the
bottom in the middle.
You should hold this for I
think two or three seconds,
it scans the page, right?
So it's looking for
information on the screen
you're looking at right now, and
it gives you follow up action.
So you can see here
you can fairly easily
look at the restaurants that--
The Slanted Door.
Find it or you find
information about the movie
you want to go to by simply
just holding this button
and then letting
Google scan the page.
So I think again a
great example how
we again, take this information
and by one click on the bottom
try to help you with
your follow up step.
All very great for in
general, but it gets even more
interesting I think,
is you're going
to see OK, for me as a person
what does it matter, right?
What does it mean for me?
I for example, might have some
packages ordered from Amazon.
I might be flying
to some places.
I might have a car rental coming
up for a place I'm flying to.
What Google is also doing is
becoming an internal search
engine meant for yourself.
If I for example, go into
Google and type my packages
it will look into for example,
Gmail or the app for Amazon,
and would gather information
about my package.
Same cancel my flights.
If I got my booking information
send to my Gmail, to my phone,
and it will scan
that information
and it will give it to
me if I look for it.
So Google is also
not only becoming
revamping itself on
the external search,
both on the internet search
for yourself it's becoming
more and more relevant.
So I think here, a
few great examples
of how you would use that.
KAVJAN: So by the
end of the day,
what you're trying
to say here is
that we are trying
to simplify and make
the everyday life easier
to find information
for those companies, but
also for us as human beings.
TIM: Yeah, exactly.
And it's a journey that's
happening all the time.
So that very quick
about the Google.
It's difficult to explain the
whole history of the company
in just a few minutes.
And now we only talked
about how does it Google
and Google Search, right?
I think if you look through
Google as part of Alphabet,
more company which has other
companies under it like Nest,
they cover thermostats.
And they cover web cams
like the shell driving car,
or like the clever
lens, I know anything.
So don't forget we're
talking about Google,
but it's part of a way
bigger whole thing.
Maybe enough for
Google, but we to then.
ANASTASIA: We want to maybe
talk a little bit about life
in Dublin.
TIM: Sure.
Sure.
I can definitely do that.
It's pretty cool.
At the start with it is very
international and near Dublin
we are already over 3,000 people
working for Google in Dublin.
It's European
headquarters of India.
So it's the whole of
Europe and Africa.
And think we have, is
it 60 nationalities?
KAVJAN: 75 I think was our last.
TIM: 75?
KAVJAN: Yeah.
TIM: OK.
And say at least 60 or maybe
other 75 nationalities,
so a lot of them.
I think average age is end of
their twenties, more or less.
ANASTASIA: 28.
I heard the last one.
TIM: 28?
ANASTASIA: Yeah.
TIM: So it's very young,
international, group
of people working here and
we are not alone, right?
I think Facebook is a across
the corner with 1,000 people.
You have Airbnb, Switzer,
LinkedIn, Dropbox.
They call it not Silicon Valley
but I think Docs Valley, right?
Again, all the
European headquarters
are based here and so
that's pretty cool.
And I think if you're
going to slides,
I put in a few pictures
of how it will look.
And you will see the office, a
few pictures from the office.
You will see it's a very
open, transparent, free place
to work.
And yes, and at
the end of the day
it's an American company, right?
So we need to reach
our targets and then do
the stuff we were hired to do.
But once you've done that,
there's lots of freedom.
It is up to you how you
do it, and when you do it,
as long as by the end
of the day you do it.
So here you see some pictures
of current event in one
of the offices.
You see the soccer tables.
You see social events.
And because I think the
great thing of Google
is that they also really care
about the work-life balance.
Yes, work hard.
It's important that the
play hard element is
something as important as that.
And so also we really
focus on well-being.
And we have a gym for jog
there in the building.
We have a pool in the building.
We have the wellness center
which it should be a dentist
or it's unbelievable all
the stuff they do for us.
And to just keep us healthy,
productive, low strain,
I think fun in things we do.
ANASTASIA: What is your favorite
part about Google Dublin?
KAVJAN: Is the
ice cream machine.
ANASTASIA: That's my
daughter's favorite.
KAVJAN: That's what I want.
TIM: It's really crazy
and I think if you ever
have the opportunity to come
over, and see us, please do so.
It's just difficult to
explain and not so much all
the resources but how it
exactly looks on the inside.
But if you have the
opportunity, please do come.
Find one of us and we're
happy to show you around.
I think the last thing
is also my last slide.
Is that yes, in Dublin the
European has a core base.
Mostly support teams,
mostly sale teams.
Of course also other things
like HR, engineering,
but it comes that sales and
support is the big hub here.
But they're in almost
every European country.
Their offices I think around
30 offices in 21 countries.
So it's quite a bunch, and
we basically-- we're always
together with them.
So for example, the
Norwegians would then
work together with
counterparts in,
and also we work together with.
ANASTASIA: I think, yeah, just
to throw in, I think personally
for me, the most
fun part actually
and my favorite thing
about being here in Dublin
is the people.
And the fact that
we're so international,
we're so diverse,
we're so different.
So basically every
day you can expect
to work with people from
other parts of the world
and you can always collaborate.
People are very supportive.
It really creates
this atmosphere
of one big campus, one
big family where everybody
is very, very helpful,
and you'll always
find somebody who can give you
a hand on whatever your work is.
TIM: It's pretty cool.
Anything to add?
Real talk?
KAVJAN: No, I think you got it.
Dublin as a city, of
course, it is quite nice.
I will say it's a little
bit like Gothenburg, which
is the second biggest city.
I guess a lot of
people from Norway
should know where that is.
Because you can walk everywhere.
Your path is all
international people
from all around the world.
So you have the Irish
culture, but you also
have this international
mix of people
that makes it quite dynamic.
So I like the city
a lot as well.
ANASTASIA: Cool.
TIM: I guess that's it
from my point about Google
and Google development.
ANASTASIA: Yes, super.
Thank you.
I think before we jump off
and jump onto the next bit,
I was just going to
mention that you do
have a chance to ask questions.
There is a live chat.
If you don't see it
then you're probably
watching it from our website
from the GOMB website.
You will have to go to
the YouTube channel.
Just hover around a little
bit on the video and you'll
find there's a link.
And then once you're on
the actual YouTube channel,
you will you will
find the live chat.
Please feel free to
ask any questions
either about the program,
or about Google Dublin,
or anything.
We are here to answer them.
Right?
OK.
So let's move on to
the actual introduction
to digital marketing.
And before we move one to
the way we see it at Google,
I suppose I would like to
take a step back a little bit.
Because I definitely
appreciate, and we
know that the students who are
enrolled under this program
actually come from very
many different backgrounds.
So some of you may be studying
computer sciences, some of you
may be studying innovation
and entrepreneurship.
So maybe some of you have had
a separate module on marketing
and know really
a lot about this.
And maybe to some
it's a little bit new.
So let's go a little
bit back and just look
at what is marketing really?
What are we talking about?
So if you remember or if you
look in there academic books,
and if you look at those
academic definitions of it,
you would see that marketing is
defined as all these things--
all those activities,
all those processes
that you put in place in
order to create products,
in order to communicate
about those products,
and also in order to sell them.
So marketing also
for maybe some of you
may be associated with the
so called sold piece, right?
So it's about product, it's
the product development,
so market teams
would be involved
in product development.
They would be involved
in price setting,
they will be involved in the
promotion of those products,
and then also in the
distribution or sales of those.
,
Now because in our
context we will not really
be developing products
so we will not really
be setting prices.
Or maybe you will get into
position with your businesses
and you have a good relationship
that you can advise them this,
but because primarily
we are not doing
that we can say simplify
this a little bit
and say marketing
in our context,
is all about promotion
and distribution.
So its about the communication
to the final users
about the products
of your business.
And it's also about making
sure that those products are
available for sales.
So and then, if we look at
what digital marketing is, then
really there's not
much of a difference
when it comes to the
actual definition.
So digital marketing would
also be primarily concerned
and focusing on the
promotion of the products
and the distribution
of the products.
The major difference between
the traditional marketing
of the same digital lies
and the definition itself.
So it is the promotion and
distribution of products
using digital platforms.
So the examples of the
different digital channels
that the marketing
teams would be using
could be email
marketing, it could
be using affiliate partners.
It could be display, or
so-called banner advertising.
It could be paid
search which we'll
be looking at through
your program that
is just to name a few options.
And in the Boot Camp
program, we will
be focusing on the
digital opportunities
that we can offer.
So the channels
and the solutions
that we have via Google.
And they actually
cover quite a lot
of those different
digital channels
that I have
mentioned previously.
And Kavjan, you want
to talk about moments.
KAVJAN: Yes.
Thank you for that handover.
And so I'm going to talk about
something that we call moments,
and in particular
moments that matter.
And here at Google why
we talk about that,
is as Anastasia
just explained, it
can be quite complicated
and quite tricky
because there's many
different parameters that
go into digital marketing.
So we came up with a
story, or a narrative
that we called moments
that matter, in order
to make it a little bit
easier to understand why
digital marketing is important.
And if we actually look
at how we behave today,
us here in the room, and also
you guys on the video here,
it's all of us.
As Tim mentioned, we are
using our smart phones,
or super computers,
all the time.
And we constantly check it, and
we are connected, and as soon
as we have a question--
we want to know when
the next bus leaves
or what is on the TV tonight,
or which Netflix series
should I watch-- we
go to our smartphone.
So we are constantly connected.
And I just want to use
personal experience.
And this guy with glasses
is supposed to be me.
So a year back I went
to London to have
a few days of a vacation.
And while I was doing this--
I hadn't been there
for a while, so I
did a little bit of research.
Check out which
restaurant should
I go to, which bar should I
check out, which places in town
is very nice to visit.
And when I did this
trip I came back home,
and I wanted to check
my browsing history
to actually see how many moments
did I have during the trip,
but also before the trip.
So here's a small
little gif that I
made of the browsing history.
And you can see that
I checked out Airbnb
to see where I should say.
I looked at healthy restaurant
because I like healthy food.
You might not see
it here but I am.
And we also looked at which
sites in Dublin should be--
sorry, in London--
would be good to visit.
So this is just me for a trip
that I made for three days,
and I had over 100 moments.
And why are these important?
They are important,
because each moment
allows an advertiser or a brand
to actually connect with me.
And when I say connect,
I mean that they
can promote their services
or their business to me.
Many of these experiences that I
just had, many of these moments
that I just had,
were quite personal
and I might not be ready
or open to actually engage
with the brand.
But the good thing about this in
marketing is that you as a user
are the ones in control.
I can actually choose to skip
the ad or just close it down
because I'm not interested.
But if I wouldn't
be interested, if I
get an ad of the best
health restaurant in London
and I click on it, then I'm
very interested in the content
and the message that that
business will want to give me.
So that is the key
learning about the moments,
and the users are
the ones in control.
And if you look at across
all the platforms and all
the products that we have.
And some of them
as was mentioning
before such as YouTube, Google
Chrome, Google Maps, Gmail,
Android Chrome, the list
can be very, very long.
But we have over 1 billion
users using these platforms,
which is quite a big base.
So just imagine how many moments
that actually creates for us.
And all of these moments
will be potential for brands
and advertisers to connect
and interact with the user.
But the question
that you might ask
when you have these much moments
is, where should I start?
Because it'll be
quite complicated.
But we have tried
to simplify this
and we have come up with five
principles, or five categories
of moments as we call them,
to make it a little bit easier
to know where to start.
And we have them here
on the presentation,
and when we start from the left.
They are all connected
to the consumer journey.
So we have for the first,
I want to watch moments.
And this is basically
where you're
in the mindset where you
go online for example
to, YouTube to get inspired,
or to watch content
that you're passionate about.
For me it will be
arsenal videos.
For team it would be
another team, and so forth.
So you're not really in the
purchase, or purchasing phase.
You just want to get
inspired or entertained.
And there we go to, I
want to know moments.
And this is more about
exploring and researching.
Imagine that you wanted to plan
your holiday for the summer,
and you want to check out
different destinations.
So where could I go?
Where to they have the best
search spot in the world,
for example.
You're not still
ready to buy anything,
but you are more inspirational.
Then we have, I
want to go moments.
For example, either you want to
buy a new smart digital camera.
And you sit at your
home and you want
to go to the nearest
store in order just
to go and get the feel, and
the feeling for that camera.
You want to go and
find it quite well.
And you often use
your mobile phone
to actually find that
store and a close by you.
And then we have the,
I want to do moments,
which can be both before
you bought something,
but all that after.
Imagine that you just
thought that Ikea drawer.
You come back to
your house and you
don't figure out how to do it.
So you just go on
YouTube and you
Google how to assemble this
Ikea drawer, and that helps you.
And then we have
the last part, which
is that I want to buy
moments, which is quite highly
intently because you are
ready to buy something,
but you're not sure which brand
or which company you should
buy it for.
And here is quite
important as an advertiser
to be visible and be
present and not let them--
because the client
and the content
will not come to
you automatically.
You need to help
them choose you.
So this is to help you get
a little bit of overview
of what kind of moments
is very important to have
in the consumer journey.
And to wrap it up we
have three parameters
that is quite important.
And one of them as we've been
mentioning before is intent.
Intent is basically what are
you as a user trying to do
when you're online searching?
And then we have the context.
And the context is
literally like Tim
said with the pizza example.
So which situation are you
in when you do this search.
And then we have
the immediacy which
is basically how fast can
we cater to your needs.
And just to go a little
bit more in detail,
intent has been a very
critical topic in marketing
for a very, very long time.
And if you investigate
within the intent,
you can clearly and
quite finely understand
what is the consumer needs and
what they actually want to do.
For example, imagine if you
would study the top things that
makes people search
for a gluten allergen,
or the challenges they have for
a college application process.
Why do people search
for hairstyles?
If you are in this any
of these businesses
and you understand why
a user would search
for these behaviors,
it's easier for you
to cater your message, and
your ads, and your creatives
to actually have the right
message in the right time.
If you look at the context,
this is basically on the
where we look at
what type of device
will the user use, what time
of day, and where are they at?
If you use a digital
camera, again
as an example, if you're
sitting on a Friday evening
watching a movie on
your laptop and you're
browsing for digital camera,
versus if you're on the street
or even inside a digital camera
store on your phone searching
for it.
Both of them are the same key
words with quite different
intent here.
And then the last part,
we have immediacy.
Which is how fast can your
message as an advertiser
solve the problem of the user.
If it's not fast
enough they're just
going to browse
for the next one.
So it's extremely important
to be relevant and fast.
And if you take
all of these three
and in the holy
grail in a minute,
we have the moments
and the micro-moments
that we, as an
advertiser, need to win.
And obviously we
are at Google, we
have different products
that helps our advertiser
to win these different moments.
And we have a quite
a big range of that.
And during the online
Boot Camp program
we'll go through many of
these different features
and you will familiarize
yourself with them
and learn more about them.
And in order to
go over, Anastasia
will now explain
to you guys, what
are the next steps in terms of
the program-- what's coming up
and what you need
to be prepared for.
And so, Anastasia?
ANASTASIA: Yeah, and so let's
have a look in the next steps
and what's to come.
So again, just to
summarize this session,
so the idea is I hope you see
it for the better understanding
now of the differences
in between the Boot
Camp and the challenge.
When we come into the
picture that you still
need to really understand and
go through the whole of the GOMC
website to understand the
rules and really pick out
all the relevant advice.
For example, which
business you can select.
Then I hope we have
managed to inspire you
a little bit by
telling you our story
because I think it was quite
an ambitious aim or mission
or objective that Larry and
Sergey started off with.
And it's really fun to
see how they are really
living their dream and it's
all happening and still taking
place.
I think the cool
things there are really
is that whenever
it comes to search,
I think we are really
focusing on being relevant.
We are focusing
on making searches
efficient and of good
quality for the users.
So we always kind of put
them into the center.
An then the micro
moments narrative
is really relevant
for you, in the sense
that when you start thinking
about the solutions that
should be relevant
for your businesses.
This is where micro-moments
come into the picture.
Because one of the
things that we probably
find as one of the most
challenging ones in our jobs,
when we work with our clients
and with the companies,
is that quite often
they tend to take
their very traditional
mindset of using
this mass communication
on the internet.
Whereas in most of the cases
it really wouldn't just work.
So micro-moments are there.
This perspective
and this framework
is really there to help
you identify those moments
and to make sure that your
communication is tailored
and as relevant as
possible during all
those different periods
in time and moments.
Now a little bit
about the next steps.
On our website we
already have included
the recommended actions and
also the different materials
that you can be going through.
The first thing--
well this week,
or we can say next week,
the beginning of next week--
is first of all, again, please
do go through the competition
website, the actual GOMC.
Really do read this.
I can't highlight it more.
It's really, really important.
And actually I can see
one of the questions that
has come through
from Gonzalo who
is wondering whether
it's possible to choose
a business of your own.
I would say, I
don't really see--
I personally don't see that
this should be an issue.
I think you should
be able to do that.
Now having said that
I really recommend
you still go to
the website and you
read through all the rules
in terms of which businesses
you are allowed and not.
Please, we do expect
that you take ownership
of this, a little bit yourself.
So put yourself
totally into this,
and read up, and figure out.
The most important thing
about your business
is that it has to be a
business new to AdWords,
so either those would be the
companies that have never
used AdWords, or
that have accounts
that have been inactive
for the past half a year.
But do please check
this out once again,
to make sure that we have
the right answer there.
Now, you will also
be registering
so very soon you
should be registering
for the competition.
Now again, some of you may
have already registered
and some of you have
received an email
with the specific
professor and the email
that you should be
registering under.
Now, if you have received
a different email saying
wait a little bit, that means
that your professor has not yet
registered or that their
verification is still pending.
So we will let you know.
We will inform you once you
are registered to do this.
So don't worry.
You'll be informed at
all times, all right?
Then you, the next thing will
be choosing a team obviously.
So if you already know somebody
that's very, very good.
If you don't again, we
will be connecting you
to the students
from your university
and trying to we are
looking for a system
to make it as
efficient as possible,
because we realize that not
all of you know each other.
Then please choose
a team captain.
So in each team there
will be one person
who will have the
responsibility for actually
accessing the dashboard.
It's only the team captain
that registers for the GOMC.
So not every single member, but
just one person from the team.
And then, I have also
explained we have
linked to this on the website.
Please start going through
steps three to four
in the preparation
for the next week.
The sessions are new.
The sessions starting
from next week
will be quiet information-rich.
There will be a
lot of relatively
condensed information where
it will be very hands on.
We will be very
specific about where
you find things in the account,
how you actually implement,
and so on.
So please bring your whole
self to those sessions.
You can also replay
them afterwards.
But they will also require
some additional reading
and some additional
time from you.
Finally, please join
us in G+ Community.
You must have received an
email with a link to the G+
Community.
Say hi to others.
Please do remember
to be respectful.
People are coming from
various backgrounds.
Be supportive.
If you can help somebody else,
please help somebody else.
Give the answers
to the questions.
All right.
So the next session is going
to be on Wednesday, next week.
And I think we can take a
couple of questions here.
So we have a question
here from Julie
that is asking what the previous
teams have done well, so
basically, how did they succeed?
What are the
recommendations there.

That's a good question.
I think first of all,
again, understand
the requirements first of all.
So have a look at what those
reports should include.
Again, if you have been
through the website
you would know that there is
actually they're Googlers,
but there is also
an academic panel
that is involved in
evaluating those reports.
So, and through those
reports I would say,
the strongest of those which
show very good understanding
of the client context.
Where you do not propose
things just because there
are some nice or cool
solutions, but they actually
provide a very thorough
and good understanding
of why those solutions are
relevant for the business.
And that's probably one of
the most critical things.
Understand what is required.
And always that you
will also be evaluated
on the basis of your results
that your team actually
provides.
And finally I would, say get
your head around the solutions.
Try and see, we have recommended
you say that you probably will
need up to five hours a week.
But this can also take longer.
Obviously you have to try
to manage your time yourself
so you know better
how you learn.
But do take the time
to actually understand.
Join all of the sessions.
Be active.
If there's something you don't
understand ask questions.

I hope that answered
the question.
TIM: I think as in general, I
try to make user first, right?
Your job, somebody gets
questions from clients.
After that just researching
OK, what do we really,
what's the really
thing that's going
to add value to the end user--
to the client, right?
So whatever solution you
will implement once you truly
understand it,
what's the real added
value for the end user of it.
So check it that you
don't work in the getting
stuck in products live.
It's really trying
to help the end user.
ANASTASIA: Yeah.
I see there's one more question.
I'm actually wasn't kind of sure
that I understand all of it,
but I see that Julie, you are
saying that you also asked this
question on G+.
So maybe we can just go back
to G+ and answer your question
and then come up
with the follow ups.
So we'll follow up
on G+ on this one.
All right.
So I think this is
it from us for today.
Please don't be silent.
If you do have
questions join G+ again,
and voice every question you
have and we'll do our best
to answer those.
Yes.
Thank you very much for
joining, and see you next week.
TIM: Thanks a lot guys.
KAVJAN: See you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
