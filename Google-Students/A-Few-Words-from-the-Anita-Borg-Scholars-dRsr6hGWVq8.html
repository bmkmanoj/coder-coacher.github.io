at Columbia University I am show panetta
Polly I'm a senior undergrad at Tufts
University outside of Boston pursuing a
bachelor's degree in computer science
and biological father kya guard the
company something so I'm currently doing
my masters in stanford university with
specialization computer architecture hi
my name is Michelle and I'm a second
year PhD student at the University of
Alberta in Canada why did you apply to
the Anita Borg scholarship ok i applied
because um as well i was thinking about
ways to pay for college but and all
upset and I went on the website and on
this one the scholarship that if I kept
on reading more about Nina burg I just
felt like I had this connection with her
because of her story and what she wanted
to do with her life and the computer
science and woman and so I was way more
passion I applied for the scholarship as
opposed to others and I just felt like
this would not give me money but also a
connection with other women who are like
me going into technology was like
passing along the corridor and like the
hate spelling and computer science is
always poster which said that women in
computer science and promoting CS so
those were the really catchy phrases
when I saw them the moment I was really
inspired like this is not the first
technical thing that technical
scholarship that i'm applying for and I
really enormous chance so just write an
apply for it how has the need a Borg
scholarship impacted you I think the
scholarship is actually affected me in
kinetic ways by winning the scholarship
we actually got to go to the Googleplex
which was really great place actually
got to meet a lot of Googlers which
sounds really cliche but you go there
and you're in the environment of people
and you meet the people that work that
you realize if they all have I'm a
passion for the same thing you do which
is really great and secondly I think it
to me because it's kind of a realize
that I am smart like I do like like in
this field yeah there are many great
things that I can do people actually
believe in me which is really awesome
and all that kind of I'm support from
other people getting the Anita Borg
scholarship solidified my future plans I
met a lot of graduate students at the
Google scholars retreat and it was
really inspirational hearing everyone
really excited about the research and
type things you could do your science so
I decided after I graduate I'm going to
get a PhD in computer so this what
advice would you give women who are
considering studying computer science
okay I would say to not be afraid to
study computer science even though it
seems like a technical field and it's
like all of guys you're all nerds it's
not only that way it's really fun and
you can really get to know people by
speaking appropriate languages and it's
also a good luck it's if you're if
you're good in science math or
technology engineering then try a
computer science becomes really
interesting and you can do so much with
it so don't be afraid surface we think
the computer science is like restricted
to hard core programming Oreo indoor
thing but it has such a wide field like
raining from computer architecture to
bioinformatics to even interfacing with
electrical engineering so just don't go
restricted by the misconception it is it
is like a plethora of ways just go
explore it and you never get bored of it
it's just a wonderful feel that you
should not miss</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
