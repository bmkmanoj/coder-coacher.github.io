me and for I think for a lot of people
that work there before working at Google
I worked in small companies medium-sized
companies and briefly big company and in
most of those cases we were very
resource constrained we were encouraged
to think inside a certain box how can
you do more with what you've got how can
you maybe take a problem that's this big
and cut it down to size and make it a
smaller problem at Google we're
encouraged from the founders throughout
the company to think big we're often
challenged to think about how to make a
problem bigger scale really pervades
everything at Google and so for me
personally that represents a challenging
area whether it's trying to figure out
how to grow an effective engineering
organization how to operate globally or
thinking about some of the technical
challenges of scaling very rapidly and
you know for any system that we work on
we have to think in terms of what if
this system were ten times bigger or a
hundred times bigger a thousand times
bigger and if we don't then we'll
rapidly get run over millions and
millions of people use Google and we
hope that that will continue to be true
so really the most rewarding thing for
me is the opportunity to work on
organizational and technical problems in
the area of scale my name is Marcus
Mitchell and i'm an engineering director</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
