a method to efficiently find an element
in a sorted list of values say you have
a list of all the birthdays in your
class and you want to find the one that
comes after yours if you turn the list
into a sorted list using the month date
format then you know all the birthdays
in chronological order so the next date
after your birthday in this list is the
date you are looking for you could find
your birthday in this list by looking
through the list from the beginning
until you find your birthday this is
called a linear search and might take a
long time especially if a lot of your
classmates have their birthday before
you a more efficient way is to use a
binary search you can look at the middle
of the list and based on the value there
you can determine whether your birthday
is in the first half for the second half
now you know that you can safely ignore
the other half you can then repeat this
step and looking at the middle of this
new list and continue until you reach
your birthday once you've found your
birthday you can just move along the
list until you find someone with a
different birthdays
if you reach the end of the list then
move along to the beginning of the
lesson this may not seem like a lot of
time saved but imagine a list of
birthdays for everyone in your entire
school if your school had a thousand
students you may have to compare your
birthday hundreds of times if you use
the linear search approach by using the
binary search you won't ever need more
than ten comparisons to find your
birthday
