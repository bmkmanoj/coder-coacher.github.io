welcome to our Google Code Jam hang out
number two
Google Code Jam is a programming contest
the Google runs every year we ask
algorithmic problems and contestants can
go online and compete with little
experience or a lot of experience and
the finalists get to fly to New York and
potentially when up to $10,000 I'm
joined by some of the luminaries of the
competitive programming world here I'm
joined by pentameter Jeff I have to warn
you by the way that I mangle everybody's
last names
tatyana is a champion competitive
program he's won more tournaments than I
could name and he's a fellow Googler to
say he works at Google and he is he was
one of the people who works on Kojak
which is also true of the other my other
two guests here
Tomica jaiku who has also won a number
of tournaments and whom I've known now
something like nine years when we met at
Google's first code jam in 2003 and
finally a new free whoo the last name
I'm just not even going to try he can
say it for us and he he's been heavily
involved in the preparation of code Jam
problems this year so we might hear a
little bit about that from him so maybe
if you guys can introduce yourselves and
tell us a little bit more about
yourselves
Tomic you want to lead us off so sure um
my name is Tom akaike and you said it
very well and so I I started working for
Google in 2007 and and have been doing
programming competitions for a long time
started doing programming competitions
in high school when I was about 16 or so
alright very cool I'll ask you for more
later yeah go ahead
okay so my name is pitching integer
which also pronounced quite good I'm I'm
from Moscow and still working for Google
in Moscow
I also General Electric in 2007 and I
will also be doing programming contest
since six forever
and I actually want the code jamming
2006 very nice and start go ahead
nuclear hi so my name is on flute
astrick I am more of a problem creator
when the problem solder it sounds bad
when I say I create problems but
nonetheless so I am setting problems for
this year and last year's culture and
also for instance for the ACMA CPC
finals and I'm working in Google here in
Warsaw I moved here from the office in
Krakow
a year ago all right well very cool we
if you hadn't noticed we have people
from three different offices here in
Murray is in Warsaw and potatoes in
Moscow and Tomic and I are in Mountain
View though here on the Pacific coast of
the United States it's 8 a.m. so it's
too early for programmers but I guess we
want to be have a good time for our
guests and so part of the reason why
we're here is to talk about cojan but we
open up the we open up a Google
moderator page for questions and it
seems like what people are most
interested in is sort of the backgrounds
of our competitors and how they practice
so maybe if I can start off by asking
each of you how you got into programming
period not just their to programming
book programming and and then sort of
from there how you got into into
competitive programming actually would
you care to lead us off
sure I mean I didn't have a computer
until I or this waiting's first problem
in contests my programming start was
with a book and then after reading this
book I went to like after our school
when you can practice programming and
from then on I was fascinated by it so
it'll run from there it was writing some
games in the beginning but then and have
her authoring mr.hotsia stuff like
programming contests I think it was 11
or 12 I think 11 all right in the early
starter tell me how are you so I was
similar I got a computer in a 8-bit
computer when I was 12 and pretty soon
after I started programming on it in
basic and doing some little basic
programs James and stuff I didn't really
get into algorithms and competitions
until high school I started by doing
math competitions and since there is a
significant overlap between math
competitors math competition competitors
and programming competition compilers I
got to know some good people who who
have done well in programming
competitions so I kind of got interested
in that circuit yeah so so I started
doing program competition when I was 16
doing the publish or link captain
informatics but we're interesting and
dutifully I understand that you got a
late start on programming contests but
maybe not on programming actually I mean
like I also had a computer when I was
pretty young and I guess I did someday I
think about it didn't stick with me and
all of high school I actually did math
competitions and well and math basically
and I also like like comics editors a
signal a significant overlap and there
was quite a few people who are doing
programming competitions but I've seen
do you have to know really a lot to get
into this so I didn't true
yeah which is not true which I learned
the hard way or the easy way actually
when I actually started doing this but
this was so I went to study maths and
computer science just because doing only
maths
kind of boring but I still didn't do
programming competitions and then like
when I finished University it turned out
that there are no math competitions for
people who aren't students anymore and I
kind of held the arch to compete with
somebody somehow and so this is the
moment where I was so desperate but I
actually looked at the programming
competitions and it turned out that you
don't really have to know anything
participate and even do reasonably well
so and so but this was when I was 20 I'm
thinking this something wasn't very
small wow that's really interesting III
like you in a circuit start programming
and I was quite young but but it never
really stuck actually yeah but it also
never they stuck until I discovered
programming competitions myself
now that's anatomic you guys are for
mocking their word great at this stuff
so you mentioned getting started pretty
young you know how how much practice did
you guys have like how many years of
experience did you have before he
started winning hmm so I actually did
pretty well in the Polish Olympiad when
I was like eight two years after I
started programming competition but I
think that's because I already had some
math competition experience and that
really helps and I I started reading
books about algorithms just to do well
in programming competitions so that was
a big driver for me to to learn things
and yeah and also I went to science
camps to math constant when I met people
who also went to other complete camps
including programming or computer
science camps
I decided to go to some of those and and
and that's where I learned a lot of
things that eventually let me do very
well in programming competitions
location uh yeah I think it also took me
something like three years to to get
from doing nothing to you perform
reasonably well at a Russian level for
me it was mostly defense because my mom
at my first several interests were quite
funny actually so I went to the most
holding but then I lost it completely
like soft only one problem but they kept
because I was so young they took me to
the Russian Olympic and there again I
lost it completely but because I was so
young they took me to the International
Olympic camp and there I learned a lot
of things so that's this hot work and I
think the competition is really what I
was driving learning for me because I
was I by myself I don't think I would
ever become as good but when I see
people that are solving problems that I
can't I think that what makes me want to
learn what what more interesting so you
know for those of you who are watching
at home it's worth noting than that
these guys you know who are definitely
among the best in the world took a
couple of years of practice and intense
case serious reading and infectious case
going to camps where he study this with
other people I did to get good and and
I've heard even longer to sort of get to
the point where they're top of the world
so I serve on a slightly more strange
note I understand that hope you have got
interesting places during TV program in
contests and a new free to do you have a
tale of that I am when I was competing
the only time actually I successfully
competed in top corner open whereby
successfully I mean I went to the
on-site finals I was somewhere in the
middle of nowhere in Poland with a group
of Boy Scouts for a month and
I wanted to do the final offline timing
final mmm rounds which you usually do at
home but well I wasn't at home so I
wanted to find anyplace but her internet
access which wasn't that easy and
finally I found out that if I Drive 30
kilometres out of the place where I am
Barry McDonald's and the McDonald's
because of Wi-Fi and triggering ground
for both free sex Iceland actually
passed from or so I went before own five
and there are some kids birthday and it
was pretty awful but fortunately you
know like it was enough to solve one
problem to get to the finals and this
was what I did that's awesome
how about you guys yeah um yeah I think
there was a time like when I was in
university I tried to basically
participate in every competition I could
find so there was some some conditions
happening at 5 a.m. for example and I
was participating and all of them
sometimes discredit awkward situations
like once I was traveling in a train
from sin days back to Moscow like they
were like four people in the apartments
all sleeping and I was right in the
contest at 5 a.m. while everybody else
was sleeping and it was like on an upper
berth in a training pitch was also quite
strange but wow you guys are hardcore my
personal most interesting contest
chartering experience was my first year
of grad school I was just getting
started with grad school I was having
just a really rough week and I've got a
migraine headache which are these really
really nasty headaches and I was my the
physics departments computer lab and I
just decided that I was just I was going
to compete damnit so I I stayed up with
like an increasingly awful headache to
computer in a top corner open round so
um and actually here's another question
for you actually ever wants answered I
guess we'll start Petya have you made a
lot of friends from programming
computations
well I think I feel like my friends are
roughly divided into three groups like
high school friends university friends
and program completion friends and I
think the latter group is by far the
largest I don't I think I spend most
time with my program friends Oh
everybody else what I happy that yeah I
mean that the contests are great
especially when you go on site you you
meet so many people and they're all
smart so it's great to hang out with
them so definitely yeah girlfriends yeah
they're not just smart but they're also
smart sort of algorithmic thinkers in a
particular way and yeah yeah my
experience sort of uglies there um now I
I understand though I didn't watch this
happen that there was a particularly
interesting round at the top were open I
think it was the finals but I could be
wrong about this that you know I
mentioned that Tom competitive you guys
are the best in the world and so of
course he's got off the games to each
other and I think in this round you guys
were competing pretty intensely for
first place
Tomic could you tell us the story from
your perspective well there have been
multiple rounds actually we competed
against each other as far as I know
starting 2003 at least in the ACM
programming competition yeah but and
then I think Pia tiah beat mean top
color open in 2006 and I got second and
then you're referring to the 2008 final
when when we live today and I won and he
was a second yeah but that was a very
interesting final cuz what I did I got a
lot more points from solving the
problems but then given that top color
has a challenge space where he can get
extra points by yeah
finding bugs and other people's problems
yet I did very very well on that which I
did not expect could happen
and basically left me with 15 seconds to
to get back on top after he he got the
first place challenging people but
luckily I found a random solution that I
hoped wouldn't work for some reason and
tested it with a free random test case
so that ended up well for me this is one
of the things I particularly identify
what's the atomic is the game theory of
competitive programming you're very
seriously about try to gain your
opponents yeah I sort of waited for this
throughout the whole challenge turned
round to because I figured that it's
gonna be almost impossible for patr to
catch up so I better just wait and not
just in case you're wrong right yeah I
mean if I'm wrong I'm just gonna
increase the the my new possibility he
might catch up so so it's better to just
not do it turned out if he did catch up
so yeah there's some interesting
strategy strategy components to these
kind of decisions I vaguely remember
around it again I talked about her final
where you submitted one or I can't hear
you man or publishing sorry can you
hurry down thank you
well I'll just keep I'll just keep
talking and hope that you can hear me
yeah
I remember talk good around where you
I've been told this anyway you submitted
a hard problem really quickly to trick
other people into thinking easy yes sir
oh so that's what's in an online I think
that was an that was an online round in
in one of the top allure tournaments I
didn't exactly plan it that way so what
happened was I started solving the heart
problem and I sort of thought that there
was a very easy solution and some sort
of a greedy natural solution and it's
thought that it would work which turns
out it didn't so I I called it up pretty
quickly
when I was about to submit it I thought
I realized it's wrong but then I said oh
it's so good to submit it because other
people are going to think the same thing
this will put some pressure on everybody
else to compression complication I think
I was one of the maybe even though I'm
not sure well most people just try to
solve the problems come back a state has
to give it so competitive component of
competition I think actually many people
look for work problems all these sort of
any programs to solve I think sometimes
the strategy doesn't work so I guess for
the coming home gym I would suggest
people to at least try to solve all
problems by solve before working with
others okay that tax you know that's
pretty good advice and for some of our
newer contenders though I think probably
if they see a large number of people at
solve a particular problem maybe that's
it somehow but we still think about
focusing on that one first yeah yeah
what companies you get stuck on what
problem then yes it's usually better to
think about not one just for several
minutes since I've come back it's still
better just look at the screen and I
think that I really liked about the
culture format is when I still was
eligible to compete by not being
employed by Google is that it's
reasonably relaxed in terms of time I
mean you have it two and a half hours on
the usual round three actually Wow it's
also and that's quite a lot of time
so yeah you've got quite a lot of time
to actually solve the problems which
means that you can you know like take
your time thinking you can try and open
all them and try to understand all of
them which is you don't feel this real
real need to hari hari hari insult as
quick as possible ok interesting and so
my next question actually is coming off
of the Google moderator link so this
question is for petia and it's how often
do you find problems and the chance to
apply contests like thinking and
algorithms in your daily job like seeing
a problem hey that would be a you know a
500-point your division one problem and
this question is from jed in argentina
um some of it biased of course because i
tend to look for tasks at work that
require some algorithms but for music
come on quite regularly yes not quite
different in selection from what program
and contests have I think the most
frequent ones are like simple one
generational dynamic program in
basically you have like several
terabytes of data come in one block at a
times and you have to compute some
something about it and it actually very
but then there are other things like KD
trees that have appeared several times
on the end I think once I even
implemented a segment tree which allowed
to other constant to arrange and find
the maximum range in auger effect and
also the world I mean it's not like it
was like I'm only doing this and I think
interesting problems are going to
extract some information for me
basically and there is no way concrete
statement or concrete time limits you
just have to find a way to make it the
data more use and I think of someone
actually quite as challenging and more
interesting than the
response interesting it's funny about
you know you just said this in passing
but it's kind of a characteristic
working at Google is that you know you
get like a terabyte of data and you want
to do something or many many terabytes
it's it's very often the case here that
we just work in very large columns of
data um all right so the next question
comes from someone whose name I'm sure
to pronounce well it's Patrick in Poland
and the question is how much do you
think your experience in programming
competitions helped you in your career I
know the Pecha is still actively taking
part and almost also have competitions
but how about others do you think it's
helpful to compete while having a job
now I know you actually didn't compete
before having a job so maybe I'll start
this one off with tom acke sure well so
definitely it helped me when programming
compositions bit for me was give me a
motivation to learn about computer
science at all initially and that's
what's the biggest the biggest part of
it I guess and so I did learn a lot by
reading and also going to competitions
themselves and solving problems and and
then going to training camps - for
international competitions and stuff
like that for these days it's mostly
like a hobby that I don't do that much
at university we we did some training
like for for the ACM competition with it
the weekly training work also yeah so I
think compete if it wasn't for
programming competitions I might be in
programming competitions I would still
be doing maths at university which I
don't I mean I don't say it's a bad
thing although I'd say I like it better
here and yeah
the same thing that Tommy said but it
gave me a lot of motivation to actually
you know like there's no way to learn to
write cold over and actually to write a
lot of code I mean you do learn by other
things too yeah so there now there's one
question that on our moderator link has
been asked time and time again always in
a slightly different form but what I
boils down to is how do you prepare for
programming competition how do you get
good have you practiced and it seems
like this is an important enough
question to people of all levels but but
I want to ask if all of you I think this
one has been asked by Nicholas by digit
by Aniston by abhishek by Icebar ayah
and I'm going to stop there because I'm
not doing very well the names there's
been asked by just a ton of people so
maybe we've heard from you at least
recently pata what's what's your number
one tip for how people everybody's
contacts the community or as simple have
to practice I mean and I think you have
to practice in a way that you don't like
if you cancel the problem you shouldn't
forget about it you should try to come
back to it in two batches of it like ask
your friends ask people on the internet
but I think the important thing is to
get problem solved
in the end so I think that kind of
approaches can get you very far
all right Clinic so I I did quite a bit
of practice when I was in college
because I had the lot of time in the
dormant and at university so what I
mostly did is well first of all
competing in a lot of competitions on
life that's a really fun way to practice
and it's pretty effective also I think
but also just solving a past problems on
from various competitions like you can
do on our College on website go and
solve all the past problems and and see
if your solution works and not even try
to solve them fast just actually I was
trying to solve them to write the code
slowly and think about like the best
shortest way to implement a solution and
then go improve it and that helps later
when you're under time pressure to to go
with a simple solution once you if in
practice you started off with a visually
people start with a complicated solution
over complicated if they don't have much
experience in program competition and
then then you can go and iterate and
improve it over time and that's why next
time you you you have to you have to
write some code you can be much more
effective by writing shorter it's
solutions okay that's that's really
interesting so your your big piece of
advice is to be very mindful when you
practice about the solutions that you're
writing and instead of trying instead of
practicing like you're competing
attractive out there as quickly as
possible you should yeah it focuses on
how you can do better next time that's
that's really interesting that's a
really good piece of advice I do free
how about you so for me the most intense
fear of practice I had was one hot year
period basically when I decided okay so
I'm gonna see if I can get to the Google
culture impales the result of this was
getting to the top cold air open panels
somewhat accidentally and then I
practiced quite a lot and the way I
practiced was I took some problem set
for instance I did all previous call
jumps back then and logged what I was
doing so I wrote down the time when I
first read the problem wrote down the
time when I understood the prasada I
understood the problem wrote down the
times when I had various ideas you know
like drop down on a piece of paper
at what point of time was I doing what
and then like after doing three or four
B's I went over vironment try to you
know like figure out what went wrong and
like for instance if there was a problem
and there was one man I spent three
hours debugging what I actually wrote
well that's bad so and then the next
time I decided okay so I'm going to for
instance try to write down the whole
on paper before I started coding because
I heard somebody was to make this and
this relief act and this was not a good
idea but what I learned is but actually
writing down the declarations of all the
functions on paper did help me quite a
lot in this also and I started doing
this in real programming contests I'm
not saying that this is a good strategy
for everybody
but what I'm saying that what I learned
by trial and error was that it decreased
the average error rate for me
significantly that's interesting so
Tomic was survive mindful during his
practice sessions and you're sort of
very mindful after your practice
sessions about what what you can do to
improve but I agree about the writing
things down hmm
so I also use I would also write things
down and pieces of code even although
with it with experience you can sort of
imagine it but instead of writing things
down if you don't have much time you can
like just imagine just do it in your
head basically but but that comes with
experience and even then it's very
important not to start coding just think
think the code through first so people
make the mistake of starting things
starting coding before they they have a
whole solution planned out which is a
very bad idea in general though for
newer coders I should point out that
they probably don't yet have the skill
to hold the whole solution in their head
for longer so yeah not case you should
definitely use paper
okay very good yeah that's just a skill
that improves this time I think as you
solve more problems who you get they're
keeping stuff in your head so we're just
about out of time here I say jest about
it really were completely out of time
anyone wanna I don't know III I guess I
want to add in but I'm super excited
about this year's code Jam problems and
all three of you have been working hard
on those anyone got anything any words
to add to that
no it's gonna be great I like to hear ya
in New York yes gonna be New York that's
true so we look forward to seeing our
top 25 finalists in New York
thank you to all three of you this has
been a great conversation and I hope
people learn something from watching it
I guess this is going to go up on
YouTube below a while after actually
we're done so thank you - I see atomic
and moon three and this has been our
second Google Code Jam hangout on air
thanks everybody
