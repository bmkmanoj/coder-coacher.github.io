lifecycle a simple command line program
runs from the time it is launched until
it is complete in a GUI environment with
multiple apps however things are a bit
more complicated as the app may be
interrupted by other apps the
application lifecycle refers to the
various states that an app may be in as
a result of these interruptions an
Android each state is marked by a
callback method that allows the activity
to react to user actions as a user
launches an app the sequence quickly
moves through to transient States before
entering the resume in this state the
activity is now in the foreground and
the user is able to interact with it if
another app interrupts the activity the
activity enters the paused States in
this state the activity is still
partially visible but can no longer take
any inputs or execute any code if the
user chooses to switch to the other app
the activity enters the stopped city in
this state the activity is no longer on
the screen and can't execute any code
but is still retained
in memory it will stay in this state
until the user restarts the app moving
it to the resumed state or the user
closes it in which case it moves to the
destroyed state before the app is
removed from memory the life cycle
methods ensure the app behaves in ways
the user expects it does not crash when
the call is received or the user
switches to another app it does not
consume valuable system resources
unnecessarily and it retains the users
progress to be returned to you later
