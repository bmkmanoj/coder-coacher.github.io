technology support services here at
Northwestern University we're proud to
have google visiting us on their Google
bus tour google apps has been deployed
to our students for over a year now and
they love it you might be the last stop
on the Google bus tour but that doesn't
mean we released we'll probably the
smartest okay
basically i use my calendar to manage my
entire life as a crazy college student i
don't have time to write a diary the
guys ready to want to and so use my
google calendar sort of remember
everything i do i remembered that one
day in october i played for sure and my
friend broke some i can search pusher in
my calendar and find the date and
remember it
I just started using labels to organize
my emails I have my class label my
personal label my activities label all
sorts of things and it just works really
well especially being at college very
busy lifestyle now I have the help of
google to organize my life and keep it
very safe
I sort of started using google talk to
keeping track of all my friends that are
somewhere else it's just very sleek a
Google target its trick it's very small
it's simple and I found that the voice
quality if you use calling through
google talk is generally better
I'm on the group that brings concerts to
campus when we use google docs for
everything and we're putting a full
application to be on our organization
this year completely online using google
forms and embedding it right on our
website instead of having a stack of
paper applications we have to sort
through and do data entry on we have
everyone's email address and all their
responses and their answers to our
questions and their preferences and one
spreadsheet right from the get-go and
that's going to be a big time saver
hi my name is will Nicholas i'm here at
Northwestern University my alma mater
we're here today talking with students
about how they use Google Apps we love
to hear your story so please visit our
website and upload your video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
