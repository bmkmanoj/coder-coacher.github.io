our University back to school road trip
but visit 10 campuses around the u.s.
talk to students and faculty and find
out what are they doing with Google Apps
and what should we be doing better to
make this course you can't wait to see
you there to get on the ride
the conversations are the best with a
professor you don't have to keep tracing
back where your email is from as all my
contacts ever save just type in search
and every person comes up
as a crazy college student I don't have
time to write the diary like I didn't
want to and so use my google calendar
sort of remember everything i do if i
remember that one day in october i
played twister and my friend Brooke
system I can search twitter in my
calendar and find the date and an
average so I'm actually making a
calendar for all the free food on campus
and I'm sharing it with all my friends
that I know don't have a dining plan I'm
a part about six different groups on
campus so I'm able to sync on my
calendar and the day part I'm able to
put it on my phone and just send me
updates and emails I was supposed to be
I saw the time I forgive or don't tell
anybody
it's a great way to get in touch with
all your professors and keep in contact
with all the people that you left behind
and family and new friends when it gets
a little bit too cold in the winter we
usually have like online chats to
actually collaborate and do our club
meeting
I'm installed a computer literacy 180
and for that class actually have to make
a website instead of making an own HTML
I can just go to google and make my own
website and make it look cool and design
it and it's easy to do
my entire class of over 3,000 people are
currently using Google Docs to create a
big document so we could present it to a
company there was a group of seven of us
they had to do this presentation
somebody even one point completely
rearranged all the slides was no big
deal went back to revisions that we
needed to go everything's back to the
way it's supposed to be no hassle no
mess oh I'm also using it for my
fraternity to collect a lot of
information from all the alumni I send
them a forum in an email they fill it
out hit submit it automatically
populates a spreadsheet
we really learned some valuable things
about how students were using these
schools keep your eye out for the bus
you never know where it will be next and
who knows it might just show up at your
campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
