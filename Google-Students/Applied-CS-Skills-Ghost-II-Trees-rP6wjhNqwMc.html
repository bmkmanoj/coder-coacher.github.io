data structure that is often used to
represent hierarchical data an example
might be how files and folders are
organized on a computer folders can hold
both files and other folders a linear
structure would not be able to represent
this type of relationship in computer
science trees go downwards so the top of
a tree
is called the root each element on a
tree is called a node in this example
the root is a topmost folder and each
file or folder is a node a node can only
ever have one parent but may have
multiple children binary trees are a
special type of tree where nodes can
have no more than two children notice I
do not have any children or called leaf
nodes given a tree there are multiple
ways of visiting all the nodes you could
look at the nodes at each level and
visit them before looking at their
children this is called breadth-first
traversal alternatively you could
explore all the descendants of a node
before moving to another one this is
called depth-first traversal trees are
commonly used in computer science to
represent many things including game
states such as tic-tac-toe where one
move can be to multiple board positions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
