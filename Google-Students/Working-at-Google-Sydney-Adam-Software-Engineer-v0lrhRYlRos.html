software engineer at Google
there was no Sydney engineering office
and while I was trying to organize
interviews to apply for a position at
the headquarters I got this phone call
from a man who I found out later was the
creator of Google Maps and he said why
don't you come in for a chat one of the
amazing things about this is my first
round interview which they just caught a
casual chat was two of the creators of
Google Maps and Rob Pike who wrote the
textbook I used in second year at
university I really like working in the
Google Sydney office because I work with
some of the smartest people in
technology and we all enjoy our jobs and
we're working on things that challenge
us and above all I think we I probably
have the best view in all of the Google
offices my name is Adam shook and I'm a
software engineer at Google Sydney</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
