applied CS with Android a project-based
program by Google designed to improve
your computer science knowledge and your
Android skills in this video you'll
learn insights into what it means to be
a facilitator for the applied CS program
this program is designed for students
who want to learn by doing and are
looking for a project-based learning
environment to improve their coding
skills the program can be used
independently but is most effective when
run by a facilitator with a group of
students in this video we hope to show
you what being a facilitator involves as
a facilitator you are responsible for
organizing the logistics of running the
program and helping students to complete
the units or track you select for them
this will require careful planning and
includes things like arranging a
suitable space and time to meet in
marketing the program to find students
and choosing the program content and
length applied CS units have two parts
the independent groundwork
and the workshop groundwork is completed
by student participants in their own
time and is important review and
preparation for the workshop groundwork
consists of reading watching videos and
occasionally practicing problems
workshops are the in-person sessions
facilitated by you workshops are
interactive and used the concepts
reviewed during the groundwork to build
an Android game in small groups between
both of these parts students will
complete one or more activities and
cover concepts from computer science and
Android development as a facilitator you
will need a good understanding of the
concepts being taught as well as
experience coding in Java so that you
can effectively help your students
during the workshops having planned
marketed and scheduled an applied CS
program facilitators also manage
communications and set expectations with
students arrive early to the workshop
space to make sure everything is ready
introduce the workshop by briefly
explaining the CS concepts covered by
the unit and the Android activity
students will build focus on
facilitation rather than lecturing
ideally workshop time is best spent
coding troubleshooting bugs and working
collaboratively register workshop
attendants make themselves available for
student questions Google provides
facilitators with lots of guidance and
resources to support their journey from
suggested program formats to detailed
guides and concept videos for each unit
these resources have been built and
refined by the experiences of hundreds
of other facilitators and programs that
have been run across the world we hope
this video has given you insight into
what it means to be a facilitator for
applied CS with Android if you're

successful program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
