here at Google and hi I'm Jesse I'm on
the university programs team here at
Google when we come to campus we get a
lot of common questions so we created
this FAQ to make things easier for you
we expect that your resume will be in
the best day possible you should be sure
to eliminate typos follow grammar rules
and fix formatting issues we also get
asked how do I make my resume stand out
but the truth is we simply want to be
able to clearly see the work you've done
head over to our resume prep video with
the link below to get all of the info
simply put a candidate applies on our
site and then sends in their resume and
transcript good news there's no need for
a cover letter if you move forward you
may go through a phone and on-site
interviews for an in-depth look at our
application and interview processes
check out our career fair video link
below
different for everyone but there are
some specific links below to see real
Googlers talk about their work all of
our benefits and perks are about
building a healthy and happy workplace
where Googlers can be productive it's
not just free food and lava lamps
although those are nice see more about
how we care for Googlers at the link
below
set up an alert at google.com slash
students our application dates go in
cycles based on region's business needs
and other factors summer internships
generally open in early fall but it's
best to set up alerts deadlines also
follow psychos so pay close attention so
many we can't help but recommend our
career site for more info our virtual
career fair video linked below is also
an excellent resource yes for students
the only way to get a job at Google is
apply online via Google comm slash
students if you're interested in
full-time or internship roles yes but if
you're applying for a technical role we
recommend that you gain at least six to
12 months worth of added technical
experience and knowledge before
reapplying and for a business role we
say one to two years one specialized
program we have is the information
technology residency program but many of
our other roles are open to any major so
check the qualifications in the job
posting and don't be afraid to apply
many of our roles do not require a
computer science degree even our
software engineering role we want to see
that you have the skills needed no
matter your degree our career for video
goes over some of the jobs we have
available on our resume video walks you
through how to show off your skills
internships are important they provide
invaluable experience and show that
you've been in a professional
environment that said we really just
want to make sure you're spending your
time honing your computer science skills
whether that be spending the summer
working on a personal project taking
extra courses or volunteering for a
coding camp just make sure the results
and impact come through in your resume
there isn't any one project that gets
you in but protip look at the minimum
qualifications in the job description
and highlight projects that speak to
those independent projects and group
projects are valuable as well as open
source and class projects just remember
to show your impact on your resume you
can use this type of a formula
accomplished X as measured by Y by doing
Z
