ahead and get started um thank you
everybody for joining
um today we're going to focus on the
North America technical intern program
my name is Jacqueline and I actually
managed the intern program here in
Mountain View I'm joined by several of
our current interns a former intern
who's actually now Googler and an intern
host um so let's take a few minutes
first and just let them introduce
themselves if you guys could tell us
your name what you're doing at Google
what officer in what school to you go to
if you're actually still at school and
then anything else you want to share um
Arian let's get started with you um my
name is Arian this is my second term
working at Google and I'm on the among
the Ad Exchange team and what I do is I
work on the backend testbed
infrastructure and I'm actually an
intern from Canada and I went to the go
to the University of Waterloo great um
Tim my name is Tim Blakely I'm a fifth
year PhD student over at the University
of Washington and I'm up here in the
Seattle Fremont office and I'm working
on the big science team here at Google
under the cloud whoa
Joanna my name is Joanna Smith and I was
an intern last year but now I'm back
full-time doing what's called developer
relations for Google Plus so I'm helping
design api's that are publicly available
I work in the Mountain View office so
that big one and up until last May I was
a student at the University of Texas and
Latvia octuple hi my name is Abdullah
Dale and I'm actually a software
engineer I've been at Google for several
years I'm in the Kirkland office which
is pretty close to the Seattle Fremont
office and I work on a project which
provides notifications to a number of
Google applications like Chrome G Drive
Google Music and Google+ great and one
of the things just to know is that tool
is actually an intern host and has
hosted lots of interns in the past so
he's just here to provide some of his
knowledge as an intern
and so just a couple things to touch on
really quickly and as I said we're
focusing on the North America technical
intern program we do have other
internship opportunities available
outside in North America and other
countries and you can find out more
about those opportunities by going to
google.com slash students and just to
give you a little bit of background
these technical internship opportunities
are full-time internships that are
available year-round we're flexible with
the start and end dates however we
should expect you to commit to about 12
to 14 weeks while you're here and we're
currently hiring for our summer
internships so if you're interested in
joining us we're accepting applications
now and there's no deadline although we
do encourage you definitely to apply it
early um so let's just get started
um maybe Arian or Tim can you talk about
sort of what made you want to apply to
Google why you wanted to come here and
do do an internship sure um I was
I'm always I've always been interested
in science I've loved science classes
I've loved math classes and I ended up
getting my masters and I'm in a ph.d
program now in the bio engineering
program but over the whole you know that
uh many many years that I was in school
here I've always been the resident
computer guy in the lab whenever
somebody had a problem whenever somebody
you know needed something designed or
made in a computer and get this piece of
software to work with this piece of
equipment that's where I came in and I
was always the one that solved those
kinds of problems so it actually made
kind of sense that I gradually ended up
at Google and figured out that there was
this technical internship program and
applied and I've been loving it ever
since
great um and maybe Erin could you tell
us maybe like a little bit about the
interview process that you went through
and that what that was like sure um
basically you just apply and then I went
through two two phone interviews they
were both technical 45-minute interviews
God has asked a bunch of technical
interviews and then I was told that um I
passed on to the next round and the next
round was like a hosts matching phase
where you go into some-some list and the
host can pick you out based on your
skills and
I guess how you did on the interviews
and stuff so once you get through the
hosts matching phase there's like
there's the 30 minute host interview
which is generally from my experience it
wasn't technical and it just sort of
asks you about who you are maybe the
host gets to know you and then then you
get the job offer cool sounds pretty
straightforward for your experience um a
tool as a host could you maybe talk
about the types of projects that you've
seen interns work on in the past and as
a host or what do you actually expect
your intern to do while they're here
with you so we've had several interns in
our team of both all all levels which is
bachelor's master's and PhD interns and
basically our model is that when our
intern comes in we typically have at
least two or three projects we sort of
you have in mind for a particular intern
and they can choose one and depending on
the like life cycle of the project they
basically get a an opportunity to work
either on some very basic part initially
or some very important feature later on
so such an infrastructure project the
things that we tend to focus on are
basically scale availability and
reliability so when one of our initial
interns came a couple of years ago he
really focused on getting us of get
reliability and later on as other
interns have come in they have helped us
with things like adding new features
like providing payloads providing doing
some measurements which helped us now
dive into why our system is slow so for
example one of the chrome sink team came
to us and said hey we would like us we
would like our system response geography
to provide data all the way to the
clients so that was actually one of the
things on the on the interns worked on
and so so fundamentally we try to have
very meaty projects that are available
to them
but that those that can be done in 12
weeks that's sort of the basic model
that at least our team
to go floor and I've talked a bunch of
other teams they tend to do a similar
thing as well yeah I think that's pretty
standard across the board for here um
and Tim I know you've had a pretty meaty
project as well um could you talk a
little bit about what you're working on
yeah actually uh so I am the lead
software developer on this project
called Big Brain which is an open-source
project that is a collaborative effort
with the Allen Brain Institute across
the street here in Seattle and what they
want to do is they've got this problem
where they want to simulate neurons on
computers and basically figure out how
you would wire up networks of neurons
and get them to do large-scale
computation just like in a biological
system like humans like mice like things
like that
now they had this dilemma before they
had they have funding but they need to
buy or they need to consider buying a
supercomputer but with the Google right
across the street and Google have access
to tons and tons and tons of
infrastructure and computing power the
idea was well maybe we could explore
with Google and see whether we can do
these kinds of simulations that used to
use or require a supercomputer at Google
and as it turns out we've figured out
ways to run these kinds of simulations
in the cloud and that's resulted in my
project that's a big brain that's
actually going to be released open
source by the end of the year hopefully
that's really exciting
um Arian it could you need to give us a
glimpse of like what your day looks like
so you you come into the office and what
you to do um I mean the very first thing
I always do is check my emails because I
I know for a lot of us as well we work
for people that are not necessarily like
I'm in New York so I work with people
that are often in Mountain View and a
lot of the times they'll have code
review stuff for me or things that
they've worked on things that I need to
check out that happened while I was
while I was home and not at work so you
know check the emails then I uh you know
have some breakfast you know but and
then and then I just you know get to
work oftentimes I'm I'm right next to my
manager and her manager so if I ever
have any questions I talk to them a lot
of it is collaborative so like my
project is
somewhat is somewhat open so a lot of it
has to do with me talking to developers
and asking them what features they would
like to see what they would like what
they want out of me basically and I go
ahead and implement those features into
what I'm working on but you know I I do
like to also relax here we have
ping-pong table pool table at lunch time
I go out play some ping pong converse
with some of the other employees so
overall it's it's a really really cheap
work environment you know work hard play
hard so chill work environment um great
so Joanna maybe we can talk to you a
little bit um so you were an intern here
last year and now you're here full-time
as a Googler um you talked a little bit
about your experiences as an intern and
how those might have helped you prepare
to be a full-time engineer now yeah um
so I think that the the biggest help
comes from the fact that if you're
starting as a full-timer not as an
intern as a full-timer they say it takes
about three to six months to really get
the hang of what's going on here but in
the internship program that onboarding
experience is like so much more
streamlined that having been through
that and then coming in as a full-timer
I was already miles ahead of the other
people that I was starting with um and I
already I knew how you know the code
review process worked and I knew how
development at Google worked and I knew
where everything was like where to go
for help and when I was confused like
where the resources were and that
actually helped me so much get started
here because I was able to become a
productive full time are much quicker
than I would have otherwise and the
other thing that really helped I think
was the confidence level right like it's
really intimidating to be a new
full-time er and having already been
here once like I've been being invited
back it's like hey we actually really
did like you we didn't make a mistake in
hiring you and so that whole like
imposter syndrome thing was a lot like
lower down and then the other thing that
was really cool is that some of the
things that I got to work on as an
intern are now like after a year after
two years have become full-fledged
products here and some people mention a
product oh I worked on that like I
actually can answer some of your
questions about that even though I'm
new here so that was all really cool
that's really cool to have that double
side yeah um so Tim you said you're a
PhD student um and you're an intern here
as well would you be able to talk about
sort of how you were able to blend your
PhD research and if you were able to
incorporate it into your experience or
project at all sure um again I'm kind of
a boarder case I got my masters in
computer science but I'm actually in the
bioengineering program over here at UW
doing brain computer interface research
so while it's computer-based it's not
exactly kind of like the project that
I'm doing here but my neuroscience
background allows me to kind of be a
liaison between the engineers at Google
and speak to engineering and talk
talking computers and stuff like that
then being able to go over to the Allen
Brain Institute and then understand what
they want from a scientific and
neuroscience perspective and translate
between the two to say this is what we
have the capability of doing to Google
and then going over to the ABI and
saying this is exactly what we want to
do scientifically so it's definitely
useful to be able to apply these kinds
of things that you learn in your PhD um
and well maybe um would you be able to
talk about some of the challenges that
you see interns face frequently and talk
about any kind of advice that you
usually give to your interns yes um so
the the biggest thing I sort of observe
and most of our interns have come in you
know they're they're very bright they
know a lot when they come in and
suddenly when they land at Google they
start thinking oh there's so much to
learn about and they kind of feel a
little overwhelmed and the truth of the
matter is that there is a lot to learn
and there isn't right there's a lot of
candy at ghouls so there's a lot of
infrastructure then subject is
absolutely wonderful and so you start
having especially if you are an
infrastructure intern you want to know
about everything right so my first
advice there is a try to focus on the
tools and the pieces of infrastructure
that you actually need immediately and
focus on those otherwise your your time
will get spread out too thin
so the first thing to do is just figure
out what you want to do and work with
your host they love one or two projects
but spend the first week or two just
getting familiar with basic tools and
then and I know I suffer from this
rather I want to learn about all the
candy make it a slower process for the
next 12 weeks that you're there so
that's one thing the second thing is
people try to figure out everything on
their own
but they don't end up realizing is that
engineers around in Google in general
are extremely helpful and willing to
answer any kind of question if there is
no silly question you can send mail on
mailing lists and you'll never get an
answer which says oh that was a silly
question did you not see this post or
did you not see this document people are
extremely helpful
it's see a little difficult to believe
you have to experience it and then you
say okay I can ask anything so that's
actually the right so that's a key is a
couple of things that I would throw us
because you will even even in your team
so even though Google is big teams are
typically very small three four seven
people you quickly find you know you are
in a group with a very small set of
people and every team has its own
culture for example in our case a couple
of interns came in and they were working
on something very cheap and they
actually you did quite bear coding with
them by that's also part of some teams
or to some teams no one but our team has
that model so you sit down and work with
them they learn from you quick very
quickly and actually you will learn from
an insurance about new tools that you
weren't aware about so those are some of
the piece of advice I'll give but the
final one I would say is have fun if
you're not having fun that's actually a
big problem everything else can get gets
solved but not having fun is like by bad
so talk to your intern talk to your
intern host if you're not having fun I
mean that's great
and I thought area to tip you guys both
nodding your heads a lot yeah I mean
I'll say in the very beginning people
kept saying ask questions ask questions
bother us bother us bother us but in the
very beginning oftentimes like my first
internship my first time around I always
felt like sometimes maybe I was
bothering someone if I ask too many
questions and
sometimes I didn't ask enough questions
but then once I got into the hang of it
I realize like you know there's somebody
at Google that has very likely solved
the problem I'm trying to solve right
now and they have they know exactly what
to tell me and rather than wasting time
you know I've learned that you ask them
and they'll even if it's someone really
high up
that's like several levels above you
will will enter your email or if they're
in the same office if you'd like come by
your desk and just take oftentimes like
an hour just to help you out and figure
out whatever is you need figuring out so
that was that was a kind of a wake-up
call like here it's like yeah people
will help you no matter how many
questions you ask I mean I definitely
agree with that and for me I still I
still didn't believe it even being here
full-time being four months here I was
like I'm still bothering everybody and
what finally convinced me was one time I
went up to somebody walked up to the
desk to ask a question and they were
just like I'm busy come back in 10
minutes and that showed me that they're
always willing to help and at the one
moment when you actually are bothering
them they'll just be straight with you
and say like come back in next time and
so that's what convinced me and in terms
of learning all these crazy technologies
that Google has like you can learn about
it on online with all the classes that
Google provides but a lot of the times
the guy that or the guy or girl that
wrote the code that wrote that feature
is sitting six chairs down and it's
absolutely great to be able to go down
there and talk to them because everybody
at Google loves what they do they love
talking about their project they're
happy to have you use it they're happy
to explain to you the finer details
things and anything that might not be
quite clear you might not understand on
your own you can just go right down and
ask em so it's great great um so besides
just coding and working on your project
obviously um Joanna what do goggle
engineers do besides just Matt um okay
so what's really cool about being an
intern here is that from day one you're
treated like a full-time employee and
what's cool about Google is that it's a
company of openness right like every
single thing is available to you so you
can start searching the codebase I'm
just looking at how you know search or
Android or infrastructure works from
like your first day if you want
then um so what's really close they have
20% time which is pretty well learn
about Google and so you are into are
working on one project but your
relationships with another one you can
start looking at it and start getting
involved in kind of your manager proves
that you can do 20% time and a really
good way to learn about that is they
have Tech Talks
every single day there's somebody giving
a talk on something you can add it
calendar to your own personal calendar
and see which talks their wins you can
show up and there are also things like
you're in demos everybody core you can
go see what people are working on in
their 20% slot and then drink some beer
if you're over 21 and you can get
involved and you can start joining their
project and maybe every Thursday you go
work on that instead of on your own
intern project
another cool really cool thing is that
if you if you always wanted to learn
another language or if you always wanted
to learn more about web development or
some some small thing Google has an
entire library of code labs that they
use to teach each other and you're
allowed to just work your way through
all of them like you can just you know
show up and like work on some of that
and do your own project and then you
know if you need to learn I didn't know
what how CSS works but I was doing a
front-end intern project last year and
so I was just working through those code
labs learning about web development
which was really cool because there's
just like more resources so there's a
lot of different things that you can do
outside of your own project that still
get you really involved with Google well
um so any question sort of is just
around the Google codebase and what
makes it so cool so special can anybody
kind of do that sure the Google code
base from what I've seen is kind of cool
because all the code across all the
teams in Google is in there so if you
want to figure out how some of the how
some say search works you can go and see
some of the techniques that people have
used to solve search if you want to see
the front ends or if ads or how ads work
how the clouds work it it's all in there
and in order to commit something in
there you actually need to go through
the process of code reviews which is
one of your peers review your code and
actually get it accepted it thanks Jim
um so I know back area kind of said this
very briefly but you know I Google will
say oftentimes that we work hard play
hard and so really quickly can you just
give us a quick quick story about your
favorite social event that you've done
while you're here at Google uh so for me
um I in the NYC office at New York you
know one of the things New York is
famous for is Broadway shows and as in
you know the intern recruiters and hosts
they do a really good job of like making
feel like you're part of a community so
for me my favorite one was we went to
the Lion King Broadway show and that was
really awesome because the Lion King is
probably one of my favorite all-time
movies ever
and seeing the Broadway was really great
um move into a bunch of other we've been
to other Broadway shows we've done tours
of the NBC Studios we've done we've had
ping-pong tournaments in the office
I think Joanna talked about this it was
the beer and the beer and demos we've
had which was great I've practised I've
done a beer and demos myself I've you
dream demos so there's plenty of
opportunity to do tons of social things
my favorite social event from interning
was actually the end of the summer
intern boat cruise where all of the
interns get to go on this like cruise
around the peninsula that is let's go
and a really big party on this giant
bill that's like four decks is like a
casino floor and a dance floor and a
karaoke floor and it was just so much
fun and it was a great way to just see
how like inclusive of the intern program
is here because you see all these people
you don't normally see and I was just
really really cool one of your favorite
does attendance
actually I was going to mention the boat
think is it's not just a San Francisco
thing because we actually have this
cruise around the the Puget Sound up
here and the surroundings of the Seattle
area just absolutely beautiful and even
though we're not the main campus of
Google the campus of Google and the
buildings are still very googly and we
all hang out together and do things like
the boat cruise and it was a lot of fun
it sounded like just one of the same
kind of things that they did down in
Mountain View so it's kind of cool too
for me just now to realize that even
Googlers way out here in Seattle are
just as googly as the people that meant
there was a boat cruise in New York as
well so I think that focuses our employ
oh hey Jackie yeah I wanted to say
something about their Co process at
Google that I just what I want to say it
was fun doing the things that is really
cool to me is how we have style guides
so all of the code no matter who writes
it looks exactly the same which was
really easy to read when you're trying
to read a new part of the codebase that
doesn't necessarily belong to your team
or to you and part of that process is
also making consistent testing and I
know that at the university I wasn't
really given much education on how to
write effective test cases because it's
just something that's hard to teach and
having been exposed for that twice at
Google that's part of what inspired like
my honors thesis so it was just it was
really cool to see a completely
different way of going about a large Co
structure that's outside of what you can
learn in a university settings no that's
really great being hearing that um I
want to make sure we get to obvious one
or two questions from the moderator page
that we set up where our audience asked
us questions um so let me take one here
from Julian who's asking what was your
work experience before getting an
internship I don't know if anybody can
talk about that uh sure I could talk
about that mine I had I work here I go
to Waterloo so there's a lot of like
internships it's an it's a co-op program
so I worked at four other companies
before I started at Google I did
everything from large you know finance
based companies to small basement
startups so I had quite a bit of work
experience when I before I started at
Google but but I have also heard a bunch
of other people that I had no work
experience also working through those so
yeah so what I did is I had a software
engineering internship last summer but
the summer before that I did something
called the engineering practicum which
kind of um helps ease you into the whole
internship process because it's targeted
at younger students who do
have less experience I was a saw I just
finished my sophomore year when I did
that but it was really great because you
got a full intern project and you had
all of the same responsibilities and
treatment as an intern but you got a
little bit of extra help like you had to
host instead of one so you got a little
bit of extra mentoring but even if
you've never had an internship before
like there are really good ways to get
noticed by Google you can really pad
your resume out by doing projects on
your own and a good place to get started
for that or like the google Summer of
Code I know a lot of people who have
done that and then came from that into
an internship yeah okay let's take
another question from our moderator page
han says this kind of goes along with
something we talked about earlier but
what's one of the coolest things that
you've experienced as a Google intern so
whether that's you know something that
you've gone to like a Tech Talk or
whatnot can anybody talk about your
coolest experience um well I had one
that in at university we end up using
some of these numerical packages quite a
bit and so they're written in Python and
we've used them I've used them probably
for four or five years now day in and
day out and I went to lunch with a guy
Google the other day and we started
talking and he asked me about my project
I told him about it and I asked him what
he did he's like oh yeah I work on this
this that in Google oh and by the way I
wrote numpy which is the numerical
package that I've been using on a daily
basis for the last four years and I'm
sitting at lunch with the guy who wrote
it so it was actually kind of like
stunning but kind of cool to be able to
interact with them and talk to them and
just have lunch with them which is a lot
of fun that's really definitely had a
similar experience where last summer I
set directly in front of Vic good entres
office so like he's the social vice
president here at Google so I saw him
like ten times a day as he'd walk by and
he'd be like hey how's it goin and I
feel like I intimidate me so much um
that was actually really cool but I
think just overall the coolest thing
about me and intern was the fact that I
was treated like an adult before
even felt like one because they don't
treat you any differently than a
full-time engineer when you're interning
here and a lot of responsibilities but
it's also really cool to be that trusted
as a student yeah I really liked giving
a Tech Talk like what am I my first
internship like when I finished I gave a
tech talk on the product I worked on and
I saw a bunch of people start using it
so that was really cool because you know
I'm here like barely like not even
graduated University giving a tech talk
to all these like full-time Googlers who
are like really smart so that was pretty
cool that's awesome
um so we'll wrap things up but I was
wearing if you guys have any final
thoughts or words of advice um a tool as
you know the host all the all-knowing
host you have any words of wisdom to
incoming interns and those that want an
internship at Google so yes I have one
or two things to say so I would say that
if you're interested in a technical
internship at Google one of the things
that I would recommend is pick an area
you like right any area Google is so
fast it has infrastructure it has mobile
clients it has browsers it has
client-side pick any area you like and
of course my bias is distributed systems
but you could you could pick any area
and try to go in-depth in that area so
for example if you learn like writing
cool android games for example so go and
learn that but try to learn more about
the Android system per se as well right
and because at the end of the day your
depth will end up mattering whether at
Google or anywhere else so that's one of
the things I would highly recommend and
see if you can get fair amount of coding
practice with it I build something
because building whether you build in
JavaScript Android build something with
Chrome extensions whatever you do that's
the kind of experience that will help
you not only with your internship put
your career in general that would be my
one piece or twice or four for students
or 13 for internship that's great thank
you
um Joanne I do you have any words of
advice yeah so I had the unique
experience of being real
young when I got my first internship so
I didn't have as much experience just in
computer science I didn't I hadn't taken
that many classes yet um but I knew how
to code and that's like the first step
just being able to do the basics and
being willing to learn but I think that
what can really make you stand out
throughout the hiring process is if you
are involved and passionate about
computer science and about other things
as well right so I really encourage you
to take a chance to you know join
another Club if you're really interested
in languages and you happen to be a CS
major then maybe working on something
like Google Translate is a good place
for you or you know linguistic analysis
for the Google Book Search you know just
things like that if you if you can just
demonstrate that you're an interesting
person who loves to learn and loves to
be involved with different projects then
that'll really help you as you try to
find a host and try to get through the
interviews it makes you more personable
and approachable an arien what about you
any last thoughts um I'd say everything
like Jonah's I was definitely definitely
correct everything the tools I was
correct I think brush up if you want to
get an internship at Google you like
definitely work on on coding work on
you'll read a lot of books don't don't
just assume you can get the job if you
have high grades for example because
it's more than just high grades it's
about a like a part of its work
experience but you know killing the
interview and kill any any of you
killing a Google interview is not always
the easiest thing so definitely practice
practice practice practice and don't
take anything for granted
like that's what I'll do on that note
the best thing to review is probably
your data structures and algorithms
course those are the fundamentals of all
programming also a lot of people don't
don't do this but coding on paper is a
lot different than having a computer to
code in front of so oftentimes take if
you practice from a book don't go write
it on the computer because when it comes
down to writing on a paper you might you
might choke I know I experienced that
the first time I did technical
interviews like way back when I was like
four or five years ago but but coding on
paper is a lot harder so that's actually
a big suggestion for me try actually
coding on paper as opposed to on the
computer and Tim what about you any last
thoughts or words in Vice
I would just say
that interns are not just temporary or
not temporary workers at Google they are
Googlers like by the end of your
internship you'd be hard-pressed to find
any intern that hasn't committed code
into the Google codebase
so it hasn't actually made a tangible
contribution to Google by the end of
their internship so you're not just
somebody who comes in learns a little
bit than leaves you literally change
Google and contribute to Google in terms
of its direction and its future's that's
awesome it's really great and it sounds
like that's something experience that
everybody's kind of had here so so thank
you thank you for joining us and thank
you for the audience for tuning in and
watching and we hope this kind of gave
you an inside look at to what you know
being an actual Google intern is like
and if you're interested in joining us
we're accepting applications for our
summer internships so apply online at
google.com slash students and thank you
again and we'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
