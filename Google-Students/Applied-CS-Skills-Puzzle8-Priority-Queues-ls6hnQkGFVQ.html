situations in life and in applications
when we want to choose the next item
from acute people tasks or objects based
on their importance or priority rather
than order for example doctors in a
hospital emergency room want to see the
most critical patient first not
necessarily the patient who arrived
first priority is usually indicated by a
particular value associated with the job
when a collection of objects are
organized by priority this is known as a
priority queue you wouldn't want to use
a normal queue data structure to
implement this as Hugh's only ah the
next element to be taken out you could
use a list but adding removing and
searching through the list isn't very
efficient you could also use a tree that
organizes records by priority but the
tree could become unbalanced which would
again be inefficient to avoid these
problems we could require the tree to
always be complete and ordered so that
the children either always have a lower
value than their parents this is called
a min heap or a greater one this is
called a max heap this means that you
can always quickly access the smallest
value or largest in the case of a maxi
because it will always be at the top of
the tree so in the case of the emergency
room you could use a priority queue
based on a heap to store the patient
with the highest priority at the top in
Java this is implemented using the
priority queue class
