starting your career at Google as
opposed to other organizations is that
you do get a huge level of
responsibility early on in your career
and we really look for people who relish
that kind of opportunity and have lots
and lots of different ideas about what
they can do with that level of
responsibility one of the things to be
aware of is that graduates when they
join us tend to have an impact on the
business very very quickly
there was a graduate who started with us
about six months ago who joined our
mobile team when it was still in his
early days he was a computer science
graduate and was in fact the first
graduates join the the wireless
engineering team in London within the
first three months he was working on the
launch of Google Maps for Mobile which
has been which subsequently became one
of the most downloaded pieces of
software on mobile applications around
the world and he was one of a team of
five or six people who developed and
then launched that product so within a
very very short space of time so within
six months in the business he'd worked
directly on a piece of software that was
used by millions around the world nick
