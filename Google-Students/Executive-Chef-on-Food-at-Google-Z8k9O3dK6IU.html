would be something that they haven't had
since their childhood something that
their mother or grandmother used to make
and to see the look on their faces when
you reproduce it is amazing you're given
a lot of freedom to be creative to try
new things the most exotic dish I've
ever made here was a alligator jalapeno
cheese cake which was received very well
we made 25 or 30 of them them and people
ate every last little scrap of them the
best feedback that we get from the
Googlers is the fact that they'll go out
to a restaurant in San Francisco a very
high price restaurant and come back on
Monday and say the food we had over the
weekend met this restaurant was
absolutely no better than what you guys
produce you're on a daily basis you're
thrown an obstacle every day that is a
new challenge and makes your life
exciting and we can think about new
foods and new ways to make people
excited and happy about coming to work
every day my name is Nate Keller I am
executive chef</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
