and gentlemen and the very warm welcome
to nus school computing i'm gary and
i'll be sharing this afternoon's session
as part of our schools 10th anniversary
celebration together with google we are
proud to bring to you our special
speaker dr. vinton grace earth vice
president and chief evangelist of google
butters earth holds a BS from stanford
and a PhD from UCLA and in the 70s as
you know co.design the tcp/ip protocols
with robert elliott can incidentally ass
piece of trivia that was roughly the
same time when our school was starting
out as a fledgling department in the
bukit timah campus some 33 years ago for
his work on the internet he has won
numerous awards including the ACM turing
award and the US Presidential Medal of
Freedom the highest civilian decoration
bestowed but pastor the United States
now trying to tell you more about our
speaker will be a disservice to you as
I'm sure you're dying to hear from him
besides our speaker really needs no
introduction so without further delay I
can call upon dr. Vinton Cerf father the
Internet to share with us the tracking
of the internet into the 21st century
dr. surface
thank you thank you very much I
appreciate everyone taking an afternoon
off so we can have a chat on friday
afternoon at least it gives you an
excuse to escape from classes for a few
minutes anyway it's a real joy to be
back on a university campus it's
something I enjoy the most because it's
a chance to interact with people who are
thinking about hard problems and looking
for solutions to them and I'm going to
bring up some hard problems in the
course of this discussion and I hope I'm
going to trigger some PhD level research
as a consequence of the chap that we
have today so let me start out by simply
giving you a bit of statistical
information about the current state of
the Internet I've been giving these
talks for quite a while and in the
recent past let's say in the last couple
of years it's been apparent that Asia is
now the dominant user population on the
internet it's not a big surprise China
in India or part of Asia and they
certainly have very big populations they
are increasingly part of the internet
environment and you'll notice that the
percentage penetration on the average is
still fairly modest it's the average
around the world is twenty percent
penetrated the average in Asia is a
little bit below that but just imagine
as the penetration of Internet in Asia
reaches the same levels as it is in
other parts of the world forty fifty
sixty seventy percent there's no
question that our Asian colleagues will
be the dominant participants in the
internet they will be the dominant
source of content they were their
languages your cultures your styles of
interaction will be in fact the most
significant part of the internet no the
next largest component on the Internet
is Europe 300 almost 350 million users
I've given up trying to make any guesses
about Europe because they keep adding
countries so the definition of Europe
you know I I don't know anymore what's
going to be Europe in 10 years time
North America the US and Canada are now
number three on the list whereas once
upon a time they were the largest single
segment on the network in the rest are
as you seen them probably the biggest
challenge in the internet universe is
getting Africa up in online every
country in Africa has some internet
capability but as you look across the
continent there are a billion people and
only about 40 million of them are online
the telecom infrastructure in Africa in
African countries varies pretty
dramatically on the average still
immature and the economies of Africa
vary widely and so the affordability of
Internet service also varies
substantially so this is still an area
of real challenge I'm going to show you
some projections of global population
and regional population the projections
come from this UN report I'm sure you
don't need to write all this stuff down
I'll be sure that these slides are
available and i'll ask the university to
make sure that they are known to the
students and staff to get access to this
so this is where my data is coming from
if you have disagreement with the
methodology for making the projections
that you need to complain to the united
nations and not to me the projections go
from 1950 historical looking back
historically to 2300 so it's a pretty
dramatic estimate this is an eye chart
for people in the back of the room but
what you can see is that the estimates
of global population high medium and low
estimates are between 10.6 at the high
end 7.4 at the low end with a kind of a
scary image showing that it might drop
off an 8.9 which is a slow increase up
to the Year 2300 I've chosen for
calculations of the Year 2035 to stick
with the kind of middle chart just just
for simplicity this picture is rather
interesting the the parts at the bottom
here represent the population of the
what is currently called the developed
world you'd be included in that and it's
roughly oscillating around the 1.2
billion range the other populations very
pretty dramatically up to the year 2050
you see a massive increase in the number
of people living in what are currently
called less developed countries since
that will include some parts of Asia and
Africa and the like once the year 2050
arrives the seven point seven billion
people living in that in those regions
varies not very much but in fact you
even see it kind of dropping off now
this is on a global scale let's look and
see what the regional picture was like
here's the European picture and you see
a very dramatic change in the
populations from 1952 2000 the
population goes all the way up to nearly
800 million and then by 2050 there's a
massive drop and the the most
significant drop is in the lower bar
here which represents Eastern Europe
some of you will know that Eastern
Europe is already experiencing declining
population their their fertility rate is
below replacement rate which is pretty
amazing that has all kinds of economic
impact on the countries in Eastern
Europe because if they are declining
populations they have a declining
workforce which means that their
economies are going to be under stress
unless they bring in working populations
from other parts of the world now why am
i showing you all this stuff when we're
supposed to be talking about the
Internet and the reason I wanted to show
this is that if you're trying to make
projections about what the internet is
going to be like in 20 or 30 years time
you have to know something about who's
using it because it's the people who use
it who will produce the information in
the people who use it will determine
what applications and services are of
interest to them and the people who are
using it may also be the inventors of
new applications on the service so
understanding which populations are part
of the internet is important if you're
trying to make any projections into the
future if we look at Asia we can see
again a very rapid growth between 2000
and 2050 and some decline showing up
which around by around 2150 stabilizes
and then begins to grow a little bit
more once again the interesting major
variation in population comes here in
this segment and that's China and so
we're seeing eventually seeing the
effects of the Chinese population of the
Chinese attempt to manage population
growth what's not being is heavily
managed India and the Indian population
in fact goes up quite rapidly up until
21 up until 2050 and then you see some
significant declines between twenty 120
150 for a variety of different reasons
now the reason that these variations
occur the reason that you're not just
seeing continued increased growth is an
interesting interplay between fertility
and longevity you know how long do
people live what's the mortality rate
and what is the birth rate and those
three things interact with each other in
fairly complex ways which is why you see
charts like this that are not
necessarily smooth so let's imagine that
it's year 2035 and we ask ourselves
what's the world like well one possible
one almost certain issue is that the
global warming effect will have been on
going all the way and fill that time for
another 27 years and of course
continuing oil will become less and less
available fresh water will become less
and less of a
perhaps more critically the location of
populations around the world will have
to change in some dramatic ways because
much of the world's population lies
along the coastlines where the oceans
are and if you listen to or watch any of
the Al Gore projections you know that a
rising sea level will cause populations
at the along the c line or the coastal
areas they have to move in them because
of the rising sea levels rising seed oil
have a rising sea levels have other
serious implications for example if
you're if you have sanitation plants and
the like that are trying to clean up the
water maybe even recycle the water they
can be overwhelmed by a rising sea level
the available freshwater aquifers can be
overwhelmed and in fact polluted by salt
entering into the freshwater systems
that can have a big impact on fresh
water for drinking for cooking and for
growing food and so there could be many
very very significant side effects of
this global warming and rising sea level
the other thing which is obviously going
to happen and it's already happening is
that fresh water will be less and less
available if you're dependent on for
example the snowpack and them all is and
the glaciers melt then the freshwater is
not going to become available through
snow mail through the snow melting and
as a result in have the large
populations which don't have enough
freshwater Barcelona is a city in Spain
that's already has this problem it is
now importing tankers full of fresh
water for the people living in Barcelona
and in some of the central parts of
Spain they're seeing desertification
more deserts being formed the Gobi
Desert is moving at the rate of a couple
of miles a year another major issue
desalinization may be a source of water
so we can imagine in 2035 there are
major desalinization plants taking water
out of the oceans and getting rid of the
salt I had a unique experience about
three weeks ago I was in Tokyo along
with my colleague Bob
as a recipient of the Japan prize and
one of the features of the Japan prize
ceremonies is that you get to have
dinner with the Emperor and the Empress
of Japan and what I didn't know until I
got there is that the Emperor is in fact
a scientist he's a taxonomist in he
studies particular species of fish in
the general area around Japan and we got
to talking about desalinization and he
mentioned that there is a problem with D
salinization what do you do with all the
salt that you get out of the ocean and
so one answer might be well you pile it
up in a big mountain somewhere another
answer might either you turn it into
building material which is apparently
technically feasible and I said well
what about just dumping it back into the
ocean again and he pointed out that
increasing the salinity of the ocean
might actually have a pretty bad
influence on the species of fish that
could survive in the ocean if it gets
overly salty however there was another
crazy idea which didn't occur to me
until after this conversation those of
you who may know something about the way
the ocean currents work may know that
the reason Europe has moderately let's
say Clement winter weather is that there
is an ocean current which brings warmth
to the Northern Europe if the glaciers
melt in the northern part of the globe
and put a lot of fresh water in that
current goes away and that will
translate into very severe winter months
in europe so one answer to the
desalinization question is dump the salt
in the North Atlantic in order to
preserve the salinity of the ocean and
maintain the currents now whether that's
actually technically feasible I don't
have any idea so but the reason I bring
all this stuff up is it the world that
we are going to live in in 2035 is going
to be dramatically different from the
world we're living in today for a whole
lot of
physical reasons what can we do though
with IT information technology to try to
deal with some of the problems well one
an example is that we can substitute IT
for transportation instead of expending
crucial fossil oil resources we can use
telecommunications systems with
increasing fidelity to have meetings
that we would otherwise have to meet
face-to-face so conceivably I can have
this meeting with you using a virtual
event projected on the wall and Inter
exchanges with each other over the net
and in fact increasingly that's a common
tactic there are technologies that allow
for very very natural interactions a
company called Cisco which I'm sure you
all are familiar with makes a service
they are a system that they call a
telepresence system it's a wall-sized
display like this where the projections
of people are life-size you're sitting
at a table and you look across the table
at this high resolution screen and you
see people the same size that they are
in real life the sound system is
designed to produce sound from the image
that you're seeing so you know when
someone speaks over here you hear them
coming from over there you when you look
at each other eye to eye in the system
it really looks like you're looking eye
to eye as opposed to one where the
camera is you know at an angle and
there's person projected on the wall and
you're never really looking at each
other so it's very very different
experience so I found it quite natural
to to use that system for communication
there for a small meeting of six or
seven people you know the only problem
is that system costs about three hundred
thousand dollars and so that's a little
more than I plan to spend in my basement
on the other hand technologies have a
tendency to get cheaper and cheaper as
we build more and more
them and learn more so my projection is
that by 2035 it will be quite common to
substitute this kind of virtual
interaction with physical presence the
second thing which it strikes me as
possible is to use IT in order to
minimize the use of natural resources
we're already starting to see that
happening companies that do overnight
delivery like FedEx and UPS and so on
are using IT algorithms to change the
the routes of the trucks that are either
picking up or dropping off packages in
real time based on the demands that
people are making in order to minimize
the fuel consumption another thing which
is happening to go back to water
shortages saugus I mentioned that the
water tankers that are coming into
Barcelona or any examples of that energy
production and consumption is a big
issue for IT we experience this at
Google because we build large-scale data
centers and they consume a substantial
amount of power they also give off a lot
of heat and we have to get rid of that
heat as well the one single thing that
would make a big difference to Google in
terms of its ability to do what it does
would be for people to invent computers
that run at very high speed on one at
one-tenth the power that they currently
do so if there are physicists among you
or hardware electronic engineers who are
interested in doing something really
significant go figure out how to build a
computer that doesn't use as much power
as the ones today now there is a
tendency already to limit the amount of
power consumed by computers those of you
who have been following Moore's law will
notice that the normal projection shows
increasing clock speed for the computers
that stopped it Moore's law has now
leveled out in a very interesting way
the clock speed is relatively constant
the thing that's still increasing is the
total amount of computer cycles
available per chip but the way that's
being accomplished is to put multiple
cores on the same chip well this has an
interesting challenge for people who run
algorithms that were relying on having
faster clock speeds to make the serial
algorithm run faster now you can't rely
on clock speed to do that you have to
figure out whether you can change the
algorithm to run in parallel or maybe
create a pipeline for the algorithm so
that all the delay goes up the total
throughput increases because you're
running the stuff through the pipeline
process it's not always necessarily the
case that the algorithms that you were
running in serial we are easily
paralyzed and so this is a challenge for
us and others who are heavily heavily
dependent on large-scale high-speed
computing we have to reinvent the
algorithms to run in pipeline or
parallel mode and finally energy
production is going to be a big issue in
2035 we're going to be running out of
the oil and coal resources or even if we
were not for example we might still have
plenty of coal available but every time
we build another coal-fired power plant
it generates a huge amount of carbon
dioxide and exacerbates the global
warming so we're going to want to do
something else and one possibility is
nuclear there are countries like France
to get almost eighty percent of their
power requirements from nuclear power
but there's things like ethanol wind
solar and geothermal all of those are
going to be more exploited by 2035 so
our world is going to look significantly
different oh thank you is this vodka or
just water
I have often thought that it'd be more
fun to have a lecture where this is
actually vodka and the lecture gets more
and more incoherent that the time goes
on so our world in 2035 is going to look
pretty different from the one we're in
now internet by that time will be 52
years old that's assuming you start
counting from the year that was actually
rolled out it was invented in 1973 but
it actually got rolled out in 1983 in
January for the academic community in
the United States and for some of the
military the world population by that
time will be on the order of eight
billion assuming internet penetration at
seventy percent which is about as high
as it is now in North America and parts
of northern Europe that's about 5.6
billion people online about a hundred
there some of the developed countries
including Singapore will be more than a
hundred percent penetrated my internet
now you might say well that how can that
possibly be and the arithmetic that gets
done is it's like Luxembourg I was
talking to Commissioner Viviane Reding
who handles communications in the
European Commission and she very proudly
said that the penetration of mobiles in
Luxembourg was one hundred and fifty
percent and I said well how can that be
and she said every other Luxembourg ian
has two mobiles so that's why has one
hundred and fifty percent we may very
well have more than one device on the
net per person in the Internet of the
Year 2035 and in fact i'm currently
guessing i emphasize guessing there
could be sixty billion devices on the
internet which means on the average 10
devices on the net per person you might
say well how can that be and the answer
is a lot of those devices will be
sensors some of them will be things like
controlling light switches and other you
know parts of building answering systems
the heating and ventilation and air
conditioning and so on control systems
in the line appliances around the house
appliances in the office appliances in
the car appliances that you carry around
on your body or in your purse so we
could easily
imagine having a very large number of
devices on the net which by the way
motivates the utility of IP version 6
because today's Internet is based on a
protocol that was standardized in 1977
called IP version 4 which only has a
32-bit address space that means 4.3
billion unique terminations and that's
not enough it was enough in 1977 because
I thought it was experiment and so you
know I picked 32 bits after a year of
debate and I picked 32 because nobody
seemed to make up their mind and I said
look it's four years into this
experiment we don't know if it's going
to work 4.3 billion termination points
ought to be enough for this experiment
thing is the experiment never ended and
so here we are in 2008 we need more
address space ipv6 is 128 bits of
address space that's 3.4 times 10 to the
38th by the way it's a joy to be in a
place where i can say that and people
actually understand what it means the
only other place where you can say 3.4
times 10 to the 38 is to talk to a
legislature or Congress that's
accustomed to dealing with money and
they understand big numbers anyway
that's enough address space so that
every electron in the universe can have
its own web page except it's actually I
used to say that and I don't anymore
because they got an email from a guy in
Caltech dear dr. Cerf you jerk there's
10 to the 88 electrons in the universe
and you're off by 50 orders of magnitude
so I don't say that anymore anyway
there's plenty of address space if we
can get ipv6 deployed and by 2035 I am
pretty confident we will be running ipv6
everywhere so the internet looks kind of
like this in 2008 a half a billion
devices on the net servers on the net
2035 10 billion hosts on the net by the
way there isn't any Wikipedia yet for
2035 I'm inventing
one that has these statistics in it 5.7
billion users six billion broadband
connections homes and residences
combined 10 billion mobiles and maybe 12
billion pcs of course by 2035 it could
be that the PC will be replaced by
something else and so this is just a
wild guess the infrastructure of the
internet the information infrastructure
of the internet in 2035 will be both
wired and wireless they'll both be
higher speed will be will be seeing
speeds that exceed a billion bits per
second for most of the broadband wired
users and they could be in the tens to
hundreds to even gigabits per second for
the wired wireless versions as well
there will be lots and lots of
interactions in the net that go from
business to business there'll be
standard transactions to take place
sometimes people refer to that as web
two point oh I think that's the kind of
marketing buzz word but there will be
enough standards so that businesses will
be able to automatically interact with
each other placing orders generating
inventory requests demanding payment
making accounts payable and so on
creating bills of lading for shipment
and the like all automatically because
of the standards that companies will use
to interact with each other I think
cloud computing is going to be very
common today it's a new term but it's
referring to an old concept back in the
1960s people saw computers as very very
big expensive things and so they
imagined that in the long term future
the way people would use computers would
be to have gigantic factories full of
computers that people would access over
the telecom network somehow remotely
well then of course came many computers
and Michael computers and laptops and
desktops and personal digital assistant
assistants and so computing power
migrated out to the edges of the net and
people didn't think about having big
computing utilities anymore until
companies like Google came along and
said the only way we can do what we do
is to build these gigantic computer
centers so suddenly we've come full
circle in 40 years time to having
gigantic computer utilities which in
fact run applications on behalf of
people who are remote there's a lot of
logic to this kind of architecture
because when you think about the
maintenance of software we've learned
that it's not easy to maintain the
software in individual and separate
laptops and desktops if in fact most of
them have standardized browser style
interfaces and they're interacting with
software that's maintained in central
data and central computing centers that
software can actually be maintained more
easily and more reliably and more
uniformly than trying to maintain copies
of software in every single laptop and
desktop so i think cloud computing is
likely to be quite popular in the in the
year 2000 35 and then perhaps even
before the other thing that's important
is that if you need more computing power
than your laptop can supply you even
though laptops of 2035 will be
enormously more powerful than the ones
we have today the cloud computing
arrangement allows you to expand the
computation into a much larger amount of
compute power and then return that
compute power to the pool to be
available for other people to have this
large computation moreover the databases
that you're working with may be so big
they would never make any sense to
transport them back to the laptop it
makes more sense to transport the
computation to the data and allow it to
take place in the cloud and then get the
answers back I'm expecting to see a lot
more collaboration in virtual
environments some of you may be members
of second life and it's a kind of a
crude virtual environment today by the
Year 2035 those environments will
probably be holographic in their
character you'll be able to interact
with people very comfortably you'll be
able to initiate video conferences and
things of that sort sharing information
and databases with each other in a very
natural way and even more interestingly
we can create virtual laboratories
online you walk into a virtual
laboratory
start interacting with a virtual
telescope but in fact that virtual
telescope is simply a stand-in for a
real telescope somewhere else on the
internet and when you ask that telescope
in the virtual space to take an image
the real telescope gets pointed to where
you need to go you get the image and
bring it back so the idea of creating
these virtual laboratories not only has
a possibility for educational
experiences but it also makes it
possible to control multiple instruments
that are attached to the internet so I
expect that to be quite common on also
believing right now the today's naming
in addressing environment will be
dramatically different in 2035 today we
identify host computers and end points
with IP addresses and they are
topologically significant so the IP
address tells you something about where
something is in the net and if you if
you attach to the internet someplace
else you need a new IP address because
it's telling where you are then we have
domain names and in theory the domain
names will work no matter where you are
in the net you just have a different map
from the domain name into the IP address
but what happens with that paradigm is
that the basic identification space is
of a physical device this computer is
hanging off the internet at this IP
address and the domain name is really
just a stand-in for a computer that has
lots of processes running and has lots
of files contained inside of it if we
had unique identifiers for the files and
we had unique identifiers for the
processes that are running in the
machines and those unique identifiers
were independent of which machine the
process for processes or files were on
then we could freely move processes and
objects around in the internet and it
wouldn't matter which machine they were
on they have identities independent of
their location I'm convinced that by
2035 our naming and addressing spaces
will be abstractions of these processes
and objects and that they will be
independent
they physically exist in the net which
means that we'll have communications
going back and forth between the
processes and the digital objects that
are that are in fact mobile and can be
moved from one physical machine to
another which increases their resilience
to various kinds of failure I think by
the time 2035 rolls around there will be
large scale databases some of them
sponsored by state national and maybe
even international organizations I can
give you an example of how powerful it
can be to have aggregated information
available to us at Google we speculated
that it might be possible to detect an
epidemic a health epidemic if we knew
something about the kinds of questions
that people are asking of the Internet
contents the web contents in the United
States there's an organization called
the Center for Disease Control and it is
responsible for detecting and reacting
to things like an epidemic now the way
that tends to work is that doctors will
report to the center for disease control
that a larger number a large number of
patients are coming in with particular
symptoms or have been diagnosed with a
particular disease but it takes the
Center for Disease Control some time
before they actually figure out that
there is an epidemic because they have
to wait till they get reports from the
doctor so we speculated that we might be
able to tell that an epidemic was
underway sooner by looking to see what
kinds of health questions people were
asking on the internet so we tested our
theory we looked at the dates that the
Center for Disease Control in the past
had announced that a certain epidemic
appeared to be under way and then we
started looking at our databases of the
kinds of queries and responses that had
and in the time before that date and
what we discovered is that about 30 days
before the announcement of an epidemic
we could actually see people asking
questions about the symptoms for that
give your epidemic ahead of time and you
almost can see why that would be the
case you get sick and you know you have
some symptom like you're having trouble
breathing or something so if you're on
the internet you go and look to see what
could cause me to have trouble breathing
and you might discover a variety of
different possible causes but then you
sort of hope it will go away okay so you
wait for another week and it doesn't go
away then you go to the doctor and you
say doctor I've had this problem for a
week and the doctor says okay try this
medicine here's your problem but the
doctor only doesn't know that there's an
epidemic all he knows is it a few
patients have shown up but after another
week goes by the doctor says gosh 100
people have come into my office this
week with the same set of symptoms I
better report this to the Center for
Disease Control so you can see how the
reporting process is a lagging indicator
of this potential epidemic whereas the
querying on the internet databases is in
fact a leading indicator so we think
based on the evidence that we have so
far that we should continually monitor
the kinds of health queries that are
going on on the net in order to detect
the possibility of an epidemic somewhere
in the world well by 2035 I'm looking at
this now from the US perspective we have
an aging population we have an
increasing ethnic diversity in the
country more people his panic origin for
example you know we're in we see
ourselves is in competition with India
China Europe and other parts of the
world our GDP will probably be only
fifty percent or less that of india by
I'm sorry of of asia by the year 2035
this is a big change for the united
states because historically it's always
have the largest GDP
of all the countries in the world but by
the time 2035 comes along the gdp s of
the rest of the world especially asia
will have escalated dramatically you
have big populations already and they're
earning capacity will have increased
substantially over the 27 years between
now and then and so the gdp will be our
average gdp in the US will be a lot less
we can't produce scientists and
engineers as quickly as you can in Asia
because you have a larger population
from which to draw scientists and
engineers now I don't know whether these
numbers are exactly right I'm sure
they're not the question is what are the
real numbers and the US has to learn
that it's not going to be that buddy on
the basis of numbers anymore and so we
have to learn how to live in an
environment where we're no longer the
most significant economy in the world on
the other hand people in Asia are going
to have to discover how to manage
themselves because you're you are the
largest economy in the world that's a
change too so all of us are going to
have to will face a different kind of
world the physical infrastructure of
that time frame will be very much
affected by the availability of energy
and water and we've already talked a lot
about that minimization of the use of
water minimization of the use of energy
reutilization of these resources local
production and power local production of
water all very important so we talked
about a lot of these things and i'll
just leave them at that let's turn now
to the social and economic effects of
the internet in the year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
