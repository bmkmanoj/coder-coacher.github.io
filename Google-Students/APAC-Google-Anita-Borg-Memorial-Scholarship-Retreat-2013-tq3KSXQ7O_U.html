Scholarship celebrates the achievement
of the future generation of women in
technology and today we have the
opportunity to bring together the best
and brightest women in technology and
computing across Asia Pacific the people
here and the kind of stuff that they
work on it's amazing we know that
there's a substantial
under-representation of women in
technical fields so we want to do all we
can to try and encourage more women to
pursue technical careers so that we can
close that gap
it's so inspiring I mean seeing so many
young girl in Google's office and
knowing that this is the future of
technology I'm just really really
awestruck team swordfish and team the
Megatron prepare your robots I think to
know that I mean all of us are so
different so that's why it's really it's
really funny everyone's so encouraging
and like clear to get to be clear there
we've got explore you get to be yourself
I believe that there's really no
barriers like
then maybe obstacle there's nothing that
will be important thank you all so much
for having me be part of this you have
worked scholarship program which we have
been deeply invested in for a long time
your blazing the trail for a group of
women who will come in your path behind
you and maybe it will be easier and we
want to help make it easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
