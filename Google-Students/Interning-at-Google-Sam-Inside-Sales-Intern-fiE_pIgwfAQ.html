London and I go to the University of
London Institute in Paris and just
pretty much finished my second year
going into my third year I've been
working at Google over the summer doing
a submarine ship internship program over
12 weeks in the inside sales
organization as a media sales intern
that basically means sort of new
acquisition trying to get new customers
on board through Adwords yeah i mean the
highlight of my internship really has
been sort of twofold i'd say firstly the
work I've been doing and the people the
work has been you know very very
stimulating I haven't to be able to
Steven felt like I've been going to work
every day it's been actually quite fun
and also the fact that we're working on
real projects with real clients going to
meetings with clients that are coming in
it's a lot of stuff over the phone
working on real proposals you know so
you really do feel like you're actually
sort of working on some very interesting
stuff rather than just you know
background things which did I don't
really have any sort of major play if
you like and then the other side of it
is really the people from day one the
team I was in very very friendly people
any kind of questions problems they're
very very nice come over you know help
me out maybe you may make me feel very
welcome and then I'd say that's pretty
much true everyone at Google I haven't
met anyone that I didn't like everyone's
very open very like-minded and very very
friendly and things like the tgif on a
Friday where you know have a few beers
in the canteen you know that sort of
helps to kind of build these kind of
bridges between different departments
and so you know you're not just sort of
stuck to one place which is quite
important when you're working somewhere
like a Dublin where there's about 1600
people so yeah I mean I'd say that's the
the people that have really made it for
me and also the work I've been doing a
thoroughly enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
