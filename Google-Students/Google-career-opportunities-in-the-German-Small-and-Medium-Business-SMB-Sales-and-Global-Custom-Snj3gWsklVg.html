University Relations across the Mia and
I mainly focused on student
opportunities for non-technical
positions so today we didn't give you an
overview but what you can expect in our

and and do that and we're also gonna

tricks so enjoyed by for Thursday's
today and literally to them introduce
themselves and in a few moments but
first of all why don't you explain that
and we're gonna talk to you a lot today
event SMB dock so I wanted to explain
the first of all dock is basically what
we refer to as the german-speaking
market so it's Austria Switzerland I am
in Germany and then SMB all the songs
for small and medium sized businesses so
before we get into a lot of the detail
never pass you over to my colleagues I'm
attention Jews themselves
so um hello everyone I'm Miriam I'm in
the SMB Services team for that um I've
been in the team for almost a year now I
started last year in April it's been
quite a while yeah hello everyone I'm
Timo I'm from Germany I work for the SMB
sales part and I joined Google also last
year and the summer yeah and I'm really
looking forward to the talk today and
telling a little bit of our life and I
will work here and we're looking forward
to also your questions that go on hi
guys my name is Kasia solar fitness
specialist within our staffing
Florentines
I'm based in Brussels in Poland and all
in all I think we from home for the last
two and a half
here's some really happy to communicate
hi my name is Anna and I'm also in
contrast with those in Parliament and
I've worked as Mariam in watching in the
customer experience Senior Service and
services guys so first of all I wanted
to give you an overview about student
opportunities in Google because I get it
asked a lot of questions and then head
students can join the little let me do
campus events so first of all if you're
in your second last year in your studies
so that's what we call it the ultimate
year so if you're graduating in 2016 the
best way to engage with Google
opportunities would be to apply for our
summer intern program this is a 10 to 12
week and program that usually starts
from June to September fantastic program
it has opportunities across a range of
different teams in Google on across a
lot of our media offices when you do
join you got to work on projects are
really impactful to our business you got
to network with a lot of Googlers and
also build a really strong network of
other interns who are spending the
summer and when I differently the
offices so the occupation process for
our intern program is open at the moment
but we'll be closing within the next
couple of weeks so if it's something
that you're interested in we'll talk to
you about more details about at the end
of the high note and cassius also going
to give you an overview about what the
recruiting process would look like for
the intern program but if you are
graduating this year I'm looking for
full-time positions most of our
opportunities for graduates are within
our SMB sales and global customer
experiences teams so I'm going to let
the experts talk to you a little bit
about those positions I need you know
review wanna date a looks like so I'm
gonna start with Tim I'm gonna put you
on the spot yeah if you were to give an
overview of your role what a day today
looks like in two minutes how would you
describe okay well so I work for the SMB
sales section and what we do is we work
with small and medium clients and
German Austrian Swiss market and we can
sort them how to advertise online with
Google so we talk about Google products
like search the Display Network YouTube
develop a strategy for mobile and what
is really nice about it is that we often
talk to the CEO or the CMO or with their
strategic or EFT izing agency and we
become a trusted partner for them so we
also develop their entire marketing
strategy for their online and sometimes
also their offline activities with them
together so basically this is our day to
day and it's really nice to see a direct
impact and what we do with them on a
daily basis yes so alright the
difference between our team is most with
that of our customer facing but our team
is more reactive the customer would come
back to us more than we the competent
customers for the ground personally from
aquatics and patients with issues that
we are there to help him with
troubleshoot and also we do the same
word as you know a little bit
differently we we also help the customer
to develop their company's campaigns and
it sounds and whatever other consulting
there might be necessary for the
customer so the the range of questions
and product is very very big so the good
part of our job is that actually you
never stop learning and you definitely
never get bored at the at the job so in
order to troubleshoot the questions of
the customer we work very closely with
other teams around Google but also with
our teammates so within the task team
that's very that's a very good thing and
also by consulting the customer we also
see the impact actually of the customers
business so we really see that our what
we do what does it change for for the
customer and the good thing as well is
that we are always encouraged to
out-of-the-box to be creative to be
innovative and the job gives us in a
very good product knowledge a very good
product knowledge is a very good start
our car yard Google and every associate
cannon strategist who joins SMB either
within the sales or the global customer
experience team automatically is
enrolled in our business associate over
Sumerian could you give an overview that
program on why this is such a benefit of
joining yes it's a pretty cool program
actually because it goes on for two
years so it's a be a business associate
program and in the first year the like
we have each quarter we have like
something like seminar training kind of
thing where we focus on different topics
so the thing is this whole year or the
second year as well it's like a
preparation for your future career
within Google so it's not only about
improving your core job that you're
doing already every day but it's also on
growing your network within Google it's
about learning about leadership it's
about googliness which is a very typical
thing within Google to to know about and
to act on and and that's the whole first
year so our first session was pretty
amazing with really cool team activities
and it goes on for a whole year the next
year you have the option to to select
some courses you want to grow on so this
is this course is really good for people
who just leave University for example to
see like hands on within the business to
see where do I want to grow and then
they can for example in their second
year select a course like I don't know
it could be in marketing finance or more
technical more with xql and there were
web development or things like that so
they're supporting us to finding our way
within the company I think another
benefit of working Google is internal
mobility which is the option to new
roles and teams and offices is really
unpervaded across all teams in Google
and it's definitely a big benefit of
working there so a lot of Googlers may
start their career one particular office
and ends up relocating and two other
offices in Europe or to North America
and the opportunities are really and for
you to take advantage of so I suppose
we're broadcasting from our Dublin
office but we wanted to hear a little
bit more about the bots off office so
our office in Washington is really
centrally located
and so there's a few really nice photos
there and to give you an overview about
the office I mean you should maybe heat
the chopped' with a little bit more of
an achene salary in the box of office
and why you love working there yes so I
do work and the fruits of office like
you can see at the pictures is it's
really a very nice office like all the
Google offices but this one as well with
a beautiful view from the window this is
actually a picture taken or taken from
from one of our windows by our colleague
you know the one that you see at the
bottom left so the beautiful one and as
you can see we have the on-site team in
our office we would have yoga classes
within the structure of course we would
have kickboxing classes we have other
things like the on-site messages or a
petition coming into the office
hairdresser so different things that are
really great about the office about
working in the process of obvious but
what makes the office so special are
people I think every word and so the
office is very like we are something
like between 150 and 200 people and the
office is very very international so we
have people from from Europe of course
from all over Europe but not only Europe
actually we have many people especially
in other languages teams like
Spanish team from South America we will
have people from Canada and from all
over the world and the good thing about
the size of the offices that we get to
know each other and so we get to know
not only people from like duck team but
also people people from different teams
so the office is big enough but it's
still safe familiar so if you want to
have lunch in this beautiful canteen
that you can also see at the pictures
here at the left corner yo just know it
just to taik to you you just can sit
wherever you want to know the people or
if and if you don't know them very well
you at least know them by name which is
a very positive thing about the we
brought our office I'm I'm actually
planning to go to the box office films
are really excited to go and dump all
that food and check out those views I'm
and we're based in there in the jovian
office and this is the headquarters for
Europe Middle East and Africa so it's
sometimes known as the AMIA Silicon
Valley so and the Google office is
located in a really central part of
Dublin and there are a lot of other tech
companies located close by so there's
always a lot happening I'm in and around
this neighborhood but I wanted to ask
Timo I says what do you you know love
working about in the Dublin office yeah
what may be said already I think Dublin
is a really tech hub in Europe and for
for this region as well so we have
conference like the Web Summit we've
other big companies here and Google
itself is also a very diverse and
international company here at this
disposition so we have I have colleagues
on my floor from the Nordic so from
Denmark or from Norway of course people
from Austria and Germany and in
Switzerland
yeah so in all my surroundings there
there are people from all over this
region and I think in total it's more
than 65
nationalities working here
in Dublin so it's it's a really vibrant
and international crowd and the
atmosphere is really amazing so this is
one one big advantage of table near it's
already been mentioned but it's a
headquarter so it's a really it's a
really big campus here we got many
employees exactly things proving three
or four thousand so it's quite a few
there which sounds a lot but but at the
same time there the atmosphere is yes
it's like a family atmosphere in a way
sometimes when you go for coffee at the
barista or when you have lunch and at
one of our restaurants which are really
good by the way so go and take them out
or when you eat up a TGIF so on Fridays
we always have a gathering where you can
meet people from from other teams from
from other countries and check with them
and see what's going on and they're
working and a life in general so that's
what I really like about here living
working in Dublin moments though we have
think it is fixed buildings now in
Dublin and each one is peed a little
differently so there's a couple of
overviews of summer buildings though I
think and your Tara Island invention so
regardless of that office that you
obtain it in there's such a great
atmosphere as well there's a lot of
spaces in all of our office to that we
will consider them as like breakout
areas where you can go and grab a coffee
and spend time with you know team
members of choc to Googlers who are
necessary working on your team so the
Google offices are really set up to be
able to like encourage and that social
interaction but Mary well I says what is
it about like in a working and living in
Dublin and if you enjoy and that maybe
you kind of also choose to but yeah I
really really like something Dublin is
like it's the capital but it's still not
like huge that you get completely lost
in there in a capital it's it's it's
it's really cute and nice and it's
really yeah I really love the whole
tough culture and everything
it's amazing and I must really say that
I think all the people I've met here
they're super nice right regardless of
if they're in Google or outside of
Google
everyone's super nice there and but
except for that you can do so many
things here you can't they're there the
nature is amazing I don't think that's
any surprise to any of you
other than that what I enjoy luck here
are like I love to go on concerts and
Dublin happens to me it's some kind of
app for that and like all the phenomenal
artists and everything like all the
little bands they do make a stop in
Dublin so I take advantage of them is
what I love most about it but other than
that I think team also mentioned that
you have people from everywhere I love
the fact that I have friends who come
from all over the world then yeah and
sometimes it's it's I don't know like
some leave as well but then all like you
have friends all over the world and you
can visit each other up true and I mean
I think you know quite a lot of our
leaders it's over 80% and repeaters or
or more I'm you know art or not I'm
originally from don't live either and
I'm sure it's you know very similar a
lot of people have relocated to you know
just brought two of them when you're you
know based in an office is not you know
ray currently from you know it's
important to build a network when you're
here but do you get the opportunity to
travel how much as well yeah
so for us we can even we have like we're
a bit flexible about that we could even
work from another office for a few days
and a quarter's so that's really good
and also for me to fly him to Germany
it's quite easy so even if it's for a
weekend or a bit longer pretty good I
mean yeah it's the same for me since so
here in Dublin I'm actually closer to to
visit my friends and my parents at home
than I was when I lived in Germany at
some point so we'll have 20 minutes away
from the airport so you get there right
away you can take flights for the
weekend go home or go to
to other places in Europe within within
a few hours which is really nice and lot
of people take advantage of that as well
the other point you mentioned working
enough offices so this year have already
worked from Hamburg and Berlin so I
could spend some time in Germany as well
but then as he said they're also really
a good reason to stay in Dublin and
Hague advantage of the city here as well
a great occasion to be and during this
week but I why did she use this and
you're over to Natasha and talk a little
bit about it and appreciate you can hear
us now maybe hell puts over the rumors
to rest and and talk to the students
that I was involved when their interview
with us yes basically so uh let me start
from different forces that we have for
four internships so it's a course
slightly different from the one that
will be falling for the full-time offers
so Shearer our internships we conduct
two phone interviews normally one of
those interviews will be conducted by
the manager from from the team you're
applying for
plus one more interview with a member
from from the business second from the
team that you are trying to get into
normally um those would be like two half
an hour interviews and of course it can
be a slowly being chippy but depending
for the preferences from the from the
hiring manager it can also be a video
conference and it can also be a habit
out as you can see that there is a kind
of a quick turnaround because after
those two phone interviews we can
actually go straight straight to the
other now if we can have a look at the
process for a full-time offers as you
can see we've got two more stages added
so the process will start from phone
interviews again here the first for
interview will be definitely conducted
by your ear recruiter which will be
actually a point of contact throughout
the whole recruitment process another
phone interview will be will be
conducted again by somebody from the
business so a member of the team that
you are applying for and normally
that actually works in the role that
you're applying for if you are
successful in phone interviews then we
can progress to the on-site interviews
normally we would invite you to the
office that you're applying for
so let's say if you're applying for a
role in front so I will definitely
invite you to France laughs so basically
you can actually have those interviews
face-to-face you can get the chance to
meet the team and of course explore the
city as well if you haven't been here
before so we want two two three up to
four interviews during one day back to
back each of those interviews will be
testing something different so there are
actually four main areas that that will
be tested and again at this stage you
have a chance to speak with the manager
from from the team after all those
interviews if if everybody are
supportive of your application then we
can move on to committee review stage so
here are your recruiter will be
preparing a kind of a case a kind of a
this year about replication we will
gather relevant information about your
profile about your experience will also
gather the feedback the positive
feedback from interviewers that had just
to talk to you throughout the process
and will present that all information to
the committee so if the committee and
the variant approves approves your
profile then we can move on to the
office stage so that would be already at
the moment that we will be able to
extend you an offer for every one of our
jobs so as you can see the process is
definitely longer than the one we just
discussed for the internship process of
course from the staffing perspective
we'll do our best to make sure that the
process is smooth and that we can
progress
basically as fast as we can but on the
other hand it's all highly depend how
how long exactly the process will take
is highly dependent on your availability
but also in divide available tip out of
each of you students read the do's and
don'ts of series so so definitely after
three and a half years at Google
reviewing thousands of resumes there are
couple skills and those can definitely
I'm sure and what definitely my son
appreciation our first of all in
you are representing yourself in your
resume in your CV you're trying to sell
yourself so it's really important what
information you want to highlight in
your CV whether you're actually putting
enough enough focus on the right
information so for me as a recruiter
what would be definitely important to
see is your accomplishments and
achievements from each of the jobs and
aromas that you're mentioning in
professional in your professional
experience so it's good all also to
mention your responsibilities state to
test a day to day tasks but actually
what interests as the most is the impact
that you have in each of those in each
of those roles which links and leads to
another point which is use a lot of data
and metrics in your in your CV this is a
kind of a something that can really tell
us whether you are successful in your
previous in your previous roles so for
example if you're applying for a sales
role at Google and in the past you had
just worked in sales positions
definitely include your metrics it
includes your core tasks include your
targets so let's say if you are
constantly over achieving your targets
this is definitely something that we
would like to know when looking when
you're looking at your profile another
point also that that we can that we can
make is and this may seem a bit obvious
but again it actually happens quite
often
it's spelling in spelling mistakes
actually so so if them seem a bit
trivial to reject application on the
basis of like mine or spelling or
grammar mistakes but on the other hand
take into consideration how many how
many applications we receive every week
and we can count that in thousand this
is what really firstly competitive labor
market where the kind manager don't have
to compromise the quality so from the
recruiter perspective if I have a look
at two profiles with the same experience
with really similar backgrounds with
similar education and one of them
actually have spelling mistakes I
probably will be leaning towards more
the application that is actually
spotless
and which in a way can tell us how we
can orientate you our work into putting
together a really great CV and Tasha
or remember defeating team has reviewed
your application your vital form
interview I said what are maybe some
tips that he would give to the students
to help into the interview process cook
christ-like main points that I mentioned
all on my candidates I when preparing
them for the for the interview
what is definitely important to take
your time and do research and prepare
yourself for D for the interview
especially when we are already at the
AusAID stage this is already next
interviews so in a way it's required
from you to take some time and in the
preparation of course do research about
about the rounded sharp line know the
exact responsibilities what would be
required from you at the same time the
team that you're applying try to also do
research about Google who we are what is
overall Google strategy and also the
products especially the products that
are relevant for the role that you're
playing for example with account
strategist like AdWords knowledge is
pretty important remember that we
definitely don't require from your
expert or specialist knowledge but as I
said it really tells us if you took time
to do research about this product and
you have that information it definitely
tells us something during during the
interviews another thing important to
mention is actually how we communicate
and how structure answers during your
during your interviews I always
encourage all candidates to read and try
to use start technique of answering
questions especially really useful with
answered behavioral questions so as
sense here for situation key for task a
for action and R for result so when
answering questions in in plenty of
situations you will be describing
particular examples projects or
situation so always first try to give a
quick overview of the situation you are
in then the tasks you have
then of course the action you did and at
the very end try to sum up really
concisely basically the end result of a
particular particular situation like
this definitely going to gonna help you
keep the right structure and at the same
time gonna help the interviewers
understand together and and basically
understand the impact you have in
particular situation play and maybe math
lots of tips but I mean you know Alicia
to know Mary you are obvious we went
through the recruiting process and nor
successful is there anything else you
would add to our fashion spoken about
and how did you prepare for your
interviews me I missed your tips you
might guess I would say what really
helps is get in as much as from
information as you can so if you know
someone who has worked here before who
was done an internship or was currently
working here ask them ask them about it
ask them what how their work is like
like how the relations with their
colleagues is so just try to get as much
information as possible which is really
helpful interview itself make just one
more thing to that I think what is also
you like you um we would require that
you have some professional experience
that you have years of customer
experience what is important is what you
have done so far so maybe think of
things that you have as a student
already like even students organizations
examples at what what was what did you
do actually and what was the impact of
what you have done so far and it for us
it's really interesting to to get to
know like your past experiences but not
necessarily only professional experience
and I mean we spell prepare and diamond
and brats off and walk away or patients
they are to even work in but if you are
you know not from jumpin and you're not
from Wausau and you have to read okay
that's gonna be you know I'm a pretty
scary thought so I guess before from
asking our Google areas how they find
your relocating to and a different
tree-pusher maybe it'll give an overview
by walking on toes and to help students
when they relocated important to the
process of course so the yes we will
provide a rotation support and basically
we provide like a general relocation
package when when appropriate this is
especially relevant to a candidate that
of person needs to move to other
countries let's say - - working for
ourself or to work to want to me that
lien so basically we gotta help you
cover the cost of your location to a
particular country class which is also
very important we're going to provide
your with with support throughout the
whole process we can't provide you with
the right advice we also going to try to
with resources that definitely will be
very useful with with different
information about the housing some tips
from older Googlers that that have to
relocate and over all over the promoter
site would definitely get your price
just to make sure that the process will
be smooth for you and basically the
process gonna be less chance for any
less painful on your site Alicia I know
that you have as you've been living him
and invasive on stuff so you haven't be
located but you know a lot of your teams
and colleagues have I hope they found
the relocation process - but often that
way it mm-hmm yes so I work in the team
where I'm actually the only one that is
from the city so I did not relocate
myself but as we are very international
and most of my colleagues are from
somewhere else
in Europe they keep relocating so I
think like the people that we also like
to have working with us are the people
that are life change changes and
challenges that come with it so moving
to Poland like for some of you maybe you
have not yet visited Poland or cotsworth
but you should definitely do that
um Rosoff is a city you know it's a very
open City it's a very international City
people speak English and it's not a
difficult thing to find housing or
signed a contract or then sign for into
the internet contract or whatever and
we always will have people that would in
the office would help you that say like
at the beginning you probably would
reach out to the Polish speakers for
some things to help you with and this is
absolutely a completely normal thing and
we always do that but like don't think
of relocating to a country where you
don't speak the language of something
that it's more difficult because I don't
think so actually
um and maybe I can I use the chance to
speak a little bit about brought up as a
city because I spoke about that it was a
office but I think broseph is really
worth mentioning as I said I'm actually
from gossips I love this city and I
think and I definitely think it's not
only my perspective but it's a really
beautiful city and it's a sea that you
also should see it's really a lovely
city it's a big city it's not a small
one so in Germany requestor for those
that don't know the Polish name for the
city and and we their office is located
with the city center so most the
Googlers will also leave like close to
the city center probably and the good
thing about the office they but also in
general is that if you look at the map
Europe actually we are in the in the
Europe's hearts in the middle so we are
very close to Berlin it's and three
hours drive to Berlin but to dress even
closer I think it's something like two
hours as well close to Prague so it's
really also very central and very well
communicated and it's a big city it's
like we have more than 600,000 people
living in broad swath and on top of that
something like 50 to 100 thousand
students so it's a young dynamic city
and for all of the people that joined to
relocate the props well they very
quickly find their ways their favorite
places and the city has a loft offer
like next year
Joseph will be the European Capital of
Culture so there will be even more
things coming and we are close to the
mountain so we can go skiing in winter
so what we do also on the office level
there's always an email on weekend so
this Saturday where do we go so it's
really a good place and relocating
knocks off I think it's something like
you will have only good memories of this
will not be something difficult or very
challenging either yes and Miriam
Timmons anything you wanted to add like
how did you find your relocating and
usually what's what's really nice is
you'd start with a group of nooglers new
blurs is a term for new Googlers here so
it it's always like yeah exactly that's
that and you have a week of orientation
so you wouldn't be alone and there's
also other people who are looking for
recommendation and usually in Germany
it's often the case that you would find
the place to live before I actually
moved to a city this doesn't necessarily
happen here in Dublin because the
housing market it turns really fast
you just look online and you can just
come by and look at the apartment right
away and then you can meet up with all
the colleagues and a lot of colleagues
actually live together in a shared
accommodation here and yeah this is also
really guys because you get to support
from your new group and also from Google
itself there's a relocation seminar and
they help you set up the bank account
and then all these formalities for you
okay or a new position and Google is
similar like locating for University and
they become extension with we in it so
we are going to be finishing up the
honey and shortly but we wanted to
answer any questions that you might have
so we have a few in the amp if anybody
wants to submit questions they can do
that I am well first of all I'm going to
ask and the dude there's no question
myself um we talked a lot about you know
the benefits of I'm working in Google
but water maybe some of the more
challenging aspects of working in in
your current role today go yeah
yeah it's it's maybe two sides of one
metal it's also it's also a challenging
part but it's also really interesting
and what I liked about SMB sales is that
you work a lot of different clients from
different verticals or industries so
when you start here at Google you get a
really good overview of what is out in
the market so in the morning to have a
meeting with client or a call with the
client in the fast-moving consumer goods
industry and then you talk with the
healthcare client in the afternoon so
this is really you need some kind of
flexibility to to cope with all that's
going on that specific vertical but at
the same time it's really interesting
for yourself and you learn a lot and
also you learn what marketing strategy
would work for this client but wouldn't
make any sense for for the other one so
this is so as I said is this really
challenging at one on one side but also
keeps the job really interesting and new
every day yeah for me it's more about
learning as much as possible and in the
beginning it was really difficult to
because I knew Edward it's a little bit
but when I started the job I had to know
pretty much everything about it and the
troubleshooting and everything I learned
so much stuff in the beginning and my
learning curve is keeps on growing it's
this I keep on learning new things every
day every single day but in the
beginning it was really overwhelming I
mean it was good for my learning
progress but that's something I found
challenging to cope with all the
information you get and all the all the
knowledge and everything so yeah and
soon is looking like that one of the
questions we have here I'm is how are
the clients left to start you work with
do you select them or they are they
assigned to you so maybe you want to
explain em to become a sales perspective
yeah I'm having a portfolio or clients
works and then we should marry we can
talk about how do you interact with
clients okay so as I mentioned we work
with a portfolio so it's the size of the
portfolio and declines you you treat in
their portfolio different differs with
respect to the team you're in SMB itself
so as I already mentioned it could be
that you're working with
direct client so with the business owner
or the marketing department of a company
itself or you could also treat an agency
so this would be one way of segmenting
the portfolio itself then it's also up
to you it's also up to you how you
structure the clients that you call and
the clients that you interact with so
you can look for instance what are the
clients that have seasonal aspects in
this quarter for itself so the last
quarter this was Christmas season so
you'd probably call different clients
than you would call in the first quarter
of a year another point you would
definitely pick the clients that you
would evaluate have the biggest growth
potential and focus all your energy and
investment on that there's also a
difference in the how often you would
touch the client in SMB itself so there
are programs where you have repeated
contact with the clients you can
interact on a more continuous basis and
other programs where it's more high
scale or one touch so this will also
affect how you would choose and select
the clients yeah for us it's more about
if the customer wants to contact us or
not so we don't actively contact the
customers but we mostly work with let's
say with accounts which are a bit more
not sophisticated but like more and
complex and so if they have any
technical issues and things like that we
also help them with easier stuff
obviously but especially with technical
stuff they would get in touch with us
for example and we would try to work
with our engineers and everything to
give them a solution so in that sense we
don't choose them but they as to us they
choose the contact oven we do our best
to solve their problems because many
many people depend on I've worked so
much that we want to help them and make
sure they can get back on track I mean
it's just one more thing that it's what
simplistic lightly um the customer
comforts asked so
not only you know it's not purely
Edward's customers which is also
interesting and challenging like
answering the first question about the
job it's not only Edwards and it's
important to know it there are different
Google products we could support Edwards
of course but also Google Analytics and
also Google Shopping that you might
might know so all the customers that are
into online advertising Google online
advertising it can be also the YouTube
ads the ads on YouTube would contact us
and that's it for today and I'm afraid
I'm originally to thank I'm all over
