Google office was when a bunch of the
engineers came to our university to give
a sort of talk about what working as a
software engineer at Google might be
like and the thing that struck me was
that I was actually a bit intimidated by
the scope of the problems that were
described to us because it's such a
global nature something really simple
when you when you put it at such a large
scale becomes a huge problem
but now that I'm here I understand that
you know I have my own project I have
the part that I'm working on and that
scale gets its it gets scaled down to
something that I can work through and I
can find a solution book so I can
contribute to that larger solution it's
great to work with so many intelligent
people who are so willing to help I'm
sitting at my desk and I run into some
obscure problem and then I can just turn
to the person next to me or the person
sitting opposite me and say you know
this is driving me crazy
I have a problem what can I do and every
single one of them will stop what
they're doing turn around and work
through the problem with you and just
having those sort of resources like
sitting right next to you is such a
great help when you're when you're
programming my name is Lily Shaw and I'm
a software engineer at Google Sydney</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
