are entrepreneurial that are kind of
go-getters and and certainly willing to
take projects under themselves and and
drive them by themselves without much
direction it's pretty apparent in terms
of how we're managed and and my my
manager is actually 3,000 miles away I'm
able to communicate with him freely if I
need to but ultimately he and I talked
about some goals that we want to set and
outline some things that we want to do
whether it's on a quarterly basis or a
yearly basis and then he just pushes me
away and pushes me out of the nest and
says get to it although I have direction
and and I understand where I need to go
I'm responsible for what I need to do
and I think that that level of autonomy
is something that really allows me to to
feel like the project is my own and to
feel like I'm ultimately responsible for
the success of the project and it and it
makes me much more successful in general
my name is John canard I handle partner
development for Google Checkout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
