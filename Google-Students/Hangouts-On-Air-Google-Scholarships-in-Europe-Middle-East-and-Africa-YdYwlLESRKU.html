short for Europe Middle East and Africa
and we in particular will be looking at
two scholarships that's the Anita Borg
Memorial Scholarship for computer
scientists which are female and for and
the scholarship for students with
disabilities and details such as exact
application deadlines and stuff like
that you can find on the Google students
page www.google.com slash students now
um everyone here I works at Google but
in particular we're all connected to
this these scholarships and directly I
myself was a Anita Borg Memorial
Scholarship finalist in 2007 and I was a
scholar in 2008 in 2009 I joined Google
in unique Germany and as a full-time
software engineer and in 2010 and 11 I
had the pleasure of actually reviewing
applications for the Anita Borg Memorial
Scholarship because I'm a strong
believer that and programs such as these
really help a lot in 2012 I kind of took
a quick break because I'm currently on
maternity need but in 2013 so that the
upcoming cycle I plan to review
applications again and now it's a
pleasure for me to introduce you to
three further Googlers and Tali who is
based in Tel Aviv in Israel how about
you introduce yourself next hi my name
is Anita Borg finalist in 2011 an intern
since for a year and now I've been
assigned we've learned that's three
weeks or something like that
cool great so Chico as she is based in
Nairobi Kenya and I how about you
introduce yourself next ok my name is
Chieko I'm based out of Nairobi I was an
entire book scholar in 2010 then I
joined Google in London in December of
2010 as an intern then Zurich you know
in February of 2010 I'm in 2011 then
joined full-time 2011 as a full-time
user experience researcher based out of
Nairobi last year 20 no this year 2012 I
was I reviewer for all the scholars in
PhD club applying for an taboc
scholarship cool great thank you
finally it's Mika who is based in Tel
Aviv and Israel again how about you
introduce yourself to Google since 2007
I have the pitch in real science and in
the last three years I have the pleasure
of reviewing the applications for the
Google scholarship for students with
disabilities great cool so first we're
going to answer some general questions
and then in the second phase we're
actually going to answer some questions
that you guys out there asked on on
Twitter or the Google moderator page or
on Google+ and so the first question is
more a kind of an explanation and we're
talking about scholarships in India and
in particular about to and if you don't
exactly know what they're about and we
kind of wanted to give you a general
overview
taani how about you give us some details
about the Anita Borg Memorial
Scholarship
so the Anita Borg scholarship moral
process is a scholarship for female
computer scientists or related technical
field basically it's for either like
bachelor's master's who were still going
to be students in the next year and it's
a scholarship that looks for academic
excellence and
and leadership cool great thanks and
speaker how about you give us as some
overview of these scholarships for
students with disabilities some
disabilities and have problems in
applying and also in studying computer
science in the various institutions so
where we are we have Google want to give
equal opportunity to everyone so we aim
of the scholarship is to support those
students give give them some money that
will help them and be equally be equal
in their studying and in accomplishing
their the way they were computed in the
real science basically we look for
excellence we look for leadership and
they have been their students ok cool
that actually in some ways needs over to
the next question which is what do we
look for in applications in propose
scholarships and do you have any tips or
advice to pass along and how about Chico
you give your opinion on that ok um
having applied in 2010 the one thing I
learned is you have to have very good
grades I mean we take excellent as a
very serious thing at Google but other
than your academic qualification I think
that the other good thing is you need to
to show that you have a life out of the
books you need to be a leader of some
sort not only an actual leader standing
in a podium or leading a group you need
to be to show initiative and these are
the things that we are always looking at
in a in an application sometimes you may
have someone with excellent grades but
very zero people skills interaction
skills initiative taking initiative you
are always being paired so you need to
show when you're applying that I have
taken initiative in doing so and so such
as such a thing I've been creative in
doing this this thing
and the one thing that I saw in the in
this year's application is many of the
students and I reread a lot of strange
markets they had not finished the
application they did take time to think
through it and it mean like an essay you
ask a certain question and do not box
yourself within that particular question
but think load me but make sure somebody
else reads that question and your answer
and and gives you feedback on their
perception about that and I'm open to
review some some applications if if you
want you just ping me and I've helped
some of the students actually through
the application process because you just
need another hour looking at your
application and put yourself out there
put your cross skills are there put your
your real support their northern
academics your real self that's what
we're looking for at Google and for the
application as well taani do you have
something to add on to that for the
Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship so I
think she goes right on the money
it really helps a lot I've had I think
tens of my friends go over this and tell
me what they think so definitely do that
and I can just say you know there's no
harm in sending off the application
especially if you've kind of put salt
into it already like finishing it and
sending off and it's like you can't lose
anything and you can win everything cool
so how about speaker you give us some
advice and tips and for the scholarship
for students with disabilities so
basically this these advices hold for
also for the applications for students
with disabilities we look for excellence
we look we look for leadership and one
thing I would like to mention is the
Google with organization called employee
to decide this organization helps a
disabled students with disabilities to
if they have some problems with the
application with
technical problems or other problems so
we feel free to contact these
organizations if you have any any
problems cool
right thanks so and also link to that is
kind of speaker and myself we reviewed
applications speaker do you remember any
applications that stood out where you
said like yeah I remember that that was
pretty impressive yes yes so in
generally they were I remember severally
touching stories about the students that
that have some disability they had some
accident or some or some heart disease
that they're coping and they they said
they described how they overcome all the
barriers that they have and they wanted
to be like regular people and they
accomplished that thing about some
specific what I remember is I like this
story of a student that lives in Albany
and in a place there are many poor
people and his hobby was to is to way he
helps friends and family with the
software problems that they have in
their computers and many asks them to
give him some to give them all the
computers and all the parts of computers
and he assembles it together and takes
it in to poorer children in his
neighborhood and it gives them and ships
them to him and so we Andy remembers
when he was a poor child in his
neighborhood and he couldn't afford a
computer and now we every time he sees a
child smiled and it it makes him feel
very happy so this was a story that I
remember so and me personally I reviewed
for two years and I think probably the
one story that stuck with me which was
really impressive and I guess you don't
see very often is someone actually first
co-hosted a
summer camp for four girls I think and
to learn more about computer science I
think it was some somewhere in Africa
kind of also a lot of basic skills and
the next year she led it and after that
as she kind of saw that there was so
much excitement so she brought it to
schools and it was like on a regular
basis which is like a clear sign of
leadership and it's not necessarily on a
highly technical level but it shows so
much passion and so much involvement and
trying to change the world with such
things which was really impressive I
myself didn't do anything such grand but
for example I I worked on open so an
open source software and that's
something I guess by I saw quite a bunch
of times and that's also something
that's always great to see that while
you're studying you actually take it a
step further you don't just do what the
curriculum requires but you do something
that you enjoy and that brings you and
others further so I think that's always
impressive and it's always something to
be very proud of and that reads very
nicely in an application to now the
scholarship I already said I'm a strong
believer I think it helps a lot of
people and for me it was very
encouraging it was kind of a boost of
confidence I I personally as a woman and
computer science often felt that I
wasn't quite as good as my fellow and
computer scientists and getting the
scholarship and especially going to the
retreat really and showed me how many
other women were on the field and by
acknowledging their accidents I kind of
got an idea of that and actually I'm not
that bad either and so it was took my
confidence and that helped me actually
push further and go for an internship
with Google and in the end work with
Google and and and kind of get rid of
that small impostor syndrome I was
I was having so that's probably the
biggest impact that the scholarship had
for me kind of being exposed to other
people and realizing the good stuff that
was happening out there and but I wonder
and what about you Tolly did you what's
that there being a finalist and make
happen for you so when I went through
the retreat first of all there were a
lot I think it was constantly growing
like every year there are more finalists
and you kind of go in and you're
expecting to fit around the same number
that there was last year and there's
like this is a lot of people all right
um so there are a lot of really amazing
really amazing girls and some of them
are like my friends now and we lose
touch and it's really great to see that
around the world people are actually
doing stuff they're changing they're
making a difference and they care and
it's it's really great to see there were
amazing stories oh my in Chico what
about you Oh for me I mean the Anita
Borg scholarship had two great impacts
the first one is I was among the first
one of the two people with two girls who
go to connect a box called for the first
time in Africa so there's a lot of media
breeds everybody from Kenya where I come
from to South Africa has been to grad
school I mean we were on so many news
channels it was amazing but the amazing
thing out of it was the number of girls
who who who actually looked up to us and
I got this number of you knows from
girls saying how do I get into
consciousness and I saw high school
girls and I got these speaking
opportunities to go and speak to high
school girls and just want us answer
what is completed how is conversational
dimension and at the time of the PhD
student and I'm very passionate about
creating technology for Africa and many
of these girls how I was telling them
computer science is not about just math
it's about solving that problem you have
in your community using technology and
they were getting
and I think because I would listen maybe
because they could identify with me I
look like them I didn't look like
extraordinary I mean like a Googler who
could catch technology a technology but
I mean that was the one thing that
really got to me the second thing is I
got some money and the money went all of
which went into my PhD I was just at the
tail end of my PhD and I wanted to make
it into like an actual viable product
that people can actually use and because
I was working with very poor people and
my those were my users I didn't want to
chat than anything so this money came
just at the right time and I put in so
all of it actually into actually making
my PhD into an actual product more than
just a thesis and those are the biggest
impact and my PhD has gone and outgrown
me even I take him into Google it's
still some way South Africa helping
people and for me I'm always entire
grateful for that it changed my life and
because any other life of these girls
that always even till today write to me
and say how do I get into computer
science and I'm happy to be an answer to
that question because I didn't have an
answer when I was growing up so it's
really great to see that partly through
the scholarship you kind of became a
role model and and someone to look up to
and and kind of someone that people
could approach without feeling
intimidated or anything like that so as
we come on ously you weren't a recipient
of a scholarship but do you have any
reasons why you think people should
apply I think as I said before students
with disabilities have many barriers and
I think money can help in some cases to
overcome the barriers also where this
gives as you can see that many people
that receive these scholarships they end
up working at Google and have
connections with Google so I think this
can be a win for both sides both for
Google and also for the students so I
think this can be a very good thing to
try cool so that's kind of
questions that we thought probably a lot
of you will be interested in but they're
the questions that probably touch the
points that are most interesting to you
are those questions that you were
submitted so here's the first one from
Anya in London UK there are many good
applicants out there any tips on how to
make make an application stand out and
so tally how about you start okay so I
haven't reviewed any applications yet
maybe this year but just based on what
I'm hearing some people and what I've
heard in the in the retreat I think you
know finding stuff hero in you and just
let it out and you know grades are
numbers and your CV is the swelling's do
it in the essays fine who you are and
what for speaker what about you I think
I agree with what Holly says I think
just be good in what you do and then put
it down write it down and be yourself I
mean this is the the great thing we show
that you are both excellent in what you
do and also that you care about others
you have some videotapes you did some
other things you had the you didn't
think that other people that don't do
and write it down and I think that's it
so sir I can also just reiterate on that
I mean she co did say we do look at
excellence and academic excellence
technical excellence but I I think the
the best way for you to show yourself is
in those essays and just kind of writing
what you think what vision you have
explaining things you've been doing
because sometimes grades aren't the
thing that actually tells right outright
how much passion you have whether you
are
for what kind of things you do and like
in in the CV and the essays you can
really show that and it's not about kind
of throwing out big terms or anything
like that it's just about kind of
getting your idea across from getting
your personality across and and and when
you accomplish that then your
application will definitely stand out
and as Talley mentioned and also Chico
it really helps if you write your essays
um if you like someone else read through
them just so and have the sanity check
does it all make sense to someone who
hasn't had any any contact with the
ideas you're presenting before I mean
you can always remember that computer
scientists will be reading the
applications so you don't have to kind
of start from super scratch but not
expecting specialists to read for
example what kind of PhD you're doing
does help because when it's easy to read
something and then you've done a really
good job which kind of leads over to the
second question that Anya I think it's
probably the same Anya asked any tips
regarding the technical essays so my
advice would be and the simpler you make
it sound the better like it's the the
most difficult thing is to make as
something difficult seems and when I
read applications I really appreciate
that and and you know we're also are
people so if you kind of make something
sound more complicated than it is we're
going to know and we're just going to
say you know that could have been stated
more concisely and when you actually
accomplish that it's very impressive and
that's something that gets extra plus
Prime's for me and speak I do you have
something to add on to the technical
essays I don't think so I think I think
you made a good point keep in mind that
the review
with many applications oh so you have to
be clear and not going to too many
details but on the other hand show that
the technical complexity of water what
you're doing and I know Sarah Sarah will
agree with me on this one some of us
have dependents have a tendency to sort
of minimize ourselves and and that's
like the main thing that you need to try
not to do that's why people could be
here at least of course you don't want
to go overboard because also between
like the ryokan saying you know love the
little thing that I do it's really very
small yeah I guess one thing to that
alter that is like the essays don't feel
the need to write it like a technical
paper like it should it shouldn't be
totally colloquial but you know you know
I try to show yourself you don't have to
be very formal and just kind of righted
as if you and wanted to explain
something to to a fellow computer
scientist so you know kind of find a
good balance but don't don't try to to
be too intellectual in some ways well
you know we we appreciate when it
complexity is explained and not hidden
away but I hope you get well I mean when
I say don't try to write a paper to
publish at a conference and to I don't
what Sarah is saying is be real be
yourself right from your heart I mean
whatever
once you're writing down this it to be
from your heart not basically from your
head down of a thing don't think this
guy's I in at Google they want to read
these technical terms I mean some of the
applications this year were excellent
but I'm forced to go on to such every
two seconds to cut what do they mean
is saying these and by the time I'm done
with that AC I'm so tired and maybe you
actually I've given you a bit and made
better points but because you use some
technical words that I didn't have an
idea what what about and it's okay if
you feel that I'm doing this research
it's very I mean students in Africa I'll
just talk to you sometimes you feel like
your research is or your your work is
not very computer science it's all here
because it's applicable to where you are
applied with that because before inside
I mean as everybody has said Sarah has
said it and because we see what you're
doing are you trying to change the world
we want to see a superwoman Superman
because in the in changing the world
that's that's what Google is all about
changing the world so don't be too
technical don't use hard names dude
don't make us think you're doing
something that you're not because that's
that's what some of the students are all
is doing don't use anything technical
just use plain English again get
somebody else to read application even
they don't understand it don't send it
yet just give it another day look at it
and then send it so I think that's a
great note to end on
thank you everyone for joining the
Hangout and or and if you're watching
this later I just reiterate that the
details about the scholarships are on
the Google students page www including
the application deadlines and the exact
requirements and and I hope you enjoyed
this hangout and as sharing a couple of
inside views and have a good day bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
