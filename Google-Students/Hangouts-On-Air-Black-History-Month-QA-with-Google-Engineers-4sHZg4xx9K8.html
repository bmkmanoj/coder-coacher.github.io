Britain I'm going to be hosting our
first black history month hangout on air
this is part of our Black History Month
series that we have that we're profiling
our Googlers it started with some blog
posts that we have and we have with us
today some of our Googlers that are in
the engineering departments here so to
start myself how about all of you just
introduce yourself to everybody we can
start with Brittany over there I know
you've had a blog post up so you can
start hey hey everyone my name is
Brittany Frasier I graduated from
Stanford University with my bachelor's
and master's in computer science in 2010
and I've been here at Google as a
software engineer in search ever since I
guess I'm da-rae I also went to Stanford
with Brittany actually worked on
projects back with a good times but yeah
i graduated in 2009 with a bachelors in
computer science awesome i guess it's my
turn I'm Kumar a nice need everyone i
graduated from morehouse college
bachelors pure science class of 2011 and
I've been at Google for roughly over to
NAV months hey everyone I'm test winlock
I'm an engineer over in payments i work
at a fair i graduated from university of
the pacific which is in stockton
california and then I got my graduate
degree at UC San Diego started here 2010
so been here ever since great well we
love celebrating Black History Month I
google because it really helps us see
and talk about a lot of the diversity
that we have here at Google and we heard
a little bit about Brittany's road to
google so to start off how about
everyone tell us a little bit about
their path studying computer science and
basically how they got to Google dire if
we can start with you that'd be great
sure yeah I guess my path was a little
bit unconventional like I didn't really
know much about computer science until I
got to college I originally went to
Stanford to study chemistry p and i got
kind of bored with it maybe like half
way through sophomore year like getting
a junior year so
I started to see us kind of late the
main reason I got into it because people
said it was difficult and that I
probably be able to get it done I'm a
weird kicking like that I like the fun
things that people say I can't do and
just immediately start to do them so I
guess that's kind of how I fell into it
and that combined with a healthy dose of
curiosities kind of kept me going sounds
like you like the challenge yeah and how
did you go from this great challenge
that you took away from chemistry which
I find to be extremely challenging also
to computer science how do you end up at
Google um that's kind of an interesting
story so I graduated and my parents had
just moved to the Netherlands so i canna
had nothing to do for a while and I was
job hunting like crazy and Google was
actually the first place to get back but
you know then again it was also one of
the biggest challenges in my mind
there's also a place I never thought I'd
work you know I got the call so I
figured hey man I'm gonna chase it down
and see how far it goes and I made the
cut so okay and um how about the rest of
you we can test sure um so I started off
undergrad thinking I mean I'd always
been kind of playing around like little
gadget e devices my father had like a
bunch of computers were flying around
and so I started an undergrad as
computer engineer thinking kind of
wanted to like you know I wasn't sure
like oh maybe I'll go for the electrical
and build stuff or maybe i'll go for
computer science and then over time I
just really enjoyed computer science and
the more you know programming of this
instant gratification in some ways and
it was also just the I've gotten several
internships overall computer science and
then I decided to go there I ended up
getting an internship at Lawrence
Livermore laboratories and then from
there they had like a specialist type
like her special that I guess it was a
scholarship for going to like Grace
Hopper and from there I applied it
figured out I could like Google and then
that's why then ended up getting two
internships here and then being a
full-time so lots of internships is
basically the road
I guess I'll try me in next for me
personally I've always had a passion for
technology and i'm growing up started
programming probably around twelve
thirteen getting really involved in how
to you know the future of technology and
really started sculpting like you
softwares and outside projects outside
of my coursework in school so naturally
progress during high school like I start
tinkering with different things and
hardware like this worked with the geek
squad car thing in from there it just
seemed like a natural progression to go
into computer science coming into
undergrad and from there I us basically
founded a deeper passion for technology
and influencing me while I was interning
at like apple and different companies
and doing some outside work and some
freelance website design just was taking
on different projects and trying to
immerse myself in different initiatives
just basically pushing innovation so I
guess with that while i was at morehouse
i had a really good interaction so to
speak with recruiters from google and
always kept that line of communication
open and basically upon graduation I
went through the process of applying and
doing the interviews and was successful
enough to be offered a position here as
a product quality analyst and that's why
I'm here no math today so you just
mention you are on the ads quality
evaluation team can you tell us a little
bit about what you do there and what
exactly that team does absolutely so on
has an ass quality analyst um first and
foremost we're here to protect Google's
users and the integrity of the ad
network we do that by investigating
questionable business practices and you
seem so add products so essentially what
i do is i execute yellow with solutions
to effectively combat dynamic forms of
the
abuse that directly impacts you know
ongoing success with Google's core
business so with that you know all the
AdWords on the Google search engine
which in no or that's coupled with your
organic search results we kind of make
sure that they're good ads and we don't
promote bad great and Daria can you tell
us a little bit more about what you're
doing right um so I'm also actually
working at quality of it test
engineering sign and most of what that
entails is designing software systems to
test other software systems so you know
designing a lot of automation tools and
you know coming up with new techniques
to kind of validate the fact that as
they're being shown on Google searches
and things like that but I guess the
main end of a goal is to assure that
quality is Matt tank so I guess
attacking that from the engineering side
and Brittany sends on the blog we have
heard about basically your paths
computer science and also your path to
Google a question that I would love to
ask you specifically is what is
something that you've done since you've
been at Google that you have found to be
really interesting whether it's just
something that's made you stretch your
limits or something that you really find
interesting in the whole tech industry
and computer science what's something
that has made you really proud to work
in this industry um so I think I was as
I mention the blog post i worked on
launching a search polish your world and
I was progressive i feel i think is just
like it's one of the biggest changes to
the search results page and so like
being a part of that was like pretty
cool like i worked on the UI side of
things like my team helped implement
like all the changes you actually see on
the website and just having a lot of
stay and like shaping how that product
actually ended up when we launched it to
the world was a lot of like I only been
here a little less than a year like
maybe like nine months eight months when
I switched that to him and I was still
very new and i still had like a lot of
say
I think my favorite things that I've
done at Google aside from like my job
like google has a lot of different cafes
and a lot of them and they give you the
opportunity to like spend a morning
helping to cook so I spent a morning and
like my first six months helping with
the bakery team and I baked or I scoop
like a thousand muffins and then baked
like vegan snickerdoodles that were
surprisingly delicious so that was a lot
of fun that's great so since you guys
have taken the path maybe sometimes the
path less traveled or maybe some of you
have always been interested in
technology but how would you guys say
what do you think is the best way to
encourage more students especially black
students to get into computer science
test urine and you're an intern before
so you probably have a lot of insight
into this how about you start us off
yeah sure um I mean there there's a lot
of ways and I mean there's some
interesting ones in trying to start
early on I mean I did some work in
undergrad in trying to involve people
from the community and Stockton like
getting them on campus to play around
with technology and seed like trying to
get them interested in it I mean beyond
that it's also trying to once they are
in school keeping them interested in
having courses and support network I
mean I greatly credit my undergrad in
keeping me very interested in
engineering because they took a very
vested interest in me and made sure that
you know that my professors would ask me
like you know if you're gone for a
couple days they'll be like hey you
still live are you okay you know things
that really help out I mean of course
it's not feasible for every University
but it's still it really helps up to
keep people interested in you know keeps
it personal and I mean being an intern
here at Google that really I mean beyond
it being just a one of the greatest
challenges because you're trying in
three months to do something you know to
pick up work and get a big project done
it's a lot of fun because you know the
university I mean they all try to make
sure that all of us have a lot of fun
with you know we did what
trampoline dodgeball all those other fun
things on the side so you know it makes
sense the mix the like crazy it's hard
technology and hard problems with also
the personal making things fun sort of
way okay and tomorrow what would you
what do you think is a good way to get
kids interested in computer science
you've been interested in technology for
a while but what really jump-started for
you um I'm first i'ma start by saying
that everybody should know doing the
computer science um for me personally
like I think it was necessarily finding
a passion um and specifically like my
mom like she brought home like one of
the first pcs and I was like using that
and like messing around with that and
they're not end up breaking it but then
finding a way to fix it so you know from
that early age I really knew that the
core would I really enjoy was problem
solving and just relating that back to
computer science so like I know so much
so my other classmates um at Morehouse
there are ways that necessarily find
their passion is like they might start
up in mathematics or another hard
science and just really found a way to
bridge the gap between the two so think
about Stephanie finding passion that
game sorry so go ahead test I was like
it definitely it's involved with making
people relate it to themselves and their
on drives if they don't have you know it
really made it for me I guess it did
make it personal because I did do some
assistive technology and undergrad and I
have always had a big interest in that
and it just really helps if you can like
actually put a face to like the
technology that you're doing so it's
like you can actually see like oh I'm
building this piece of technology for
those with several palsy I can actually
see the result in the help of that it's
giving and I can see a lot of people
don't really think of computer science
they see it as like oh I'm just going to
be coding or oh I'm just going to be
developing you know certain little
programs but there are very important
benefits that can be gained from
technology
and it can really have a face and smiles
acting so that always helps do I'm going
to go ahead and second Kumar's response
for life finding your passion or just
laying like 12 but I'm not gonna say
everyone's fashion should be computer
sighs I think it should be but chances
are it might not be for you maybe I
should me but um computer science for me
I didn't think that it was gonna be like
something I was interested in like I i
encode until like dari I was in like my
sophomore year at school and college and
my best friend convinced me to take the
introductory CS class and I was like
this is actually kind of fun but this is
not what I thought I'd be doing um my
parents we want me to be a doctor and I
was very much not because aren't I had
very similar path you're both chemistry
we both the fancy as we focus which it
immediately like we're basically the
same person I always one of those be
done to celebrate doctors um and so I
think it's definitely like worth
pursuing things that you might not think
you'll be interested like us on the
surface but like take introductory CS
class like do stuff with like Lego
Mindstorms or something just the weather
like how older like there's always like
introductory CS things that you can do
and I think it's worth like just
exploring those like with an open mind
like seeing what is it like and what
Kate where can you go from there um and
maybe it will be your passion maybe you
don't have to be a doctor Daria what do
you think I think I think exposure is a
really big tool I know growing up I had
a lot of exposure to technology I didn't
realize it you know until I came to
Google and I realized like the path i
had taken but you know growing up as a
kid my neighbor had like the most
ridiculous computer system his dad was
like some computer architects somewhere
and he had this ridiculous servers just
him in his house money OST to go over
there play video games and computer
games and things like that and you know
that really got me interested in an
early age I had a tangible effect on me
and like even growing up in high school
you know I started hacking up my xbox
and opening it up and try to put chips
in there and like running different os's
on it and all kinds of weird stuff like
that and you know that that was just
kinda like a thing I didn't on the side
I didn't realize you could actually
create these things until I got to
college
you know I started taking CS classes and
I saw that not only could I just use
technology I could be you know the agent
of its creation so that really got me
excited and seeing the tangible effects
of things that you can create having a
positive backup guro that that really
got me excited and that's what's keeping
me going today so it sounds like you're
saying you can have a positive impact on
the world without being a doctor
convincing my family of that I believe
it I actually I have a funny story about
it I met one of my aunts a while back
and I hadn't seen her in a long time and
I told her you know I was working at
Google I'm a software engineer and she's
like okay that's cool but when you going
back to med school it's like say maybe
later because you can accept the fact
that I'm probably not gonna do it well I
never test talked about the importance
of internships and for those of you out
there who are interested in learning
about more of our internship
opportunities scholarships full-time
positions that we have after graduation
you can definitely go to google.com /
students and see all of that March 18th
is the deadline for the UNCF scholarship
for any for any of you who are
interested in that so just wanted to put
that out there for anybody that's
interested and there's a question that
our viewers asked all the time which is
please tell us about a day in your life
so what is a day in your life a test you
can go ahead and start tell us about
what do you do every night um yeah I
mean the day I always find actually
starts with me waking up and walking
over TV Google shuttle for it and then
jumping on that and having my free Wi-Fi
as I go campus and then I typically
respond to a whole bunch of a whole host
of emails and things before starting to
code when I actually get into the office
being I purse I work on fraud detection
so what we're trying to do is stop bad
guys from either stealing money from our
users or from google itself so we are
always trying to you know keep up with
people in
also trying to bring in products and
make sure that they are using our API is
and stuff properly so a lot of what I
have to do is meet with people and talk
about requirements talk about how they
should be protecting themselves or what
our rules are going to be so um there's
a lot of coding but then there's a lot
of like actually interacting with people
and understanding their problems and
trying to help them solve with its all
to give us to help solve the problem we
can give them to solve their problems so
I have this sort of like it's definitely
a very techy piece because of course i'm
coding constantly but it's also like
there's a lot of meetings i have on my
calendar all day enough yes the melon oh
sorry I was just going to say for
somebody that was an intern for two
summers how is what is the biggest
difference you've seen as a full timer
meetings honestly like the the
internship you're very um you know you
have this high focus on like I have my
project I haven't exactly laid out i
have to do ABC and then i'm done and
then summer is over and i get to go out
ada and here it's a lot more there's a
lot more trying to like find projects
fine fraud you know define things myself
instead of having my like supposed to
find them and yeah there's there's a
less trampoline dodgeball also distinct
lack in that not what was that we can
make that happen um yeah it's still I
mean it's a lot of fun i personally like
it better than my internship honestly it
only got better from there like every
summer just getting better and better so
here i am starting full-time or doing
full time that's great so what do you do
on a day-to-day basis c'mon ah so I
guess after I get um really healthy
hearty breakfast at Google um I head
over to my desk where I'm I greeted by a
a plethora of work emails of course um
like test said but uh also like the
energy of my team my team members like
bring this like awesome energy to work
every day that
inspires me to just set my bar higher
every day so like we will like work from
different meetings and we'll collaborate
with different teams we're very
cross-functional across Google will have
meetings MVC's from across the world
basically you know from there we'll meet
with other engineers try to find needs
knock out different tasks that can be
knocked out that given time and you know
we basically drive policy changes with
other product specialists and it's just
really fun by the end of the day I'm
pretty I want to say burnt out but a
little bit tired so I like to probably
kick back and watch like a movie or
something or you know if I have the
energy like bollig a co 3 or something
like that but of course with my friends
in they happen to be co-workers just so
it's an awesome time and I really do
enjoy working on such a small fast-paced
team yeah well you were talking about
having meetings with people all around
the world and although our headquarters
are right here in Silicon Valley google
truly is a global company that you
really realize once you get here so what
are some of the places that you find
yourself having conference calls and
video chatting with during your days um
so for me specifically i would have
meetings for from anywhere from people
we have a team that sits in hyderabad we
have a team that sits of course right
here in Mountain View but then there's
another team that is actually in Japan
um so will you know there's a there's a
couple of different teams that we might
necessarily meet with but a lot of the
VC and emailing necessarily takes place
from the hub here and then and sent out
and then finds his way back again so to
speak so we have a unique culture within
our group that we were able to you know
leave with different people across the
world
this is awesome yeah daya what do you do
every day every day is a little bit
different for me so my project is
somewhat internal so we have a lot of
turn and a lot of different things that
come in every day I guess I can start
with my example of today today our car
as she's driving in my car wouldn't
started to get my roommate to jump me
but I made it in and answered my morning
deluge of emails after eating breakfast
of course but the past couple weeks I've
actually been on call so any kind of
like series production issues that might
ever happen I'm the 911 number for that
so um that's that's a very dynamic task
being on call and that's definitely a
challenge and I love it it's interesting
every day every 20 minutes something new
happens and you have to fix it or figure
it out make something you happen to call
somebody or go to beating or find some
way to get around some issue that needs
to be solved instantly so I guess my
typical day is always different but you
know I guess the core thing is that i
get i get my meals in and i get my rest
at the end of the day I get to kick back
of my room base hit but every day every
day is a new challenge definitely an
interesting challenge Brittany what do
you do every day ah my typical day often
revolves around food actually I google
on a lot of different cafes and all of
them are delicious so I also shuttle in
like Tess I live in San Francisco and so
I hop on the bus and I read my mail like
catching up on things like I didn't feel
like doing as I came in like the day
before like came in while I was asleep
um and so like respond to that and then
I'll get in here if I'm lucky I'm here
before breakfast closes but usually I
just end up with a bowl of cereal um and
then I'll spend the rest of my morning
just like catching up on like a few more
things probably a coding a little bit
like responding to people's comments on
things that I had done previously or the
day before and then I said they might
when I'm going to eat for lunch and
where I'm going to go so many choices
and all the more delicious and then the
afternoon is usually where most of my
teas meeting happens like where we're
not morning people by any way shape or
form so some people want to talk about
the
usually after one um and so like I'll
spend maybe like an hour to after lunch
I just try to throw like what we should
do next with our projects and like what
are the next steps we want to take and
like what features we should add so
we'll have meetings like various teams
to discuss like either providing the
data for us to display or working with
like product managers to figure out like
what are the features we should target
and then my afternoon is coding a little
bit more before I shuttle back home to
eat dinner with my roommates and friends
you don't eat dinner here only sometimes
for anybody that's just now joining we
are having our first hangout on air for
a black history month series so welcome
I'm going to ask one of the one of the
last questions that we have for this and
that basically is what have you done
since being involved Google or computer
science has really made you either
realize that this is really something
you want to do has gotten you really
excited about someone who does engineer
but it was an engineer or just made you
really proud maybe of the company that
you work for or the field that you have
chosen um tomorrow we can start with you
um so the one thing there's so many I'm
trying to pick um I would say my core
work really really I'm developing a
passion for it um so to speak that this
is the very beginning I was really
coming in I wasn't really sure exactly
what I was going to do is ask quality
analyst and once I got here I got a very
clear understanding and basically just
the fact that Google puts you know their
uses first and making sure that you know
we stay true to the company's core
philosophies and that we make sure that
there we're not distributing
badass and I I thought that was a very
unique perspective since prior to coming
to Google I've I've used google since
the very beginning and me personally
doing a simple search I've always had a
question about the ads and you know how
the selection process in you know could
it essentially no be bad for me in my
information so I think that really
speaks to like Google's core
philosophies and what they stand for and
I just I mean I mean every day I'm
reminded that this is the perfect choice
that's great that's how about you what
what makes you excited about either the
work that you do or coming in and being
a computer scientist do it being an
engineer why are you happy that you've
done this there's I mean there's a lot
of things I mean constant problems the
back and forth that we have with our you
know fraudsters who come in and try and
take money it's definitely I think like
that moment where I was really like you
know wow I'm not only happening in
effect that it's really awesome it's
like just seeing those graphs of like
how many people we like you know when I
push in new features like oh I'm save
you no stopping this much fraud you know
and maybe catching this many people who
might have taken over account so like
they're taking over someone's accounts
and it was just like we're catching them
for stopping them it's like that moment
really like realizing this stuff that
you do actually has an impact it's
really cool and like I don't know that
just is really empowering kind of her
like yeah I can any any change I do some
you know has an instant reflection on
like our users and like help stop them
from suffering like you know terrible
event of having someone take over their
account so it's I don't know it's a lot
of fun here and I mean also it's made me
proud at Google was having done some
work in assistive technology working
with sublime it's like the moment i got
here i think we had like a TV africa's
like we need to you know improve our
accessibility that was really that was
just really awesome so and dari and
brittany i guess i guess i highlight for
me is being able to do things like this
you know come in on a monday and you
get to have my face out there and talk
about how awesome my job isn't we're
here I don't know how many other
companies eyes on that yeah good job you
can come in on Monday and people ask you
like hey if you want to talk about okay
you know and then you go back to work
and that's part of your normal day so I
mean it's definitely it's definitely a
highlight for me to be able to think
like that to meet all the amazing people
who work here it's more than just
engineering and like it's more than a
single roll you can have more than one
identity here you can definitely be
yourself and do all the things that you
want to do and more things that you
thought you'd never be able to do like
this for me i never thought i'd do this
so you know i'm definitely excited to
come into work you know tomorrow there's
something like this might happen again
um so yeah I think like Google's
commitment to increasing diversity I
find extremely honorable like they do
there's a bunch of different types of
scholarships a bunch of different like
summer programs just to try to increase
the number of underrepresented people in
this field and engineering and being
like an african-american woman you're
super rare in computer science like
being a woman period or being
african-american is already kind of rare
but being like an african-american women
kind of like being a unicorn um my
friends often call me a unicorn like I
have the trifecta of being both a girl
and computer science and so testy and I
can be unicorns together absolutely like
my nickname is like the fact that
Google's like trying like we're actively
working to make not so for make us not
so unicorn and rare like I think is
amazing and they also like on the
engineering side the homepage doodles
one of my former co-workers is now on an
engineering person on the doodle team
and just like the things that they do
are oh like it's just it's super
exciting like there's a lot of
