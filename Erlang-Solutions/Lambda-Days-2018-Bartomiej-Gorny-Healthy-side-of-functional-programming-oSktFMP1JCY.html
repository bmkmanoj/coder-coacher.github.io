will work as developers is not really
dangerous right we sit in comfortable
environment
nobody's trying
Kilis usually but as years turn into
decades it takes its toll
Reese got worn out
that's our spine issues your eyesight
problems after a while and there is
stress these are a bit separate topic so
we will tackle them first up sorry yeah
stress there are many causes causes of
stress their internet connection is
going down trading hard were using those
plenty plenty of issues type deadlines
we can help much with that but there is
another kind of stress which is caused
by using tools in the wrong way for
example if you have that hammer and I'll
use a hammer
this is a right tool for a job right but
normally you hammer the nail with the
flat side of the hammer right you can of
course hammer it with the thin side and
this is this tool this is still the
right tool for the job
but you are using this in the wrong way
so those three spine ice and stress they
are actually tightly connected we will
see presently why it's all boils down to
efficient use of resources when I
started digging into that I asked me
after the question doesn't really matter
which style of programming to use after
a while it or not maybe maybe the
starting point was East our brain better
suited for one or the other programming
style ninety some research and I came to
some conclusions which I now have a
privilege and pleasure to share with you
we will start with wrists because this
the most simple thing we saw worn out
because of typing right so unless you
have one of those outrageously expensive
ergonomic keyboards then after a while
you trust me you will have problems by
the way if you are using Mouse
considered trackball because if you're
using a mouse you do a lot of this and
the end after
a few years it begins to hurt so but
this is saying not them wrists got worn
out because of typing so we want to type
less right does functional programming
means less typing there's no scientific
proof for it because it's nearly
impossible to prove it experimentally
there are statistics which shows which
show that functional code is between 2
to 10 times shorter so it's not really
precise information but it it means
something I found this interesting this
is the list of implementation of quick
check and the best implementations
chosen by the quick check authors in
every of the every language and this is
thousands of lines so you can pretty
much tell the difference between 6 and
77 and you can pick you can hear what's
on the top so check let's type in good
for us with score one point then the
main the main point we want to make a
work easier easier we want to use our
brain in the way that it's meant to be
used in the right way so this is so it's
efficient and productive
what are we best at as human beings what
is what is the operation that we do in
our brain that is most efficient it's
like a bitwise operations in computing
the fastest possible thing what is it
anybody knows is this it's recognizing
familiar and familiar patterns and flows
in those patterns and this is because
for a million of years our life depended
on it
I Bartosz Milewski likes to say that we
are made we are built for hunted
mammoths not for solving equations and
this is a grain of truth in him because
it's like you see a green field grass
and you see an animal who's passed my
brain
all your search for fruit or you see you
just a danger in the booze you can't you
don't see the tiger this is a tiger
right but you see something moved
something is wrong and this is what we
our brain is optimized for just to give
an example what's wrong with this
picture
yeah how long did it take you half a
second maybe and look how much work you
have done you started looking at it you
formulated a pattern after like two
tenths of a second probably then you
scan the rest and you'll find they're on
the wrong place so this is how efficient
we are this is something every
experienced driver knows when you drive
in a heavy traffic and all cars are
following a certain pattern and then you
spot a card that swerves an inch did
something wrong you don't know what what
is it oh there's something wrong with it
so this is this is our our optimization
now to the point why am I talking about
pattern recognition you have two pieces
of code
this one is Python this one is in Erlang
it doesn't mean doesn't actually mean
that much in all language it is written
because you can write practical in every
language in the quad you can you can
write good Khan in JavaScript or
whatever whether that length functional
programming like enhances and sometimes
that for certain good practices for
example those two pieces of code they do
the same thing they act they take three
input variables and then they do some
logical conclusions check now now try to
figure out what this code does if you
want for example what this code would do
if you have bad false and ugly false and
you have a number of clauses and you
have you have to read them line by line
and see because there's always there's
always two of the money who one of them
is missing so we have to read all those
lines a few times probably until you
figure out
what are you looking for now if you try
to do the same here you don't have to
read it at all you just do a quick scan
yeah here done so in my opinion pattern
matching is the most readable construct
ever invented in programming so check
now a few other interesting things about
pattern recognition for example in says
just if you know about strategic
planning about thinking ahead what you
are what your opponent is supposed to is
expected to do but not always
not only have you ever seen chess
players playing bleats bleats is a chess
game which was a very short time limit
like two minutes so there's no way
there's no time for thinking
those guys are moving their figures like
as fast as the hands could go they are
not they do not think at all because
there's no time for you they recognize
patterns on chessboard and make decision
based on the unit and this is actually
called recognition prime decisions yeah
because the heads are full of patterns
like ready-to-use they all don't lead we
only have too much so it's done
instantly without thinking there's
another kind of recognition Prime
decisions which are based on episodic
patterns episodic by episodic memories
memory of something that experienced but
something you've read or seen or heard
but something to actually been through
you took part in it some quality
experience and this is something that is
very annoying about senior people in
every workplace because it's very
frustrating for juniors when they come
up with the idea and the senior guy said
no it's not going to work that's like
this after sprint second how on earth
does he know it he didn't even think
about it know what he has he expect
having spent decades on a job
he has lots of patterns in his episodic
memory and he just do quick cards yes
I've seen it go away
yeah back to the topic because I did I
diverted a little bit we want to save
our spine we want to have a right
posture when you are working
how can functional programming help with
that let's see this is how we should sit
at work it's eight strict requirements
which would all be followed frankly who
does that I can spend about when I try I
spend about 20 seconds in this position
then inevitable like pretty much
everybody does something like this this
is common typing position for the
software developer which is actually
horrible from our to PD point of view
because it kills the spine here
so if you keep doing this for several
years you end up really like something
like this like stiff corner and if we
read the code which is we also do will
actually spend more time reading and
writing we often do something like this
which is even worse okay so what would
you like to do what is the good for
position for our health
well a good position is when we are
thinking about code and it's something
like this right spine is straight we are
relaxed
we are not stressed out we are thinking
someone else gets just out in between
several managers because most of them
with some notable exceptions cannot for
the life of them understand that this is
what we do our work this is when we are
the most productive right it's the most
important moment you know daily job to
think about stuff not disease okay but
we cannot help with that
the managers have to manage their stress
levels themselves
where was I yeah so our goal is to spend
as much time as possible in this posture
right okay let's see right as I said we
do we spend more time reading than
writing and we have to understand the
code so now what does it mean to
understand anything to understand means
to build a psychologists call it concept
network it is a mental model we have
inside our heads which is built of
concepts and relations so for example
this is a concept network that a
two-year-old kid could build around the
concept of a car so car there's fuel
that goes into a car car does groom and
carries people somewhere else that's
having figured out this nut the kid can
pretty much say it knows what car is all
about but now then then the kid can
start thinking about it so for example
without any further input I need any
more observations he already know that
he was going to a car okay I guess the
cars need the fuel right because that is
fuel in the car or over and over again
so the fuel does it need to be there it
has to be it is used by the car so our
kid did some thinking and extended it
concept network by one more relation and
this actually was thinking is it is
building rebuilding the concept network
creating new concepts creating new
relations destroying relations or
concepts with proof to which we finally
found out to be wrong right ho well the
concepts come from well you have a
stream of input and some of the input
turns into concept we have to isolate
the concept and store it will start with
storage we have our memory is built of
two layers I mean it doesn't mean it
physically built like this because we
don't know how it is wired inside but it
doesn't matter and it works as if it was
built physically like that in this is
budino forever
there's a working
which is sort of left input buffer
everything that goes into our head goes
to working memory so it is very high
throughput it's very small and there's a
lot of experiments to figure out how big
or how small are working memories and
it's estimated to be still like between
five to ten digits so this is really
tiny that's how much we can hold in our
head like random information and stress
not a whole seriously impair working
memory by the way and this associative
memory which is not that efficient but
it's persistent in this huge capacity
like real infinite it's like many people
can run it's like running many people
can run one mile there are people who
ride who run marathons there are people
from ultra marathons like hundred miles
but we know that nobody ever will run
thousand miles at one go this is not the
case with memory there is no known limit
to it so actually there's no nothing
that would prevent someone from
memorizing complete works of William
Shakespeare Rossum
right right so this is the picture the
to the lowest rate there's a lot of
input coming in like you hear me talking
you check something on your smart form
you feel that the seat is hard
you smell coffee whatever everything
goes to work in memory and nearly
everything is immediate flash to denote
it just goes away unless we pick up
something that we care about and we
build an association I mean let's flash
to associative memory and it stays there
for a long time sometimes forever a good
association is something that is
familiar and that is triggers and
emotions for example if I tell you 75
it's just a random number it's nothing
but if you happen to know that this was
actually the bar of the main gun of a
Sherman tank Danny this is something and
it surprised you
so to get some emotions and you can
remember it and probably next year if
you go to lamda days and someone
mentions my talk
chances are the only thing you will
event there will be 75 it's like another
story about memories like trying to
memorize a phone number like you are
somewhere you mean someone you would
like to meet again and upon PI upon
leaving us could you be my phone your
phone number yes it's six eight seven
five eight three eight six one call me
late car call me tomorrow bye and then
they you are frantic is trying to repeat
the number over and over again to
memorize it but is nine digits yet it
just about the size of your working
memory and there's any distraction gone
so much for the romance but if you think
about it like this
68 Woodstock Festival 75 is the number
that do those lamda days was talking
about then you have a snowman on a
Sherman tank then we had a note computer
and then we have a pipe to flush it out
to working memo to associative memory
what was the phone number again I bet
half of you could could could recall it
now so we have a stream of input again
and I have one digit which is in
betweens nothing we have another which
means nothing you have another this is
something this is an my first PC when I
have trouble installing civilization
five or whatever this is concept is
association bang there it is so this is
how all the minimal techniques are
builder now why am I talking about it
since our reading called revisited this
is another example this is Python again
this is all coming this time and this
again there are two pieces of code they
do the same thing but
what actually is this code doing if you
try to figure out it's purely imperative
it reads something from a file starts an
array they does something to some part
of it listen it catches an exception
change into an integer appends to
something that is append to something
else and so on so on so on you are
trying to understand what this company
does so we are trying to stitch together
some concepts so that you can store them
right but it's not easy because there's
like doesn't line so it's it's bigger
than your working memory so there you
are frantically trying to jump in up and
down your eyes trying to put it together
it's not easy you get stressed out you
will you waste time you lose your health
now look at this what does this code do
well opens file folds lines by executing
pastro check then our single all means
filtering string and mapping something
on it
right what are turning it into integers
right how do we make an integer well if
it's something if it's empty then it's
none if it's something that is something
what is it it's a concept network so the
point is that here you have to stitch
those elements together to put to build
a concept network well here it's ready
it's already laid out for you in the
code there's nothing more to do so you
have all the concepts you have
associations between them you have them
stored my point is that functional
programming is explicit about concepts
and I would go even further and I would
say that well imperative code is
organized by operation and functional
programming is organized by concept
which in those mad it's way easier to
understand now
you read the code we remember what it's
all about because we will a concert
Network now we have to understand the
code understanding mean a lot of
thinking because the leaf can be
mind-bogglingly complicated so now we
start thinking about the code and that
is what we aimed for from the very
beginning span it isn't it now so why is
functional programming better so my
theory is shucks I'll show you something
about theories this is a short story
about the driver that goes to a garage
and he said that it's Costin stops my
fear is that the steel got stuck and a
mechanic is seemingly outraged he says
you called this theory theory is a
collection of axioms rules of inference
and theorems derived from them fear is a
system not some stupid guesswork and
later on he keeps writing he thinks if
he's so smart why he cannot tell theory
from hypothesis so my hypothesis would
be that the functional programming is
better aligned the way our brain is
structured and that's why it's easier to
understand and easier to reason about
easier to work with sadly this is all
metal research done did a lot of reading
and their conclusions I derived from it
but there was no experiment that we
provide us with a hard proof that it
really is the case could we experiment
like this possibly there are a few ideas
being tossed around I've been talking to
some psychologists and we are
considering some ways to find a proof
for it it's not easy because which
language is most readable for for you
it's the one that you know best right
this is simple a snake so asking each of
you to read coatings certain
which will give us no good answer we can
make people read in a analyse code in
the language of its half of his choice
and see how they perform and do they get
stressed out or not but it's also tricky
there is another idea maybe we can turn
something that is written in natural
language to something
Frank's knowledge and see if it's not
more understandable for example this is
a beginning of a cooking recipe it's
purely imperative because this salad
recipes are written it and I don't know
about you but form is horrible I mean I
found I cannot read this it takes me
like a quarter of an hour to figure out
what I should really begin with what is
all about maybe I'm biased because I'm a
coder maybe not this will have to be
checked maybe if you write it like this
so that you know what you what you have
to start with and then it spit out in
subtask and you know how to do them it
tells you the relations between them
form it will be more readable I don't
know how about average person this is
something will have to be checked and
there's another research that would be
very interested interesting which means
answering a question why are you here
not I mean not only lambda days but also
functional programming in general is it
by accident or is it because you have
some personality trait that makes you
prefer this over something else it's
also tricky because it's it would need
the comparative research so we have to
make some questionnaire so in-depth
interviews with you guys and if somebody
on some Java conference or whatever will
see if if there is an interest in the
outcome of such research and if I can
get some funding if I can get some
psychologists to cooperate that I hope
maybe I'll be back next year if
somewhere
so it and this is about it we are you
already over time thank you very much
for your attention
