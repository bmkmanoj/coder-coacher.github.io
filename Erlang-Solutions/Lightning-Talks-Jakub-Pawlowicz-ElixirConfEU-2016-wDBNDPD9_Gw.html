for having me today so this is a very
trivial problem i stumbled upon one
evening and i wanted to get a list of
all the characters using user-provided
emails i have a database of users and i
wanted to find out which letters and
basically characters are used so i'm
coming from the object oriented language
so it means the metal chain is no longer
a thing so probably most of you could do
that in in Ruby so select all the emails
join them down case split sword and do
unique but also there are some questions
here like where the metal come from and
also what are the return types if you
are a seasoned ruby developer you know
that Joanne returns a string and split
an array but it's not the case in elixir
because we don't have metal chaining
because we to do it's a functional
language but fortunately we have been
yourself five operator so we can do
something like this in elixir and so we
can use actor to get the email addresses
and then join down page turn them to the
charities and finally sort and do a
unique but also we get something extra
here we get where the metals are defined
so if we don't know how the method works
we can go directly to the source because
all those methods like the modules are
defined or declared and also we
implicitly get the return types because
if we see that while we do an anom join
and the next line
the stream down case which means that
the previous nine get a string which is
very handy so thanks to everyone return
damn method chaining to something much
better thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
