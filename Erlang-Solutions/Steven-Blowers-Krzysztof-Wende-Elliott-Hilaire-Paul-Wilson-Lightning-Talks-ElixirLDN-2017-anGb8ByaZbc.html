my name's Steven blows I'm a software
development engineer at five my past
this lightening talk is going to be is
called creating a Microsoft sequel
server adapter for ecto 2.0 it's going
to briefly explore technology choices we
made to deliver fast and the developer
experience of creating an extra adapter
so I mentioned that we wanted to deliver
this product fast so we made two key
decisions on how the project one unfold
so firstly would only support sequel
server features that we needed and
secondly we would write as little code
as possible trying to compose existing
technologies where we could so this is
kind of how I kind of visualize the
problem we had so we're going to look at
some of the existing technologies we
used to bridge the gap between echo and
sequel server so currently Microsoft is
making moves to let the software be more
compatible with Linux and Mac OS so one
of the ways they've done this is with
the creation of the ODBC driver called
cig for sequel server so with that in
place we then looked for a pre-existing
library that we can use to talk to an
ODBC driver and we found that in the
form of Erlang ODBC which is part of the
open telecom platform so with those two
things in place we've gone from the
interpreter gap between ecto and sequel
servers binary format to a smaller gap
between ecto and the open telecom
platform so now begins where we actually
needed to write some code so we decided
to split our implementation into two
separate libraries one would be a
general-purpose alexa driver for working
of sequel server which encompassed all
of the ODBC stuff that I talked about
and the other would be an adapter
between that and echo
so the general elixir driver is called
MS sequel Oaks so after looking at
similar drivers like Postgres and sequel
light we knew a library called DB
connections where we should start
so dis library as a behavior module and
you can think of a behavior module as
similar to an interface class in
object-oriented programming DB
connection defines the set of behaviors
that if implemented through callbacks
provides an implementation for database
connections pools and transactions so we
kind of use it like a brew blueprint on
how we build our driver to
the functionality that we wanted so for
the most part after we had implemented
the callbacks we had a working elects a
driver for sequel server so next came
the ecto adapts of the way besides
called MSE galacto so I'm not going to
go into any detail on this part as I
think it's quite a well-documented
process and it's pretty similar
regardless of what ever database you're
going to connect to especially if it's
sequel based so instead I'm going to
point you to system usable resources
that we used for creating the adapter so
firstly there's this blog post called
Michael muscala no sorry by Michael
muscala called creating ACTU adapters
it's quite it's really good kind of
overview of what's involved in creating
an actual adapter secondly there's the
ecto adapter Docs which you can find in
modules
starting with ecto adapters and also
there's the extra integration tests
these are great because kind of from the
get-go we had this full set of tests
that we can use to help understand what
to do how to do it and kind of
understand that if whether we done it
correctly on up
so with MST galacto finished we were
able to communicate to our database with
echo and the project was a success so
whereas the project today so in terms of
hex downloads we've got about 5,000 hex
downloads between both of the packages
we are listed in the ecto readme as an
available adapter and as of Phoenix 1.3
if you run this command then you'll be
create a new Phoenix service using Emma
cigarette tow and Emma sequel acts so
where are we taking the project so at
the beginning I mentioned that we don't
fully support all the features of sequel
server so next comes fully full support
of sequel server
unfortunately the limiting factor is not
our libraries but it's our lingo do we
see so we'll be looking at trying to put
in some pull requests for that and any
help from the electoral island community
will be greatly appreciated in doing
that that's a talk his links to the
libraries thank you
my name is stuffed and tried to
pronounce it you probably might know me
from autocomplete elixir which has over
thirty thousand dollars right now and a
huge title project deprecated because of
drastic changes which did I showed you
from posting a lot of original issues a
lot of original issues so um I want to
present my latest project which is
alchemy recently known as Elm cami it's
a long story
so who of you is familiar with Alma
language okay so for those that don't
know Elm is like a Scottish language
that doesn't have type classes there's a
good article about scrap you'll scrub
your type classes about why it doesn't
have and why it doesn't need them so
alchemy is a compiler of maybe a
language if you will that compiles Elm
code to elixir code and the syntax is
the same the semantics are a little bit
different right now it has over 100
releases and it's pretty much ready so I
will do some live coding for you so
there is a lot of room from for me to
make a mistake so I will show you how
basically works this version is you can
access this version online it doesn't do
any type checking but the console
version does type checking so if I make
a mistake in here it doesn't mean that
the compiler will let me do it in my
editor there are only parsing errors
here so we can define our module which
is Alex from London 2017 on the right we
will see our compiled election code so
we can define a function joseph talk
which is an integer okay which is a
float
which was hundred 100 we can write a
documentation for it which would be ed
talk by Java okay one more thing it's a
comment not a doc so okay and elixir
converse is a module dock so basically
it has everything that Elm has right now
it doesn't have effect so you can write
an entire library in that ad plus a lot
of niceties like for example how do we
test called in elixir way tested by
writing oh the indentation is run by
writing duck tests you can write duck
tests inside our code you can define
your own operators
okay
you can okay so you can define your own
operator the operator can be anything
that that wouldn't even be allowed by
elixir so it can be really anything as
long as I can repeat it over there okay
that's impossible
yeah okay so you can also define types
which would be like for example the
types are tagged unions so if you're not
familiar with the term I recommend
looking up so we can we can have a type
elixir programmer which can be either
ruby let's say or elixir or lack and and
we can oh we can obviously use use these
types you can match on them let's say we
can use them in cases it's impossible in
this time
okay this is not a proper code so you
can see that if a case is the same is
the case course is the same as the
argument it will spit it to an over
overridden heads overloaded so okay I'm
not gonna make it there is a lot there
is a lot to it all of the features of
our that aren't related to effects all
right now implemented you can do almost
everything everything is carried you can
just do stuff like like map list and it
all will work you can also do my plus
one everything that works in elm it will
work in here I really recommend checking
out none of this one alchemy hello I'm
Elliott I make sheep games in my spare
time and I want your help in the next
two minutes I'd like to get everyone to
go on the Wi-Fi and go to woolen socket
stop her echo out I want to see as many
sheep on here as I can get I've only
seen three sheep max before so this is
an experiment and I don't know how it's
going to go
I have no idea what's gonna happen when
we get more if it'll stop or yeah if
it'll be able to cope so it's made with
Phoenix using channels and a game
library called phaser there's four four
main events that happen there's a player
can join leave that player needs to send
a new position and there's also the need
to well that's my thing broadcast copy
of the world all the other players so
once I got the channels working then
then it was a bit of an exercise to try
and make things a bit more efficient so
I wanted to talk a bit how I managed to
split up the world and then optimize it
so that the right amount of messages
were being sent around so we've got four
basic types of strokes
we've got velocity which has an x and a
y position which has an x and a y a
player which is made up of an ID
position and velocity and then a world
that indexes is a map well it contains
things that index everything by the ID
and that gets broadcasted to everyone so
we have an agent and a gen server the
agent holds the state of the world and
every time you make a move it's going
well every time you move your client is
going to send its position positions
which updates the state in the agent and
this only happens if you've actually
moved if you haven't done anything then
no traffic is sent and then we also have
a world broadcaster which is a gen
server and this reads from the agent the
state of the world and if the state of
the world has changed then it will
broadcast a message out to all of the
clients this is kind of pretty cool I
think because it means that the two
things are entirely detached and the gen
server is ticking over and sending out
the state of the world and a set
sequence which matches up with the game
library so that's pretty much my talk if
you like this sort of thing I'd like to
talk to you afterwards yeah it was just
a learning experiment and I'm glad that
there's lots of sheep there sorry thank
you
so a funny thing happened on the way to
the conference and they wanted to be to
put another thing together to have
understand well that's not much happened
anyway well it's time we'd have to rush
with pies won on a biathlon bot you know
biathlon ski skeet shooting voice like
biathlon a pot from the skiing and the
shooting and the other one being that
being the target and they could talk to
each other over the over the network I
like to use umbrella apps who knows
projects nice we do with umbrella apps
in those projects is to have one
application being you're nervous bit
which which is the phone were a bit and
all your the code isn't notes related at
all it's just it'll just pull it in and
you can pull your firmware in that one
place this time I had two separate
things I thought well let's just have
one umbrella project two things what
could go wrong got the one thing working
the Senate got a sense of working first
which which you shoot out and goes beep
and in sense of things that worked fine
then I got the thing for control for the
robot work running put it on the browser
pi didn't happen
Louis application what's the thing for
this analysis in your open applications
probably open application something like
starting applications nothing have been
started what was going wrong well config
bootloader in those is the thing which
loads replication on when when it boots
and this is how you this is how its
configured config bootloader goes out
most configuration loads it from Bradley
projects by default as somebody said it
wasn't a question it was a comment a bit
of a problem with umbrella things is the
tend to show the show the configuration
and so the last one was winning the bot
thought it was a sensor sensor
application wasn't though didn't work
this is a pet that as the loading one
thing could do is realize that this
mixed file is just them it's just an exs
file and you can change all that stuff
so you could just say let's not do the
another thing or just do a joke on fake
but then you'd have to put the same
config in both place here is a bit of
hassle I've done this last minute it's
Tuesday evening it was eleven o'clock
who can be bothered with that another
thing to do is realize that it's all
elixir and all this stuff in in though
it's available to you and you can use it
you can put your own thing in there and
it's still available to you makes the
conflicts loaded when mixes run and it's
it's loaded from free and it slowly from
the mixed file you're running it from so
this is that so when you're in the bot
firmware this one runs when your sense
of film work the other one runs Dada so
in the product project msconfig
use it fantastic I did actually take
about three hours to work out but no
bonus could use it somewhere else so I
want to when we bind with the notes
gotta talk to each other need to bind
something to address of all there's no
DNS binding to the IP address but I
don't know the IP address in a fan skits
DHCP so receive the DHCP event under and
do it dynamically what node name are
going to use and then you get to the
slide I don't know why tada you can if
you can define it by config array I'm
not going to tell you how it broke ass I
think it's horrible
I'm a director you know that even
understand how it works not to cuss UDP
who knows does I mean though I could
talk yeah okay I'll talk to you later
I mean was a group anyway anyway that's
me I'm done
