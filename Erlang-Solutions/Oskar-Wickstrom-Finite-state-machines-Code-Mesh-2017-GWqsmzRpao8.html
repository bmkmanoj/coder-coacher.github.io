so I'm Oscar and as bill said I'm
working as a script developer for a
company called empowered today I'm gonna
talk a bit about finite state machines
and kind of what your compiler can help
you with
or more specifically what your type
system can help you with and this is the
sort of trip we will be making today
so I generated this nice fantasy map to
to make you very interested and we'll
start down in the valley of programmer
death and escape the land of implicit
state through a DTS and go through the
side effects enter a safe harbor of MTL
style and pick up some type classes
travel through index monads and we will
cross the value type level boundary into
the land of idris where we will
eventually sell down on the types of
shores and reflect on our journey yeah
so this will be a fast-paced tour I have
a lot of stuff to show you
and I hope I don't keep it from lunch
too too much okay and yeah I hope I can
inspire to learn more because there are
a lot of paths to take care and stuff to
check out so first off we'll talk a bit
about state and a stateful program is
one that remembers its previous events
and we call that memory the program
state it may transition to other states
based on what it's seen before a one
problem with save for programs is
implicit state and with implicit I mean
that the program does not explicitly
define the set of legal states and state
may be scattered across many variables
all over the place and you can really
follow the the program in what state it
kind of transitions between without
reconstructing that knowledge from all
those variables and you might do
runtime checking in a certain that
you're in a state because you you have
to be sure
so instead instead we can make state
explicit which makes it more clear how
we transition between states and how
they are constructed and it can make
stateful programming less error-prone
now one technique is finite state
machines so with finite state machines
we model a program as an abstract
machine which has a finite set of states
and the machine is in one state at a
time events trigger state transitions
and from each state there's the set of
legal transitions expressed as
associations from events to other states
and many of you have surely heard of
finite state machines before in some
sense or have a relation to them and
yeah there there are a lot of different
takes and and ways to look at this so
for this talk we will use this simple
model that I've stolen from the Erlang
documentation and since there are a
bunch of Erlang programmers here I think
at this conference I'm trying to to get
a good start here so let's use that and
it says if we are in state s and event E
occurs we should perform the actions a
and make a transition to state s prime
so it's it's very simple and even if
this looks like a function up there
we won't this is like the conceptual
model we won't necessarily write
everything as a big function from a pair
of state an event to actions and another
state so this is our definition and we
won't be talking much about like million
more machines in the strict sense we
won't be doing hierarchical state
machines we won't use guards on
transitions and I won't go crazy in
doing a lot of UML state chart stuff so
don't be afraid
what we will do is to model the set of
legal states and events as data types
and preferably we will use Haskell and
in this way we will have each state will
have its own value constructor
and you can do this or similar things in
most mainstream languages as well so we
will start by encoding using algebraic
data types this is the example I want to
use for for most of my most of my code
coming up so this is a like a shopping
cart checkout flow you've probably seen
these before and this is one of the kind
of canonical examples of state machines
at a business process level the checkout
begins with having no items and then one
or more items can be added after that
you can start to checkout and all the
states in this big box called checkout
can be canceled from so that's what this
is really the hierarchical notation but
yeah so you can you can cancel from any
of those three states in box we start by
selecting a card going from no card to
card selected and then we confirm it and
then eventually we place the order in
which we have reached the terminal state
so this is a bit simplified but it will
illustrate some of the points I want to
make this is our state data type and it
has one constructor for each valid state
and some of them are nolley which means
they have no arguments also known as
constants and some of them have
arguments like non-empty list of cars
items and when we can accumulate state
we get more stuff so we end up having a
card and in the end we just have order
placed the events are also data type and
similar thing going on here some have an
arguments sometimes so one one
constructor for each event in our first
attempt of implementing this would be
perhaps a function like this saying that
a finite state machine is a function
from state to event to state and we
parameterize that by SNe so state and
event types and then we go on to define
checkout and yeah this doesn't look too
bad
is very similar to like the definition
from from Erlang that we looked at and
we can pattern match on the current
state and the event and do some decision
so there we have our transition function
so to speak and the problem is in our
case that we with this with this setup
we cannot interleave any side-effects in
between when we transition from one
state to another we can't have side
effects B because this is a pure
function or could be at least but let's
say that this is a pure function but we
instead say that we need a impure
function so we we have a state machine
be a function from state and event to IO
of state and now we can perform side
effects and on state transitions so
let's rewrite this
check out thing with the impure of some
instead the first pattern match creates
a non-empty list with the first item the
second one just absent item to the list
so on then there is a bunch of more I'm
not going to show you and the last one
will given that we have some some way of
charging in the card with this payment
provider thing we can do a side effect
and then we can return the terminal
state so how would you run this thing a
very simple Runner could look like this
running pure takes an impure episome
initial state a list of events and
returns the terminal state in IO and the
definition is really just fold in very
simple we could easily decorate it with
stuff like logging so this function
takes an FSM returns another exam what
it does is it runs to the one it took
and logs its transition and returned
that state so when we run this starting
from no items and with these events in
the list we might see this I this this
is the output we will see and my
implementation of the payment provider
just prints charging some amount so here
we see that the side effect is
interleaved between the
transitions to summarize this part we
have explicit states and explicit events
using data types we can provide stuff
like standardized runner logging metrics
we might instead of having a list of
events we might use the pipe library or
conduit or what have you some other way
of kind of feeding the events in but one
problem is that transitions are coupled
with with Eyal currently which with that
we can't test the sake machine in a pure
setting so that might become a problem
and while illegal states can't be
constructed because we have our data
types
illegal transitions between states can
be made so we can make an a mistake in
our in our implementation and do a an
invalid transition between states and
the compiler wouldn't be angry about
that so could we get some more
flexibility around testing and could we
get some stronger guarantees about our
program actually following our model so
we're gonna use MTL style as it's known
and we're going to use associated types
so this is like an kind of extension to
MDL style for state machines we will
write our state machine in this MTL
style which you will see soon we will
have these extra conventions for state
machines which I'll describe and with
this we can combine it with the stuff
like monad transformer regular monitors
former stuff like error handling and
logging and so on and we can build
higher-level state machines out of
lower-level ones so we get some
composition out of this you might
explore using extensible effects or free
Mona's or something else but I've chosen
to do this with MDL file and we start
out writing a type class which encodes
the state machine transitions and it's
events and each event is represented as
a method in the tie class where the
current state is passed as a value
to that event and that event returns the
resulting state the state type is
abstract using an Associated type alias
and this is so in our kind of model or
attack class we don't know the concrete
state ID we write a program depending on
this type fast and then the type test
and the program together caniforms our
state machine then we need an instance
to run the state machine program and
actually have some side effect so the
instance perform state transition side
effects it's the one actually doing like
charging the card the instance chooses
the concrete data type for the state so
the instance can have its particular
implementation details going on inside
the state that gets passed around
without the abstract problem knowing
anything about that and we can write
these instances for testing like
instances that are free from side
effects so we define our states as empty
data types in this model instead these
these data types have no constructors so
there are no values inhabitant OHS types
and we will write our check out type
class which will contain all the events
and their state transitions and it has
this Associated type state of M which
has kind start to star how many know the
the kind of the star to star notation
and kinds in Haskell okay a bunch so if
you don't know what this is you can
think of it as like a type level
function and describing this type
constructor taking so star is basically
type so it's a function from type to
type and so the state of M will be some
type constructor with one argument now
let's look at some of these methods in
the check out class initial gives us
just a starting state it doesn't do
anything
than that here we see this associated
type being used so it's parameterised by
one of these empty types that we have
four states in this case it's no items
some events are very simple they
transition from exactly one state to
another
so confirm goes from card selected to
card
confirmed some events are more
complicated so if you remember from the
diagram I show you both no items and has
items except a select event it's the
same same name for coming from two
states the same event being accepted but
two states so we have to pass in either
one of those states to sorry we have two
to pass in either one of those source
states to the Select event and we could
use either the either type for this but
I think it would be more clear if we
create a specialized type for for this
purpose so select state has one
constructor for each choice these are
one constructor for each state you can
come from when you do select and yeah we
pass such a select state value to select
along with the cart item and then we go
to house items then there are three
states accepting the canceled event the
either type would be even worse now
because then we'd have to start nesting
them and no let's not do that so we
write a new data type called cancel
States which has three constructors each
form for each valid state to come from
and we passed that in the same manner to
cancel this is the complete type class
with all its methods and to show you how
it corresponds to the diagram I've just
put it on top so they're very similar in
what they say you can imagine generating
this diagram from typeless somehow and
now we will write our program using this
High Pass so fill cart constraints m2b
monad with the check out and I
operations so I should point out that
I'm used actually using IO in this
abstract program as well just to kind of
drive it forward you could factor that
out if you want to make it fully
testable but I've tried to keep it as
simple as possible and only have the
state machine be abstract in this
example so the type signature says that
this transitions from no items to house
items so and the definition asked for an
item and selects that and you can note
here how we wrap the state in the
appropriate no items select constructor
to get a select state value and finally
fill part hands over to select more
items and that signature says that it
remains in the house I team state its
definition ask the user do you want one
more item if so select that and then
recursive with keeps on spinning here if
the user doesn't want any more items
then we return the state we have start
checkout type signatures as a transition
from has items to order placed and that
much is kind of what we have so far we
ask for a card and for a confirmation
and you can see it here in this do
notation that as soon as we transition
state we get a new state back and we
have to start using that instead so we
kind of swapped the old state for a new
one and start using that passing that
into the next event and so on and as
these state values their types are we
they're using the associative type so we
don't know the concrete type which means
we can construct these states and kind
of cheat our way through onto the end we
have to form all the steps and in the
end if the user confirmed we place this
order so and if the if they did confirm
we cancel and we go back to possibly
slightly more items resorting checkout
and on and on this is the main program
starting the whole thing it creates a
checkout flow runs it and then ends it
and what we get back is like the
Magnetic return value that's
order ID and so far we have only seen
the abstract part of the program and we
need an instance as well so we only
depend on this check out that class and
together this program that I've shown
you using the Tatar class and the type
as kind of form the state machine like
the model or the abstract part how it
how it will run but we haven't actually
done any side effects yet so we need
this instance to check out to perform
the side effects and it will also be say
decide this concrete stay type it will
perform a appropriate effect at each
transition and we will run this - to run
the checker program using this instance
first I'll show you the concrete stay
type this is a bunch of code don't don't
be scared I'm using a gadget here that's
a generalized algebraic data type so it
has a parameter S which we can we can
parameterize it differently with the
different constructors so each
constructor here maps to one state and
they they if you see no items here
that's not the same as you know no items
on the left to the constructor name no
items isn't the same thing as no items
to type no items the type is that empty
type that we created way back so here we
can a link this concrete constructor for
this type to that empty that the data
type from before and this creates like a
mapping between these constructors and
associate the type class the associated
type and our empty empty state types so
it's a bit confusing perhaps but you
will see how they come together assume
and you may be you don't see explicitly
here but the check out state has kind of
star to star so that matches associated
type in in the
class given that we have this new type
check out T this is like the MTL stuff
you just have to do when a bunch of
deriving and boilerplate then we can
create an instance and here it comes
they're kind of tying things together
part
so check out T is an instance of check
out and we say that the state type for
this instance for check out T is the
check out state data type to get it that
I showed even before so here we kind of
link everything together and say when we
run this the concrete type will be this
galets so I'll show you a bunch of these
methods or the implementation of these
methods so initial just returns no items
no side effects select prepense an item
to a new or existing list depending on
where we came from and notice how we
work with our concrete data table here
those no items and has items that's the
Constructors from the gedit and we don't
have to handle any mismatches we don't
have to say like okay and if state isn't
one of these two then we have to abort
or whatever because the DHG HC will know
from the Garrett and the associated type
that this this parent match is or this
this case expression is exhaustive so
that's kind of nice place order
generates an order ID it calculates some
price and charges the card finally
returning the terminal states so here we
do some some side effects we run this
after at check our program using run
check out T and we end up in i/o and
yeah just print something we could write
other instances for testing that won't
charge a customer cards and one thing
you might be asking like we have only
driven this program by user input but
you might have stuff like timeouts and
whatnot so I'll show you a quick example
of doing timeouts as well so the example
is similar to the checkout but it
friend little twist so we here this is
like a flight booking where we select
the flight first and then select the
seat and the seat ends up being reserved
for five minutes then after five minutes
it times out and going to see it
released unless the booking has been
cancelled or the seat has been paid for
in those cases we end up in terminal
states if the reservation timed out we
can either cancel the booking or restart
with the flight selected so with then we
can go back to just having the flight
and we start over like before we use
these empty data types for the states we
model multiple states accepting events
with specialized data types for that
that's the same as before and the entire
class looks like this there is really
nothing new going on here from what I've
shown you before except that it's a
different domain so I won't go through
all these again these are events and
their state transitions now let's look
at this flight booking program don't
worry about this Mona based control that
came in it's just some plumbing that I'm
using for doing the actual time out this
program is the entry point so we're
starting top-down and we start by
selecting a flight number and then we
pass over to web flight selected in with
flight selected we select the seat then
we start the time out for the
confirmation - - to actually buy the
seat in a real system we probably
wouldn't just ask the user do want to
buy and then they have their their
ticket but we'd start a real checkout
flow but I've tried to keep it simple
and we wait for an answer for this this
time out and it can have won three
different state values sorry so just
true means that we got an answer and
that it was a confirmation a positive
confirmation I want to buy this ticket
so we transition into seat booked and
end the booking just false means that
the garments are saying I do not want to
buy
ticket and so we cancel the reservation
and end the booking and nothing means
that we got no answer in time so the
reservation timed out we transition to
seek released and asks if the user want
to restart and if they want to restart
we do that and recurse if not we cancel
and end the booking to summarize what we
have seen so far with MTL style we have
modeled our safe machines using these
type classes and MTL style we have used
associated types for states we've used
explicit state values passed and
returned from these events methods and
we have written part of our state
machine as an abstract program depending
on the type class not as a big function
from state and event to state we are
using instances for side-effects
this is stricter than the ADT based
version in that we don't only encode the
valid States we also encode the valid
state transitions but it isn't
necessarily safe because state values
can be reused or discarded and
side-effects can just be re performed
illegally which isn't good there is
nothing even transition even enforcing a
transition to the terminal State we can
just not do anything more and the
compiler wouldn't know so an example of
reusing state values would be this here
we first pay for the seat and the chart
some money and then we discard that
resulting state then we pay again taunt
the user a bit and end the booking and
this is probably not in our business
model and wouldn't it be good if the
compiler would be angry at this point so
one solution here would be to use
something like linear types to ensure
that a state value is used exactly once
but we won't be talking about linear
types today instead we're gonna move
this state value inside the Mona
so the Mona will carry the state and in
in that in that way we won't have to
pass around these explicit values
everywhere so the previous example would
look like pay twice here where we pay
for a seat and then we pay for a seat
again and then we get a type error
because something is not correct here we
have yeah we've done a double booking
sort of week to accomplish this we need
to parameterize the Monad a bit more
than before we have to do we have to
index it as it's known so we use state
types as parameters to the monad in
addition to the return value this is
called index monads and as the name
suggests it's a mana that is indexed and
it's indexed by two type parameters
input and output this can be seen as the
type before and after in this
computation and the type class looks
like this it's also an IX applicative it
doesn't matter too much but the IX monad
is some M that has the type k2 k2 start
to start
sorry it's a kind k2 k2 start to start
and the K here the case means that it
could be any kind and the two stars are
types so it says like can you the m
takes two indices of any kind and the
type does a return value and gives you
back a type so to explain this index
monad hopefully quickly I will compare
it to bind from monad so this is a
regular magnetic bind how many here know
kind of how this works okay very good
then I might pull this off
so this is dangerous area okay I'll put
I bind below here and that's the index
monitor bind so we add a bunch of
indices IJ j k and i k here
in the kind of slots that didn't have
them before and okay so what's going on
here if we add some colors and arrows we
see this very clearly the input of the
first magnetic value is the input of the
resulting magnetic value that's a red
arrow from eye to eye the output of the
second magnetic value is the output of
the resulting magnetic value that's the
blue arrow okay and the J is like the
intermediate index that's a green arrow
so this is like the magnetic bind but
the indices might remind you of function
composition so if you compose two
functions they kind of meld together and
the intermediate type in between goes
away and get one bigger function so to
speak
so this is I bind again different
formatting to show you how we will use
it or how you can use it
I'll specialize this type to two states
instead so if we swap these variables
for some state types we have this
instead so one action from state 1 to 2
1 from 2 to 3 and the result is all the
way from 1 to 3 and one big chunk and
the last example here we use two of our
transition from the check out example so
we have check out and select card and if
we bind those together we get one big
transition from has items to card
selected so we hide the state value and
only the state type is visible in this
magnetic value this index value and we
cannot evaluate these computations twice
unless the type permitted and kind of
lines up oh sorry ok so in pure script
now comes a pure state part pure script
has this row kind which is really neat
you can think of this it's kind of a
type level record and the reason why I'm
using pre or script theory is Haskell
does not have this so let's use proof
tip for for this example
and okay roll kinds are like type level
records so here we have a row of one
filled out type file and one of n with a
socket this is a closed row and they can
also be polymorphic so in the second
example we see a row that has at least
out and in and possibly more in this our
row variable and these can be used and
these are used in impure script for as
indices for record types and for effects
so here we construct a record type using
a row and that's the same as the
syntactic sugar below sorry that's the
same type and say we want to use these
row types for state machines instead oh
I think I missed a slide but yeah the
problem is if you if I go back and
that's the missing flight sorry I should
say is first
okay the index Mona's that I shown you
before they describe one state machine
you know you go from one state to
another and that makes it very hard to
compose so we might want to have
multiple state machines going on in one
program and one computation so some
examples are opening two files then you
have if you see a file as a small state
machine and you want to copy stuff from
one file to another you have to two
state machines living at the same time
really and you might write a program
like a ticket machine using card reader
and a printer or yeah whatever so what
we want to do is to have a type that
maps from names to States then we can
have many state machines going on at the
same time and use that kind of mapping
as the index instead so these named
state machines can be independent and we
applied events to them by name is that
and now we come to this part where we
need these row types that are explained
in the wrong order and okay so here we
say if we have these MS we say that
these these are index monads and in the
first example initial we go from having
some row to having a row with my image
added to it so this kind of creates a
new state machine value or resource the
second example
transitions from my machine having state
1 to my machine having state 2 and the
third example transitions or deletes
machine that in its terminal state so it
goes from a row with that my machine
terminal state to a row without it then
you could have a type signature
requiring that each state machine
resource is removed or like that we have
went to the terminal state so this type
same signature
run ix machines has two empty rolls
that's it parens and then we have to
clean up and can I go all the way
through there are some libraries
implementing this and now I'm gonna
shamefully show links to two of my own
libraries but the first one is a control
Sdn Idris which is not my library but I
will show this shortly and the other
ones are one for pure script that I've
been tinkering with and the other one is
for Haskell trying to bring down the
control st ideas into high school so if
you want to learn more about these index
Mona's in general you can check out this
blog the Kranks Haskell blog the Haskell
package called indexed you can also use
do notation with the index models if
you're really daring and you can combine
this with session types which kind of
goes back to Chris force talk from being
before so for the last part I will make
a bit of an adventure and go into
dependent types in addressed just to
this is like the craziest part that you
can go for so yeah idris it's not
concurrent they're not currently
recommended to use for anything like
critical do you won't be basing your
business on areas right now I think and
as Chris Ford I think I mentioned it's a
hipster programming language so gotta
use that and we can use some cool ideas
from idiots and can I bring them to
Haskell or where
pure script perhaps so with dependent
types we can make some of these aspects
around safe machine state machine
implementations more concise we can have
better expressed at multiple states
except in events we can do a nicer error
handling and we can have dependent state
types and this control SVG library
implements this for address and it also
had this has this notion of named
resources but you won't be naming your
resources yourself you get like an
unique identifier that you can use to
refer to to some resource in your
computation context and if you like this
sort of stuff you should read this
implementing state aware systems in
address the SD tutorial this is very
good and even if you don't know a lot of
a dress you can probably follow along
here so I recommend that ok for this it
read stuff we will use our check out
example again but we will change it
slightly just to deleverage more idris
magic we will merge the no items in
house item state into one state has
items which has this extended n natural
number so really if you think about it
no items and house items is like there's
almost like an app in itself so we can
just have one state with with the not
saying how many items do we have and we
can start at 0 so selecting one more
item increments that n and when we check
out it has to be greater than 0 we start
by writing this namespace for our
protocol and most of these things are
like aliases for Strings like an item is
a string and the card is the string and
so on and items of n is a vector of n so
it's a known length list basically our
state is a union type in any race and
you see here the net can flows through
all the states until the end so we
always know how many items we have
the checkout interface has a state type
as well this is very if perhaps reminds
you of the associate the type from the
MTL style and it's parameterised that
that state type is parameterize by check
out state and gives you back a type so
very much like that associate the type
in this in this interface we have
initial which is an ST that's from the
library so this operation adds the has
items of zero state and returns U of R
that you can use to to refer to this
resource that's been created select
takes a bar and adds an item and you see
in the type signature that we go from
having n items to having the successor
of n items that is one more item and
checkout takes a bar and the transition
goes from has items of at least one
that's s of n to the no card state of
the same amount of items so we keep keep
track of this number of items as we go
along like before we have free states
accepting counsel so in address we can
express this using a predicate over
States which is basically saying to the
color of this operation please give me a
proof that your current state accepts
cancel so then we won't be using like a
special data type that we wrap it in
manually but we will instead have this
predicate at the like the type level but
yeah everything is kind of the same
level in address
so this data type says that okay a
Council States is parameterised by check
out state and a bunch of or account of
how many items you have and it gives you
back a type and their heirs one
constructor for each valid canceled
state so here we use our valid valid
States as parameters and we linked those
Nats together saying like if you're in
no card and
the amount of items you have is M and in
the council operation we asked eateries
using this Auto keyword - can you give
us a proof that the state s because in
the operation we take any state s give
us a proof that this state s is a
countable state and which when we cancel
from it has n items so the operation
goes to has items event so this is why
the number of items has to be tracked
all the way through because we have to
go back in a non state so instead of
showing you the implementation of this
checkout protocol I will just show you a
program using it and select more it's a
function that selects one more item and
it depends on this type level not to
print a nice message like do you want it
add your first item or one more and yeah
it selects one item check out with items
goes from having from from house items
to order placed or it stays in house
items if the checkout is canceled so you
see this type level thing here or else
where the the type of this transition
depends on the results and the result is
the return value which is a boolean so
or else switches on true/false basically
so if everything went well and we did
check out then we end up in order placed
otherwise we still have just have items
so we asked for a credit card and
eventually we place the order and in
between all those steps we we ask the
user do you want to continue or do you
want to cancel that's the longer lines
and there I'm using some address
notation to kind of short-circuit out of
the denotation if if they want to cancel
but the cool thing here is that we
couldn't do this continuer cancel in any
other place than these free places
because we couldn't construct a proof
anywhere else
check out or chop removes resource in
state has items it will try to check out
with items and complete the checkout
flow but if the user cancels it will
loop using go shopping in go shopping we
select one more item then we ask if the
user want to check out if not we go
shopping again and these two functions
that I've shown these last two functions
they can I go back and forth in until
the user has made a purchase and the
program is started like this and you can
note that all all of these functions are
total which is a cool thing because if
you want to convince your boss that you
want to use a dress at work you can say
that you can prove that you use those
users will end up in the checkout and
buy your that's nice anyway to to
have total functions that loop we need
to use this run loop forever and the
printing of oops we there is one partial
value here it's forever and if we run
out of foreverness we print oops
so to summarize all this implicit state
is is hard and unsafe and just going the
the one step to making states explicit
with the data structure is the big win
really consider doing that and you can
lift more information to the type and
get more safety if you want you can do
this in house : pure script and whatnot
and you can steal cool ideas from other
languages so do look at the address and
and linear type somewhat not to to be
inspired and as usual it's no silver
bullets don't rewrite everything like
this and don't hold me accountable for
anything basically but yeah the main
takeaway is to reify your designing code
and keep exploring thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
