professor at Delft University of
Technology in the Netherlands and it's
my job to keep you awake for the rest of
this hour that the conference still
lasts so I hope I will at least succeed
in doing that and I want to talk about
teaching programming because in my job
as a university professor half of the
time I'm teaching university students to
program and on the other half of my
university days and do scientific
research and my research is also about
teaching is about how to teach young
children elementary school-age children
programming so it's fair to say that I
spent most of my time in doing education
or thinking about education and in this
talk I want to share some of my insights
with you but first a quiz it's a good
way to keep you awake
who said this who said everyone should
learn programming any guesses Steve Jobs
Bill Gates other guesses thank you yes I
like to thank every programmer ever s a
bit I mean I said it and I'm sure a
bunch of you have also said everyone
should learn programming you know we
love programming so sure kids should
also do programming but this of course
brings a very interesting question with
it and that question is what is
programming what do we say if we say
everyone should learn programming it's
not an easy question it's not as easy as
you might think if you ask 10
programmers what programming is maybe
you will get 10 different answers over
real programming means to people and
this is especially hard the question of
what is programming because we as
programmers as professional programmers
we are programming all the time and that
gives us a certain perspective on what
programming is it reminds me of this
joke of three fishes maybe you'd know it
there is one big fish he's swimming and
he runs into two other fishes and he
says hey fishies how's the water and the
two little fishies say what's water they
don't know what water is because the
only thing
no it's water they're always swimming in
water so they don't know that there's a
difference between everything and water
they don't know that they could be
yanked out of water and looking in the
water and that wouldn't be a very
pleasant experience for them in a sense
this is also how many programmers think
about programming at least this is how I
thought about programming for a long
time the only thing I knew was
programming the only community I knew
was programming and that gives you a
certain view on programming so for the
first part of my talk I want to share
with you my story into what I see as
programming and how that has changed
over the years so we have to go back in
time until to the Year year 2008 when I
moved from it--over where I did my
master's degree to Delft where I was
going to do a PhD and our country is
tiny so this move is about 150
kilometers so probably for you that's
nothing but for someone from a tiny
country this is a big move and I went to
Delft to do a PhD at tu Delft University
of Technology and the research question
for my dissertation was this my
supervisor had the idea I minds to build
a DSL a domain-specific language
specifically for Finance so a
programming language but not for
professional developers but for people
in finance insurance people bankers to
write their own programs so that they
don't need a programmer for everything
so this is more or less what we
envisioned a programming language that
was easy enough for people that weren't
trained as professional program
programmers to express their business
rules so I went out to do a small
internship at a Dutch insurance company
and remember I just came out of school I
only had a master's degree I have never
worked in practice so my view of the
world was more or less days
this is what they told me University
there are programmers and there are
users and there's a big wall between
users and programmers they're a
different species they don't really mix
very well and sometimes you have to
listen to users a little bit to know
what you have to program and then
quickly you'll go back to programming
lands where you'll do some program
that's I'm not sure if they still teach
this in universities but that this is at
least the mindset that I grew up with
coming from you know
this image was quickly shattered running
around in this insurance company because
I figured out that it wasn't the case
that programmers program and he refused
they all program the programmers
programs and the user also programs all
the time however it wasn't how we
envisioned being in the ivory tower of
the university that the users programs
in a textual language expressing their
business rules all the users were
programming in spreadsheets they were
all using spreadsheets for everything
running risk models doing budgets doing
forecasting they were all programming in
spreadsheets so I went back to the
University and I said to my PhD
supervisors at a friend's they don't
need a DSL in finance they have a DSL in
finance and it's called Excel Excel is
an amazing programming language that
empowers normal people to do programming
in a variety of different domains in
finance so this became the motto of my
PhD dissertation spreadsheet our codes
spreadsheets are a valid means of
programming they are in a sense and I
say this with a little bit of humor but
also in full seriousness spreadsheets
are the best programming system that has
ever existed in the history of program
spreadsheets are such a good programming
language that people don't know that
they're programming
people will find you they will say oh no
I'm not programming I'm just making a
spreadsheet I'm just making a little
model but while of course they are
programming without even realizing it I
mean imagine doing Java by accident it's
like oh he Clips just showed up on my
machine then I open it up and it looked
very intuitive I'm friendly and I
immediately figured out how it works but
this is true for spreadsheets you can
open a spreadsheet then you can more or
less figure out how it works and you can
pick up programming skills as you go so
I I see it as I say in all seriousness
spreadsheets are an amazing programming
tool not only are they code they are
functional programming now we're at the
functional programming conference think
about it the only thing a formula in a
spreadsheet can do is take inputs from
other cells and calculate the results
based on those inputs a spreadsheet
formula is side-effect free by
definition it cannot access other cells
in the spreadsheet so it's functional
programming if you like buzzwords I have
another buzz words for you spreadsheets
are reactive programming you know you
update the formula I sell in the
spreadsheet and the other formulas that
depend on the cells they just update
it's a reactive functional programming
system and yet 750 million people can
use it without any issues eat that
Haskell it is functional programming for
the masses it is really a serious
programming language that enables lots
of people to do programming so again
this was the motto of my PhD
dissertation spreadsheets our code
however what I zoomed in on was the
issues around red sheets spreadsheets
don't really have the IDE support that
we are used to in professional language
development tools ideas usually have
support for refactoring for smell
detection for visualization and
spreadsheets don't really have that type
of support
well sometimes practice can need those
type of supports we've seen spreadsheets
that had 150 worksheets all interlinked
with formulas going everywhere and it
was very hard for people to figure out
how exactly it was structured and
whether it was structured well or not so
that is what I looked at in my
dissertation mainly I focused on the
idea code smells in spreadsheets so code
smells if your notes for where with
familiar with the concepts are parts of
programming that aren't necessarily a
bug but they aren't really structured
very well so an example of a code smell
is a long method a long method can be
fine it doesn't need to contain bugs
however we've all seen these 1,000 line
methods they're not really pleasant on
the eye they are more error-prone they
will take people longer to really figure
out what's going on and another code
smell that's common is duplication also
sometimes called cult cloning where you
have similar functionality across a code
base and then if you need to change one
duplicate duplicated item maybe you also
need to change the others and you can
introduce bugs that way we can see how
these type of smells can also occur in
spreadsheets because similarly to long
methods you can have long formula which
is smelly for the same reason it's very
hard to understand what is going on and
also duplication formulas can be
duplicated in different parts of the
spreadsheet and then if you change one
maybe you also need to change the other
ones and you can make mistakes so in
this sense it's quite intuitive to
translate code smells as they were
defined by Martin Fowler to spreadsheet
formulas and write tools that help
people to find and improve the smells in
spreadsheets and that's exactly what I
did in my dissertation so I wrote a
bunch of papers about smells and
spreadsheets and then I got my PhD so
that was that was a fun story and I
shared this story many times and many
developer conferences where I talked
about hey you know a cheater code and
it's really cool and I'm writing and
teased about it but this is sort of the
story from my brain these are effects
they actually happens it's not a fake
dissertation it's a real dissertation it
actually happened that I that I did
these things but it's only part of the
story because there's also the story of
the heart how was I feeling while I was
doing this
how was I reflected on the world around
me while doing my dissertation and it
started off really fun so I went to lots
of developer conference like this one
we're at right now and I went everywhere
and I said hey Frenchie's are cold
it's so cool stretch it's our code and
then people be like yeah it's not real
programming to me but they were heaps
functional and they're reactive and
they're really cool and it's
spreadsheets and code and people be like
yeah it's not real programming and it's
sort of fun it's fun to be the underdog
for a while but after a while it really
it eats at you it's really tiring to
tell the same story so I sort of god´s
sadder and more tired without really
realizing what was going on I was just
losing my energy because I was like look
it's programming look it's frightened
from the few it's an if statement be
like no no it's no real program and
later like three years later later I
realized that not all communities are
like this when it was 2012 when I was
graduating I really thought the way that
normal professional adults interact with
each other in stages pitch to each other
about their tools all the time this is
normal behavior in communities that's
what I thought so now I'm also part of
other communities that this may surprise
you are not like that I'm also running
now and I'm not a good runner I'm
actually quite slow runner mind quickest
half marathon if 2 hours and 15 minutes
and the full marathon world record is 2
hours so I'm more than twice as slow as
the quickest people on the planet but
that doesn't matter to other people that
are running if you're running or you
just mention you're running other
runners will come up to you and they'd
be like oh you're runner that's so cool
what is your what is your PR and what
races are you doing they don't care that
you're super slow they they're not going
to say oh oh you're running on a D - ooh
so they have security security
vulnerabilities you know they're I
no runners are like cool you're a runner
you're part of the club they're not come
to say oh you're so slow thank the
moment there's an hour we don't care
about that
it's even worse runners are more
evangelistic all then Jehovah's
Witnesses runners if you know a bunch of
them they're all trying to actively turn
other people into runners if I see
someone catching the train I'd be like
oh you're wrong all right you want to go
on a race with me seems like you're
having fun
runners are trying to help other people
be better runners and they will never
say something like you are not a real
runner that is it's a ridiculous thing
to even think about and the same is
parts for the Knitting community so I
used to do lots of knitting when I was a
teenager and then I didn't really do it
for 20 years and then I picked it back
up so I went to a few workshops with
what I know now are very old fashioned
knitting needles there are fads also in
knitting and now they don't you
straighten knitting needles anymore but
circularly their needles I didn't know
that so you just come to your workshop
with your old-fashioned needles and no
one says Oh old-fashioned needles you're
really meaning that oh happy that you're
knitting and everyone is friendly to
each other imagine my surprise right it
is so weird
why do we do this to each other but so I
know that now that other communities can
also be friendly and inclusive but then
in 2012 I didn't really know this so I
was sad and not really excited about my
topic anymore but I just accepted a job
as a university professor in valve so I
needed to do research about spreadsheets
that's what I promised them to do but I
wasn't really into it it's like where's
my life going I'm so sad luckily by
networking I knew people in my
neighborhoods and I found a community
center close by with a bunch of kids
that wanted to learn programming and
they were looking for a programming
teacher so I was like yeah you know I
teach a bunch of kids
programming and at least I'm doing
something that's making me happy and
maybe I was stop worrying about whether
spreadsheets are programming or not so I
went there and at the community center
they had a little Lego Mindstorms robot
who's played with Lego Mindstorms to try
it for your kids right I get it so this
is what we started programming because
it was there and the kids really enjoyed
it and for those who of you who haven't
done Lego Mindstorms it's a visual
programming environment it really looks
a little bit like this where you have
boxes that are connected with lines and
this is how you program the robots so
one Saturday afternoon the kids have
gone home and I'm looking at those
programs I'm like hmm that was really
very well structured they have some
duplication in them and some necessary
logic I think I've seen something like
this before
these are code smells in Lego Mindstorms
the exact same thing that we saw in the
financial people in spreadsheets the
same behavior I saw in the children with
Lego Mindstorms because they were
programming as a means not as an end
goal an insurance person cares about a
budget a kid cares about getting the
robot to drive so they're not
necessarily concerned with the beauty of
the organization of what they're making
they just want to get it to work so it's
like hmm that's interesting I could just
write down something about code smells
in Lego Mindstorms just one paper at
least my department head will be happy
that I'm producing research even though
it's not in spread about Freddy's like I
promised in my research statements I
paid for his paper so it should count
for something
of course you understand that we're 20
minutes in this talk so it wasn't just
one paper because then of course I was
curious our code smells bad does it even
matter to young children that programs
have some code smells is is this a
problem no maybe it's yeah it's a
problem for professional developers it's
even a problem for people in finance
because the models grow so big that they
get confused but if it's just for kids
does it actually matter so at this point
we move to a programming language called
scratch who's tried scratch for their
kids it's a visual programming language
from MIT and with scratch by the way we
did this on fresh kids so not on the
kids from the community center but on
kids from a local high school you can't
experiment on the same kids after a
while they sort of understand what code
smells are so we had a bunch of fresh
fresh kids from a local high school and
we divided them into three groups
one group got perfect code that we
designed as pretty as possible one group
called source code that has lots of long
methods so big blocks of source code
stacked together and the other group had
code that suffered from duplication
similar functionality in different
places in the program this is by the way
how scratch looks like so it's a visual
programming language it has blocks here
you can imagine how a long method would
look like that's a big stack of blocks
instead of small parts that have
functionality spread out so on a game of
breakout so a phone like game we had
these three versions that I talked about
a good version and too smelly version
and we asked children to explain the
source code to us so what is this doing
and we also ask them to adapt the source
code so the game would go until 5 points
and then it would play a little sounds
and we asked children increase the upper
limit to 10 points and of course this is
where the duplication was so that made
it a little bit tricky for the kids that
got duplicated codes with this we could
answer the research question our smells
bad
for children that are just learning to
program and the quick answer is yes coat
smells are also bad for novices that are
just learning to program the kids in the
noice group did significantly better on
explaining and adapting source code than
the kids in the groups with the code
smells not surprising but it was good
that we found out that it actually makes
a difference for young kids so yeah
maybe two papers or maybe tree because
then we wanted to know do these code
smells exist in the real world we made
those three programs of which two had
code smells but maybe just maybe
children in the real world don't produce
médicos maybe they're just perfect
programmers and it doesn't really happen
in practice so the nice thing about
scratch is it's open source and you can
use it for free but also they have a
public repository which is a little bit
like github where you can share your
programs you can even fork programs from
other children and this repository is
also creative comments so you can
download all these programs and print
them out or tattoo them on your arm or
do static source code analysis on them
which is the most fun option really
so we've done like 250,000 programs from
the scratch public repository and we
analyze those programs for the
occurrence of a number of well-known
code smells what we found is that 30% of
the programs in the public repository
suffered from long method smells so they
combines a lot of those blocks in one
stack rather than splitting out
functionality where possible so that's a
number that's comparable to things we
found on spreadsheets and on traditional
textual languages we also found that 26%
of the programs in a repository suffered
from some form of cloning so copy
pasting functionality rather than
creating abstractions which is also
along the lines of smells that we see in
professional code bases what we also
found and I didn't really understand the
ban is that only half of the program
that we sampled had some user
interaction so only half of the programs
did things like if you click about an a
sound clays or looking at the mouse or
looking at the microphone the other half
of the programs didn't have any user
interaction
you just sort them and then they would
play a song or an animation or make a
drawing and we weren't really looking
for that we were looking for the code
smells but I'm still like hmm this is a
surprising finding if this really fits
what I think about what programming is
very well because if I think about
programming for kids I think about games
of course they will have lots of user
interaction because you're playing each
other it's like hmm that's interesting
finding I'm not really looking for that
but it stuck somewhere like a piece of
gum in your hair like it can get out
it's annoying me what does this mean so
at this point I thought hmm I haven't
done spreadsheets in over a year
maybe maybe this is going somewhere so
we wanted to take it a little bit
further and the next research question
that I answered is can we teach children
about code smells if we explain code
smells to young children and this was
from the age of 7 do they actually
understand what code smells mean we
explained to them hey don't stack 20
blocks together split it upper possible
is this something that they can then
recognize in source code so we created
an online course on the EDX allured
platform a platform that's usually used
for MOOCs massive open online courses
for university students and professional
learners but we used it to target 7 to
12 year olds and in the first run of
this course 3,000 children participated
so that was really nice for data
collection what we taught them is
programming and smells together so we
said through the children this is just a
programming course we'll just teach your
program but she couldn't every week we
talked about the programming concept but
also about a code smell so duplication
long method and
good naming we talked about those coat
smells every week and we did some
moderate lying to the children because
we said this is how professional
programmers do it they like clean and
efficient and need source code so this
is how you should also do it
I hope they believe me so with this we
can answer the question can we teach
children about coat smell and the quick
answer is yes we can actually teach 7 to
11 year olds about code smells pretty
well on the questions we asked about
programming they scored about 72 out of
100 points whereas all the questions
related to smells they scored about 85
out of 100 points so these were
questions like is this code better than
the other code or what adaptation do you
need to make to make the code cleaner or
nice of course this only tells us that
they understand code smells it doesn't
necessarily tell us that they will also
not make code smells while programming
in the future but at least it proved
that children are capable of
distinguishing good code and bad code
so now yeah maybe almost almost two
years in this I'm not really doing
spreadsheets anymore story I figured out
that this is my new topic I am NOT going
back to this and not to your programming
lens I'm really interested in can we
teach you learn about short code can we
teach children about code smells and
everything else that is there so at that
point I thought okay maybe it's time to
look back at what I did what I have done
so far and make a plan for where I want
to go because how research normally goes
if there's such a thing as how research
normally goes is you have support of
those on the horizon you're working
towards you have a goal why you want to
go and in small steps you you're going
there but I didn't have any goal my only
goal was where I didn't want to go I'm
like there are the spreadsheets I'm
going that way
but in there you have any goal so after
a bunch of paper so it's like okay I
need to look back and see what is
teaching programming all about and of
course as ice
in the beginning of my talk as well if
you say your research topic is learning
programming you have to think about what
is programming because everything you
believe about programming is what you
will end up teaching children about
programming so it's looking back and was
like oh my god I imprinted so much of my
beliefs on children without really
realizing it I told children that
programming is technology because we did
the Lego Mindstorms robots I thought
that that programming is games because
we did the breakout game in the smell
story I told them learning to program is
by making programs because in the online
course I just said hey this is a game
this is what we're going to make step by
step we're going towards this game and
every time if you're teaching a child a
child what programming is you're also
teaching it childhood programming is not
so what I didn't tell them is
programming is art I'm programming a
story and you could also learn
programming by exploring different steps
rather than building towards a big
program from the beginning so I realized
I had lots of beliefs about programming
and I accidentally brought them into the
classroom and I wanted to do my best for
myself to have less assumptions that
also goes back to this story where I
said half of the programs have user
interaction and the other halves doesn't
have user interaction I was assuming
that that has didn't didn't exist I was
only concentrating on the game like
programs and notes on the arts and
animation like programs so I started to
think really heavily about what is
programming what does it mean for me why
do I think that what does it mean for
other people and and why do I think that
be where I'm going to say controversial
stuff I'm putting my Twitter handle
handle on the slides again so if you
disagree with me send me angry tweets or
you can also like notes or wave your
hands but in the interest of we all want
to go home I'm not doing respond
at this time but if you don't agree with
me feel free to send angry tweets or or
leave now if you think you can't handle
controversy so what is programming you
can break it into a number of different
dimensions I think I can also imagine
their other dimensions but these are the
dimensions I think are interesting one
question is what is programming about by
which I mean what do we program for if
we're programming
what will we apply the superpower that
we have that is programming what will we
apply at all so I would say that access
more or less goes from technology to the
humanities so things you can do that are
very much in the technology space are
toy robots
maybe self-driving cars is still very
much technology but it's moving a little
bit towards the humanities because you
can see how a self-driving car makes the
world a better place more than its way
robot or a drone or something like that
and maybe all the way on the humanity
side of the spectrum maybe you have
analyzing Shakespeare which is it's a
valid use for programming but if you
think about what image programming has
in general these things are less likely
another dimension is what is programming
like what other things are children or
adults already know
looks like program that's another way
that we can frame programming with this
dimension more or less goes from
programming is math towards programming
is like creativity and this is where
fill water is nothing against fill but
with his talks about category theory
that I've seen many times and I'm still
not sure that I really get it
we imprint a certain image on people
what programming is programming is like
math and it's not necessarily a good or
a bad thing but it is a thing we say it
may it puts programming in a certain
facility of other fields many intro
courses are somewhere between
programming is like math and programming
is like logic and scratch I think the
the visual programming language that
also allows you to make stories and
animation is a little bit more down on
that structure made it also tells kids
that programming can be very creative
so another dimension is what is
programming for which more or less goes
to I am programming because it pays my
mortgage towards I'm programming because
I wake up at night and it has to go out
of my head I'm programming because I
want to express myself in a certain way
and you could say open source is all
many places I think of the spectrum some
people do open source because they think
it will give them a good reputation and
good chances on the job market so it's
still very much in the frame of coding
for money and this can be towards coding
for self-expression however many
open-source projects even though people
do it for fun they still create programs
that have a use in the world like a
video player or a chat application you
still make something that has value that
you could sell you don't but you could
so I'm not placing it all the way at
self expression something like end-user
programming for me is a little bit
closer towards self expression because
you're not programming directly to sell
the source code for money you're solving
a problem that matters to you and you
use source code to solve the problem so
it's a little bit farther for me from
the code for money spectrum who knows
sonic pie Oh awesome
lots of Sonic 5 fans in the audience so
sonic pie is a programming language
that's meant for both children but also
professional musicians to generate music
with source code and I think that's at
least what I know of the thing that is
most code for self-expression related
it's most I have this music in my head
and I really want to get it out or I
will be inspired by the source code that
I write so these are a bunch of
dimensions that can give programming a
certain flavor there's one more that I
want to talk about and that is who is
programming for and that's an axis that
goes more or less from programming is
for compilers to programming it for
humans to read and enjoy that's also a
dimension of
programming is so things like coding
style and good naming are a little bit
away from for compilers in the direction
of coding for humans because at least if
you're thinking about good names if
you're thinking about a proper coding
style then you're also thinking about
humans but not as far as we could
literate programming and that's the idea
that mixes documentation and source code
together it's a quite old idea but it's
now maybe the thing we know closest to
it's that's in fashion is Jupiter
notebooks it's a nice way of thinking
about literate programming where you mix
source code and natural language it's
sort of in the middle between
programming for humans and programming
for the compilers because you mix text
that is specifically for programmers and
text attic specifically for the compiler
closest I think to humans is
non-executable
explorations of source code source code
doesn't have to be for compilers that's
just the thing we agreed upon but if I
really feel like it why couldn't I say
if as a code poem who cares that it
doesn't compile if this is what I want
to express if I want to explore all the
ways iteration I could write down many
forms of iteration that don't even
compile just to see how does that
programming language feel to me how does
it make me feel how does it feel for
other people and one of the person I
didn't I'm not sure if he's here but
someone that has really inspired me in
this is Tomas he said when we were
brainstorming about this in Cambridge
here's ago he said we should liberate
programming from the tyranny of
execution she's like yes that really put
me on the path of this thinking in many
ways
why should source code be executed
there's no reason that we would limit
ourselves to one side of the spectrum so
we can combine all these axes together
and I'm not saying they're necessarily
orthogonal I don't know how many
dimensions this space should have but I
think we can more or less say that this
is where the sea of reasonable beliefs
lies this is what most people focus on
what they mean if they say programming
they mainly mean programming is
technology it's math it's something you
do as a job and it's partly for humans
but also very much for compilers and as
I said if you don't agree with me send
me angry tweets but this is something
for me that's really interesting to talk
about what do we think is still
ridiculous and what do we think sort of
middle-of-the-road would everyone
believes a thinking frame that has made
me a little happier thinking about
programming and has helped me embrace
the richness of what programming could
be is the thinking frame that
programming is like writing I think
that's a very liberating way to think
about programming and if you think about
it it's only makes sense that
programming is like writing I I'm not
the first you observe this different
this similarity between those two fields
ultimately programming is you have an
idea like an app that tracks complements
I would really like to have that if
someone says something nice we like say
that again while I record it and I can
play that is this high-level idea
that you translate into letters and
sentences level programming is if you
abstract away very far the same is true
for writing you have this very high
level weird idea like a frog murders
foreign diplomats you take that idea and
you translate the idea into letters and
sentences so from that perspective
writing and programming are very similar
I have an idea you write it down in a
agreed-upon form and then you read it
and then someone else can execute it in
the brain or their machine whatever they
prefer
however right thing is also way broader
than programming is because what is if
you if you go on the streets and you ask
random people what is writing all these
things are writing writing a
dissertation science writing a petition
participating in society writing it
to-do lists
purely practical for yourself writing
fiction for yourselves or as a career as
a hobby calligraphy is writing just
writing pretty letters is writing poetry
is writing breaking chromatic rules to
see what it does with your brain no one
has an issue that all of these things
are writing they're all writing they're
different but they're all this umbrella
like ant programming this wise why can't
thinking about how to write syntax in
the previous way be also considered part
of programming that is interesting and
as I said for me this frame has made me
happier to think about programming
because this language metaphor really
helps to be inclusive and to get more
people and different type of people
interested in programming because the
connotation that comes with program
writing is everyone can learn it
everyone almost everyone knows a
language and natural language people
know two or more natural languages so if
you say programming is like learning a
language people be like okay I already
did that once in my life maybe twice
probably I can do that again whereas if
you say programming is mad some people
will not really feel included and this
is not like a hypothetical idea that
could happen there's lots of research
that shows that the more people believe
that quality in the field is innate is
in more the less women participate in a
field so the more people believe that
programming is like math and about math
people believe that you need a certain
skill set you need to be born with it
otherwise you're never going to make it
in that whether or not that is true
format is a whole different discussion
but that is a stereotype that sticks to
math and that stereotypes makes women
feel less included because they think oh
I'm not born with imagine so I know born
with the programming gene so let's go do
something else that I can learn so this
is really a frame of thinking that
matters and we could exclude people by
emphasizing how much programming is like
math what I also really like about the
per the programming is writing frame is
that some stuff in writing in natural
language makes no sense why because
people invent it and people make
mistakes so this is Mina as a 16 year
old learning English so I'm like Hello I
can English I read a book and the
teacher says well done you read a book I
read a book next sentence oh I can do
this I've read a book no it's I've read
a book why why is there inconsistency in
English there are languages like Dutch
that have a one on one mapping from
letters to sounds but not English some
things just don't make sense why is it I
read a book and I've read a book there's
no other reason than man that's how the
language evolved this is also true for
programming so here's some Python one is
a for loop and the other is a list
comprehension that also contains the key
word for but in a loop it ends with
semi-coma with a code and in the list
comprehension it doesn't it's both for
it looks the same for something in range
something the one variety has a colon
and the other variety doesn't I had one
of the students in my Python class said
that this was unfair that the syntax was
like this and I was like yeah I hear you
friends this is unfair why is that the
case and they were just studying for
lutes and I think they get it okay a
for-loop is for AI in something
something cold on here's something that
looks exactly the same it's not if you
tell people programming is like math and
like logic and then you confront them
with stuff like this and and to be fair
there are worse examples I could have
pasted about inconsistencies in
languages this doesn't fit programming
it's math programming and logic this
more fits people make decisions stuff
evolves sometimes we have to satisfy the
compiler in a certain way and that's the
way the reason things are the way they
are another really nice thing about
programming as a language is that some
stuff is cultural some stuff isn't
necessarily part of a language but it
just happens to be the case so I'm from
the Netherlands and we have this very
confusing way of talking to people if we
say do you want to come over for a
coffee at 7 p.m. what we actually mean
is do you want to drink coffee at 7 p.m.
that's literally what we mean that's
what we invite you for we think we're
being very clear but if you invite let's
say a friend's person for dinner they
would show up at 8:00 and they'd be like
where's the food we'd be like we had
food food at 6 then we had coffee at 7
what are you even doing here so some
stuff in languages is just cultural it
isn't necessarily stuck to the way we
speak Dutch that coffee at 7:00 means
coffee at 7:00 it's just the way our
country evolves
together with the language and you have
same in programming languages in Python
you would write the variable in snake
case with underscores whereas in c-sharp
you would write it with camel case it
doesn't necessarily go with the language
you can use underscores in c-sharp but
there is a certain culture and like with
showing up at 8 p.m. on a Dutch person's
doorstep to get a coffee
you would look a little bit silly if he
would write in this course in c-sharp
there there evolved in different ways
not necessarily related these are all
things that really very much fit the
programming is language frame and to a
lesser extent fits the programming is
math of the programming is logic frame
and of course we have to talk about
teaching a little bit because that's
what the talk was a balance we can learn
a lot from how we teach language to how
we teach programming that's the
direction that my research is going in
now we know so much about how to teach
language we've had hundreds of years of
research and we have maybe 2000 of years
of experience in how to teach people
languages we don't really have enough
experience in how to teach people
programming but because these things are
so similar in different brains we can
teach programming like we teach a
language and probably it will be
beneficiary to learners because we know
a lot about how to teach a language if
you if you remember probably from when
you were learning the first or second
language you do a variety of things if
you learn a natural language reading
writing drilling words speaking
listening who's listening to English or
Dutch is already a very valid form of
learning especially for people that
learn their first language they would
learn a lot just by hearing their
parents and hearing their teachers speak
English then you would learn a lot you
see a variety of activities and if you
compare that to how we teach and learn
programming
see how small the scope is of things
activities we do in programming
basically if you want to learn
programming you practice programming you
don't for example
read source code allows you don't listen
to a teacher reading source code allowed
you could but we don't we've really
narrowed the scope of activities we do
with children toward children
programming by doing programming in
language there are these two streams of
how to teach language that are sort of
in competition with each other that I
think we can learn a lot from if we want
to teach programming and these
approaches are called the fornix
approach and the whole language approach
so the phonics approach this is the
approach that we also use an analysis we
teach children Dutch it's very much
focused on how to pronounce letters so
we would practice the are only the R and
then you would read the words read we
even make this movement their schools be
a book that's how you practice letters
and then words and then sentences and
then books that is one approach to
teaching language another approach is
called the whole language approach and
this is more popular in things like
Montessori education that are more
interested in what is it what is a child
to learn and what is an exciting thing
for children to do so the whole language
approach would be more to look at
language in the context of language so
if you take this whole language approach
to the extreme you would just say to a
five-year-old here's a pen you're right
they write one sentence but they're
doing fine motor skills and after a
while they read it and they say oh the
unicorn dances in the woods because they
remember what they wrote no because it
said actually means something and then
after a while you train this skill into
being words you can see by the way why
the formics approach is more popular in
english-speaking countries because you
can't really focus on the letters
because I read a book is not the same as
I read a book
so in english-speaking languages the
whole language approach has traditional
be a little bit more successful than in
languages like Dutch where there's a
water war mapping between letters and
words and you can just practice letters
in isolation so what does this mean if
you do it in programming so a whole
language approach is looks most like
what we normally do when we teach
children programming we say this is a
loop now you reverse a string we very
much focus on doing something that means
something to children that does
something in the real world whether all
eight-year-olds are very interesting in
reversing a string is not a discussion
so what you apply it on is an
interesting discussion but mainly if we
teach we say your concepts now build
something and the practice is in
building big girl programs even though
for for kids that are learning of course
the programs are still small but they
are full programs we always practice
full programs that do something useful
like reversing a string the phonics
approach if you would do it in
programming is more like practicing one
keywords in isolation it doesn't even
necessarily matter what this keyword
means or does we're just going to
practice the syntax of this statement
until you've practiced that syntax
elements very clearly you can dream how
an assignment looks like and only then
you'll apply it in a bigger program and
the interesting thing about language and
also math related didactics is that
phonics is just the best approach this
discussion has going on has been going
on for decades but research upon
research upon research shows that
practicing in small steps and only then
applying it in fact bigger programs /
synthesis is superior over these three
for more applied forms of learning so
this is a British article from three
months ago I think where again they're
stressing even though it's not really
popular in english-speaking countries
the full next approach is a superior
form of teach
this is a newspaper article from the
from the Dutch press also a few months
ago this is about practicing math but
it's about the same two variants of
teaching math where they say well it's
better to practice small examples two
plus three is five and the tables of
multiplication until you're totally sick
of it and only then do bigger programs
that's a superior form of teaching to
telling children oh you know we want to
do I have 12 euros and I want to buy
five apples and bigger more meaningful
programs slash problems so in math and
in language even though there's still
lots of debates in general people say
practising small steps it's just a
little better so this is what we're
exploring now also when we are teaching
young children so from 9-10 towards the
middle of high school we're trying to
teach them small steps at a time we are
practicing how to speak source code in
the classroom I say you know repeat
after me
eggs is five and the children be like X
is five we're practicing these small
steps so that if they're reading source
code if they're actually programming
they're not spending brain cycles on how
do you read this because it seems it
seems so simple reading X is five but
this could have many meanings it could
be x equals 5 or X gets 5 or X is
assigned 5 there are many different
things that it could mean so making sure
that kids don't spend any mental energy
on how source code sounds in their brain
is very important and this is especially
important we found for bilingual kids so
we had Dutch kids read Python aloud and
they struggle a lot just how to
pronounce the variable I because if you
would read the letter I in Dutch this
letter is e that's how he pronounced it
and we had kids read a for-loop in
Python saying for I in range 0 to 5
planes
so they wouldn't even pronounce it
consistently in a short snippet of
source code which probably means that in
their brain it's not the same thing
either so practicing the small step of
how to pronounce source code especially
for non-english speaking children is
probably going to help them not spend
effort on how it sounds in their brain
is there reading maker programs so we
give them programming homework that is
nothing like probably programming
homework that many other people give
where you would say indeed this is a
loop now do something with it we just
give them fill in the blanks exercises
this is the statement X is 5 so it's
blank 5 what goes there X is blank
what goes there blank is 12 what goes
there practicing the assignments until
they perfectly get it and they don't
need any mental cycle anymore spends on
how does an assignment look like think
of all the energy that you have already
spent in your life fiddling with
semicolons or red brackets getting it
right this is a skill you can probably
this is the research but you can
probably practice in isolation such that
if you're programming your brain is free
for the bigger problems that's at least
what we think of course here I know that
here also will be new naysayers and
they'll be saying they have said this
already to me they'll be saying things
like that doesn't seem fun at all you
make it look like school sort of true I
mean there is a risk in making it more
boring and there's this encouraging some
kids that are very excited however the
nice thing is science bitches I have
science on my side because here's a fun
fact about learning that if you don't
remember anything from this book at
least remember this how much fun
children are having has zero correlation
with what they're learning
shall I say it again there is no
research whatsoever that shows that how
much fun children are having actually
has a correlation with how much they're
learning on the contrary many children
pick exercises that they already know
how to solve because it's really fun to
get everything correct that that's more
fun than practicing things that might be
difficult like it's more fun to Netflix
on the couch than it is to train for a
marathon in the long run it might be
more fun to not get a heart attack but
now you know it's very fun to eat potato
chips and watch doesn't make the
survivor so we as adults that are
teaching we need to challenge kids not
too much and not too little to make sure
that they learn something if we just are
going to leave it to fun then probably
what is likely to happen what has also
happened in the past kids that can
already do it a little bit they can
advance really quickly because they can
do harder puzzles and kids are still
stuck at the basic level of where does
the semicolon go we'll never really
advanced because they don't have room in
their brain because they're so figuring
out old symbols so maybe it's less fun
but it doesn't matter because learning
is not about fun learning is about
learning the final thing I know out of
time this is almost my final slide the
final thing that I really like about
this fonox
approach where we focus on small syntax
elements and small semantic elements
before doing bigger programming goes
back to the sea of reasonable beliefs if
we give children only small snippets of
code instead of saying here's a loop
reverse a string we give them less
context about where programming is
because if your first assignment and
I've really I've sampled many free
Python programming courses on the web if
your first assignment is reverse a
string you you are already pushing
children into the sea of reasonable
beliefs it says so many things it says
your code should compile
it says you must do something useful it
says there is maths reverse and that is
the scope of the things we're
programming so if we teach this small
building block approach to children what
you can also do is okay I've shown you
assignments and and print statements
what will you build with this and it
really changed my life to start asking
children but also university level
students starting to ask them what do
you want to build with the building
blocks that you know they come up with
the weirdest things I had a high school
student in the classroom I said okay you
know some Python what do you want to
build he says I want to build an app for
the local supermarkets it's like why he
has a website can be really fun because
everyone can see what's for sale in the
app in the supermarket and with the
opening hours are and I this is really
what I want to build I would have never
come up with in websites for the local
supermarket but he was super engaged in
building that in another story I was
teaching a bunch of elementary school
children so 10 11 year olds a bunch of
girls and asked them what do you want a
program they say we want to build a
story with a narwhal who knows what a
narwhal is okay a frenzy I'm stupid I
didn't know this I friendly and Nara is
boffin it's like a dolphin but it has a
unicorn on the side friend I thought
they were messing with me but this is an
actual thing that exists in the see a
unicorn dolphin so you can imagine if
you know any ten-year-old girls you can
imagine how excited they get about a
door friend that's just like a unicorn
so they were entirely engaged in this
programming exercise because they could
make a normal dance around in scratch
and this is an exercise that I literally
could have never come up with because
these children explain to me the
existence of a novel so I could have
never come up with an exercise that
would appeal so much to them as this
really ridiculous creature dancing
around in the sea so if we focus on
smaller steps not only is it likely to
get
better results it's also likely to get
more inclusive results because children
are necessarily have to swim in the sea
of what we think is reasonable they can
write wicked programs about things that
we would say doesn't make sense but they
bring to programming because we imprint
loss upon them
what actually matters so with this
picture of the Unicorn dolphin I want to
close my just summarize everything in
like one minute because I know it's late
and I speak very quickly so let me give
you a few highlights to end it with the
first highlight that really matters is
listen to your heart
it took me way longer than necessary to
figure out that I wasn't really having
fun in spreadsheets and that was that
was one of the things that was dragging
me down is people saying it's not real
programming I didn't realize - too long
so it's important to figure out are you
still having fun ask yourself this
question are you having fun and if not
do something else
the second point that's important be
aware of the water of programming
understand that what you have come up
with isn't necessarily everything that
is true about programming and especially
don't be these people don't be this is
not real programming please because it
actually hurts people if you say prawns
ends or PHP or imperative programming is
not programming it matters to people so
don't be that person because it just
sucks
a lot more positive notes let's think as
a community together about what X's
there are and what programming is and
let's expand these axes even beyond what
I put on the slides today again if you
have ideas send me tweets because I'm
curious what you think is dimension that
I missed or a point on the dimension
that I missed well we are trying to
explore and if you have children or just
an interest in teaching feel free to
reach out to me
we are trying to explore can we break
programming down in tiny pieces to be
more effective and more fun in teaching
that's it
I met Celine on Twitter for all your
tweets I also have a blog where I
regularly blog things about my my own
scientific research but also what other
people are doing in this space we surely
don't have time for Q&amp;amp;A but there's one
question I will answer because people
always ask have you hadn't thrown these
slides the answer is yes I have an apple
pencil on an app called good notes that
allows me to draw these funky slides
that's it
