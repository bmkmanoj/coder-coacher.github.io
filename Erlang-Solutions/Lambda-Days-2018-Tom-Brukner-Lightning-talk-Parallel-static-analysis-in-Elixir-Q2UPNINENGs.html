a parallel software can you raise your
hands please
good I've wrote interactive code viewer
that allows you to see within a thread
what functions can be can be executed
and what functions cannot be executed
from a given thread would you like to
know how it works
good good good good so the product goes
like this in a bra in a text editor you
choose a function that starts a thread I
calculate what can be executed and what
cannot be only shows you show you what
can be executed and what cannot so
this the solution today's has to have
three properties it has to be real time
because you don't want to work you don't
want to wait for the results it has to
be ad hoc you only need the results for
the one function that you have selected
and it kind of needs to be quick how do
you do this how do you calculate it it's
actually quite straightforward it's a
very simple static analysis so you you
start with a function that the user has
selected you show that one obviously you
go through all the call instruction that
it has and for each function that's
referenced you recurse in do so you show
that function and you go ahead until you
until you're stopped under certain
conditions now if you choose to elixir
you will find out that you will have all
these properties that you need because
you have it ad hoc you just start you
just start a thread that goes for the
starting function
it sends a message to the browser to
display the function when you found
another function just spawn another
threat and uh and it will real-time be
shown through browser and it will be
real-time also in sense that Alex here
or Erlang has a first scheduler so you
will see all the results very very
quickly and as soon as they become
available now this works rather well in
theory but there is a catch
what if functions take are the functions
because if your functions take another
function this function may also be
called so you need to find out that this
function can be called and show it to
the user now in order to calculate this
you don't only need to know what
functions are being called directly but
you also need to know who calls you
because the function that you're
processing
and for that you need to know for every
function there is which other function
it calls so that you know who's calling
you
and when you want to calculate this you
will find out that it gets rather slow
why well because suddenly you don't have
to process only subset of functions that
you found but you have to come go
through how the whole program that you
have
and then some things an elixir tries to
show show up and fire and slow your
program down because suddenly you have a
lot of sequential code that needs to
basically to have to go through the
whole program the scheduler that usually
gives you real-time results suddenly
gets in the way because you're only
interested when you have all the results
and the and the parallelism that that's
built in into elixir it's with when with
spawning all the functions and making
sure that they are only calculated ones
brings additional add additional need
for synchronization which slows your
execution down
now why is this why is this such a big
problem well because you started with a
with a small problem with ad-hoc
execution and as you work on your
problem suddenly it changed it came it's
not no longer ad hoc and real-time it's
all at once and it has to be pre
calculated in order to do something
about it so suddenly a better solution
would be to write it in a different
language where it will be faster and
more enhance better for the user so
what's the conclusion of this well when
you're working on a problem and you're
digging down suddenly you may found a
new requirement that changes your
previous ones and then you may need to
rethink your whole solution oh and about
the product if you want to know how it
ended you can buy me a beer after party
I'm really happy I will happily tell you
that thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
