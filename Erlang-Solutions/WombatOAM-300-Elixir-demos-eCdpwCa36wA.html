Erlang and Alexia clusters do you find
out about your system crashing only when
your customers start complaining
figuring out what caused a crash feels
like looking for a needle in a haystack
there is a solution for your troubles
one bat OEM is the only operations of
maintenance system purpose-built to
understand the behavior of Erlang and
elixir clusters whether you are running
a proprietary application or an open
source one such as Phoenix react
rabbitmq or mongoose i am one bat OEM
works out of the box and gives you fun
visibility and control over your system
you can easily visualize collected
information in one bat o Am's web
dashboard or push it through our
northbound interfaces to other OAM tools
such as graphite graph on ax and nag
yours or to SAS providers such as Splunk
data doc and pager duty through its REST
API DevOps teams can integrate wombat om
requests in their workflow get in touch
to find out more about one bateau am
using wombat OAM for chat one bad OAM is
a great way to monitor your elixir chat
app first add your node and add the
cookie
one bad OAM will automatically connect
you to your node you will be redirected
to an auto-generated dashboard
the dashboard contains panels with
information about the metrics alarmed
statistics and everything that is
running on the node live
you can modify edit add and remove
panels to build your own customized
dashboard
this panel displays the request time for
each specified status code which you can
monitor live
to add a new panel click on the spanner
icon in the top right hand corner choose
a panel type select a node and select
the metric you want to monitor on the
panel we've selected WebSockets to
monitor the number of clients on the
dashboard
in this example we can see 130 users
connected to the dashboard of a Phoenix
application here it displays the number
of connected users all displayed live
you can also view historical metrics for
the last 15 minutes one hour one day or
even one week
there you have it learn more about one
bat OAM and get a free trial at
www.oneonone.org or you can monitor all
of your node stats
in this panel showing message queue
length we can see we have a problem the
message queue length is rising which is
not a good sign and can mean that the
message queue length is stuck when a
long message queue occurs one bad OAM
raises an alarm in the wombat OAM alarms
tab the alarm is showing a process
message queue error along with
information about the error and a
proposed fix for it let's go to the
tools tab to check the process manager
and see which process is causing this
message queue we can sort the processes
by message queue size for ease click on
the process for further information
about the process we can see that there
are a number of stuck messages from here
we are able to check the process error
and debug it
using the process name we can now go to
the topology tab and terminate the
process with the error
if we go back to the dashboard we can
see that the process with the long
message queue has been terminated and
that the process is now delivering the
messages
