going back to my chin s looking Legos
I've always wanted to work something
like it so let's see what happened yeah
so here the animal is and fingers
crossed it will do something sensible
we'll find out so I don't know if either
of you have seen me speaking at other
conferences but there the general plot
the way we operate things is that they
they have some sort of theme of things
running for conferences I find a way to
fit in there and then free slides into
the thing I start talking about our link
and it works wonders and it's a solution
for all just about anything the problem
is you see these nice people we learn
from border today this is how enterprise
people look like and these are
enterprise Java people and then when you
go into a conference like q con I went
in there and I didn't realize it was a
Java conference because I didn't do my
homework so I ran on stage and I asked
them anybody using Java for living and
hands go up and okay that's a lot of
people here this is going to be fun so
that see this put this on your arm it'll
make the pain of Java go away and and as
normally they turn into this stark
raving orcs so then we have another
thing here because this is pictures of
nice airliners the community here nice
people everything and then you you get
the idea and you talk about it on the
mailing list and you suggest slightly
and in the parenthesis is almost maybe I
will loop use elixir to teach kids how
to program and then the earliness they
turn into this all bite it's been a year
so maybe things have changed so the
question now is is anybody here using
our link for living yeah good I have
these patches for you
you can put them on here it'll take the
pain of our language so jokes aside but
there's something here because of the
other people talking this the syntax and
all of this really truly is irrelevant
unless you're doing brainfuck and then
it's a different thing but that's beyond
normal things here what matters is
thinking again I can go on for hours
about how universities do not teach
young people how to think anymore but we
will leave that for beer later but
thinking is everything and what what
does mean to think it's a language you
have that shapes your thinking in
language in this case it's not your
programming language it's not if you
speak French it's not if you speak
Danish or Swedish or whatever it's the
concepts you talk about that's important
because that's your language and that is
what's limiting you in expressing things
this is what happens when you have an
object-oriented programmer and you tell
him you can no longer use an object you
have to use a process he will need to go
to a shrink for weeks if it's a girl
same thing they are like oh that so that
means that language actually is
everything that's good thing to remember
language is everything good so that's
that said so now we've been warned there
will be licks in this talk there and
they'll be legal so the first encounter
I had with with this mindstorm thing
here not this political set because
that's the stockholm office one was in
Legoland in 2008 they had a huge demo
room and then I told my wife I'll just
go in and try this out with my son I'll
only do the trying out and she looks at
me really yes I'll be not be buying
anything you know you know you do make
promises and everything they're so and
so I went in and we had this father-son
moments and evidently tits talk a bit
harder with me because last week I did
this presentation and I had my son in
the audience in London and I asked him
just to make sure that this really came
through was a wonderful moment and
everything do you remember and he said
no not really
it goes to show when you have a teenage
you need to rehearse things with them
very hey so anyway it was a father-son
moment they had a beautiful environment
you took this mindstorm and you sitting
there you're building visual programming
and everything it was just wonderful so
I just went out there didn't look at the
wife just went straight to the booth and
bought a legal mind sunset and later I
had to buy her back to recover from that
but never mind you fix it and then we
come home and then I'm expecting this
again because this is cool this is what
you want to do with your kids there and
then I turn into this because it turns
out that the environment they show you
in the demo room is a demo environment
its shielding you for all the nastiness
of the labview graphical environments
that ships with the lego mindstorm and
I'm sitting there and my so good dad can
we get it to work no no we can't data
that doesn't understand this that
doesn't understand visual sequential
programming and it was just horrible so
luckily enough I sold it off with a
profit because i bought it in legal and
i got a discount on everything so i
voided having to buy another pack for my
wife for selling it so that was good bro
then 2013 my son goes ah I think I'd
like a legal mind stone kid and in my
head who father son moment again this is
going to be grades so we buy a new set
not on discount but this time which was
on his Christmas wish list so it didn't
involve another back so I was cool this
is good and then we open up the thing
and we start the visual environment and
this is the feeling there same pain
again and I couldn't explain these
things even though time has bad it was
the same monstroso's pain of programming
try the environment one day and you will
understand what it is so we after food
tries we put it away and then you had
this free thousand corner danish corner
thing sitting there not doing anything
just reminding this is the most
expensive Christmas present you've ever
bought you a son and he's not using it
and that was close to another bag but
then I thought okay I'll start doing
something so i took out Alexia and I
told my wife I'm going to do some magic
stuff don't disturb me and then I did
some some hacking and did some things to
get Alexia running on this one and then
we're actually getting closer because I
know after doing a few drivers I took my
son in into the room and CSUN need to
see some code here and then he goes oh I
can understand this code this elixir
code and as you always oh good you can
understand it there then he said okay it
said then do something with it so he
copied a few lines changed a few things
that worked fine then he did some extra
things and then he compiled it and then
the ugly animal of error messages in
elixir crept out of things and it Brad
screaming at him and he ran away so my
conclusion of this what Alexia fits when
you can program a bit so I'm assuming
you all guys here can program a bit
there so we can skip the thing about
learning Alexia I'll come back to that
later so there are things involved in
trying to get this to run so first of
all there's this linux distribution
called ev3 dev org which will put linux
on an SD card and then when you have
that on on the thing you connect to it
installed online which is actually quite
easy you just do apt-get install darling
and then you unzip a pre-compiled elixir
and you're up and running and be warned
it's not superfast it's rather slow but
still you have a lecture running
everything is good and then of course
since it's a lecture and since it's a
Linux thing you need to do some alchemy
and in this case it's file alchemy you
need to do and now I'll just one second
I'll turn this on because booting also
takes a time yeah so the thing is it has
a file based interface so everything you
want to do to control the motors and the
census has to grow for go for a file and
then if you take them and then pop them
in with a with a wire there they'll show
up in the file system so when you
connect the motor you can see it here so
this class tak a motor motor 0 that
means it's the first motor you can
to the system if you take the motor out
and put it back in it goes up to motor
one just to have fun the file system
there then you open it up and you go in
and you have this in your file system
then you go whoo that's a lot of files
what am I to do with this luckily this
is documented on re ev3 dev dot org and
by the way I'll say something more about
this this is not how it looks today I I
know out of painful experience the new
ev3 totally changes the file system
there but anyway so what can you do well
you take the duty cycle SP file and you
write a number between minus 100 and 100
which is if you want to go forward fast
or backward fast and something in
between and then you write a 1 to the
run file and the engines will just go
beautiful so that's that's okay and you
can do that on the command line and you
can do things their butt and it's not
really programming it's just hacking
around with hardware yeah they're so
then we did its library thing and the
gym is here he did this and he wrote
some beautiful macros that takes away
all this pain of defining things you can
actually write to and have any interface
to all these files and he's defining we
have run here says it's rideable it has
a min and max value there and you've got
some other things you can set which is
really nice a super nice interface to
this then allows you to write and this
is for me this was the first time I saw
macros that made sense because I'm old
style so I'm not a list person so macros
a little bit scary so here you have a
way of actually getting something from
the port and you can see here turn it in
and you have some utility functions here
and then I have to read the thing you
then turn it into an integer on Adam and
then you have all of this just magically
generated for you using macros no
boilerplate code super because then aha
you can just tell the the motor I want
you to go forward the one are connected
to output port be with 50 the other one
forward with
strength 30 and I can read the column
sensor this and if if you're like me
this is actually getting foreclosed a
beautiful code and then you start
feeling like this and then you're
sitting at spinning and your your little
office and everything is good there I
work at home so it's okay for me to sit
and spin it it doesn't disturb anybody
Darrell it and then at this point normal
slide say show me some Lego which we
will do in a few seconds I'll just warn
you here because this is how I feel
right now because normally I don't do
live demos I'm scared to death by doing
live demos but people have convinced me
there's a good idea which at the last
week in London and it failed so yeah so
maybe you want to see this God will
mirror the displays here for a second
good and it's on and it's yep we'll put
it down oh just we can just explain it
here how it works so we have two motors
here driving these two wheels and then
we have a color sensor here that is
trying to read something and then turn
that into something we can actually use
to steer the thing with then it's got a
bump up here front but we'll take that
later and it's got a tail too artistic
impressions but we're not going to do
that today yeah so let's put this down
there we go and then we connect here
let's see I can't spell
the s Java Roxon is so difficult to
spell there we go oh good the password
is of course Alexia but yeah so now you
can steal my SD card good and see that
it resets the date every time you
restart it it's beautiful one second
yeah working with embedded stuff always
is funny repeat after me working with
and better stuff is always funny got
I've got an hour I x minus s mix first
we need to get Earl and running our line
is a resource hawk it's just going in
there stealing all the CPU power and you
can almost feel the batter is getting
hot over here there and then then we put
a lecture on top of that just to make
sure that we take anything everything
out of this one just give it a few
seconds you can't blame me for doing
false commercials here you'll see how it
really is there you don't want you won't
be going home &amp;amp; Co it just works no it
takes a little bit of patience here so
good ready
and yeah sometimes it fails like that
don't talk don't despair we start again
yes see it's following the line for
those you can't see just trusted but
it's actually following the line and
it's it's using a very clever algorithm
it's it's following the left edge of the
dark line because then it can do and we
can go into someone half of the steering
works on that and in the philosophy
behind that let's see how confused to
get when it reached its the end of this
and and then it thinks it's found a line
there yeah poor thing but we'll put it
out of its misery now but and exit let
me just show you something let me just
show you something see we with safety
cautious here so this was a bumper so
when it bumps into something it actually
stops so he has a safety feature so no
legos were hurt in this presentation
yeah so good thank you and that will of
course be the last time in my life a
live demo has ever worked so but we'll
just savor the moment for a second good
anyway so I feel little less like this
guy right now hi there so then this is
of course been coded in a very elixir
way it beans the way of programming it
but let's go through the different
stages on how to approach this and do
these things so naive approach to
program this even if you're in elixir
and you're just coming to the thing
there would be that you take one process
to be the controller and then you have a
timer to trigger this process to go read
off the sensors and then you change the
motor settings and then the problem with
that one is it has no leverage of
processes and that means that this way
of structuring your program is a bad fit
for what elixir and darling is about
it's about processes and message passing
so if you're doing this you're
programming the thing as if you are
doing Python
then by all means stay in Python do not
take a sip of the divine water called
elixir lang don't do it stay away there
but if you want to do this you have to
do something and that comes down to the
golden Trinity over line which applies
to elixir as well then so these are the
things I took a walk one day because you
think better when you walk anybody who
claims to be thinking while sitting in
front of a computer screen that person
is lying simply you need to walk to
think anyway so the things i would never
remove from your line because if you
move some of this i'll be running
screamingly away from it and are also
providing screamingly away from elixir
because then it's not magic anymore this
is the act of divine intervention that
came to the computer science lab many
years ago 25 years ago at least so it's
share nothing fail fast and fail you're
handling these things and the way they
fit together this is why you are here
today this is why there's still
something called or languages there's
also something called alexia the way
these things work together this is how
that this is the magic and this is what
you need to embrace in your coating in
order to taste the magic and to live
forever so so that's what you need to do
so what you do here is let's say we take
a sensor and make a proxy for each
sensor by being one process now we're
talking right so all this reading timers
to trigger for instance reading the
color sensor and by the way I need to
turn this off otherwise it will do some
nasty things to me off there so the
sensor they're all that reading you can
configure that inside the process that
acts as a proxy for this color sensor
meaning you can control how often you
want to read it depending on what you
want to do so all of that is to subtract
it away and then you can have it the
sensor here just send a message back to
your control process when there's a
change in value now we get into
something that's event-driven which is
good it's a good fit and then you feel
like a beam stock that's my word for
being either in erlanger or an alchemist
it's a beanstalk there so that's good
and
the way that looks ending code is and
it's okay to take out the Kleenex and
wipe out the eyes because your eyes when
it gets really nice here I get tears in
my eyes when I see nice code so it's
okay no pointing things over that so
here you have this thing you read the
color off here then you do a bit of
mulling to figure out if it has changed
sufficiently there you're taking another
all all same and blah blah blah and then
should you have a change in color you
notify the line follower the brain of
your system that good we have a new
color here there and then you continue
you repeat and then you do since this is
inside edn fsm you do a no reply because
it was a message to God and you're just
sending yourself another check with that
interval you've set when you want to
read the caller this is how easy code
should be so this one is separated as a
color sensor is doing its own life and
then we can answer also the bumper you
saw the bumper in action and that is
actually quite easy because when the
bumper feels that it has a value of
pressed it will just notify the the the
line follower that the bumper has hit
something and then it's up to the
controller to figure out to do with this
bumper hit and then it'll check again if
it has hit anything there so it's again
read sensor notify the controller and
repeat the whole thing so you do these
lies little abstractions for each of the
little components in your hardware thing
and then we come to where where where
I'm when I'm sitting here the first time
I did that I was crying like a baby
because this is so beautiful so you have
a color sensor here and you draw that as
a circle because it's it's a process and
you have the controller and then you're
sending a message to that everything and
the beautiful thing here is that then
this color sensor can barely see but
that's a wire here going here somewhere
there and that wire equate the message
passing between the two processes so the
software architecture resembles the
physical architecture what you're doing
go find that in a java program please
can't do that then they'll force the
beauty just goes on and on so you have
your motors here and you're just sending
commands to them and again they're
connected by wires to your control so
everything setting up and then because
these things are simple we just add
another process the bumper and that
would be connected again by another wire
and we'll send a bumper hidden so this
is just one to one match between
physical and conceptual software
architecture it doesn't get any better
than this simply not in this slideshow
anyway so so the line for other we've
seen it it follows the left edge of the
line there and it's implemented as
Jennifer's m and it has a number of
little small functions to control the
motors and show a little bit of the code
here so here it will let's see will pop
up let's call this the line right now so
if it's on the left side of the line
it'll say ah now I need to drive forward
slightly right until I find the line
again so that's the logic here I'll just
do that and the forward slide right is
of course that you tell the left engine
to run a little faster than the right
engine and then you curve to the right
there and then you wait on here till
until you see the target color you're
looking for that's of course the color
of the line and that's why we have a
black color down there because
describing what the Erlang solutions
local look like it's one color it's a
bit difficult there so you see as soon
as you find that you say now i'm on the
right side of the edge and that means i
need to then do the opposite thing and
start turning a little bit left that's
why I saw the robot going just it was
not drunk I was just trying to find the
line ever so simply and then this is
pretty good and then you go to the old
state events and this is like the bumper
hit or if you just ask the thing to stop
and the bumper hit here is when you get
that event in you stop all the motors
and all the event generators that's all
your sensors here and you just terminate
this state as I'm here so this is also
very nice they're all the things you can
do there whether it gets even more noise
is that if you have the time to do that
I haven't had so far you
protect the hardware because that
process that's not the sensor that's you
can't do anything to protect that or
harm that there but the motors if you
give them the signal to go back and
forth all the time very fast you'll
break motors that's just the way these
things are they are very sturdy legal
has made some really good stuff but they
are still despite being a Danish company
the biggest toy company in the world
they are still have to obey the laws of
physics so that they still have to
adhere to that so those motors can be
damaged but the thing is here you can
create that process for you for your
motor you can build into that that you
will control that you're not going
outside it's a safety limits that's the
nice thing you can do with this try
coding this in your normal loop no this
is a thing that the property of that
motor it has to go inside the
abstraction for the motor there as in
sure reaction to the bumper fairly easy
there and then you also got this
smoothing of sensor readings by reading
a reading and it was inside the process
it was inside the color sensor that we
did that smoothening nothing on the
outside we just decided this is an
abstraction of a building and it's quite
easy to do good now the problem here is
well problem problem there are those
people here that can we do a little more
direct so this involves fooling around
with linux and it also meant falling
around with these SD cards and I don't
know if you feel it with SD cards they
break when you least expect them to do
do it so like last week when I was
supposed to present in London it broke
down in the morning of the day of the
presentation so i had to find a new card
so it's good yeah people like that i
will not comment on that there because
what i think my main goal is I would
like to write some control software all
this fun fun stuff of putting linux on
an SD card and getting rolling on it and
getting elixir on it and then every time
you've done a change to your file that
you copy them over and then yeah get it
all compiler there again yeah that's fun
yep sort of fun but I would like just
wait
also so what if we can just run that
control software from the laptop that
would be nice because then my my
feedback cycle becomes extremely short
and if I'm particularly clever about it
I could probably write the software over
here run it on my computer and control
it over there in and then if I wanted to
really embedded stuff I could probably
just get it over there and run over
there but I want the feedback in my my
programming to be fast and have it
luckily Lego has created something
called direct commands which means did
you pull out the SD card here with the
linux on it and then you just boot the
normal software and then you can send
commands to control all the sensors and
motors using these commands and it's
over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi there and then
you can run whatever program you want to
control the thing on your own machine
speeding up development i'm speeding up
the feedback loop and making everything
good and then if you're no telecom guy
like me then again kleenex out because
we have these instructions here with up
codes and arguments and how encoding and
everything and it gets even better it
gets even better because then you get to
the command encoding and then when
you're sitting around people that
actually try to do this in Java and have
done it and there just crying over this
 because it's not doable and this
kind of thing ok they will they cry and
I just look at it oh yes I know exactly
what to do here so what you do is you
write a simple function for it so you
take in something here a command type
the command some options to it and then
at the end of the day let's forget about
this for a second you just say ah bite
size of the command i'm sending plus 5
because that's the header here and that
has to be encoded in 16 bits little
endian encoded it said it's okay to cry
now yeah and then you have the message
counter here the same thing here and you
have some bites coming here and then
here's here's the extra beauty I only
need six bits for this Alec local thing
and I only need two bits for this one
this three or four classes in Java to
get this
done lovely lovely of course we're
cheating a little bit here because you
also have to use on the underlying
parameter encoding functions but then
again this is also good depending on the
size of this numeric variable they were
trying to encode that different ways of
encoding it so the first one is
interesting when it's less than 32 you
can do this one while you put in a short
format which of course is one bit lovely
and he tell is the constant afterwards
also one bit and then the size comes
here in the last remaining six bits go
home do this and see and lose your hair
it's a I've never done this and say yes
they'll have my hair so there you go and
then if of course if it gets longer you
tell it it's a long format constant
constant value and magic that needs to
be a zero feeling two bytes bits here
have no idea about that did you figure
that out to me the others a mystery yeah
this has to be a little bit of alchemy
even encoding here and then again the
value itself here the last eight bits
this is nice okay so
yeah maybe this yeah that could be a
reminiscence from that you would like to
have something bite aligned that you put
in there some padding there because
nobody accepts people doing over-the-air
protocols will have something that's not
by the lined and then again as Earl
angles on the licks here we don't give a
rat's ass about that throw it out we
have bits insects for that so so then
you start yes we can do this and you can
send commands you could see the engines
running and everything and then cool
bluetooth issues it turns out to be
latency when you're sending too much to
the poor thing here and then I did some
experiments with it and because neither
Jamie nor I could figure out why I was
doing this you send a command to it and
you wait for the reply this is very
polite this is that you can't get any
more polite you wait for the reply
you're not interrupting the other person
you're waiting for the other person to
reply to this is common courtesy and you
do that a couple of times then after
three or four of these interactions the
latency and the thing went up to 250
milliseconds so the algorithm you saw
making following the line I will do it
from this one over Bluetooth this poor
thing looks like it's been drinking for
four days and then trying to follow a
line it's it's really horrible and we
will not do it to do you today no okay
good yeah and then the hope here is that
it might work over Wi-Fi but then again
then goes to show that leo has been
trying to open up this environment but
not fully so you can buy a Wi-Fi dongle
but it has to be with one particular
chipset and one particular model because
the firmware has hard-coded into itself
that it would only accept that chipset
with that particular model number in it
or you can recompile the firmware and
then again a little bit stuck on it
because I need to find a windows machine
because you can only complete configure
this Wi-Fi dongle on a Windows machine
now anyway so you can go here and tim is
here but he's the man on this one he's
done most of this
there and the I think I constitute the
evil boss of the year what I forced him
to do Lego Mindstorm at work for three
weeks it doesn't get any more nasty than
that actually there but we have these
two libraries done here and then there's
a small warning down here don't don't
try to get the newest version of ev3 dev
I'll need to find out where to find the
old one there because the library they
changed the entire file structure in the
new version this is open source you
allowed to do that without telling
anybody well I could have read the page
but that's a little much there but
anyway that's something there you can
come contribute and if you update it to
the new environment will just get it
merged in and everything and if you're
really enthusiastic I'm aight just give
you access to just run the project but
do have fun there and by the way if you
go out and buy one of these is they
commenced offices after this talk that's
happened after alexia conf and I'm not
getting any returns from Lego for doing
that so there's no catches in this it's
a yeah it's clean now let me come back
to teaching programming but this was all
fun and I can do this they are there so
so we take the normal visual environment
for me be free very very difficult also
very very painful and although I'm it
I'm a very stern believer in pain driven
development but not this kind of pain
this is the pain leading nowhere there
then we have this library of now created
for alexia which is better but you have
to learn elixir first so I'm stealing
her and still having my own set that
home Christmas present not going
anywhere so I need to fix that so
instead of just complaining about these
things I actually started this thing
called junior pin stop there when I'm
teaching a lixia to first into 15 year
olds at my son school there and
everything I do is made available freely
on Beanstalk there and I need to get the
logo on the website as well there but
anybody should be if they're equally
crazy as I am just go i'll take this
material and ping-pong with me and find
ways to take this forward
mornings initial learning from this when
you take these kids when they're 18
month they get ahold of a phone and they
do something on it then they turn 13 14
they come to my class and as a command
line what's a command line and you just
walk there you have not been playing
with computers and it's not their fault
they've just been brought up in this
protective environment that doesn't
subject him to pain like the rest of us
with a big twins your Commodore 64
because the only thing you got there was
a command line for starters and then you
had to do something yes that's what
makes you a man or woman it doesn't
matter that's what in it and then so
that was one thing and then of course me
being a Mac user I could not explain to
them how to open up the command line so
I had to and then figured out that these
windows + R and then CMD and then you
have a command line there good first
problem solve then we go through that we
install Adam on all the machines and
that is then they install this editor so
you'd think that the logic is clear here
good then say now you open the editor
and you start typing in a program and
then 1 i'm gonna opens upward and start
typing in as like no no no this is not
going to work you're not going to type
in your program in word it's not going
to help you much so that's a different
thing there as well but then they start
getting it and one thing I've seen is
that functions they actually easy they
easy to understand it's just like
mathematics to them that's good
recursion on the other hand yeah comes
along a little more slowly there and
then I have one thing that I want to do
after the summer break some UI and find
a way to do some sensible UI stuff with
alexia i'm looking at nitrogen and some
of these things just so they can get
that kind of feedback in but again yeah
suggestions most welcome so there so
anyway so this gives you something that
that's something burning on addiction
everything's there so then sometimes
walking can also make you think of other
things there so what if you could start
in a nice
visual environment because there's
something to learning and a being in a
visual environment we cannot deny that
there and then you'll gradually open up
the boxes as you understand more you can
open up the boxes and see what's inside
these boxes and then staying with the
same concepts opening up more and more
and eventually you code everything in
text in VI or emacs there depending on
how evil you are there so and then you
start thinking okay maybe somebody else
thought about it and actually did
scratch they have this very intuitive
nice environment there so that's good
the only problem is that apart from the
peroxide intuitive so you can actually
read what's going on here it'sit's
sequential programming it's evil it's
not what we want to do we need to do
something further and sequential is
little sometimes important but the
little bit you do between sending
messages you see I untrained on tony
hoare CSP so this is this is how you
should do it so that's good for to inver
so then you've got another thing here
you have alexia which has these awesome
concepts for robots because process is
in message passing they fit in one
hundred percent how can we combine these
things to give us something bigger so we
take that each sensor actuator just the
process the wireless communication and
you end up with this visual environment
and then the first thing you do is you
give each of these element a default
behavior yeah there's a reason why I'm
into computer science and not graphic
design there but anyway you open up the
box and you can see the default code so
when people start putting in a sensor
and connected to something there'll be a
little default thing saying I will have
a color sensor here depending on what
color you're reading it'll turn on the
engine to do this or that and then that
code will be showing in the box when
they open it up and then gradually
they'll go from seeing the same concept
to your message there's wires showing
whether the messages are going and then
a little bit of code to do the
transformations on it it will be the
same concept from day one to the day
that they can just code
everything there then we were talking
about learning curve so you take a very
very simple visual environment that's
probably the one where we had my father
son moment well mostly a father moment
it turned out to be there yeah is that
you have you hit the ceiling extremely
fast because when you do these things
very simple their limits to what you can
do then it just stops and this is an
issue everybody's trying to do these
things you hit the ceiling very fast and
then it's not fun anymore so you have
fun for three months and then whatever
kid you have goes away then you can do
the fing the guys doing today you can
take the complex visual environment and
then the learning curve is insane and
I'll bet you doing that it's like
programming see you lose your hair so
don't do it it's just not worth it but
then again same concept from start to
end should give you a smooth learning
experience and we also have to admit
playing around with Lego and get it
robots to do stuff it's fun and it's
what triggers people to do something so
that's something they're there I just
need somebody that can do the UI then I
shall do the elixir programming and we
can get that rolling so the thinking
here is basic concepts processes message
passing and the modeling is more or less
straightforward so that's the kind of
Nirvana we want to go to and then
remember here the golden trinity of
Erlang or what the beams to church to
church the beamster here's share nothing
with message passing fail fast and their
failure handling these are the things
you need to embrace in your programming
and that's what's going to make good
programs it makes good programs on this
one and it also makes good programs when
you're doing anything else in Alexia and
your line so that's it thank you
we have five minutes of questions I'm
minutes for questions it looks like I've
I planted good questions yes yeah ok
yeah ok yeah well I've been involved in
getting rolling running on those pies
there's really a brick brick pie ok good
I'll have a look at that that could be
really good to get that rolling might
make it easier there well my solution
there is that you get something like I
want this kind of visual notation where
I can see my processes being key
building blocks and i also want one
message passing to stand out and then i
want to be able to again sir Sir click
on the boxes and then open up and see
the handling like the handling for the
handle event that's the kind of code I
want to see their little snippet West
painfully obvious you getting this one
in what do you want to do about it so
you're breaking down these things step
by step so that's my thinking at this
point if it works I don't know it's a
figment of my imagination yeah but
that's flow based programming
no unfortunately not I had chosen a
different track and I am sorry yeah yeah
yeah maybe I can use that to get a short
cotton on getting this rolling because
that would be really cool well anything
I can steal perfect and no flow it was a
no flow and that's and that's open
source good length okay good then then
something there for me to send also for
others to collaborate with me because I
that last time I checked at 24 hours
also in my day so yeah collaboration
good
yeah actually I tried that when I was
and then oh the okay the video still on
I'll say it anyway I actually in my
youth went to the dark side and I taught
java at the technical university to my
defense I taught them recursion they're
just so they learned how to think a
little in that and there I didn't use
the Russian dolls I used the towers of
Hanoi and then I had broad plates and
things from the Institute kitchen and
then I was shuffling these things around
and doing things that they sort of got
that one there but I'll think about the
Russian doll as well but they're getting
it slowly there but it's just yeah but
there yeah yeah yeah one of the things
and I think I have two more about it one
of the things I had success with which
not recursion was using pattern matching
for Yahtzee and detecting what scores
you have that they got very fast a lot
faster than I expected so that was
actually really good but I'll try the
Russian dolls then turn that into an
exercise they're more questions actually
have one does it exist on other robots
and can we can you welcome do you know
if we can work with addictions or kind
of robots not just illegal for example
do anything anything you can run along
on okay input alexion so the Raspberry
Pi work i mean the driver exchange is
very specific to that whole linux thing
and the whole mumbo jumbo that is very
much directed and they was directed at
one particular version of EV free dev
there and then there needs to be some
work on figuring out to be more
resilient to changes in the way they
represent thing in the in the file
system there but then again i showed the
macro there it's not terrible what you
have to do you need to find a way ok i'm
reading this file and i'm turning it
into something sensible on my side and
then you're gone whether it's the file
structure that changes that's good yeah
no no they're just regular files in the
the UNIX file system there or Linux yeah
but these seems totally straight to me
but you need to close them every time
you do something because when you do
when you open up the run file you need
to write it down and then it needs to be
flushed and to the file before the
automatic that happens inside that ev3
thing detects it there but it's that
works fast enough to see you saw the
line four or so there I'm not sure how
much speed we can give it and then it'll
still follow the line but it works fast
enough for that so yeah there's the last
question contiki thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
