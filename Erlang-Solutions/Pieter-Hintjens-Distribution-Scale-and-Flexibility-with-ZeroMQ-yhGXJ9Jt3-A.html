Garrett for inviting me again I was here
last year I'm not gonna you slice the
reason I don't you slice is that I tend
to make up my talk the evening before
depending on what's being discussed
ostensibly it's going to be about 0 mq
now you were at the keynote and you we
went through a list of attributes of a
reactive system decentralized
event-driven skill hole resilient
remember that yeah and you were probably
all asking yourselves this sounds fun
how do I actually do that they notice
it's like saying you must you know peeps
well live long and be happy these are
nice keywords but execution is a lot
harder than having the idea so luckily
for you luckily we began solving this
problem about five years ago
and we have the answer it's actually
it's actually that simple and there's no
sense Garcia from O'Reilly to us it has
the book there so go and buy the book is
by the fire six coffees and I will sign
it and I'm not gonna go into much detail
about the technology because it's been
here in exhausted details and I make our
money from selling books so you buy the
book it's a very good book what I will
very briefly explain why 0q is an
awesome answer to these problems there's
nothing only apps right there what it
does do well and I will also take that
into something a little bit more human
less technology more about people one of
my ideologies about software is that
it's really about people much more than
the bits and bytes of machines people
are our fundamental physics and building
a disability system is we have a large
architecture is essentially a bad or
amazing people okay
and although we are all engineers
go on really typical challenges are
people based so I will present to you
today the thesis that I got my mind last
night thanks to Barton which is based on
Conway's law which is about how to build
large systems and it really is also how
to build large district systems using 0
mq now we've noticed difficult user MQ
is they form certain categories there's
a specific category some people take it
before I did until system so they vanish
into the mists happy and successful they
may be basic story they don't talk once
again he was taken right
but a large number of people take it and
use it to the substrate but biggest are
and they have a problem crossing from
the world or in today to the world they
want to go to which is this amazing
world we talked about this morning so
I'll explain how to cross that uncanny
valley the chasm from the old way of
thinking to a new way of thinking it's
not just a bad software in libraries
it's but how we think and how we
organize ok and that's why I also like
that to successfully use this stuff so
very briefly what's your mq is and does
who does not notice hands up if you do
not know this okay
it's very briefly as a up to level 5 who
delivers palos it delivers contracts ok
think of it like that level 6 is the
contract is the encoding that is the
what delivers to applications be there
anywhere in the world really connected
to any transport it does have been an
adventure than well huge well - the
right strategies for throwing away
messages and not blocking and everything
else resilient simple good answers to a
whole bunch of problems as you will find
out when you look at that thing
ok to look at
Conway's law who knows Conway's law and
someone except from ours and someone
statement Conway's law
so I remember this for a long time ago
when we would be used to make compilers
this is in the days of all Poland and
it's the joke is you know a team of five
will make a compiler with four passes
because one guy has to be project
manager before guys we break it up and
the work will naturally structure itself
granted people will be all kinds of
rationalisation why four passes by the
way because there were five guys that's
all so turn this around and say let's
build a big system start by building the
team the organization structure of the
people structure of your company or
community and out of that will emerge
the software with the same similar
structure think of the team as the
framework on which the software will be
merged rather than the team being
something you kind of hire people in two
different offices have musics and so on
so if you tell me about decentralized
event-driven reactive resilient learning
driven software you're talking about
decentralized reactive resilient
skinnable
learning driven teams ok all of the
properties that we heard this morning if
I the software really applied to the
organization that makes the software
that's my thesis I think it's accurate
time will prove it I know there are many
companies that don't do this and they've
had very old-fashioned teams making what
loosely very modern software I think
they're just in a very high price for it
so there's this notion that you can't do
things like for example concurrency you
can scale just by sheer effort and
investment and you can do shared state
concurrency even to you know 16 threads
if you're willing to pay the questions
well of cost can you scale 16 threads by
not paying the same cost as one thread
do that skill to a million threads so
let's take some of the we know the
problems in shared state applications
you know the problems with failures and
blocks and synchronization points and
you know the slowest part of the whole
system you know all these problems
you've seen them all
think of similar problems in
organizations which are synchronous
think of meetings conference calls
who likes conference calls who enjoys
conference calls interesting who enjoys
meetings I mean apart from the social
aspect and the peer who enjoys actually
going to a meeting and thinks that's a
great way to work nobody I mean very few
people actually enjoy meetings as it's a
way to work we need them we have no
choice we've learned that they're the
will to communicate efficiently and
elusive assumptions but they're not an
enjoyable thing for me meetings are like
the mutexes of organizations there
anyone can block anyone can take control
and block something and synchronization
parts are incredibly expensive
incredibly bad for scalability so if
your organization depends on people
being in the same room that's very
similar as having software that depends
on people sharing the same stays the
treasure is a mistake it will not scale
and it will not build scalable software
cheaply and if your organization is
using Siri MQ and still working so to
successfully use 0q or anything like it
to build systems of the future let's go
through by analogy how we build such
systems and then by now you have those
organizations okay so what what are the
core elements of building a distributed
system we know what are the least we use
these words distribution
distributed first of all means that time
and space are broken up things happen at
different times things happen in
different places it's very important if
I'm talking to somebody they may not be
there they will not be here they may not
be the same thing I sent a message it
may arrive at some unknown future at
some unknown place and this very strong
assumption in shared state systems that
we are in the same space in the same
time is completely flawed of course it
works you call it the crack cocaine of
software developments I think is the
crack cocaine of organization it seems
very simple it does not scale it's gonna
cost a very expensive if your systems
are distributed over time and space
they're also heterogeneous they're also
different you have different languages
different operating systems you will not
be able to standardize on one language
it's a failure point to say we will use
language x is a dramatic failure it may
work in a short term it's a dramatic
failure that will kill your system that
will kill your company that will stop
you succeeding so by definition the
language is not the solution the
language will not help you you have to
be able to handle any language because
the team in the future different country
will have a different technology goes
without saying that we have advanced
accused that's a logical synchronize you
cannot send stuff if you waiting for an
answer in real time we've worked on
projects with time zones and it's really
difficult to have a meeting with four
different time zones people waking up at
four in the morning and someone else
with you know still at work at 10:00 in
the evening this is really really
difficult
that's the synchronization problem
sending a fence you got to see
is there a carry-on and the lazy
execution of events in a simple pipeline
is very scalable
am I making sense here okay
so cross language is very important and
then if you have people that are not
talking to each other not able to
resolve their assumptions by a brute
force which is amazing how do you
resolve the assumptions how do you agree
on what's going to happen how do you
collaborate without upfront agreement in
consensus who's using github here for
clue request we like it do you remember
what give homepage Deseret for pull
requests that all important phrase list
as you work without about front of
consensus it's absolutely critical not
having to seek consensus means you can
work as a currency you can work in any
time zone and you can come afterwards
and delivery of work and there's no
synchronization point it's a distributed
so the key to a dissipated protocol oh
sorry didn't get away this with
architectural protocols there our
contract is written by the evil lawyer
style people which thank you as a team
or as a person
talk asynchronously over time and space
to other pieces I remember when I made
AMQP the first version and there are a
bunch of areas that rabbit took it to
the spec without talking to us
implemented clients and servers and came
to us the human station and did talk we
our clients in their service in our
service their clients talk to each other
from the very first day without a single
fault
protocols do that they let you work a
secrecy without any upfront consensus so
protocols are a technical thing that
we've used in the past for building
systems they also work for building
organizations you can have the same
approach you can write the rules for an
organization as an RFC I've shot without
me must not effective in my and my
process stalking myself I refer to the
IETF RFC whatever it is you want create
the keywords see these are our keywords
for collaboration and we have a new
project you say here's our process RFC
22 read it if you agree kind of
maintainer and it works shockingly
simple right by buying into a
distributed process you're able to work
completely in synchrony from other
people okay so now failure we've talked
about the failure this morning you know
failure but failures happen well I'll go
further than that I would say that
failure is part of your process not just
tolerating failure or recovering from
failure but expecting failure even
encouraging failure learning from
failure this is old cultural dichotomy
some countries hate failure Korea France
it's just really bad to fail if you fail
at school make a mistake in your exams
you're in trouble and people aim for
perfection until you're is punished
other cultures tell you is poorer
tolerated and expected and those
cultures learn much faster
certainly when it comes to the systems
that we run we expect failure everywhere
we expected every message to get lost we
expect every process to crash every
Network together though we expect that
we build it into our assumptions if your
protocols
you have that we have heart beating as a
kind of basic element of our technology
we don't take it by surprise well the
same comes organizations we take failure
as part of our process so for example I
have this morning a patch on
0nq master pool request or some coder I
consider completely insane I'm being
polite to the garbage thing I don't have
use cases like that but I'm saying I
still don't get it after five Dino's I
still don't get it I'm gonna merge it
anyway
what emerges patch trying to it into one
commit try get it to pass the Travis CI
on that emerging it'll sail in I'm
pretty sure that that will break our our
master in functional terms certainly
insanity terms it would become bizarre
things
what is this coding it's a very bizarre
security proxy thing I don't understand
it I don't understand it I'm pretty sure
to focus but I want anyway except it all
emerges because it will fail and we will
learn and we will learn our way through
the problem and it gives us as an
organization there as a community open
source community the way to build code
by failing and learning collecting
problems trying to solve them happily
failing learning is has to be caring
going through and we spoke this morning
also about latency better performance
there's no point having adventure that
system it takes you two hours to process
a transaction you wanted to too many
seconds okay so the speed is very
important
who here has submitted a past
open-source project ever was it accepted
to keep your handle it was accepted okay
good
do you prefer to be accepted fast or
slow what's what's your favorites your
perfectionism as a contributor it's an
issue for six months or so thank you for
six minutes what you prefer sir of
course available submission have been
accept right you want response to your
individual effort as fast as humanly
possible you want someone to actually
look at it briefly just Jake just look
saying margin you want someone to catch
your all your vulgar mistakes but they
don't want to be embarrassed by someone
insisting on perfection like this commit
message is the proper English seriously
dude come on
so the responses responsiveness over
this to be the assistant maps into
responsiveness with distributed
organization and how fast can you get a
cycle a persistent cycle and too late
where you know is it is it a matter of
hours days and again synchronization
parts it have to hold a conference call
or a meeting to discuss a particular
patch you look at right now this is the
kind of situation of you seen many
companies I would make is change let's
discuss it let's get our consensus from
five divisions in the VP this gets you
know twelve sign offs let's get a
document I still don't trust you let me
get another another proof I want to see
a prototype and you go through six
months of stress and the guy says I
don't really need is anything sir
no make the patch merge it try you don't
like it revert it I mean get is showing
me simple to recover from the states
there's no excuse for not allowing the
states as maintainer all I ask is that
all those commits are to that one
they won the first but don't have ten
reverses not annoying makes a mess of
things
so then the next thing in a disabuse
system
who's in charge but I think you
mentioned it this morning but there's a
notion of control where's the authority
in industry in a centralized system
who's in charge of the internet apart
from the NSA I mean who's in charge
the answer is nobody's this is the funny
thing it's like this is a question we
used to ask ourselves is who who pays
big today
who runs this thing together it's so
cross collaboration when no one's in
charge it's a very interesting dynamic
of how he communicates and learn also in
software also in organizations when I
was in charge in software
there's no critical points of failure
with the internet any box can die and
they do over time it doesn't matter at
all and the answer is you are you are
now maintainer of our project let me
teach you github we have no branches at
six commands here's an interface book
it's hope you will now review every
patch and you will always miss the merge
button thank you and please read the
equity of Travis and they're like who
middle managers are a problem middle
managers are the brokers of a
distributed system
insist on being important because they
are important so that you know we exist
and therefore we want work to do and
definitely will creates a populating
synchronization no even middle managers
prefer to be productive and to know that
they're just floating and coasting along
being in the way however if you're in an
organization with a certain structure
and now we can say let's say you're
hired as a consultant to go into this
very big architecture and fix it the guy
says I want you to make it reactive to
you have a mainframe when you have
Oracle database and you have a gunship
VT 20 terminals there and I wants to
become reactive not yet go for it fix my
mainframe okay so you can't just do that
of course you can't just go and change
existing systems they don't think
they're not just difficult to change
their design to not be changeable I mean
half the work of building an
organization is to survive attempts to
change it after service the theory of
politics is organizing to win some
conflicts then organize it to stop other
people from eating it taking you out and
organizations defend themselves very
aggressively against change and if you
go to an organization see we're going to
change you they will fire you they will
kill you they will fire you they will
murder you and you will they will result
in a great day it's not a nice thing to
do
doesn't matter if there is the VD
supports you he will get kicked out as
well so the way you change a big
architecture the way you change an
organization is you start again with a
small one obviously you start with the
kernel core
if it's boxes it's one you know one box
one word type of concept one product so
if it's people it's one team outside
several it's how ibn made the PC some
guys off of the campus and a few people
can learn a new process can work through
the issues they can internalize it and
they can start building success and even
then it's very risky if they get
discovered over the Soviet kicked in a
tic-tac but if they can do it stealth
and get to the point with actually
delivering some value to someone else
efficient importance they make a
sponsorship and they may be able to
survive and grow that certainly once you
have a small team that's internalized a
successful strategy for distributed
development and building that kind of
software then you can grow then you can
scale scalability in software
scalability in organizations comes from
expanding on a internalized success by
that I mean you have to have a
successful core to build on you can't
just add boxes to a failure you get more
filling this faith groups famous theory
about adding people to a slow project
makes it even story the purpose not lack
of persons like it was the promise back
process the scaling it back was this
makes it worse so once you have a good
process once it's working once the core
team has internalized the process and
can teach other people there's
confidence that can tell them why I
answer all the questions and say yes it
works because because look then you can
grow until that point you can grow all
you can do is spend money and be in
trouble so probably if you're going to
build large distributed systems and you
have the chance the best possibility is
a start up a separate company with its
own money its own authority where you
can start internalize the principles and
then grow slowly over time and as you
get a market success you can grow pretty
fast once you've got your cloud
architecture working you can add more
workers Chiqui the cost of adding people
should be very low scalability is
essentially bad tactics about having
successful patterns and then reducing
the cost of adding marvel at the metal
question is - as possible to zero so for
instance when we have a community of
contributors how do we scale we don't
scale by the marketing and by propaganda
be skilled by reducing the cost of
participation to join should be really
really really cheap which it is few
things to sign or agree there should be
fact we only have that one thing with
our contract please read the rules it's
a game we're playing with the rules and
then you can join and even those rules
are pretty obvious unless you have a
strange existing mindset to reprogram
you that's more work but for ordinary
naive developers is what they would
expect it's what they dream of so it's
fitting of their expectations it's very
energy so low formality that we can
scale very quickly
we also skilled by letting people build
their own purchase it's the same
anticipate assistance if you're if
there's a protocol you can improve
medicine
anybody here implements the web browser
or web server HTTP server it's fun isn't
it you take the spec you read it you say
hey okay this is kind of complex but it
said it's a twenty line program the
first version and you start making code
implements a protocol that should be
allowed in any organization and
e-community
take the specs implement them I want you
to own the right to design certain
domain somebody naval in that space
certainly everything is possible for us
somebody may be responsible to certain
parts of the code people can create
their own projects they plug into an own
framework taking skill and the best
judgment of where to invest time is
locally people know the problem they
know the market they were the best
again that's where a centralized
decision-making as we get tragic thing
because you cannot actually know what's
happening and finally shared state and
centralized state it's very much the
same Authority this notion that we could
know all the problems in one single
space when in fact the problems are
decentralized as much as the solutions
the problems are spread at an advanced
landscape and the only way to actually
discover them and answer them
marginally accurately and cheaply is to
be there on that space decentralized and
have that local point of view and the
other to solve that so that's Conway
stop organization will produce the
software given the right tools in the
right structure it's a bad organization
it's what is bad software if it's
distributed decentralized scalable
event-driven lazy opportunistic
organization and I love to produce that
kind of software that's the thesis we'll
see next year how far this goes how well
it works thanks to Martin for raising
that idea and we have to have some
questions in some discussion there okay
so
this is say this is a I would say it's a
talents of creative people so developers
basically here's the problem is
developers if you let them work freely
on anything they want to work on they
will they will not actually work on a
business critical issues at all will
just go off and you know have fun and
stuff it was this very important time
writing that you compiler why because
also optimize database it Dixon you know
I make I'm making you go pilots from no
developers like to make stuff artists
like to make stuff
$39.99 if it's not answering a real neat
that's still that's a waste of time they
may be fun but there shouldn't be
earning a salary for that so mid
management's management job management
job is to ensure that every line of code
every line of code is connected tangibly
and measurably to a business need in
other words if you are developer if you
work for me and you're committing
matches to my repository and I can't see
for every single commit the problem is
solving spelled out explicitly spelled
that and you telling me why this is the
simplest possible solution to that
problem I will pay you for that much
like that's fine you can use you can do
this but I'll even let you four can do
it in one space don't do it in my
repository my codebase will not have
technical debt if you're giving me there
I mean whatever did you as a problem how
I made for you for doing that
I certainly trance cute
the communities it's a recurrent thing
so engineers shouldn't be free it's not
having a server just running in a corner
what's a server doing oh it's serving
doesn't know no it's good to be dealing
with events from the outside world store
that supply chain of problems all the
way from the customer all the way
through to the developer and all the way
back and a supply chain has to be built
and connected and react responsive and
resilient and fast and then problems
come in get broken down and what we
humans are very good at is departing
conquered were regularly taking large
problems and breaking them down and then
finding the merits and specializing in
particular areas and solving them we're
very good at that and you'll find that
engineers are actually much happier when
they're solving real problems the
weather just inventing stuff we did
they're actually much happier having
paid constructive feedback for their
work than to be working for six months
on something that they hope they hope
will be useful because they're often
wrong with the fact that mostly wrong
with that the most visionary work is
just how do you prioritize this is the
number one problem with any workload
management any is prioritization how do
you prioritize the events coming in the
queue
first you have a cute you don't just
throw a lens at a system say here's
10,000 events have a cute and they come
in order as the first and the most
obvious the most efficient is first come
first serve and you have a queue with
one event at the time if your quotas are
processed ten events at a time that
won't work it's gonna get very confused
very bizarre so here's my message
processing tasks
having cute and I will send it offensive
one by one that's a very simple very
effective 80% kids so the goal with if
you're responsible for project
management is to take all of your issues
and then say to your your one developer
let's say this is the issue I want you
to work on next this one what it does
that we save a perfect he receive share
once we work on next and as he gets at
that you say okay here's your Q of
issues let me give you a cube two or
three issues you can choose and as they
get better you can say okay and that's
as a team you can build up your queue of
issues and have a few that are high
priority all the rest are just crashing
here so keep the visibility very very
short-term there's no emergency critical
high priority medium priority low
priority nice to have that's trash
there's only do it now I'll talk to it
back there's all this birthday the
second thing is you can have multiple
queues you can't actually have a high
particular party queue if you really
want that obviously a production issue
will be fixed now whereas a issue for
you know next month's travel season will
be fixed in maybe two weeks time I
always do you have multiple queues which
we do that works as well that's a little
bit more fast so in terms of
prioritization you love all of your
issues you're tracking as a problem
statement not as solutions the best
problems that every issue envelope is in
a project is problem name of problems
which that problem possible solution the
problems when you force and this your
tracker has everything along explicitly
there's no email communication in the
value shoes there's no chance about
issues except in fact they should be
everything should be on on paper so you
can come back and look at it afterwards
and see what was discussed and see why
there are mutations like that as a
stranger you come in and see and get the
whole stage there's no spells of bad
discussion and then someone will just
mark those issues is critical somebody
who understands the business someone who
represents the clients will say that it
was polluted next I want those two back
tomorrow I need
to deliver something and there there
there's their betting I mean they're
working for the business they have that
need they can they can express it to
developers that seems to work and it
maps to a distributed architecture where
workers get requests one by one from
something like those the organization
that can talk to clients a typical
architecture is that helped Martin you
mention management
I see management firm is another Potter
and I think with many organizations
actually lack is leadership rest so
management represents an anti-pattern
yes so I would argue that leadership is
responsible for setting Direction
helping with the prioritization and also
providing resource but not managing
individuals which is very different is
this a question or a statement miss
Jordan there's there's a lot of work
being done on business structures
management structures so on a very good
references Chris Argyris with his model
one model to have a look at that if you
can and it's a very interesting
discussion there about how we learn as a
group difference between a hierarchy and
collaboration in a hierarchy very smart
people who learn something from a
reference source from a book or from
university whatever it is mainly apply
that they pilot in a straight line very
aggressively very dominantly
you know I have read the book and not an
expert I don't have applied this wisdom
and I will bully my way through to
success because you are all wrong and I
am right and I have the authority it's
my money or I know the boss where I have
married to his daughter or whatever it
is so that's kind of a mobile one and it
can mean moderately successful they
confuse results because you can actually
you can actually be right very different
multi to is where we learn as we as we
go through our knowledge that the combat
is a starting point that as we're
working we're learning and the
leadership in that is simply to tell the
team this is how we're going to work
we are going to learn like this I'm not
going to tell you what to do I might
tell you what the problems are I might
let you choose which ones you work on
and I might judge you on that afterwards
I might I might actually farm you if all
you work on our rubbish problems
seriously if you're not that good we are
a team you know we're like a football
team if you're not good enough I will
get you off the team as a team we will
survive and I will find him buddy I will
find you computers I will find you
internet and coffee or tea
I will find you desks to sit on but I
won't tell you how to write your call I
will give you rules if you need them and
objects all of your prose another local
program that's great if that's what you
want you don't want someone say this is
how we won this is your us specification
document here's a 10,000 page analysis :
making did you get that just change
companies my community for example that
is my job and you manage the community
right well Henry Ford was taking pity on
skilled labor and turn them into you
know robots in a certain sense which at
the time was successful if you look at
how to yo to build cars today it's very
different until you tell everybody have
responsibility when there's a problem
they stop the supply chain they stop the
whole thing it's an assertion they say
stop we are going to fix the problem are
going to learn and then carry on so the
cars all come out perfect it's a very
different approach but it requires a
much more educated workforce than
circumstances a lot more culture of how
to work better which is contained over
the years so I can't blame Henry Ford
for doing it I was established at the
time was what we had
today we know a lot better the magnet
managers are essential in the sense that
it's it's insane to ask developers of
the clients since the same time
developers go for money or think about
problems like infrastructure I mean
physically their job is to focus on
solutions and they should be aware of
things like the cost of code and
technical stuff that's their job so they
need somebody to protect them from the
outside world and feed them in different
ways that's what the manager we should
be doing solving problems looking for
problems so when I was working in some
teams I thought of myself as you know in
ice hockey you have these guys and score
two goals and he's really big nasty guys
with no teeth to protect them from other
bullies right I was my job I was just
fighting off the insane
vice-presidents who wants to destroy the
project selected for promising kickoff
to the good guys could score goals
that's what management should do I think
is protect their team from two theories
also the way we understand designing
software
who here does code reviews in their job
or it's subject to it or customer has
them okay
code reviews are they synchronous or
asynchronous synchronous right so
they're glowing there's basically a
problem they're a bad thing not a good
thing now you're like Peter if they're a
bad thing that means that people just do
any code well obviously learning is a
good thing
code reviews as a learning tool are very
code reviews as their way to stop
somebody from committing code are a very
big mistake if you can't commit by the
code you can't make mistakes you know
the story of if you go to a doctor's
office nice attends an experiment on
people because this office and you sit
in the waiting room and smoke comes in
the door then the normal reaction which
110 people will have is a smoke smoke
inspired fire means death I'm leaving
right standard however in that same room
was two other people sitting there and
the same smoke comes on in the door then
what they all think is smoke smoke means
fire and fire means death but I could be
wrong so I stay and two-thirds people
will just stay in the room and not live
and they look at their look around at
strangers people they never see again or
never met before it a look at them and
say he's not worried or she's not
worried I'll stay and I'm not going to
look like an idiot who would rather die
than be proven wrong that's how
important statuses and code reviews are
relating to blackmail people into
submission fire threatening them with
status saying we will make you look like
a fool
just really really bad so of course you
can review code and we do that but it
should be an asynchronous thing that
happens without stopping the commit
process that stopping the actual
learning process so the best way to see
code as a as a problem is to see it
actually running and fillings see
someone else patching it and improving
it
that can't happen till is be committed
so much rather take the cold merchants
and prove it explain why I improved it
you can argue with somebody about
improving it up and if they don't learn
by observation they're not going to
learn anyway I'm teaching them a pattern
for learning if they don't take the
pattern then they're probably not going
to help we have one more question then
you have lunch
is anyone working like this today of
their organizational community its kind
of distributed adventure than lazy a
reactive model one two yes okay
my prediction is that those of you who
aren't will be out of a job within a
certain future are the your condition
will die your company will go bankrupt
in a not very distant future talking
about a few years so if you're
interested in having a long term future
in this business and I've said this
bacterium cute many times this is the
kind of thing you have to know to have a
job in the future
decentralize disability programming save
your organization's look for
organizations if you can't find them
make them but give you this freedom
because with it you can be very powerful
that if you will just be a head before
robot and you'll eventually just lose
your job thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
