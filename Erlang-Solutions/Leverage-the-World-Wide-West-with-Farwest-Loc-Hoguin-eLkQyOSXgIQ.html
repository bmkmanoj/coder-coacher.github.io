first language I the cowboy guy so I
thought cowboy a web server you probably
have her feet by now and I funded the
99th of a few months ago we are planning
to do only ere long open source
development and it's going quite well or
will so I wanted initially to finish
forest for this presentation but i did
not have enough time and also the wishes
took a lot longer than I expected so
there's no code or almost nothing
Friedrich but it coming soon so first
let's let's take a look at what we have
in our own for web development we are
nitrogen which is pretty much web for a
long developers that is how long the
repairs don't need to create HTML by
hand they don't need someone to do it
for them it's pretty much and we work
whole package to do web development for
our then we have chicken Goebbels which
is pretty much ice with your body's
working along so this one as only detail
templates that means you have to avoid
HTML or at least you have by the effort
and then we have the Tony which is a CLS
that is an application that you can
install and configure and be ready to go
as you are but you can also write Ln
code to expand it of course this
solution
as many constraints on the present King
application so it all depends on your
needs and then the rest solution that is
where go bury my saga for the singing
and or so much evil and yours you can
take the server as a basis and read your
application from the Gundam of course
it's ratnamala so part of these
solutions of one week program it's very
simple it's that along developers suck
at fighting user interfaces they're
really really really really good so of
course along the repairs are very wet
they work then fight very good elegant
but when it comes to the time to be a
user interface it's a bit awful and I
won't take any examples I think you all
know how it's like so of course there's
a few solutions you can write HTML from
your uncle instead of by hand it's
amplifies will be those things for the
Aaron developers but that doesn't make
the very bitter so I think around
developers should never avoid user
interface code it's not their own for
that we have the front-end developers
which are pretty much the HTML and CSS
guys they know how to do it they are
usually assisted by graphics Gary and
all they need will is to write HTML CSS
and JavaScript so the program with then
is that they don't know how long so you
don't see very a lot of front-end
developers in the wrong world and that's
a problem because when you want to write
a big into in the league web application
you need a frontal game at least one
maybe more the cleon tail but I work at
currently as a three of them so in depth
three of them and none of them know
album and none of them will they don't
need a line forever they only need HTML
CSS and years and that's important so
both along developers and front-end
developers have different concerns and
the important thing is that the rock is
completely separate they have to talk to
add sugar to establish common
communication bull but the fronton guy
doesn't care what the bacon is and
that's important photon carries can work
with our own but they have to have the
process simplified so they don't have to
know how to work with it so they need a
common language which is pretty much
West which is already used by your own
developers and content developers also
patent developers don't use it as much
yet but the trend is going and if we do
that if we use West as a common language
then both the wrong side and the front
and side will only need to know the API
the rest api to discuss so they don't
need to know it's a long behind it can
be anything but they have to define this
mattifies so this is where Farwest comes
in for West is pretty much the same as
before for how long developers you have
the cowboy waste resources which are
pretty much the same as web machine and
that's about it that that's the only
thing they need to do right and expose
they don't need to write any HTML no she
s and I know you hate tgs and that's it
they should do as they always did and
then so yeah far west is pretty much
done for fronting deserters what I want
is to bring attention to how long by
allowing people to make go ahead looking
applications and you can do that easily
today so you have to appear to the
fronton people and that's all that's all
it's about so for ice packs many
features and none of the features
require any El Nino rage at all except
of course and studying your own that's
the one thing they need to met that's
all then once they are elongate start
they can download the project template
or right there on and stop the server
and that's about it they can know the
rope using forest and they won't need to
restart the server or anything into the
course of down development so to do this
we simply recompile occurred including
the client side code pretty much the
same as mature webs regular accept it
also works for a on site
and at worst they only need to refresh
the page to view their changes of course
it's West it's the most important part
and because of this we need to provide
the front end developer with many tools
to write the JavaScript code because
they they don't know how how it works
behind if we don't provide them with
this information and that the story it
is and of course I'm talking JavaScript
but highest is also get so you can write
a sample website using only get and it
it will be West and you don't need to
use unusual aspect so a script comes in
when you start posting resources pastor
forget so the first thing the most
important tool is to provide
documentation of the Restless of this
the home developers our waiter and that
can be generated because the wrong
developer will of course document the
hood or at least I hope so and we can
take this documentation and in addition
to the exported interface provided a
pretty good documentation of its
resources so we can automatically
generate a rest api and that's very
important i think and most importantly
we can reuse this documentation when
they begin to the
I've process I took about this softer oh
so far west country's bullet which is a
projector width on top of the way it
allows doing pretty much what socket i/o
does that is what so get even when you
don't have a boys'll that supports it so
you have a continuous stream to the
server and when you choose it so we have
events on the JavaScript side which are
going back to Jessica but does not need
for anything else and you can we save
the events on the south side using your
bullet angler you should probably go
together to check into the project
there's link insulator it's very simple
and what's very good however is that you
can do west over a bullet connection
that is you already have one string to
the server so why not use it for HTTP
calls and that's what we are going to do
and that means the West girls are going
to be a lot more efficient so we can do
them we can do a lot of them if we need
the request isn't as JSON and its then
some dispatcher through cavalli so it
works the same except at the entry point
and then you can receive droids like you
would have with a jquery object skull of
course will we use combo is rooting for
far west so does nothing you
except that we have we'll build a tool
for configuring it without touching your
uncle so nothing complicated and then we
have a small API that's enabled by
default but only for development we have
storage which is going to be Peter kayak
or coach gb by the effort the photon
developer can put request to the data
URL and create manipulate originator so
the photon developer then doesn't need
to have a skimmer to start writing code
you can already vydra user interface
submit information and return on his
actions so it's all made to avoid having
an arm developer to divide this code
before the front end developer can can
work out same goes for the dispatch list
the environment variables and of course
we have URL for all the tools William
and Elise powers we have another tool
which is going to be very good to
increase the productivity which is
marking a URL to resources that simply
we say that I query in each in its
configuration and little this data so
it's used
to allow developers to start writing
templates are good on the data before
resources album it's just another phase
two we configure a new I'll configure
what data queries this URL with Tiger
using maybe get information post
information and vital mean the result in
the template of hook great so this is of
course the rest of scaffolding you can
keep it you can build features using
these tools and then choose to keep the
tools maybe some of the features you'll
fight don't need Kristen code customer
sources so why not keep them and of
course you care you'll be able to add a
few hooks to identification and that
sort of thing man and you can also use
this order the best example is a wiki
wiki is pretty much a page you erase the
data you you display it and then you
have a form to edit it so you can do
that using this mechanism and I want to
insist that you don't need any ailment
knowledge to do all this and that means
that photon developers can use our even
if they don't know it and that's very
important because they don't need to ask
their own developer any question they
don't need to ask you to set up reserves
for their development and maybe they
they don't admit
they don't even need an hour long
developer which would be bad for you but
it's just a fox more application so it's
okay and of course it's still around so
we still have all the concurrency
default oh heavens and the distribution
but of course and this one is important
we have phantom and clients so we are
going to take the airplane mechanism in
OTP to complain the clean side that is
the border and we can do this by putting
much writing to the buzzer code like
Gonzaga so it would I say it would be
overloaded I save a callback card and
you can change culbert car and that's
about it and in the worst case this
coach Anker can something of a load the
page of course this one requires an alum
developer to write the upgrade the OTP a
guy that's that's a given so far west is
going to be more direct the best for
West is going to contain a voicing of
this query here maybe as plugging
differences and not sure yet but it's
going to have also a lot of plugins to
for example of already written wiki blog
that kind of features and the plugins
are auto pay applications so
those applications are going to simply
register themselves with forest and then
you can use them as you want you can
they can contain also not just occurred
but assets as JavaScript CSS image tools
anything and of course since there were
to pay applications you can use them to
generate what a POS and that's quite
important because that's what you want
to do when you put it in production and
of course they can be a go ahead so
nothing special here and if you don't
read made for web development so we are
going to have a few features to import
the the efficiency of delivering the
applications we can for example minify
the CSS life reducing the the transfer
size and of course we have
identification which is quite important
maybe also sessions and until necessary
at emotional relation which is also
important for the web at least when you
need to support more than one yoga
knowledge and unicode so the
dependencies are going to be of course
coboy great i talked about it earlier
sheriff which is simply for liquid data
validation it's a pass transform that
takes all types to to validate the input
data and also gold rush and salon which
you can hear about at
wiped after the next one and for the
templates we are going to use LED tail
by default and j6 for Jason of course
there's the only used for the tools so
you can replace them Israel and jay Park
is going to be used for the architecture
so it's going to be quite quite easy to
to plug into it because you only need to
register your process to receive
messages and then on the clean side will
go for boost help Angie coil which are
pretty much stand out and we are not
sure i hack push the bay for the backend
of course like I said you can replace
any of the dependencies forward doesn't
care what you do with mr. clean side or
with your record you do as you want it's
going to be listen said like rockabye
that is a base decertified resource
called yesterday and the timing is this
we stopped the rapid rail development
starting after the conference I hope to
have something working for the next
conference I want result far west there
but in London I don't know when it is
but we hope to provide a demonstration
of the technology and of course you can
help we accept patches you can try the
project submit bugs and so on and you
can also sponsor it if you are
interested here are the links so the
repository is currently empty it's going
to other few permits starting next week
and the website our company website is
also is also empty at this point it's
all getting good so any questions
burn it yeah it's a it's something up
trying to give a common interface for
building a string between the water and
the cellar that means you have the same
colors on the council to doing anything
that is to to make a swing it will use
behind the same a WebSocket if he can
but otherwise it can fall back to Long
Pauline or any other and solar cell you
are a common interface whichever
transports you you used that is a
WebSocket lowering our coming to the
same
yeah yeah
unclear what those endpoints you showed
like the environment endpoint or routing
comes with farm with or for ya it's 40
Tang from mucking us to resources right
but somebody has to create the resources
yeah of course but we don't what we do
is provide special resources that we are
200 the data it wishes for most small
cases but of course yeah well you you
live your property so you put the files
into a folder with fun add those to the
dispersed wrist if necessary and that's
allotted by default it's going to have a
static folder that is going to be solved
so and your question yeah
resources is that way now it's not part
of Cabaye it's not going to be it's
going to be part of probably diplomacy
of the West it's not ready yet there's
just a quick very quick proof of concept
so it needs to get up and I probably
release it separately because it can be
used wisco go in without forest and you
love question thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
