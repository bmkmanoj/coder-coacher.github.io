chance to hear the very interesting
presentation by lab he already discussed
some of the properties of the Erlang
line width of the airline vm in my
presentation i will try to discuss them
quickly again but later i will focus on
showing some of the use cases for
airline as i have explained before there
are quite a few airline factories around
the world nowadays on those at those
conferences companies would present how
they used early researchers would
present some new interesting projects
but it also turns out that not all the
companies that do use airline admit that
that's the technology in their
technology stack some of those maybe
feel like this is a competitive
advantage some others just didn't have a
chance to present which is why I think
that is important to actually educate
others how we use airline where is where
it has been put in production what was
the thing and so my presentation will
just focus on some of the presentations
you could find on airline factory com
website I have stolen some slides from
different people here but my intention
is to once again just highlight some of
the interesting my opinion are use cases
first I have few slides just putting
features of airline here headline being
a functional language gives a nice high
level of abstraction so to get rid of
pattern matching we get quite concise
readable programs I very much like the
comment my left that the airline code is
like what you see is what you get kind
of code it's support it has support for
concurrency which should very much helps
with scaling systems on multi-core
machines
it has soft real-time properties which
is again a very nice advantage as well
the real-time web as we have heard
brought in some other areas like
telecoms were soft real-time systems are
needed
its robust because it has very
interesting approach to consistent error
recovery I will not go into details of
all this my in my slide because we don't
have enough time to discuss this but
here I just want to highlight some of
the interesting features which actually
make add up to a platform on top of
which interesting systems and solutions
are built
distribution is definitely one of those
it is built into the Erlang vm it's
relatively easy for a programmer to
communicate between the nodes in a
cluster in a ring so systems like ryuk
distributed database are relatively easy
to build at least the distribution layer
of it
is very nicely expressed through airline
syntax
another feature hotpot loading it was
mentioned already today could be used in
production which is nice but it's also
very very nice feature for developers as
it as the development cycle short you
just add a new feature to your code
recompile and load the new module into
your system that you are testing which
is a very nice feature one it shortens
the each iteration of development
airline is not a ghetto it has external
interfaces towards other external
systems and the technologies it is quite
portable as you already have edline
running on unix windows vxworks and such
and they will last but not least is a
feature of us for support for symmetric
multiprocessing where airline vm can
take advantage of old available course
of your CPU i guess your laptops today
have dual core intel sore quad cores
already but in production systems you
already see 24 core cpus so how do you
take advantage of this new power of your
hard work
thanks to the feature of the M which
allows spreading airline processes
across old available
chorus of the CPU headline vm can
actually take advantage of this new
hardware architectures
okay this was just a short introduction
and now on a couple of slides I would
like to show how this how different
industries had a chance to use airline
with success so we have games messaging
databases cloud automotive just name a
few
first comes the slide about the mode
where it's the Irish company
where we use airline as an
infrastructure for the online game call
of duty black ops they have quite a few
users online as you may guess over two
million concurrent users airline is
being used here as a core server for
controlling heightened task
so logic of the game is in a Python task
but all the distribution layer of the
TCP handling this is done by airline so
interesting use case where both
technologies combined together allow
them to serve such mass of online users
another example Luca
where we use also airline for social
gaming this is quite the popular set of
games that Google has made as we report
by actually grow so this is maybe
already a bit outdated but having 1
million daily users generates quite a
lot of traffic having so many requests
per second this is online gaming creates
a lot of challenges so in this
particular case airline has been used to
store user data airline processes
encapsulate state very nicely the number
of airline processes that we can run on
each machine can be up to millions
so this is actually the way that airline
is paid for well an advantage for for
Google packets
we have also airline being used in
messaging world which is actually quite
natural due to the nature of airline
processes and message passing for
example facebook chat feature which was
what a while ago but it has been
implemented to with a bit of help from
airline where billion of user messages
will process per day and for each user
in the system and airline process was
created and again it was not only
pushing the messages but also keeping a
state of the user and by the way
facebook chat team got an airline user
of the year award in 2009
so this is this was also good news for
them but also for us their land
community because thanks to them a lot
of people were actually looking into our
line
there's quite famous XMPP implementation
in Erlang in jeopardy which implements a
lot of extensions and with this running
it takes advantage of airline features
like distribution for tolerance
cross-platform and so on which is why
quite a few companies around the world
like she adopt this here on my slide I
just put a few like Jabba the door
japser PL as a pastor but they're quite
a quite lot of fun at others too
another example of how Ireland was used
in messaging and what's up
they are actually very bright the
engineering team they have tweaked the
airline vm slightly to push it to its
limits all of those modifications have
been published on github so we are
available not all of them are part of
the mainstream as far as I know yet but
what they have done with airline vm is
incredible we are talking here about
quite modern hardware with 24 logical
CPUs a lot of RAM as you can see and
those are the numbers that they were
shared with us few months ago and during
the airline factor in San Francisco
almost eighty five percent cpu
utilization across all 24 logical CPUs
this is really a lot with two dot eight
million users connected per box at peak
nine per box this is really a lot and
again of course this required a lot of
skills of the engineering team as we
were tweaking it the vm as well but the
airline has been used as a baseline
platform for the system
few slides about the database solutions
built on top of airline we have ryuk
here a masterless distributed database
which is scalable
you can add not as many notes well as we
have heard action today bring one of the
presentations there's drag Corps used
here as well so interesting project
interesting product there are quite a
few companies out there using drag
already I just put here a few names like
Comcast the amber boxer also some of the
classified ads are using online store
images I sorry react store images like
slandered oh true
so this is an interesting database to
look at that there's another one couchdb
also implemented in airline which is a
schema 3 and it has interesting
replication model with bi-directional
company detection so again this is one
of those no sequel databases and is
sometimes we refer to them which is
being used in modern web development but
nadolny and the developing it was built
on top of the Erlang fear
some of the services outer the the use
airline for different purposes like
github where airline is used dispatch
requests to Ruby machines the business
logic of github being implemented Ruby
but airline serving as the first layer
heroku
again airline use the for distributing
traffic for automatic scaling so airline
is now being more and more used in cloud
environments as we see the growth is
quite interesting
in this slide which I borrowed from 47
signals the interesting thing is airline
and see comparison because when people
try out airline for the first time we
sometimes say okay well this is her line
p.m. right so code is interpreted this
never be fast but interesting
measurements done on the IO intensive
Network intensive applications with some
degree of concurrency show that is not
that's not necessarily the case here we
have to implementation free
implementations different languages
of the same chat feature of campfire and
the interesting bit is here that airline
can serve almost as many requests as C
implementation would do having bit less
code base to do the same the Latin c is
also very interesting and instead of
using a lot of OS processes which are
not always easy to coordinate which is
this is using just one airline vm
process and within the airline OS
process a lot of airline processes will
be found each one to probably serve each
new tcp request but this is interesting
part we have less code we have less OS
processes to work with but still did at
least the benchmark survive been doing
show that this was not so much slower
than C implementation
and another use case i put here on my
slides it's a quick check it was also
mentioned here today and it's well it's
used for property based testing which is
an interesting approach quite different
from unit testing that is widely adopted
here we actually generalize we have some
properties defined first domain defined
first and then we can generate a lot of
use cases for free meaning it just takes
time to generate them but it doesn't
involve the user it's automatically
generated within a random fashion and
where this has been used well in very
many projects we are using this on
day-to-day basis but one of the
interesting use cases for this
automotive industry the quick big
company behind mixer has shirts quite a
few presentations on how we use airline
and quick check to test and verify
modern cards where you have it well tens
if not hundreds nowadays so-called ECU's
which are small units in a car which
need to communicate with each other they
were responsible for every small
operation of your car and now how do you
make sure that all they talk to each
other there are no bugs and actually
that if if those processors come from
different vendors that way I still can
talk to each other so
no longer talking about the scalability
and falter ends here talking about
interesting tool quick check for testing
but the done in airline actually helps
testing also airline programs
so those were just some few examples
I just wanted to
help you kick off exploration of airline
dash pack.com website because this is
where we put all of the slides most of
the videos that were captured during
factories so you can learn quite a lot
about how people user like what is or
what are the trends and I really
encourage you to think more about it
I think this was really it that I wanted
to say today so thank you is there are
any questions I can probably still take
not now as we have still quite a few
minutes I will also be here till even
tomorrow so we can keep on chatting on
going thank you
I have a question about hookah use kids
as an instant and they use air Lanka ski
really storage right and I know that
they actually grow the airline theme
quite a lot and we find more and more
use cases for airline at Google so
probably what I know about Google's
already outdated as well keep on using
airline for different purposes okay
thank you
so as we know airlink emerged like in
mid 80s and since then it kept basically
a rather low profile and started to gain
popularity right after 2000
five when we all know free lunch was
over yeah and we couldn't anymore again
product
there for months from raising cpu clock
times right so John two technologies
that utilize properly multicores but
since then virtue safar link we adopted
by other languages like as I said Java
scale now have
acha which uses the same extra module
message base and stuff like that
so don't you think that erlang who's
this it's chance to gain to become
really mainstream language because now
other
languages uses a lot provide the same
killer features of the language but they
more widely spread
um this question is being asked over and
over again I think it was also asked the
before the previous presentation I think
that the airline has some niche here it
depends how you define a mainstream
technology I wouldn't use airline for
everything I would just use it for some
class of problems where it really
shinies so I see that skala being
tightly integrate those with Jabbar
world and probably having lower cost
entry for people that come from Java is
natural choice but I also see airline
having some interesting features which
are not in other languages yet and this
makes it actually quite tempting
proposition for for developers anyway so
I don't see airline really losing here I
see tremendous growth of interest when
you see the numbers at conferences the
number of companies hiring looking for
airline developers a number of new
projects popping up on github or other
places I see it growing and that's just
a trend that we observe for quite a few
years right now so this discussion will
probably continue whether ask allah aur
acha or other technologies are better
suited to an airline certain class of
problems so like I think this will just
keep on going for now I wouldn't say
that there is like a like a one
one victor victory here one winner here
