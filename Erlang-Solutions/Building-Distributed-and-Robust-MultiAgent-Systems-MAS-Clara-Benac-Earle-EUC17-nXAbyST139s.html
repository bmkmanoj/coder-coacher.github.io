saying a alvaro here is a PhD student of
logic a friend own of myself and when he
came to us he was already interested in
in multi alien system it was something
he had work without the undergrad at
university and he came to us and he said
ok I want to to to maybe hopefully work
on this on my PhD and we looked at it we
we were not familiar with multi alien
systems before we looked at it and
because we we were already familiar with
Ellen and we thought okay that is very
somatic here so what is a multi alien
system anybody and resistance okay so
the way people define this is that a
multi alien system is a system a
composed of aliens of intelligent aliens
that which and which have also an
environment they the system includes the
aliens and the environment that
surrounds them and that they interact
with some examples of multi alien
systems are for instance online online
traded disaster rescue and so on and
there is a big large community working
on on research on multi alien system so
this is just this is not a multi alien
system but we could program this as a
multi-agent system I I have this picture
because I think is fun
it's just from the RoboCup initiative I
don't know if you know about this
initiative this was a Grand Challenge
something like 30 years ago and they say
they said them in 50 years time we
should be able to create a football team
of robots that can which can a win which
can beat a human a world champion
football team that was 50 years ago I
think there is fast on that but anyway
this was the idea and I want to elicit
to use this to illustrate some ideas on
the multi-agent system so simply put a
an intelligent alien is an an entity
which has some sensors receives
information from the environment and
then does some thinking and then it
activates over the environment so in the
example of the aerobic app we can say
that there is this football player this
alien that is close to the goal and it
receives information about its its
distance to the goal it has information
about the opponent a position and then
it sinks and then it decides for example
to kick the ball and try to score it has
a goal which is to score and then
depending on the information it gets and
its own intelligence is going to to do
something about to do something to to
achieve this goal some characteristics
and some very important characteristics
what what what is what does it make and
intelligent alien is that they should be
all tournament and by this we mean that
that we as people or as promise and
delegate our goals to this alien so we
give them some goals but they should be
able to determine the course of action
what they should do to reach those goals
in a in an independent manner they
should also be proactive so in order to
reach those goals they should do
something about it they should try to
achieve those goals so we are ruling out
a passive
that yes they are sitting waiting for
something to happen they should try and
and reach their goal they are absurd
they are so reactive they should also be
reactive so of course as we have shown
in the previous example they react to
the changes in their environment
and they should also possess some social
abilities so they should be able to
cooperate and coordinate among
themselves in order to reach their goals
they may have a common goal but they
they each each one has their own goals
okay and and I think this all these
characteristics a type somehow nicely
with with many things I have heard in
these talks at their annual conference I
have heard about autonomy I have took a
half a load social abilities cooperation
and so on dependency so so I think it's
even if this comes from the beauty alien
system community I think this in some
sense applied to us male and to the
systems we want to build so let me put
another example a very simple example
they say that what is a day in an agent
life
s'okay the agent a leap song is going to
walk to the office do some work and then
come back to this what come back home
okay so in the third sample in the 80s
and there was this philosopher sorry I'm
not sure if he is still alive
sorry about that I don't know but anyway
there is this philosopher called Michael
Batman who was researching on a human
practical reasoning and he came up with
this idea how to how a human reason a
practical human reasoning is is built up
and he or from his ideas came this this
what is called the belief desire
intention model this is something which
is very well known in the multi daily
insistence community in the
in the people that are building
intelligent aliens it's called the BDI
software model or the VDI architecture
and the idea here is that aliens have a
mental state and they have a separation
of concerns so on one hand they have
their beliefs which is how they the
information they have about the world
and I should have stress that this
information may not be accurate so this
is information they perceive so for
instance I can look at this guy here as
an alien and I can think oh because he's
looking at me she's really interested in
what I am saying but there is finding
out something else completely different
okay so this is my perception that these
are the beliefs then aliens have desires
which is what do they want to do what is
their goal okay and they have intentions
which is how are they going to do it
okay so there is a separation between
what I want to do and how I'm going to
reach that goal that I want to to
achieve and and if I think again I want
to say that what the work we're
presenting here we think it is
interesting for people building would be
alien systems but we think that maybe
you can get some ideas from here when
you build your own your own software for
instance if you are building protocols
communication protocols and so maybe you
can get ideas from from this so okay i
if i go back to the example I showed
before of the alien that goes to work
and does some work and then come back
home i I could say okay this alien has a
belief an initial belief that it's at
home a desire I want to go to work and
then what the intentions are are these
steps to fulfill this desire to go to
work I need to leave home and walk to
the office okay this I have already said
that this the central idea in this is
that a computer program may have or
behave as if they have a mental state
and they have these components
of beliefs desires and intentions so
let's go back to this to this a goal so
the agent has the goal to go to work so
the steps is going to follow is okay I
have to leave home and I have to get to
work and these these steps this what we
call a plan a brings up new goals which
is okay now I want to walk to work to
work I need to fulfill that goal in
order to follow the steps that allow me
to reach the previous goal the initial
goal so goals desires are give a half
are divided into sub goals okay and that
is this way of working okay what if it
rains I want to walk to work but then it
rains what do I do
I can take an umbrella or I can go to
work by car what it means is that the F
I said at the beginning
the aliens have to react to changes in
the environment so they are in the
process of doing something but then some
event something new comes up and then
they have to adapt to that okay so a the
same goal may have different tensions
different means to be rich depending on
the city of the situation so of course
it can become more complicated and okay
to to drive to the office and the agent
needs to have a key the car shot has to
be close by and another thing so okay
this is just an example so this is what
is called this a procedural reason in
cycle so this is how the aliens reason
so this is just showing what I have
explained in the example we have these
three components beliefs desires and
intentions and there is also a set of
plan which is what the program what the
parameter has programmed that okay all
the things they
can do so I'm just showing how this
Riesling cycle works the alien has a
desire to get to work and the beliefs at
the time are he's at Roane it drains and
so from the plant is going to choose
that to work again this separation of
deciding what to do and then doing it
okay how do I print that what language
can I use any ideas Java anybody else
that's great
more no come on come on
oh I think I thought I was in their land
you said conference where I was mistaken
no so yes of course I come from this in
airline great yes this is they way to go
because you know with the agency spends
we have a concurrency distribution we
want to have four dollars of course
everyone is the perfect match however
however we look in today what people at
the multi-agent systems communities are
doing and they actually have their own
programming languages for this and once
they're such example is Jason so they
have built their own programming
languages that are talking about beliefs
desires intentions and so on so they
have this this level of a splash of
abstraction which is very good and they
have done a lot of work on getting this
reasoning cycle right which is very good
why do we have to re-implement that and
not only that we also think oh if we
want to talk to these people we actually
need to talk their language if we go
there and say Evelyn they say what so
okay let's let's look at this Jason
let's look at this decision and see so
yes Jason implements this vbi
architecture and this reasoning cycle
and yes it's it's
using Java below fine okay so let's look
at an example of off for a JSON code so
this is a this is the code of the agent
that goes to work luckily or right now
by chance it happens that that this JSON
is also inspired by Prolog oh wow so it
has some similarities with ellen nice so
believe this is a this is a these are
predicates with ground terms okay so we
have the predicate at home desires they
are my marked by this bang business I
hired and then plans have a three part
which has a first trigger then after the
colon it's a kind of God so if the agent
is at home then it can it can fulfill
this plan and then the body of the plan
which is a sum it disguise a new goal to
live home and to drive to work in the
case of the goal to leap home what we
see here this - at home means that a the
belief at home is going to be removed
from the what is called the belief base
where they beliefs are stored and a new
belief is going to be added to this to
this belief base so that's how how it
works okay questions ok so far I have
been talking about one single alien but
of course what we want is to build a
multi-agent systems systems made often
many alien so this is just one classical
example of a because I want to be
politically corrected me a female
sitting at home and was doing some beer
of course why not
so there is this this agent which I
delegate my wish to get some beer from
the fridge and there is this robot that
brings me over here and when the video
is finished by in the fridge it would
contact the supermarket and get asked
for more beers to be the
okay how do we do that well of course we
need communication so how do we
communicate in JSON
what is this is it trust similarities
with error analysis in tactical so I
have two areas here remember actually no
it's Allison mister I don't know what
happened anyways so we have a salmon
action and this is a send action that
what if that is having the name of the
agent I want to send a message to having
a in this case a directive I think it's
called so doesn't matter and then the
message which is hello and what this
does is the again tom
bye when this code gets executed it's
going to put a belief hello in the
belief base of Alice so that's how
communication is is done okay
so they still have some very very good
characteristics okay
as I said before there is a lot of
effort in getting this a reason inside
call right and so on and so forth but it
has some deficiencies as well on one
hand we all know I think here that
concurrency it's a difficult problem to
adding to get it right no no somebody
they'll say no okay great and it
actually had the language itself has no
good has no distribution mechanism so
they rely in other libraries in in
another people in other libraries or
other tools to distribute multi-agent
systems and same thing can be said out
fault tolerance and actually do end up
the people who are using JSON for
implemented multi a and systems they end
up writing a lot of Java code pure Java
code okay so we say okay this is very
good this is very good because then we
can come in and say okay let's do
something about this and we have a very
good tool which is airline which is good
atop currency by especially at
especially in this case what is very key
is that is very good at distribution and
about is good in fault tolerant
mechanism
okay so let's borrow ideas from Ireland
and put them into JSON put an
integration okay yeah and this is what
we call or over here called a Jason very
original a Jason Eblen Jason yes and
there is a there is a there you have
there a github repository where you can
download it and use it okay so what does
a Jason do it corrects some of the
concurrency problems I'm going to tell a
little bit about this I'm not going to
tell a lot so if somebody is interested
about the concurrency problems of Jason
we can take it offline or after you have
signed whatever but the message here is
that we're looking at saying we are
looking at the Jason people and saying
you see is not so easy to get it right
when it comes to concurrency so we have
look into your language and we found
that important many of them they already
know of course we have as I said added
extended the Jason language with
distribution and fault tolerant
mechanisms in spy by Ellen
which makes this I think it's good
because it made that people that don't
want to know anything about Ellen but
want to use Jason they can use
distribution and fault tolerant
mechanisms in their favorite language
and they don't have to care about Ellen
and there is a deal work or implement is
you can find it in there in the
repository they Jason in the pair
interpreted a implemented in Ireland
okay so over here discover many problems
of many concurrency problems in in Jason
and just going to to talk about one just
to give you a feeling one idea or one
problem so to say and and this is a when
a audience have
desire that cannot be completely
fulfilled so okay so let's say that this
alien wants to go home and tidy the
kitchen okay in JSON this may have two
outcomes so in Jessa the agent either
goes from and print the kitchen or just
go home goes home because when it tries
to clean the kitchen and it cannot
because it's not at home then this this
a plan is dropped so this is what we
would call a race condition in some
cells no in the sense that that there
are two possible outcome is not
deterministic so in the implementation
that alvaro has done he just say this is
not happening so so there is only the
pizzoli this plan of sight in the
kitchen is not dropped when it's not
abandon when it cannot be fulfilled but
the a they only outcome is that the
agent goes from and type the kitchen
this is got one example and as I said
the idea is that yes concurrency is hard
and we should feel happy that we have a
life so I was with the gas to
distribution an agent is implemented as
an airline process in Bulgarian systems
or at least in the languages like JSON
aliens are distributed into containers
but we can map a container to another
node and something that is Australian
implementation is that a agent names are
unique globally unique okay and this is
what the alvaro has implemented and
called a distribution manager so the
names of the aliens are are Dunican and
he maybe tell you a bit more that when
it comes to to fault tolerance okay so
this is just an example of a of a
distribution schema where we have two
hosts and one container when container
running in each of the hosts and is well
the example of a of me sitting at home
and wanted to drink some beer
and okay so some of the agents are
running in one container and some others
you know continue this for ellen people
this is so so what so I will say more
about this it's just the nice thing that
this is in the level of affiliation okay
so now let's move into fault tolerance
and I'm going to pass over to to Alvaro
little hello so yes just summing up of
it a what we did is here you know
this year JSON language was out there
the people from the movie alien
community was saying okay I can program
software based on the VDI model my
agents are communicating I have a lot of
entities but they couldn't distribute
the software which locate why what's the
ball and no Java concurrency is not very
good at that and we said okay we have a
long for that and as Clara said we
introduced I mean there was no the agent
containers and all that we introduced
them from the distribution paradigm of
of Erlang and apart from prefer of
providing such distribution schema which
is okay now you can distribute your
agent but you have to it almost to known
attention to fault tolerance
I mean you have agent if they cross
nobody's carrying you cannot recover
your system from problem senior in your
agents and airline is very good at that
so we said okay let's bring the best of
Erlang into this dis language and we
introduce both positon unfolded recovery
techniques inspired but not equal to
those of Erlang we introduced a
monitoring mechanism that as you know it
allows us to know if some other agent
some other in La Mesa process in a JSON
is an agent as you can know if another
agent is there or you can know if it's
disconnected
okay so you are notified about this
change of execution state and you react
to it we implemented a monitoring system
an agent can monitor the execution state
of another agent but apart from being
aware of deaths and these connections we
introduced we
Greece the observational power of
monitors which may be the interesting
also to to Erlang head for instance
because now the monitoring agent is able
to know if another agent appears what
does it mean you have an agent saying
okay I want to monitor a box selling
Asian if it's not available at the time
you're establishing the monitor once it
appears when that agent that process is
spawned you are notified I mean now in
Erlang you you cannot be notified about
some other process you have to
communicate to you can do or not
notified of its existence okay you can
use them a name of an agent as a
contract of its functionality because
you say okay I want to monitor The
Bookseller once it's available notify me
I want to communicate to to that region
i apart from that we also allow monitors
to know if the present of another agent
is similar to to the one before okay you
say I want to monitor the bookseller and
the injection granting system notifies
me this is not available and will notify
me again when this is available apart
from that the monitoring agents can know
if some other region has been revived
forced on by a supervisor okay we are
communicating to some other agent and if
it crosses and comes up again so the
monitor notifies us we can know that
maybe our session or communication
information has been lost
okay so as I said we introduced
monitoring with enhanced operational
power what is also important from
monitoring in ejection is that the
notifications in airline that are
messages here are beliefs
okay we try to map airline concepts into
JSON as Clara said we wanted a community
the multi system community to feel
comfortable with this language we didn't
want them to learn airline we want to
use the ingredients with the potency
power of Allah and now here in modernity
notifications are just new beliefs it
must perfectly they have nothing new to
to learn apart from that the monitors
that we implemented now are the system
what we mean by that is that now in
Erlang you establish a monitor the
monitor agent the sorry the monitored
process dies you get a notification and
the monitoring relation is done you
could we'll never know if it's up again
or refuse respawn and dies again our
monitors persist you can know what's
happening if you're interested in
execution state of another agent you
stablish some monitoring relation and
you know what's happening with that
aliens you know if it dies if it's up
again you may have more information
normally do monitor another region
because you want to interact in some way
so the more knowledge you have about its
execution state the better or that's our
intuition so this is all about
monitoring relations in mediation which
is a full detection you see that you are
able to detect fault but you have to
implement how to recover from them and
on the full recovery dimension we
implement this supervision mechanism
which is inspired by Erlang but is not
exactly the same you see here we have
monitors agent monitoring other aging we
have a super-sorry
supervising we have a supervision tree
but this tree is dynamic okay
that means that an agent can say okay I
want to supervise this set of aging with
with this strategy but it's at its
established at runtime you you don't
need to say okay this is a supervisor
agent that spawns these other agents
which have this behavior is everything
is dynamic you can establish and disable
supervision relations online also it's
important to notice that supervisors and
children I mean a supervisor and the
supervisor agent are not children I mean
they are not coupled a supervisor a can
super an Asian can supervise a set of
agents but if you do supervisor dies the
agents are not dying I mean journo
introducing any kind of strong
dependencies between the agents in a
supervision relation and the the most
important contribution of the
supervision in ejection is that not only
the the supervisor will restart the
agent when one of them dies
I mean you know say ok I want
supervising one I'm going if one of them
dies bring it up again we also
introduced a mechanism that allows the
detection of these behaviors in the
supervised station we do this by
introducing a pinging policy ok we have
for instance an agent on Monday
supervising an agent Alice and it's
constantly pinging Alice analysis
responding back it is everything is done
by the runtime system ok the a program
area has to say ok Tom supervises Alice
and forget about this ok you just win
the behavior that I'm going to describe
now a drunken City will be polling Alice
pinging to know if it's alive if it's
responsive when Alice is not responding
it's a life but not responding it sends
an unblocked signal by the nature of
Jason it's possible that the during the
computation of guards
the agent can enter in infinite loops or
computation that are so long that won't
terminate or it cannot be tell if equal
tournament in real time and this
supervision mechanism will allow telling
if an agent is alive but unresponsive ok
you not only recover it that died but
you can tell if they are actually
providing any behavior if they're not
the supervisor automatically and blocks
them ok it will say well by the nature
of this one it's only possible to to
fall into an infinite loop during
reasoning when you are assessing the the
truth of some or some value so you say
ok unblock it assume it's false and the
agent will continue will be responsive
again if such an block happens a lot of
times also a Jason will restart the
again okay what that is allows to
identify an unresponsive agent and if
it's misbehaving just restarted by
itself their province doesn't need to
care okay make some test if the agent is
extensible know if if something's going
wrong it will automatically restart the
alien and I'm just finishing okay I had
the idea just that I want to transmit
here it is we said okay a language about
language in in order to program highly
concurrent is to the system like the
multi-agent systems are but the
community is not using it I mean that
the focus of the community is handling
the high-level instruction for ages like
the BDI model how to program reasoning
cycle but they didn't care about how to
distribute actually they live quite
happily without having distribution and
a sensible concurrency framework and we
said okay why not use it and underneath
and you're going to gain all this
potential all these incisions in the
distribution and fault tolerance even we
wanted to do that without they even
noticing and with a very short learning
curve and that's why we put a headline
underneath a Jason in order to build an
interpreter that he implements all the
behavior of Jason and introduce all the
excellent distribution and fault
tolerance capabilities of Overland and
the we call that a Jason which is what
we try to sum up today to you and if you
find that interesting or have any any
doubts or do you want to show is running
actually we're going to that afterwards
and we'll be happy to so this is it
thank you
any questions from the audience I and
what the execution model of the the
rules to go to the next stage is
something like data load or prologue or
how how do you interpret the what to do
next and how do you the dissolution
cycle I mean there are like 12 steps and
they are implemented in Ireland it's
quite that the formal semantics of the
objection is available and we
implemented them I mean there it says if
their beliefs are these the next step is
to be that and we implemented all the
transition will pramatta them in in a
LAN I've got another question or
slightly different level here so you
said in the beginning there was a
football play and this is the patient
what is kind of the hardest problem
people use engaging or trying to address
at the moment and how does your airline
solution solve that problem for them and
you can make much more progress in the
artificial intelligence world well I
mean one thing I would say is that one
problem they face is that they don't
scale up very well so they can only run
ok it's not the case in maybe in the in
the RoboCup if you only have one a.m.
per perry robots with what but in in
general they have problems with a scale
enough they cannot run the large number
of ages that you can see in heaven so
they have protocols where they want to
try and use with a large number of faith
so that one of the processes I don't
know if it's the main there is not but
it's one of the problems actually I
think the main problem they have is
distribution they there are a lot of
implementation of third-party software
that is meant only for distribution
there is have some mess over Paul Jay
the different languages I say okay I I
delegate all my communication on my
distributed communication to Jeff you
have to program integrated to this third
party so I provide you a link
we're alien scanning Tara but I don't
provide you the means for them to
interact distributed I mean they have
problems to run separately distribute in
a distributed manner there so where they
said okay this should be possible but
they didn't make the effort
I think they'd assisted on it because it
was not an easy task
so I see that you can add these kind of
capabilities to the language my my
really questions how does the robot look
like if you can know do all these kind
of things what kind of things can you do
in reasoning which you can't do today
because you can distribute because you
have a better concurrency model what
kind of things can you then a vision we
have in the future what you can do
things that we that you couldn't do now
mainframe the system I mean if you have
only one container one computational
system what can you do there I mean you
cannot buy a you cannot build an
e-commerce system you cannot build
anything apart from what has to be run
in your own laptop or your own device I
mean okay anything that is attributed
you cannot do in imodium system I have a
lot of problems yeah any more questions
from the audience
hi can you distinguish between false and
undesirable reasoning a no I mean it is
assumed that this has full
anything that is not expected I would
rather I mean we we focus on the things
that obviously were false what this obly
afford is having an unresponsive agent I
mean if a nation is not responsive
what's the use of that again is an
infinite loop I mean this is for sure a
fault if an engine is crashing it's a
fault I mean if the parameter stablished
supervision relation saying I want this
a generalize and this dies for some
reason it's a fault I mean but if you
have a nation that is saying
computing something say it's five you
have don't have damage to say okay it is
five this again is not acting as it
should resinize is that answer I mean we
focus on what was obviously a thought or
what we understood to be over default
business like fault we didn't focus on
them I mean just I I would like to he's
not really into that by what your
previous question is that we contacted
one of the creators of Jason and we
showed him this and he was very very
positive he particularly liked this idea
that you could take a diverging aliens
again that are alive at you cannot
communicate with and so on so so he
really liked it so so one of the goals
that I said at the beginning okay we
