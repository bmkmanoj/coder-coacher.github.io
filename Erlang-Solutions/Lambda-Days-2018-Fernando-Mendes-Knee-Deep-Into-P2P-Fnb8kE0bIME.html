my name is Fernando that's my whoops
that's my twitter handle and github and
everywhere else so we're going to be
talking about peer peer and how we can
design a distributed system from scratch
but mostly we we are going to be talking
about me failing because that's pretty
much what I do I fail for a living
so this is the story of the failure that
came from my first job I was attending
university about a year year and a half
ago
and I was going to write my master's
thesis but you know how university
students are we don't do a lot of things
so this was me I was born I wasn't
getting my hands dirty I wasn't actually
producing anything right and I said hey
I'm pretty okay at this distributed
system thing maybe I should get a job on
that so I started to look around for
jobs and I got a job not doing this
routed systems I got a job in Ruby doing
web development I know this is a
functional conference but it's it on
here does anyone here have a background
in Ruby or web development okay right so
you probably know that where I'm going
to be talking about I look at a company
called Seville we do cool stuff like
miracle for you trusts but after that
excitement the first excitement of
getting a job I was feeling bored again
then we had this awesome project we were
going to build a distributed smart
office and we were going to prototype it
using raspberry PI's so these notes the
red notes they were the ones that we
were going to build they only have
sensors so they read and in broadcast
data and these nodes right here these
are black belt boxes so there can be
cell phones they could be other
raspberry PI's we don't know we cannot
control them and we don't know what they
are
they behave we just provide like a
software development kit for people to
build these notes so our primary roads
will gather data and they will share it
to other nodes right and the message
will flow through a gossip protocol
those secondary nodes the black boxes
they need to be handled a bit
differently because we can't control
them we are not sure if they can reblock
if they will rebroadcast messages they
could be malicious so they cannot be a
part of the gossip protocol apparently
this is me whenever I have to play with
distributed systems and this project
came up so I was pretty excited and I
ran into my mechanical keyboard that's
my mechanical keyboard is anyone else
here unnerved for mechanical keyboards
all right you guys get back to me after
the conference so we can geek out a bit
about our keyboards so I set down at my
keyboard you know what I did like super
excited and it did absolutely nothing
because I didn't know how to do this I
was a web developer and didn't know how
to do a smart office only you had to do
web development so well now well if
you're a web developer how do you
arrange your project how do you build
something that you're not used to my
approach was to transition from web
development to this rooted systems so
let's go see how web development works
it doesn't matter where language what
framework you use in essence you could
have a web server right and for each
incoming requests you're going to spin
up a worker and then that workers going
to do whatever your framework tells you
to do basically this is it so how does
web work step on you receive new
connections step to you process the
internal messages and you send replies
and then you just do this a bunch of
times right so let's take this
interaction and first up to build our
distributed system we need to receive
new connections this is pretty easy you
set up a server that it is and now I'm
going to show you a bit of elixir code
and it's going to be
a big chunk of code but don't be
frightened because we only need this
this is an Atlanta strike that I
discovered with Gen TCP in the and the
ein and basically said this sets up the
listener for a different operating mode
whenever you killed whether it is in
Ruby Java whatever you usually need two
threads or two processes if you're doing
elixir or a line to communicate both
ways so you need a process to be blocked
on the socket listening for incoming
data and then you need a another process
or another thread if you want to send
outgoing data but this is going to
basically tell the system hey you listen
to this port and you send me an elixir
or no line message whenever data comes
in so we are now ready for step two
we're going to accept and send messages
so we're going to spin up workers inside
all the raspberry pi here we go now we
have workers see without little trick
you don't need two workers you need one
worker and the code for the whole worker
it's basically this you can just loop a
receive block and then you can pattern
match for messages so this is going to
be delivered to our worker by the system
whenever you new data comes along from
the socket this is going to be whatever
the socket is closed and if we at the
same time want to send outgoing data we
just send a send message to it so this
is one of the most powerful features
that I've found in this system which is
to keep the logic really simple and in a
single process if you need to keep track
of the messages that you have already to
received you'll need one worker for that
so step three let's do a bunch of this
we have two raspberry PI's web server on
each one and a bunch of workers because
we have one for every outgoing
connection but like I said this is
gossip
so we are bound to have repeated
messages we need to account for that and
we need to have a process that manages
it so I just called a message agent and
this could be anything if you're crazy
enough to have a database on a Raspberry
Pi you get to put this communicating
with the database you can use ETS you
can use just so
list and you can keep track of the
repeated messages right so this is
pretty cool at all and at this point I
was pretty excited because I had my
first distributed system and I said this
to my boss but he told me the three
words a developer is most afraid of does
it scale well this doesn't scale and we
might tell me hey this is premature
optimization you were only going to need
to handle this when it becomes an issue
right
the thing is gossip is really io
intensive you're going to be listening
for data in the network interface and
that's costly this is not costly for
raspberry PI's but we were going to put
this on specialized hardware so our
algorithm it's you can for that and we
should avoid having a great number of
connections we also haven't really done
anything regarding these two types of
nodes here like I said we can't make
them a part of the gossip network which
is this one because they if someone is a
terrible coder and has a bug but doesn't
broadcast incoming messages our system
will work so we're going to need to
handle this and since we're going to be
switching the whole protocol we should
tackle this now right this is something
to get some inspiration which force
developers is known as please internet
helped me write who here remembers using
this program okay a lot of people cruel
actually miss this because nowadays we
just go on Netflix or Spotify whatever
you don't have that adventure of getting
the right file and hoping it's not a
virus
anyway LimeWire show aza and other
programs connected to a network called
Nutella what a G and the window tell of
words is the following
you have a gossip network and if a peer
wants a file it's gonna ask it to its
neighbors and then they're going to
query their neighbors but you might
start to notice here some red arrows
these are going to be repeated
right and even though this will
propagate across the network and here we
go this node right here it has the file
we were looking for but in the meantime
the message went through the whole
system and we had a bunch of repeated
messages this is what's happening on our
system on our s berry pies so after a
while some there was one developer that
said hey I can do better than this so he
created a new protocol and he called it
Nutella - and this started the whole
flame war because some people said this
is not officially related to Nutella so
it should mean it shouldn't be called
Nutella - what the differences were that
Nutella had this network Nutella - had
this network
these are super peers they only talk
among them and the black circles are
regular peers they only connect to a
single super peer so what happens if a
node wants a file it's going to query
it's super pure and then the super peer
is going to talk through gossip and in
here it's someone sending one message
okay so it one super peer could be
connected to multiple super peers but
they're going to gossip they're going to
ask the regular peers if someone has the
file that the original peer requested we
can basically grab inspiration from this
and do a similar protocol not like
Nutella - because we're not sharing
files we're sharing data but we can have
these nodes be super peers and then we
just do a simple gossip and we're going
to switch the gossip next we're going to
take it off but for now let's assume
we're working with gossip
we're going to ask we're gonna send
messages to our peers and whenever we
receive new data that we just send it to
regular peers that are connected right
so this is pretty much miss on - but
we're not breaking any laws okay so
right now we have handled those
regular notes those black boxes and
since they're only ever connected to one
super peer they're not going to be it
doesn't matter if they're malicious
because they're not going to be part of
the protocol they're not going to be
able to stop the network from
broadcasting we only have an issue with
gossip now so let's take care of that
there's this protocol called hyper view
hyper view has an interesting approach
on gossip networks since gossip networks
are really io intensive hyper view
basically says okay some redundancies
some repeated messages are fine
let's not I know that because we kind of
want for redundancy if another fails I
want to be able to reach it anyway and
you can only achieve that if you have
repeated messages but let's try to keep
it in an acceptable limit and then since
we have this we have a regular gossip
network but then we're going to build an
Elvis Rainey graph on top of that so we
go from this to this these connections
there are border connections are data
connections if two nodes share one both
connection they're going to share data
the other connections are used to share
neighbor information so if this node
right here if it crashes there goes okay
so this node now he's isolated because
he doesn't have any data connection he's
cut off from the rest of the network but
he still has a network connection and he
can use that to shuffle the network to
sell he is here right there hey I'm cut
off can you send me information about
your neighbors and then he can
reorganize itself so hyper view solves
the i/o intensive nests by saying let's
keep this within acceptable bonds let's
have some repeated messages but let's
use all those connections to increase
the robustness of our system and this
was what I ended up using and I deeply
regret that because there's another
thing called plum trees ten trees are
basically another layer on top of hyper
view because they
have they have that same neighbor
sharing information thing but they only
send one message so if you sorry if you
use regular trees you're gonna have an
optimal number of messages but you can't
afford to lose nodes because the tree
will break into you're gonna lose every
message you have so you give him this
and if that node crashes you're gonna
have a partition network ten trees solve
this by taking whatever hyper view does
but building a tree on top of that so
these connections will share data the
bad ones and the others will share never
information but now this is a binary
tree that this is the root and it's
children and so on and you have a single
graph and this would have been a better
choice for the project I just there
happen to know that and I went with
hyper view but if you ever see yourself
in a situation that you were using
gossip but you really really wanted to
use trees you don't have a lot of
resources this plan may be using palm
trees is a better option right back to
our projects I only met in hyper view
and then well um this is working right
now I'm gonna show this to my boss and
he told me yes
it's working on your computer we're
gonna need a demo which from my
understanding was something like you get
to play around for a couple of weeks
putting raspberry pies across the office
and that was what I did I brought a
bunch of duct tape and a footrest very
flies around the place and up until this
point I had nothing to show no even even
knew what the hell was doing in the
office and these comments started to
appear on slack because they were
actually they were actually wondering
why I wasn't pouring them coffee anymore
why wasn't the interim anymore okay so
when I implemented hyper view I didn't
actually implement it I did what
everyone else does and I bought an
implementation
so I grabbed the no lying library and
put it into the project and to see a
visual a visualization from the sensor
data so I was collecting temperature
humidity and all of that from the office
I set up a Phoenix app and I deployed
that Phoenix app to Heroku so a
Raspberry Pi would be in our office
right and the server was in the cloud
turns out that when a node wants to
connect to the network or an important
detail this the server was actually part
of the network so actually made it so
that he took part in the hyper view
protocol and when a node wants to join
the hyper View protocol it contacted the
server first
so whenever a Raspberry Pi wanted to be
added to the network he he basically
said to the server hey I can enjoy him
this is my IP address dial back but we
are relying on an external connectivity
and that's a private IP address and you
know what happens when you try to
connect a private network with a private
public network for the private IP
address basically Kenneth comes in and
smite in the head and I couldn't set up
that I couldn't set up the web server so
I did the half-assed approach which is
hey instead of setting up a VPN and
maybe changing things around I'm just
gonna deploy the app not to the cloud
but to a single wesberry PI so this is
this is a very important part of my
failure let's see what was running when
the Raspberry Pi okay so we had a beam
process to run elixir and that beam
process was running what we codenamed
the box which is the code for the
sensors then we had the Phoenix app but
the Phoenix up was built separately from
the box so there are actually two
processes and we're gonna have to
beaming senses because I did the how
fast approach and then the Phoenix app
connected to Postgres
but this is sensitive data right so
technically it's big data and I had to
put in Cassandra and this is this is
very well raspberry PI's are not built
for this don't do this
I mean it works it works
but it is also very very wrong it's not
how it's supposed to be okay so after
burning one or two raspberry pies I
eventually got the thing to work and our
broad sort of communicated with us on
slack and tell us who was in the office
it had told us the temperature and I
actually was able to build a small
framework that has with a few lines of
code you could automate your office and
this is Ruby I'm sorry about this but
now I can sell but I him to a functional
conference and show you a bunch of Ruby
code sorry anyway
we can get right everything's working I
have a project set up and I'm finally
happy with something to show and then
everything stopped working so wrong
let's see let's take a look into the
information that each node has so inside
there was very point said that spaghetti
of code it had to keep track of the last
sensor readings it had performed it had
to keep map of the network so we can
tell who's in the office at any given
time and we had a list of target values
so we could say I want the temperature
to be 20 degrees and this is very
important this is a very important part
because I should have realized that this
is shared sake we're going to have
multiple writers even though it's not
shared memories shared state multiple
raspberry pies could come along and say
this this is a target temperature and
another message at the same time setting
the same target temperature so this is
going to originate conflicts and we're
trying to avoid conflicts right so how
do we have them compare see then let's
go back take a look into what happens in
web development in the world of the web
you can have multiple servers right you
can distribute your app you can do that
you can scale horizontally and how do
you handle concurrent to request them
you basically pretty much will rely on
the database to do that for you it
doesn't matter if you're using a
distributed system as a problem as a
programmer most of the time you just put
all your faith and to whoever built that
database system so in here we don't have
any database locks we don't have
transactions we're all our own right we
have to do this a different way and one
suggestion for that is to use vector
clocks but vector clocks are an
algorithm for generating a partial
ordering of events you don't have an
absolute clock in the system there's no
way to tell which a what time a message
arrived you can just give a sense of
causality to it there if you know
lamport's fox they're pretty much like
lamport's clocks but the messages
contain the clock for the other knowns
as well so let's take a look at that we
have two nodes and B and node a performs
a read and increments its clock so ace
clock is now 1 it's gonna send it to be
and as soon as B gets the message it's
going to increment it its own clock in
the meantime a performs 1 read and
another read and the messages get there
because if Network in a different order
the second one got that first but not be
updated
ace clock 2 3 so when the next message
is the next message comes in with a
clock set to 2 it's just going to
discard it and everything is ok but this
was actually deployed and was working
for a while and then things kept going
wrong because this isn't enough like I
said we have shared site and having
share site is you
a hassle there was this edge case there
was still conflicts because the messages
arrived in concurring clocks there's no
way to tell which message came first
just by looking at this and in the
previous example you had some sense of
causality this happens quite frequently
and we can solve this by using the cap
theorem I don't know if you have
familiar with the cap theorem but it
essentially states that if you're a
programmer you're not allowed to have
nice things or in a more known version
you have three properties consistency
availability and partitioning and you
have to choose two of them so we're
going to choose availability because we
don't want the world to stop every time
we make you read and we're going to
choose partitioning because we're is
it's a distributed system and by
definition we're going to be partitioned
so this is called the eventual
consistency which means that at some
point in time if we stop feeding data to
the system every node is going to have
the correct state to help us with that
we're going to go into c rd t's
has anyone ever worked with CRT T's
before okay some people cool right this
is a data structure that prevents you
from screwing up it's a way of thinking
about data because you won't exactly
save let's say integers you won't save
integers you'll save properties that
allow you to compute integers they can
be one of two they can either be
operation based or state based operation
based means you broadcast the actual
whoops you broadcast the actual
operation so instead of sending over a
variable where the value said to five
you're going to say something like that
like add five or subtract two they're
commutative so you can switch the order
but there are not idempotent which means
that if you send us a message saying
plus five and then send it again you're
going to end up with at least ten and
that's undesirable you need to update to
say exactly once let's see let's create
a distributed set without CRT T's so
maybe
are gonna build a set they're both going
to add X now a sends that message first
and then removes DX B then sends the add
X message but it sends it before
receiving the remove so everything has
gone inconsistent now let's use
operation based Co duties to do the
exact same thing so some case they're
going to add X but they're not really
adding X they're adding X of a and X of
B now when you remove it you're gonna
remove X of n X of B to get the actual
value of the set you need to compute it
so even though here says X of a and X of
B what know B is going to say is that
it's said his set contains X it just
contains two versions of ax but
eventually this is going to be
consistent right so at this point in
time we were able to be consistent let's
go to state based unlike operation based
see our duties in here you send the
actual representation of the state but
this could be very heavy on the network
right there very you're sending large
amounts of data and that's a downside
there are ways to only send Delta's so
only send the differences but we're not
going to go into that we're going to see
a different example because it's easier
to comprehend the way safe base ER
duties work if you use integers so meld
a is going to add 5 to a variable and
we're here we're doing a distributed
counter so note a is going to add 5 to
the camera that's homeless 5 he's gonna
send the actual 5 to B and the toll in B
is 5 as well then they're going to
different operations notice that a note
B you have two different versions of the
counter but this is not the actual
presentation of state you need to add
both to get the value of the counter and
eventually you're going to find a point
in time where your
system has the correct representation so
let's put this in our Raspberry Pi
Network right okay we're gonna have
these two messages arrive at the same
time and can anyone tell me what's going
to be the target message of the system
the target value okay who here thinks
it's gonna be 22 raise your hands okay
so no 120 right neither okay one person
20 neither twenty two or twenty okay
it's really red okay so it's gonna be
twenty one watch anyone because this is
a business decision when you are
building CEO duties you choose the way
you solve conflicts in this case this
was for temperature and if you say
twenty to you and someone else is twenty
let's MIT in the middle right let's do
the average it could have been the
largest number there are securities that
solve to that could have been the
smallest it doesn't matter you choose
but now we're going to receive another
message and right so we're going to
average this again 24 plus 21 you're
going to divide it by two and we're
going to end up with twenty two point
five the problem is is that this step
was wrong because this was the actual
conflict the message is that originated
that conflict were the first two plus
the third one so it doesn't matter which
messages arrived first would counts
under the clocks inside each node like
those vector clocks and if that set
conflicts we need to account for them
all so we're not going to save the state
we're going to save properties that
allow us to compute to say let's do this
again but now how do we average we
divide the sum by the number of parts so
let's say that we receive these two
messages and when I said the sum to 42
and a parts to two and if we want to
access the actual value we're going to
compute that and get 21 and then later
when the target message arrives again
and there's conflicts we're just
add that increment the number of parts
and we're gonna get 22 which is the
correct representation of site right so
wrapping things up we just built the
serrated system we just built a
distributed small office when you do web
development most of the time you're not
going to care about your system
resources I'm willing to bet here that
let's say 80 90 percent of you use the
cloud to deploy your apps all right like
who who uses Heroku or digitalocean or
something like that when they're doing
or development right good a lot of
people so you if you have performance
issues you most of the time you're going
to scale horizontally you're going to
add more resources and here we don't
have that when you're building a
distributed system at least for this
case or for peer-to-peer networks with
sensors you're going to have to account
for the system resources when you're
deciding your algorithms and then
apologies that work better and larger
networks and smaller networks but even
though people tell you optimize later
sometimes you need to optimize sooner
than later and when you're first
building the system you should ask
yourself a set of questions because
there are already some models that give
you a solution for most of the problems
you will find let's I'm gonna give you a
checklist of questions so there's the
number of processes known or finite
because if you know how many processes
you are going to deal with you probably
don't need a dynamic network you don't
need a network the need that supports
nose is running in and moving out you
can just use a stretch of network like a
ring or a tree or something like that
is there a global notion of time we had
partial ordering a while ago we use
vector flux for that but we had no
global notion of time clocks time stamps
time servers they're terrible way to
tell time I'm serious if you're building
in a suite system don't check the time
by going to time servers because if the
node fails it's going to have an
incorrect time representation
there is one system when this rigid
system that has a pretty good notion of
global time which is the blockchain they
have the block height so you can tell
when it's message was received as the
network reliable where messages get lost
while messages get reordered if you're
using if you using UDP your polygon
engineering mechanisms like this like
vector clocks or CR DT is to allow you
to receive messages as they arrive this
is important because if there is no
message loss there is no reordering you
won't be using vector clocks or version
vectors or anything like that is their
full connectivity other than it's fully
connected but we need to account for
algorithms like hyper view which give
you partial membership you only know a
small set of nodes and what happens when
a node crashes will ever be back is
there a chance the node is gone for good
and if it comes back will it lose all
the messages it had previously received
and this is actually very important
because if a node crashes and has no
data from before you're going to need to
put it up to date and you're going to
lose a lot of time doing that and you're
gonna waste a lot of processing power
according for the web encoding
distributed systems really isn't that
difficult I mean the web is a
distributed system most of the time
you're just given a framework to do the
light work for you and stabilities arms
are golden hammer I've seen a lot of
people start using crts for pretty much
everything they can because it's cool
but there are other mechanisms maybe you
can use vector clocks version vectors
for your use case and here we only use
your duties because of an edge case and
if there was no educator wouldn't be
using them at all and finally you know
you want to know what this was my
biggest fail because reinventing the
wheel is stupid I spent on this a year
in this project and last Saturday this
happens I use ipfs pub/sub and did the
whole thing a smaller militant version
in red afternoon so I kind of just
wasted a whole year of my employees my
employers
time and money into a system that could
have been built in one afternoon so
choose wisely everyone and this is what
I have for you I hope you enjoyed it if
you have any questions feel free to ask
thank you so I have a question with two
beams and Cassandra is the King Fahd
state this way I will change it while
walking on it or is it in the same
thanks I actually turned off the system
because there was kind of dangerous you
have raspberry PI's overheating I only
did that for demo and that that's why
did the half-assed approach
I could have set up a droplet on digital
ocean and set up a VPN for the whole
thing that would have been a good
approach
I could have deployed Posterous and
Cassandra to hue a remote server and
connect the Phoenix app through that it
was just because it was a demo and I
didn't want to bother a lot with it and
yeah okay any other question can you say
something about the TFS your experience
have I don't have a lot of experience
with IPA fast they're using that
experimental pub/sub version which is
pretty good
basically you're gonna what I did was
having a room and broadcasting messages
to a specific set of nodes so the
reliable nodes would be in a pub so room
and then I would use the ipfs Kadeem Lea
rodding to connect directly to them
so yeah it's so experimental but from my
experience it's already working pretty
well yeah thanks any other
but okay if you have any other questions
feel free to talk with me now after the
talk has ended again thank you for
coming and enjoy the rest of the
conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
