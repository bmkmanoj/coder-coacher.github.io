this is my first elixir talk of any kind
so I expect it to be a little bit choppy
I expect to get some technical details
wrong but I'm excited about this so how
many of you have read one of the seven
and seven books maybe seven languages in
seven weeks or just a couple of you it's
an interesting book because there aren't
many people that know seven languages
that they could use an anger and I
certainly didn't so I was at a
conference probably about a year and a
half ago called code mesh and was in
London and I was very very excited to
meet Jose a vellum who actually built
the elixir language and I got to meet I
got to meet him for the first time and
it walked up to him and I had in my hand
Dave Thomas's book and I said could you
could you sign this for me please he
said wait a minute and yet he he went to
go get the seven languages in seven
weeks book and so we signed each other's
book and I told them what a big fan that
I was and that i really liked elixir
because it had some of the elements in
seven languages in seven weeks and and
Jose they said that seven languages in
seven weeks was where he learned Erlang
and also Lisp which are two of the big
influences an elixir so it was it was a
really cool cool point for me we're
going to talk about using pipes in a
different way and this this talk I was
told not to not to pace in front of the
in front of the light it kind of limits
my lemons my pacing area to to right
about here but I guess I'll live through
it but Josie and I were trying to work
through the idea of how to compose
different components of a web
application server
so I'm of the firm belief that we're in
a functional area now and and so Java so
the languages that I've used in
production before our Java and Ruby we
have better tools for composing than we
had in Java and Ruby and I'm of the firm
I strongly believe that when you put the
two words web and framework together
you're probably already wrong okay so
the idea is that I should be able to
grab different tools from github to say
okay this is what a web connection looks
like and now I want to transform
transform an inbound connection to say
to something that's that's going to
that's going to support ssl and then
maybe i want to parse parameters and
basically maybe you'll want to route
maybe i want to render and i could stack
those things together right and to do
that there's a there's a great tool
called pipes and so that kind of planted
a seed for talk a little while ago so I
asked Jose a I said okay give me
something tell me why you added pipes to
the elixir language and he said first I
stolen I said come on Joe is a I've got
this talk give me something give me
something to help me out a little bit he
said well I hadn't put much thought into
it I said okay give me a little more you
know because it's it's become like a big
a big flag for the Ruby community and
he's any gate you went out a little bit
more and he said you know this is a
essential tool for helping to think in a
functional way I said yeah that's a
little bit more what I'm looking for and
then I found a paper that he wrote a
little bit later and you said it
embodies the transformation of data and
that's what makes functional programming
such a powerful thing we take no text
and add paragraph tags and then
you lad list tags in order list and then
then body tags and h1 to build a nature
to build a HTML page we take raw text
and then decorate that with with I don't
know we we can substitute at Alex and
bold to to build a word processor you
know everything that we do is a series
of transformations and in fact on the
cover of Dave's book we have you know
this this kind of subtitle that actually
has the language construct in it I think
that that's really cool that says that
there is something special going on here
and and that makes you look twice at the
book and at the language and in fact
when Joe Armstrong played with a
language for the first time he had this
code right here that said this is easier
to read than the erlang equivalent and
this is a guy who loves the prologue
inspired syntax of early I was talking a
little bit earlier today to to Chris
McCord the creator of Phoenix and he
said pipes and macros are why I am here
with the elixir language so what is it
about pipes that make things so
interesting well in functional
programming if i look at function calls
and in in a naked way everything's a
little bit backwards this is a English
cliche one step forward and two steps
back and it doesn't really reflect the
intention of the programmer very well at
all
what I really like to do is take this
and flip it and that's what a pipe does
so that if I have something more
complicated like this I can flip it
where this is passed as the first I
argument to this and the result of this
this pack is passed to this and then I
can do an extended transformation and
that's cool but if you think about it if
you think about a web server I start
with the connection and then I can
enforce SSL and then I can map on
parameters and then then I pass that to
a router and then I respond with some
type of of redirect or some type of
render this is really the fundamental
problem that made me start thinking
about pipes but there's a couple of
problems that are inherent in this kind
of transformation that means that we
can't use them as often as we would like
to and that's what we're going to talk
about today okay
okay so the first problem is that I
might have some unreliable tasks right
so maybe I have something that works and
something that works and I'll pipe that
to something that breaks and then I'll
pipe that to something that works right
now if everything throws an exception
I'm probably okay right because I'll get
works works breaks and that will
interrupt the flow and I can capture the
exception up on the top but in Erlang
does everything throw an exception not
necessarily right what might I get
instead an error to be right and so
what's the result of running code like
this well it's going to run works works
and then it's going to run breaks and
this going to run works and then I can't
do something beautiful like this I'm
dead right so let's express this in
another way what's an unreliable process
well russian roulette right when this
crash is this is probably really going
to crash right so and maybe the messages
that come out of this are click click
bang and click now if this actually
follows the rules of Russian roulette I
better not get a quick click a bang and
a click but that's exactly what I'm
going to get right so this doesn't
really follow the rules that I expect it
to follow so I'm surprised and mad and
ultimately sad right because what I'd
really like to do is what I would I know
that I have to do to fix this problem is
to either corrupt every single function
or add extra functions to my piping or
wrap functions somewhere in there or I
can corrupt my overall composition right
and none of those solutions are a good
thing but with the liq sir I can do
something else right I can change the
operator this is the big deal and this
changes literally everything ok so let's
look at macros and a couple of different
languages let's look at macros and
closure what's interesting here is this
little operator here this means rather
than execute the code right now I want
you to drop this code so this is a
compile-time construct and i'm going to
execute this code right now and it's
quoting the if and that means don't
execute that if statement right now
right so basically when you look at lisp
or closer macros you see quote and
unquote macros or instructions and
basically what that what they mean is
okay this should be interpreted but this
might not be interpreted but since those
since this might be the result of a
function often you can get lost in the
various quotes and none quotes right but
this is a tool that literally changes
everything here's a demo of the of the
macro in early well it's cut and paste
isn't it right and we do this all the
time right so what's the most common bit
of cut and paste code with OTP
Jin server right and how do we do that
now this rule should have been emacs I'm
sorry this there's a bug in the slide
this should have been in an emacs
template and then and then everybody's
happy i'm dave was talking about that
today right we're essentially what we
have is a language that isn't rich
enough to solve the problem that we
needed to solve hey inner macros okay so
what I'd like to do is build a macro
that changes the definition of all the
pipes that come after right so inside
this block I'd say okay while everything
matches this tuple okay in the wild car
i'm going to call click click bang and
click and I'd like it to execute up to
here and stop okay
so this is what we're after this is the
macro that we're going to build and note
there's a couple of rules that I want
this to follow I don't want that last
click to be prematurely executed I want
to preserve the syntax of the the pipe
operator and that preserves my intent
right that makes my intent crystal clear
and because of these two rules this has
to be a macro there's not another way in
the language to accomplish the task okay
so what is a macro a macro is something
that executes SAT compile time it's
going to potentially change the syntax
tree and since this is true this is an
especially powerful tool for building
templates of codes like OTP gen servers
right so when so basically in the ER
line community we've gotten used to the
idea that when we have a problem that's
repetitive we either reach for the
cut-and-paste key or we reach for a
editor macro right what we'd really like
to do is build something in the language
that can take full advantage right okay
so basically in this application up here
on the top somewhere I'm going to have
something that says use pipe right and
when that happens this is going to call
this macro here called using right and
in this case all I'm going to do is drop
in by helicopter this little line of
code that says import pipe and you
notice that this is inside a quote do
block right so basically what's
happening is that quote do says that
okay stop the world drop this code into
the syntax tree and then you see the end
there so I'm lifted back out of quote do
and then I started executing code
right and then I have the other deaf
macro calls for the explicit macros like
pipe while that I want that actually
want to build so let's look at one of
those so this one is is the pipe
matching macro right if you think about
it the difficult part about writing a
macro is keeping the scope in your head
there are two scopes that we're
interested in here one is the compile
time scope so when this code is compiled
what what variables what is active at
that time right the second scope is the
runtime scope and the runtime scope is
basically everything that's inside of
the quote right so you can also look at
it like a cute like a cruise ship so i
might be on one particular level this
might be the compile time level of the
cruise ship and i might have to go a
level down or level up to work my way
around the engine room to get to another
part of the cruise ship right so a
thinking of things invisibility in terms
of levels right so for example level one
these are things that the compiler can
see right
so basically it's going to win when I
execute this macro this is going to fire
and then I'm going to quote so basically
this code will not be interpreted except
the stuff that I run across one unquote
because that comes back up a level right
so in this case what we're trying to do
is drop this code into the application
rather than the the pipe well this this
is the the code that will drop in what
we're doing a pipe right so pipe while
has the arguments there's the expression
that that we want to that we want to
match right that okay wild card and then
there's the pipes right so in this case
I want to I want to pipe while and then
I'm going to build an anonymous function
that's going to say do I match does this
pipe match the expression right and then
and then I'm going to drop in the rest
of the pipes right and what's
interesting is I've actually defined the
first macro in terms of a second mecha
macro right so pipe matching is actually
going to call this pipe while well what
does the pipe while look like well we
have a strategy here we're basically
going to take the pipes apart and we're
going to keep firing the pipes as long
as as long as they match the internal
conditions right so the way that I do
this is I essentially have an outer
macro and that's going to call a private
function that does most of the work
right the atom macro is a reduced step
and remember reduced takes you know some
type of some type of primitive in a
function and and you know combines them
all together recursively so for example
if you had a list of one two and three
and you had to reduce with plus which is
a function
then it would add a doll them together
right so basically this takes the pipes
apart and then I'm going to pass this
reduce if function which is my private
function which has the accumulator some
type of some type of function which is
the reduced function in some type of
test which is the mass matching function
that we passed in earlier right you guys
following me so far so now let's look at
the private function so remember we're
on a cruise ship and we need to think in
terms of where the visibility is right
so right now we are in compile-time
visibility but let's dive in and let's
look at the code that we want to inject
at runtime right in this case we don't
want to unpack the this attribute twice
right because that could fire the code
twice so I say okay this accumulator I
unpack the code here with the unquote
and then basically I have a test right
if if my test is true then go ahead and
dump pipe the macros otherwise do
nothing and continue and then it will be
true for the rest of the cycle because
i'll continue to return just the
accumulator right so that's really all
there is to it so there's really once
you once you get set in your head that
there are two levels of scoping that you
have to pay attention to the compile
time scope and the runtime scope things
get a whole lot easier ok so the code in
block is really what's going to get
injected here and the code in green is
actually a macro code that's going to be
dynamically executed at compile time
right and so when I run the code I get
quick quick and bang the last the last
element isn't isn't executed at all
which is it exactly the behavior that
we're after ok so we just talked about
pipe matching and pipe matching solve
the problem where we wanted a much more
uniform experience with return codes and
I can actually see that work here
ok
up
I'm stuck
okay so off the screen you would see
click click and bang sorry about that
let's go back to here
okay so let's move on to the next
problem so sometimes pipe while and pipe
and pipe matching aren't enough for me
sometimes I want to map more
sophisticated behaviors around around
the whole pipe like for example what if
I want to make my return codes much more
uniform right like what happens if
something works and something works in
something breaks but this breaks breaks
in a way that's not uniform right maybe
it has a tuple and maybe it throws an
exception right so the best way to solve
that would be to wrap all of my
exceptions into something that caught
the exception and turn that into an
error and the exception to pool right
well fixing this problem makes me sad
right because if I do something like
like this that raises the exception now
I can't have a uniform now I don't have
a uniform uniform example anymore I have
to catch that on the outside right what
I much rather do is have the semantics
of that exception capture here and I'd
like to be able to deal with that in the
context of the pipe so I'm going to so
basically the problem is this exception
here
so what I'd like to be able to do is
build this exception wrapper right this
exception rapper captures the exception
and translates it into into a tuple and
then I can wrap that with a macro let's
pipe with right and now i'm passing my
exception rapper and so every single
function in this pipeline will be
wrapped with my exception wrapper right
it's not just exceptions that we're
working with here what if i'm working
with matrix algebra right so I've got a
matrix and I want to follow that with
plus 1 and x 2 and multiply everything
in that matrix x by that amount or at
everything in that matrix by that amount
we could all right that code in our head
right what we don't want to do is
corrupt our functions right we want to
say pipe with and then helped write the
code one time to deal with that major
matrix algebra and then throw the
function at every single thing every
single column in the matrix right so
let's say we have a list here
and then basically I want to pipe plus 1
and x 2 and have that work on everything
in the in the list right or maybe I have
a matrix that's arbitrarily deep I don't
want to wipe operators at that really
what I'm doing is I'm taking this
pipeline and I'm wrapping a function
around it at every single step that's
cool so this is accomplished a whole lot
like we accomplished the pipe while
right we're going to do it with pipe
matching and in this case we're doing
another reduce except instead of doing
reduced if we're doing a reduced with
right so we're going to wrap everything
every function that comes through in the
same function so in this case the
reduced width is the is the thing that's
changing here and again we want to see
what's we want to differentiate what's
happening on the outside of Kampala Tom
there's really not much behavior there
with what's happening at runtime and at
runtime we have an inner function which
in this case is the f1 in the f2 and we
have an outer function which in this
case it was at G function right so
basically
the inner function this function right
here is what we're is what we're piping
with right fu n is what we're piping
with is that the inner or the outer
function yes that's basically the
exception wrapper that we want to wrap
around the outside right and the inner
function is basically the function
that's going to come through with each
pipe segment right so when we do our
reduce we have an umpire that takes the
first pipe that basically takes the
pipes apart right and we're reducing
that with with the first argument which
is an accumulator which is the value
that we've computed so far and the rest
of the pipeline and the function that
we're piping with ok so we have our pipe
pipe segment our accumulator and we have
our outer function and and basically all
we have to do is unquote and that makes
this that makes this visible at at
compile time right so we're good want to
pipe them together with the segment and
basically all we've done is build an
anonymous enter function right and
basically we wrap that anonymous inner
function with an outer function and
we're done right
so now for my matrix math all I have to
do is some gum maps in here right
basically I can merge list which is
merch as a single list and then merge
lists which merges a bunch of lists and
and then I can basically I can use this
as a rapper to do my matrix math the
same way that I used a rapper to rap by
exceptions right now all I have to do is
build a list and call pipe with merge
list and then I could take the list pass
it plus 1 and plus it passed at times
too and it just works right I can take a
matrix which is multiple levels deep and
pass it take the matrix pass it plus 1
and x 2 and it just works
so basically what we've done is we've
said that programming is thinking pipes
express that thinking and transformation
steps right and the macros define the
way that pipes held things together and
that's all got questions yes yes
yeah so basically basically the pipe and
untie our expressions that that that are
built into the language to make these
things accessible to us at runtime right
I mean so basically if we wanted to we
can go parse the syntax tree and we
would see that inside out function but
what we'd rather do is we'd rather so
shows a has written these macros that
basically reverse it to us so that we
have the same benefit as macro
programmers as you have as an elixir
programmer that basically translates
those things in order yes actually dave
has encountered a few of those
situations dave was actually rewriting
some of the assertion macros in the test
framework and you know you're basically
parsing a syntax tree here right and
with Lisp so we actually had this
conversation yesterday afternoon in Lisp
the syntax tree and the language and the
language structure are one in the same
right now the cool thing about elixir is
actually one of the drawbacks of elixir
right this is the first time that we've
seen to my knowledge that we have macros
in a language where the the syntactic
representation is is divorced from the
syntactic is divorced from the data
structure of the AST right and the
benefit we have a uniform AST that that
is is the same all the way down right
it's a nested data structure the
drawback is that since those are a
little bit different it's sometimes
difficult to reason about about about
the code
yes you can so basically what you're
dealing with is in every single line I
didn't go into this on purpose but every
single line of elixir code is the three
tuple it's it's the operator which is
often a function call it's some metadata
like line numbers and in debugging
information and things like that and
then its arguments right and you can you
can imagine that that nested function
calls work exactly the same way
everything is just a nested data
structure yep
yes yes and you saw one right here you
saw that pipe and um pipe are macros
that that actually help deal with the
syntax tree yep yes yeah so so the
question is that can with with my cruise
ship analogy I said you can climb down
one level we never climbed down to
levels can you ever climb down to levels
and climb up a level well it's sometimes
we're actually quite often when you're
dealing with more sophisticated macros
you want to break things into smaller
macros or functions right and when you
do that you have to be very careful that
you understand how far down you've
quoted or how far down you how far back
up you've done right you might want to
put two levels of quotes around
something and then take one level off
but you want to run you want to wind up
with with the right you won't want to
wind up on the right level of the cruise
ship yes
the syntax tree is wide open there are a
couple of kind of structural caveats
like for example you can imagine that
everything in the syntax tree is a 3-2
pool you can imagine also that if you
were to pass some code that was a hard
coded three tuple you might have some
confusion right what's actually what's
what's syntax in the tree versus what's
a hard-coded three tuple so you have to
do some you have to play some games to
solve that problem yeah Dave no I think
he wants to ask is there anything I
can't do with the syntax tree but I
think the answer is is there something
that I can do with the syntax tree I
think the answer is no I can I can work
directly on the syntax tree in back rows
are just a convenient abstraction to
help me do that other questions and you
guys can tell that I'm learning this as
you guys are well not that guy I get
that right so say
Oh
so once it's defined as defined right
it's it's a you know it's you basically
have a compile-time pass which winds up
to be a multipass multipass basically
for each you know using right you guys
remember the using macro the underscore
underscore using that actually got fired
every time that that we encounter to use
more questions
it's really this is really the key to to
what elixir brings to the table really
it's it's tremendously exciting because
it's really the first time that we have
a language with Richard syntax that
we've kind of we have a steady uniform
syntax tree we have the rules for
building that syntax tree we have a
quoting an done quoting structure for
templating that allows us to have a rich
syntax and the full macro capability for
templating our own solutions right and
what that do what that does for us is it
essentially changes everything that
means that when we find out that the
language is not rich enough to do things
like gin servers we can we have a second
shot at right we can build macros that
can dry that stuff up right so for that
reason I think that the early community
is going to be using Alex or a lot even
people that like Erlang syntax and like
what earlene does to them and does for
them right so I'm actually a big or like
fan but I think that we're going to find
a lot of places where you build dsl's
around the outside and where you build
configuration in elixir because it's the
right tool for the job yeah
yeah yeah exactly and so so Josie and I
were working at at this idea that a web
framework is essentially we bound these
we couple things together that don't
belong couple together does that make
sense what we really needed to do is
define the concept of what a connection
looks like and once we've defined what a
connection looks like then we can
compose them into interesting ways and
one of the macros that that we we toyed
with is building you know plug that that
wraps this concept plug that wraps the
second concept and the plug could could
be a call into an erlang library it
could be a straight function basically
it was an abstraction it could be
another stack of plugs right but when
you start thinking in terms in these
kinds of terms and when you start
thinking in ways that can be composed
like this and you're not bound by the
original language and the rules of the
original language when you start to
compose things get really powerful very
quickly yes
so basically we can do that we can
essentially quote and unquote things at
runtime so you can actually see what an
expansion looks like is there something
that happens at compile time that we
seek compile time Josie
yes oh these are so basically if you can
see the way things are quoted the way
things are unquoted and you can see what
the final version of the code is trying
to do you basically have a pretty full
stack I'm not saying that this stuff is
easy this was I mean it's basically 10
lines of code that took me about a week
and a half two weeks to write it was
just insane exactly exactly exactly and
that's what so so there's a tension
between the Erlang and the elixir
communities for this reason right one
community wants to be very explicit
about the things we do one community
thinks that you know there's a necessary
tension when you decide that you want to
be dry when you don't want to repeat
yourself there's a necessary attention
that can be solved with macros and
there's a place for them right but think
about putting yourself and Brian who saw
the the ad ad world presentation what
was that 10 10 billion transactions a
second yeah I don't know a day or
whatever right so so basically if he
adapts elixir he's adding a level of
complexity that that's terrifying Brown
right maybe it's not such a good tool to
be using maybe it's better to have a
little bit of extra cut and paste so
that I can be explicit and the
developers and tension is crystal clear
right but maybe in such a system around
the perimeter maybe there's some
configuration maybe there are some
domain-specific language that we could
do to integrate this thing with the
outside world right in such a world it's
possible even valuable for Erlang and
elixir to coexist
more comments and questions yeah
right just returns a new yes and
basically the macro allows us gives us a
template language it's a mail merge
program right it says this is code and
then I'm going to do some mail merge the
problem is that you can be running some
code that does the merge right and that
code might execute at compile time or
runtime and that's what makes things
confusing and that's precisely yes you
can only do that that until the compile
passes the compiler pass is finished is
that correct so say so so basically the
question is can i modify to kind of just
modify the syntax tree directly any time
that I want to
so there's so you had two built-in
questions the first question was can I
amato again I modify the ast directly
the answer is yes and what are the
limitations around that and that's what
shows a just answered yes
that's right kept the end of the day but
to make sure I understand that that's
really all you're doing yeah so
basically it's compiling it's compiling
the stuff inside of quote and shoving
that in straight into the ASD that's
this is part this is a living breathing
part of the compile time pass yeah Oh
I can't but the guy is standing next to
you can so can you repeat the question
first Jose
yes
yes
so do you guys catch what's going on
here so basically one of the questions
is is related to how does Haskell handle
this type of concern so Haskell has
something called a maybe monad which
means that sometimes I might can turn a
null and sometimes I might return a
value right and and maybe allows allows
us to manage both types at the same time
and what Jose a is saying is that this
particular solution this pipe matching
solution emulates so that we basically
broken our own primitive type into a
couple and that's that's essentially
what we've done here well monadic type
properties yeah with with macros right
yeah it's not nearly as cool as the
haskell stuff but it's cool so I'm sorry
did I
yes
so a great analogy is that the Erlang
community and the java community they
have something in common and that's that
there there is a wall that's being hit
with complexity in terms of the amount
of duplication right java handled that
problem with things like aspectj and
bytecode enhancement and things like
that and and elixir is adding this
capability through the macros we have to
wrap up thank you
