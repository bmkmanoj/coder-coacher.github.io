thank you all for being here and welcome
to debugging code that crashes the beam
so let's just go over the general layout
I'm going to introduce the main ways
that Erlang interfaces with C code so
that landscape might now change because
people are investigating other languages
which compile object files and I'm going
to talk about when things go wrong and
that will then segue into debug VMs and
ETP the emulator toolbox for
pathologists I'm going to show some very
very small completely contrived demos
that will sort of demonstrate how easy
it is to take down the VM when you're
writing C code and then we're gonna wrap
everything up so a little bit about me
most of it was already covered but I am
working full-time and I am studying
full-time and in just last summer my
professional career as a programmer
started so I'm still very much learning
about everything the main languages that
I use are Erlang C and a bit of bash for
plumbing reasons effectively because of
the really really tight latency
constraints we have in AD Tech when
Erlang doesn't do something that we want
fast enough we often wind up rewriting
the stuff we need in C and then usually
linking it in as a port driver or an if
as to why I'm giving this talk right not
an extremely experienced programmer but
there are some very cool things that I
have found with regard with respect to
debugging code that gets linked into and
then run by the beam these neat things
are not exactly the most searchable
online I'm hoping that this presentation
will sort of serve as a signpost to help
others in the future and to help you who
are here
so let's dive into this Earling has
several different ways of interacting
with code written in other languages
these are the main four there are also
things like je interface and bifs but
I'm really only going to be talking
about these three and I'm not even gonna
go into very much detail there's a
really nice tutorial about that so
Erlang lets us interface with other
programs and this is really spectacular
for when we need speed that the Erlang
virtual machine doesn't necessarily
provide if we need to quickly encode a
string differently or if we have some
number crunching that we need to do or
random number generation crypto or when
we need to integrate with other
libraries suppose we're using some fancy
new message broker system and that's
written in C Erlang gives you the
opportunity to use that it's completely
available to you so starting with ports
these are the main mechanism by which
the Erlang VM communicates with the
outside world effectively a process will
open a port to another process and they
communicate with each other via standard
in and standard out and already this
gives us a lot of flexibility because
things like a new plot or R can
communicate through these channels so
right off the bat we have wonderful
integration with other well-behaved
programs and so the cool thing here is
that the non Erlang code is separate
from the beam it's a different process
we like process isolation here and
unfortunately there is a bit of an
introduced cost with overhead for
serializing and deserializing next up we
have port drivers and this is basically
a port slapped on to what is
called a LinkedIn driver and this is
basically a compiled shared object file
which gets loaded into the beam and then
these callbacks are called when certain
events occur this is how the Erlang VM
does file i/o this is how it manages
sockets it also does it uses it in a
whole bunch of different places and so
there's a really large API that we can
use we have great things that we can do
with these port drivers however they are
tricky to debug and a misbehaving driver
can cause the entire virtual machine to
misbehave in summary they're really
great for these asynchronous operations
that we need to do so any kind of i/o
port drivers are great Lucas got me very
excited this morning when he announced
inif select because well let's talk
about what NIF's are sown ifs are
similarly a compiled object file that
gets loaded in to the Erlang virtual
machine but the way that NIF's work is
that when they're loaded in they will
replace functions inside of a module
with the native versions NIF stands for
native implemented function and this is
how the Erlang standard library deals
with regular expressions and it's crypto
module when you look through let's say
crypto dot url' what you will see is a
lot of these functions will have a small
macro called NIF stub and when that gets
expanded that's really an error because
when the crypto module is loaded what
should happen is that the NIF library
gets loaded in and all of those stubs
are replaced by functions written in C
so these nips have really really low
overhead which is really great because
we're trying to eliminate overhead with
our very very low latency requirements
however much like port drivers these are
very tricky to debug and when they miss
B
they have cascading effects these are
best used for synchronous operations
that terminate very quickly and the sort
of canonical definition of very quickly
is under one millisecond if you have
sniffs import drivers that take longer
than a millisecond to execute you have
sort of a responsibility to chunk up the
work and to make your port drivers and
nips yield so I said misbehave a lot I
sort of alluded to what that means but
let's just talk about how the Erlang VM
schedules processes so Erlang uses
what's known as pre-emptive scheduling
it will start running a particular
process and after it does a certain
amount of work it's going to swap it out
with a different process it counts these
reductions which is basically it amounts
to a function call and that measures how
much work the process performs so when a
process reaches the reduction limit it
switched out and replaced with another
process in the queue how and the problem
here is that the beam cannot count
reductions that happen outside of Erlang
code if you have an if that takes five
seconds to run it really only shows as
one reduction to the virtual machine and
this is bad news because Erlang has one
scheduler thread per CPU core but these
scheduler threads are talking to each
other constantly there are various
synchronization processes that happen so
that all of the schedulers are kind of
working together they're communicating
and so when a process is executing
native code it's not communicating with
these other schedulers and the longer
that goes on the more the other
schedulers start to misbehave because
it's missing all of these
synchronization barriers so other
schedules will
they're schedulers will wind up waiting
on the scheduler that is running a long
NIF or poor driver so some general tips
for writing dips and port drivers you
should make sure that they run very fast
time them constantly and if they do take
longer than a millisecond you should
make them yield and have them reschedule
themselves so that they can be executed
after the scheduler has run some other
processes first and another option that
is available to us is if you're writing
a port driver there is a separate thread
pool which is mainly used for non block
or sorry for blocking i/o you can take
your port driver out and it gets put
into a separate thread pool because it's
doing there it's probably writing to
disk or waiting for a file descriptor
and you can also use dirty NIF's and a
dirty myth is effectively when you
annotate an if saying hey this is CPU
bound or hey this is i/o bound and the
Erlang VM will basically use dirty
schedulers to manage this work that's
happening either way so what do we do
when we have bugs in our port drivers
and NIF's we have a really great wealth
of tools for debugging C as well as for
debugging Erlang however we can't really
use any of them when we're debugging C
that gets run by Erlang we run into
trouble because this has happened that
the beam binaries that I use don't have
debugging symbols so if I try to use gdb
and I'm printing a back trace I tend to
get a bunch of question marks which is
not always helpful but that's fairly
straightforward to fix another problem
is that valgrind
will occasionally report false positives
saying hey this
thing is leaking memory when it might
when it actually isn't it just happens I
believe because the Erlang virtual
machine has its own memory allocation
and it's also difficult to run NIF's and
port drivers in isolation these these
NIF's and port drivers are run are
written in such a way that they can
they're meant to be linked in and run by
Erlang there is no sort of main function
in these so if you want an entry point
so that you can do fuzzing let's say
with American fuzzy lop it's it's really
not straightforward for NIF's however a
colleague of mine has more or less well
he has something working his name's
Julian Squires he presented at last
year's Erlang factory about this tool
called Miffy and effectively it's just a
very small shell that will let you load
in an if and feed commands to it and
then Miffy with whatever and if you
decide to load can then be tested using
AFL it's very handy we usually have a
fuzzing job running somewhere on one of
our servers that add gear I don't
believe this problem has been solved for
port drivers really it's a lot hairier
to deal with so the good news is that
Erlang has something called debug VMs
which is effectively just a Erlang VM
binary that is compiled specially to be
run in different debugging tools like
gdb or valgrind they also have make file
targets for purify and quantify if you
use rational software and they have
other targets for profiling as well so
I'm who among you on your work machine
will compile Erlang from source ok cool
that's that's a few of you that's
awesome
if you're going to be writing NIF's and
port drivers I highly recommend it if
only for the reason that you get access
to these debug VMs it is so helpful to
be able to run the virtual machine with
your NIF inside of gdb and to really it
will save you weeks if you do have an
issue so I highly recommend it as a
matter of fact in the slides we're
really just going to go through the
process of building Erlang and debug VMs
so Erlang is now in github so we clone
it and then we'll check out a particular
tag all the major minor and even bug fix
versions are tagged which is really
sweet
and so we'll check it out we'll read the
install guide because that's what it's
really helpful we'll find out that we
need to export this url' top variable
and then we're going to basically run
configure make sudo make install install
our documentation right there you can
see that I use Stowe it's basically lets
you manage symlinks really easily so I
can actually have multiple versions of
Erlang installed and I can swap them out
pretty easily so the next step where we
actually build the debug VMs is we're
gonna go into this the RTS emulator
folder and then we're just gonna make
all of these targets or just some of
them I exclusive I almost exclusively
use debug and valgrind the debug target
builds your beam binary that will you
will run inside of gdb and the valgrind
target will make a beam binary that you
can be run in valgrind and so once you
have those you also have this CL script
which you will invoke whenever you need
to in order to start up Erlang inside of
these tools quick note our - our gdb
will use the command line
client for gdb if you type - gdb it will
actually run Emacs if you like that I
just want you to be aware of it or if
you hate it you know be aware of it so
the next thing that we have is the
emulator toolbox for pathologists I find
this extremely handy when I get a core
dump from the beam because it crashed
because I write NIF's and I'm not very
good at writing nips yet
so what ETP will let you do is when
you're inside of gdb you can print
Erlang terms usually when you're in gdb
all you see are pointers to things and
you have no idea what those things
actually are with ETP you can actually
print the Erlang term inside of gdb it
blows my mind so the source file for
these gdb commands is sort of this path
I highly suggest you read it otherwise
you can also access the documentation
inside of gdb you just type help ETP and
it will print out some nice things for
you so I'm just gonna show what I copy
pasted it into my slides so I'll start
Erlang in gdb I'm in gdb I well this is
a an example that was taken from the
mailing list it's a really simple
example that I liked I tried to get
something that I printed with IO format
but too little time so we're gonna set
this breakpoint and then we're gonna run
Earl and we're in Earl
if you press control C you'll actually
go back into gdb which is kind of cool
and we're just going to run Erlang notes
hahaha bad arc and we're gonna get a
breakpoint when the C function is called
and as you can see we have these two
pointers and we have no I
what they actually mean and so the heads
on debt of ETP is that I can say hey
what's that thing pointing to and it
says oh that's a pig that's the pig that
called dysfunction and I can say hey
what's that biff orgs thing it seems
reasonable to expect that it's the
argument that we passed and so ETP has
several other really handy functions for
just generally getting the state of any
running process in the Erlang virtual
machine so I can type ETP process info
and I will get a message that's very
similar to what you may find in the
Earle crash dump file that gets
generated when Erlang has to go down but
it shuts down gracefully when you're
writing NIF's you can't you're not
necessary there is no guarantee that you
will have a graceful shutdown sometimes
you might just have a core dump or
sometimes not even a core dump and so
you might have to set your you limit to
unlimited then run your Erlang virtual
machine wait for it to crash and then
look at the core file but this lets you
investigate what the state of the system
was when it went down and this is really
helpful when you're writing NIF's
because this is really the only help you
get if you have an if that does
something that a normal process
shouldn't do and the operating system
kills that process ie you're in whole
your whole VM you have no idea what
happened if you're lucky you have a core
file and you have debugging symbols and
you can you know of ETP
and you can investigate what went on so
ETP has really helpful functions for
dumping the memory of the heap of any
process you can dump the memory of all
of your processes you can look at
message queues and it's it's very
helpful for when you don't have an earl
crash dump file so I highly recommend
that you
you take a look if you decide to build
debug VMs and after that we have just a
couple of other demos this one is
borrowed by Rafal who works in Poland at
erlang solutions this segfault library
is basically the smallest NIF that I
could find that will take down the VM
basically instantly so if we you know
run rebar shell and we run this segfault
generate function we get a seg fault but
is one really good at breaking so I've
been greeted by this when working at add
gear I have an if I'm not really good at
writing C and so I will I will write
code that crashes and when I'm greeted
by this it was demoralizing and my
coworker Julian says have you heard of
debug VMs and I'm like no so we start up
well first I'll export that variable
which is important for how I invoke my
debug VM and I start my er Lang shell in
gdb and I make sure that I pass reboot
the output of rebar three paths to the
code path for Erlang this is I use that
command a lot and basically it will
function as if I had called rebar shell
but inside of this gdb so here I am I
got some helpful messages Oh gdb is
loaded I'm reading symbols from the beam
binary and ETP will print some various
properties of the vert the Erlang VM
that you're running and then you get a
handy gdb prompt and we can start we can
run this we get our shell
I'm gonna call my segfault generate
again and I'm gonna get a segfault
but now gdb is telling me hey you know
the operating system told you to shut
down and here is what you were running
here is what you were running so line 6
what is line 6 oh where
do you referencing some variable and
we're setting it to a hundred well what
is going on what is the value of that
variable we'll type list and it's null
goodness that's that's two lines to
break the Erlang VM it'll break any
process really
but Erlang sort of is up on well it's
it's known for being extraordinarily
stable C is known for being really good
at having code that has vulnerabilities
in it and so when we combine them
together we get you know Erlang well we
get the stability of the lowest common
denominator here which is C so two lines
takes down your entire Erlang node but
we managed to pinpoint it in a matter of
minutes thanks to the debug VM and gdb
so we're not always dealing with just
seg faults we can also have buffer
overflows memory leaks memory leaks are
particularly troublesome because they'll
just slowly slowly develop and then when
your system runs out of memory the
operating system will kill a process and
it's it's fairly innocuous so I have a
very small demo heavily inspired by that
last library which rather than seg
faulting whenever you call the NIF it'll
just leak a little bit of memory so
rather than you know run it for days and
wait for it to crash I'll just run
Erlang inside of valgrind and here we go
so we're we get a message saying hey
we're in valgrind
and then we get our Erlang prompt and
I'm gonna say leak or call this function
20 times I get my tuples back and that's
it I'm gonna press control C and I'm
gonna exit and I'm gonna see what
valgrind has to say about how the
behaved Eyelock i leaked memory oh no so
I'm gonna rerun this with leak check
equals full and I'm gonna see what the
story is you know where am i leaking
memory and so the way to do that is
you're going to pass some flag or you're
going to set a variable which will
basically get read in by this CL shell
script and it will pass that to valgrind
and then it'll pass
what's at the end of the line there to
Earl and we're going to be back in where
we were we're gonna redo everything
we're gonna leak a bunch of times and
this time valgrind is gonna say here's
you know your general back trace you
called malloc from you know een if I
lock in this function generate and with
within minutes you've sort of narrowed
down where your leaking memory to a
single function which is pretty
wonderful for when you know you
previously thought you may you didn't
have these tools I use this basically
all the time sometimes one of one of the
VMS running on our servers will crash
and sometimes if the error log
information is interesting enough I make
shell into that server and build a debug
VM just so that I can peek around it's
very very helpful
I've even run our software inside of gdb
like just letting it go and it was still
surprisingly fast which was kind of cool
but that's that's basically what I came
here to say I had a bit of trouble
finding out about this when I was
starting out and I'm just hoping that
this will sort of serve as a signpost
for the future and you will all know
about it and you can tell all your
friends and when you go to the office
but basically Erlang will let you
interact with code written in other
languages through the use of ports port
drivers NIF's see nodes Biff's J
interface a whole bunch of other things
you can port drivers and niffs are like
the single easiest way to kill an Erlang
node and in my experience they've been
the most difficult thing to debug
however we can use these debug VMs to
run the beam inside of these debugging
tools and they will let us find almost
exactly where we went wrong and I make a
lot of mistakes so this is super helpful
for me and ETP the commands for gdb
thankfully provided by the developers
for of OTP provide a lot of useful
commands for just generally poking
around when Erlang does not quit
gracefully and what you're left with is
tears and a core dump so my my general
one sentence wrap-up of this is if you
have to debug a port driver or an if you
you have help I have some links here the
install guide T tells you how to install
debug VMs you have the Erlang
interoperability tutorial which will
teach you how to write ports port
drivers NIF's and c nodes you have this
nifty library which will let you run an
if inside of a small facsimile of the
beam and that can serve as an entry
point to your fuzz testing this is not
to be confused with another library
called Miffy that library is also super
cool but also super scary the other
nifty will let you write C code in line
in your Erlang source file and then that
gets stripped out and compiled into an
if and loaded back in its wild there's
this bitwise library
in Steve vinasse Keys github which shows
a couple of demonstration niffs that
show just how the Erlang schedulers
start to misbehave if you write NIF's
that take too long he also provides a
slideshow which is super handy going
through those slides gave me a much
better idea of what I was working with
and Scott Fritchie also has this NIF
wait more demonstration if that show how
the scheduler logic sort of degrades and
then lastly we have a tutorial written
written by Rafal who has that segfault
library and it talks about analyzing a
core dump from the beam and in it he
uses ETP to sort of show what is going
on where things are breaking and it sort
of catalogs how a particular bug was
fixed and that was a lot shorter than I
was expecting but that's that's all I
have to say now go forth and debug
excellent walk and bonus points for
being ten minutes ahead of time or so uh
well I I generally think that the beam
is pretty stable otherwise so if you do
get a mystery segfault its probably than
if that's the first place I would look
I love that blog
oh that's a that's a really good
question
so the question was how can the
documentation around these features be
improved well I'm hoping that when
someone Google's you know oh no my NIF
is seg faulting that somewhere Google
will respond with hopefully this talk
and that this will sort of help them
orient themselves I don't really know if
this stuff is not particularly
documented because writing NIF's and
port drivers is discouraged or if it's
just I mean there's so much work going
on as for things to improve it I do plan
on writing blog posts mainly that's
that's usually where I find my
bite-sized solutions and if I don't find
blog posts then I'll dive into the
Erlang documentation
so the question was is ETP compatible
with other debugging tools no I believe
it's it's really just written for gdb so
if oh I'm not familiar with RR which
cool if RR understands gdb or if it runs
gdb in any sort of way then I'm hoping
that it could understand DTP but that's
that's something that would be really
cool that's that's really cool RR for
rewinding
okay great question so the question was
what is my use case for
niffs and port drivers and sort of at
what point was it did it dawn upon us to
sort of write these things I
unfortunately was not at add gear at the
time when a lot of the NIF's were
written however I am actively working on
a port driver which has the Erlang vm
react to I notify events and so that's
sort of the integration side I'm really
not the right person to answer that
question but I can certainly forward
that so yes I notify ken l like there is
the I notify watch or I notify wait tool
which will sort of write something out
to a shell when it does happen however
I'm not I haven't played with it very
much I don't actually think that I
notify watch repeatedly prints events I
think it just opens a watch collects
events and then when you
I like send sig into it it will then
tell you the statistics unless I've
mistaken that with some other tool
yeah it would definitely be a way to
sort of isolate yeah there's there's
definitely a bunch of different ways
that you could react to I notify events
without having to write your own C code
that gets loaded in and then crashes the
beam repeatedly for reasons you don't
understand for weeks so if you have the
ability to hmm in in this case it's
probably more for speed than for
interacting with the rest of the system
so if you have real like a real need for
speed its it's hard to avoid writing the
stuff you need in in native code and
then loading it in i'm however hopeful
in for the future because of rust and
the various compile time guarantees that
it offers and it builds you know these
these native binaries and if you write
them in a certain way that Erlang
understands them you can load in an if
that's written in rust and there's an
elixir library called rustler which
which does that and a couple of my
colleagues are actively investigating
replacing NIF's with rust ada is another
thing worth investigating i it light
bulb
amazing I'm definitely gonna play around
with that I can put up with that if if
it's a dot so are there any other
questions all right well thank you guys
very much
