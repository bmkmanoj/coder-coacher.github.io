replacement that I've been working on
initially I used Reba with a make file
so i have a pretty usual workflow and he
wanted to be able to reduce some of the
time Reba spent doing things I didn't
care about all doing things wrong or
breaking sometimes so I simply replaced
over time the rules I used with rebar
with a pure makefile implementation so I
ended up putting it in this repository
extend along mkay and i will show you
quickly how it works what you can do
with it pretty much the same as rebar
and how to get started with your project
so you can find it on the type of course
i will show you with ranch here so we
need to create a make file in order to
use it this is the make file for lunch
this contains all the configuration for
along that mkay so a long dot mkay can
compile the code of course it can fetch
the dependencies and compile them it can
also fetch test on the dependencies it
can run the high Eliza it can learn City
tests and it can also generate a dog
documentation it also handles other
files dun Alyn files it can do early
digital files coil on files and a few
days soon so how it works is that we
define here or project name here its
launch
and from this project name the make file
will be able to find the dot up dot SSE
file to find more information about the
application it will also when you build
the project it will fill the modules of
the application in the dot up file like
rebuilders so there's really no
difference with web are here a
dependency here we only have test
dependencies a dependency is specified
by listing them first we will have
depths for normal dependencies and test
depth for dependencies which are only
fetched when you are in make tests and
then we defined for each dependency line
containing the link to the github so the
git repository and then the version we
want or master if we want the last
version then we can use a few different
options they are documented I want but I
know you with it and then we include
along the 10k so we can do a few other
things first we can also override what
happens when we tell when we type make
first by adding a rule on top of this by
default make will compile and fetch all
dependencies dependencies are only
compile once so we save a lot of time
compared to what you would do with well
yeah and one thing that this doesn't do
is compile the code in parallel
rebounders but this is only good for the
first compilation after that the cost of
launching the along vm is way too much
and this can be quite annoying when you
want to just check that the sauce is can
actually compiled for example here
we are done we can own dialyzer with the
common McDyess which should be pretty
fast fast also and then we can run the
test treat make tests so it's very
similar to Arriba you can easily replace
you make file if you have one with this
one or you can also replace Weber but
don't forget to call Megan said instead
of river of course the projects that use
this makefile are still compatible with
river you can of course use them in
ranch in a cripple dependencies and they
will still work there is absolutely no
incompatibility the focus here is on
making the workflow when developing much
faster ok so if you want to find more
information about this project you can
go to this address extern github.com x
turn around mkay any questions nope
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
