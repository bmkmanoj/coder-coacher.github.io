when you're talking about something that
looks usually it's a matter of meeting
of the minds from the business side in a
technology side and sometimes you will
find that they don't really care about
what programming languages are the best
or what technology should be used and
the real reason really in my opinion is
because of risk so the match of selling
technology in itself is actually a
matter of understanding risk management
and honest and approaching the problems
through the lenses of risk management in
this very classic chart what a chart
state is basically if a project is
finished then you know exactly how much
it costs if a project hasn't started
then the possibility of it going under
or over budget is very high and as you
progress through through the time and
get you more details get you more
getting a further phase of
implementation the risk shrinks so so
what you really want to do when you're
selling your new technology is to try to
reduce the size of the cone early in a
process so as to make it more palatable
to the business to get in to say okay we
can do it and there are multiple ways to
do it so again you'll want to look at
risk and value because depending on how
large your project is maybe it's one
week or two weeks or maybe is one year
two years the actual potential value ie
how much money we expect to make how
much money we expect to see is entirely
different based on the potential values
so when you're specifying a project
let's say you have a site that has to go
out two weeks later and nobody knows
elixir then in this case you will
probably not be able to sell elixir
because because you will have to take
more than two weeks to learn elixir and
you will go over the time allowed so in
that case the financial value isn't
really very high in doing that so in
execution what you have to do is to
reduce the value at risk
MFL a risk there are several examples
for example we know that we know rows
very well so we have fixed
like we have six my character encoding
issues in it always connection whatever
or whatever so these things are
basically the last and last naughty
person out here to finish 90% of the
work and more understanding of
technology can reduce calorie risk
during during implementation so lastly
there is the maintenance phase where
sometimes people will tell you we don't
want to use this deck which is obscure
or less famous because we won't be able
to hire people to maintain it
so what you can really say to these
people is that if we have specified and
built a project correctly then you want
to need to fire fight and even if you
need to add a new feature you could take
your time to learn how the code is
written and so the difficulties in
hiring really wouldn't be that severe
anyway so to carry on to your next topic
there is a topics of complexity I come
from a software-as-a-service business
where usually there's an adage or saying
that the more features you have the more
customers you will get but there's more
features mean more complexity the answer
is probably as probably no it depends on
how you have organized your application
and that is really another point of why
illig's I could be a good sell because
if you have a good tool to manage
complexity without actually having to
write additional Iser code or to do
duplicated work then what you really
have is leverage so in its case leverage
can be thought of as a multiplier you
put in time your spare resources you get
results with good technology if you get
better leverage through good technology
then several things can happen while you
can ship faster or two you can shoot
more or three is the entire premise of
the project what's wrong
ie it's not possible to do it then you
can find out quicker saving time
therefore reducing value at risk by
committing less okay so that's the
precept of this talk now the background
so as I said I come from a sauce
provider we work in international
education business has been there since
2007 the goal of the company is to
support transition from paper
because if it imagine an average
emissions office at an average high
school in the middle of the USA every
year there will be a period where they
are drowning in paper
everybody's sending an application
parcel from all over the world people
have to pay for postage and so on and so
on they're drawing in paper so the goal
of this company really is to support
transition from paper and you do
everything online and also do it without
ever ever asking the customers to talk
with an IVR system so you call somebody
and somebody answers and that person is
knowledgeable that's basically a premise
and a team I work from is an UK branch
for managed services so the differential
manager services at least as I
understand it is that we build certain
things for certain clients that are
important and we manage the operations
of these applications for them so their
KS they get the service and they use a
service that's basically it and
sometimes we do also spec writing so to
have arrived at the precepts we actually
had to context version ii contacts with
OTP and i'll tell you a little bit about
about these two contacts the first
contact of course is driven by the
business basically we've had a lot of
applications and they kind of work with
each other if one day we decided hey if
we have to become an integrator and
integrate with other applications then
we could expand our customer lifetime
value because then customers will pay us
for anything else that we are sell
but the downside for for being coming
integrated is how you now have to
integrate and anybody who has integrated
multiple systems written by motor
between two different times those in
different countries would understand how
much of our thinking actually is so
anyway one day we wrote a message
brokering ruby which is a classic
message bus architecture and that really
opened the door to OTP so as to say
because we've found certain
niggling problems with the ruby
implementation for example
lifecycle management is not it some
solid way to write custom code and we
had to do work sharing in a cup
in a constant way and in addition we
have a lot of error handlers everywhere
to handle issues that would have been
fixed by restarting so well what you
hear that you would think okay LTV does
it properly it isn't it yes ought to be
does it properly because we were very
annoyed by it and we wrote two
prototypes to try and see if there are
ways around it to find a better solution
so we wrote ooh
the first one is great would be the
Easter which is Ruby on a JVM and we
pull it in a concurrent Ruby Jam to use
our real shreds and a real actor is to
do the work it kind of works fine and we
wrote another whiny elixir which used
use OTP and his revision tree which also
worth mine even even better
unfortunately we ran out of time so we
decided to sign a contract with somebody
else and make it somebody else's problem
so so that was that was not entirely
successful however we still did a
post-mortem so in a post-mortem we found
out that we wouldn't be able to actually
do it in Ruby anyway because the
performance breccia would be out of
olive reach of what we wanted and in
addition this was not an issue that
could have been fixed by having more to
have more servers because what you can
do with multiple servers is how you can
handle additional workload that you
can't really frankly amount of time that
we our resources each workload actually
requires so so it was basically going to
be dead in a water anyway so that was
what what we learned and was also found
out about the ecosystems of are around
Jamie around the bean respectively so so
after after her failed first contact was
soaked for a bit and then we went for a
second contact which again was ruined by
the business and in this case it was
riven that only by the business papaya
vendor basically somebody came to what
is this hey this really I've been using
for three years is going away as Rios my
readers are still on and the replacement
does it entirely differently stores data
in an entirely different manner it's not
what you expected so this drivers to
look into a better solution because
because it was very annoying from our
internal perspective or if he was
furious and started thinking about
okay we need to get out of it we don't
want to reward this manner before for
taking a rock under our feet once you
make a buy versus bill decision this is
when the second context something comes
in because we went out to the vendors
and we also know what can you do is that
one one vendor told is give it one
hundred thousand dollars what we will
try in the second vendor told is yeah we
can try to do it but you gotta sign a
contract first and you don't get a trial
before you sign the contract which means
there is no trial or the average trial
that trailer is broken and all sorts of
issues propped up
it was quite an adventure and not only
an adventure in technical terms spells
on an adventure in terms of culture
because as I said before the company I
work for has a philosophy which is if
you want to try our software go to this
URL that URL points to an application
which reset every two hours so you can
do anything every single function is
available and you don't even have to
call us if you like it in Collis so this
is entirely different from from what we
have seen and and that was that was
terrible and we also realized that if we
have to do these pilot projects and and
so on then basically we will have spent
a lot of money and that money could have
been used to actually internally build a
prototype if we could basically money is
to be spent anyway so why don't we spend
it internally so we look at the row
options we can do sales we can do Co
tiers or commercial off-the-shelf or we
can do custom build so this is basically
a cloud forming in the VPS head and one
day we came to a mutual realizations
there are two so one is even if we buy
something we'd have to put it into our
application and we have to integrated
and if we found something that was
missed during feasibility studies we'll
have to try to fix it and if we don't
have the source code we cannot fix it we
have to change we could ask other people
to fix it and as a provider of services
we know that when customers tell us to
do something we don't always do it
because because it might not be worth
our while and this thing situation can
also okay to us when we
our vendors to do something so so we
decided that okay let's do a custom
thing but as I said before during the
first few minutes during the presense
when you start doing custom thing that
all your risk management ideas come into
play so our proposal will have to be
crafted in a way that is palatable and
actually realistically show a reduced
reduce risk during design implementation
and operations so what we did was we
spent a weekend we made a prototype
networks and 2nl we deployed it and then
we attach it to the proposal so so the
proposal was accepted and that was the
story of our second contact with OTP
which was successful now I want to take
a few minutes to talk about what we have
learned on concessionary OTP this is
going to be brief because multiple teams
have done this transition before already
so basically four major components rails
as its pipeline action table and active
record we like all of the other
available options currently available on
D so especially for the SS pipeline the
improvement in compelling edits is very
remarkable so another thing is that
there are several tasks that may may be
done or may not be known by several
libraries we have cases where we have
you made something else and well I don't
want to run in the imagemagick
process alder process and I don't want
to rather FFI inside of being so we had
to do a C program and customize it but
we managed to do it and we managed to
open source it
so basically difficult things are
possible easy things are easy in in
beamland
okay so now closing thoughts I'll send a
few minutes here as well again from the
stories you can see that most of the
problems you may face installing a
project a technology and so on can be
reused through different lenses and
there are four lenses I would like to
talk about
the first one is a nature of the problem
whether it is a wicked problem or a
normal problem and by a wicked problem
well it's more of a nun technology term
but in technology you can think of a
wicked problem that's a problem that
nobody knows a precise solution to in
order to find out the solution to a
wicked problem you have to have multiple
tries and each time they get you closer
or further away so what the problems are
like okay the customer wants this thing
but they cannot articulate and so on and
so on these are wicked problems if a
problem is wicked then you have to make
sure you plan for iterations and you
gradually transform the wicked part into
Russia's parts that are easily definable
in have easy answers the second thing is
the organization of your team whether
your team is large and require a
basically whether you want to keep a
large team or or keep it small team
because well as you know when you add
more people through using the
communication overhead goes up so in
certain cases the solution is if you
have multiple teams that don't talk
together and then make each team make a
micro service but you may want to look
into different options other than or in
having dis critical bases in discrete
teams and lastly there's one thing one
more thing which can be used when you're
trying to sell which is a mode of
control this is another own idea there
are three different kinds of modes of
controls free market forces contractual
obligations or cultural values and I'll
explain them basically this is a two by
two are horizontally you have z-wave
factor as in complexity uncertainty and
ambiguity so vertically you have whether
people are more self-interested or more
group oriented and these are basically
basically the classic target types of
workplaces if you could say so
so contractor obligations mean do this
or you are fired
and usually it will work if you know
precisely what is to be done if you have
written in to beta one implementation
then you can do that and if people are
over insulting this is free market
forces
but usually you will find yourself in
your team probably in high CUA
which which means that you're in a
start-up and things change everyday it's
always in flux and in these cases the
only solution networks will be to
impulse cultural values ie a set of
guidelines that people share so you may
want to think about it in conclusion in
conclusion in certainly Alexa per
concretely you may have several
objections coming your way and I'll call
these things perceptions so for example
you can have against some of the
objections say the perception is that
this is this new technology this is
unproven but in reality what they're
probably thinking is that there is an
implementation risk we may not be able
to finish the project and so what you
can do to address this niggling problem
is by having early entry and prototype
having a prototype which is working
proof that a technology is feasible and
if the prototype has good out-of-the-box
performance and has better dress like
how how its to be deploy how its to be
integrated as long as we have all these
things addressed then you will have you
risk a little bit more and that we find
however the pre-requisite here is that
you must have said ensure that your team
does have time to experiment and learn
otherwise you will never have time to do
on schedule works like this and if you
don't have any time you can schedule
work they will never have an opportunity
to make a prototype and you will never
have opportunity to sew anything and
you'll be the technology unless if you
have explicit backing which is not what
you want to learn how to steal
technology so another thing is maybe
well the technology is not standard ie
everybody is writing Java where are you
writing this weird thing so this
actually would be more of an ego problem
and or say this is more related to the
perceived complexity in IT governance so
because basically you're making the IT
managers like very hard by forcing them
to learn what this technology can do and
some people like it some people don't
and you can take time to try to persuade
them to like it
but well sometimes you can't the real
solution is to have cultural change and
it has to be button up and in certain
cases if you fellas skunk work model
what you can do is you have if you have
demonstrated successes in the past that
you do whatever you what you say you
will do and the things that you have
done are precisely as you said and so on
ie your key performance indicators are
all met then you may have more leeway in
pushing these things and eventually
arriving at cultural change the last bit
is on obscurity of a technology which is
a different thing from now standard so
in terms of obscurity and more talking
about the lack of people who know a bit
of Technology ie how many resumes how
many CDs we see every day has this
keyword so this is actually a silly
problem to begin with because inside if
you look at how long it takes to hire a
new person and retrain the peasantry
making this offer stack it may take a
few months if your week to a few months
for a person to actually learn first
help what a system does and then start
coding so the syntax or technology
itself actually is just that in minor
part of maintenance and in addition if
you have a constantly available
professional development budget then you
could have trained people constantly and
you wouldn't have run out of people to
maintain your up software applications
so of course your purpose it is you have
in your community is in order to send
people to right places
ok so I think I spent about 19 minutes
yeah thank you
