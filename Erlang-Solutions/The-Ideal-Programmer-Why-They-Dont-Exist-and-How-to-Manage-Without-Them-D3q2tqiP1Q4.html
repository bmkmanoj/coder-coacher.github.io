about airline is that even now the
programmers can program Emma now it's
far better to give a bad program for a
c++ because they never will gather get
anything to work if you use a cell phone
system in the segmentation violation or
something like that so the best thing is
as well see I developed the first
airline virtual machine in competition
with my friend little equals over here
and today and worried about the machine
called the V I know I broke never seen
called jam it's called chapter cuz the
actual architecture of the machine was
invented by Joe Armstrong was in the
center of their life so the 30 machine
was about sort of 20,000 lights of C I
became a much more proficient C
programmer than I ever have been an
airline programmer writing virtual
machines is a difficult part Robert
Smith talked about those equations later
today either
I then got a job trying to sell Ella
now at that time we thought you knew
sell programming languages you can't the
conclusion after was the selling
programming languages silly idea the
best thing to do is you using the way
free the people use them used to pay
money for them they say we'll use
something else well I didn't sell very
many in fact I saw what my friend my
friend from Alaska and I think the main
reason he bought it was the team could
get at work from at the United States a
saying that they implement that system
in airline he was the only one around
who could do that and therefore they
should care but guaranteed work permit
to work in Alaska either kinda don't
want to work masking any weapon that's a
different question I gave my life to
manage an Ericsson for about twenty
years
big broken Japanese small projects
people like the white you need big
program takes it just as an aside that
selling the radio systems are actually
incredibly complicated systems and
that's what they work with the last time
though people don't really realize that
the base station and the software around
the base station there are about seven
or eight million lines of code and you
can't write seven or eight million lines
of code with
ten people to try and that's really one
of the basis of my talk about what how
traps organize projects if you've got
two people three people we don't really
know hydration as soon as you get about
ten people working in terms of okay you
are programming in programming
development is about sort of 10%
programming about the rest of it is
working out what you need to do if in
race management testing the software
delivering it maintaining it remember
the programming is a very small part of
it nevertheless some people are ahead
for the site better than others I think
this is well known I'm sure when you're
sitting in this little pretty good
programmers bills I'm sure you also know
people who can program top why are some
teams why do some teams really work my
son keeps highly productive and some
teams you have to sort of bully and
chase every warning of sort of fire
their manager can be nasty to them all
the time to get anything to have one hit
sometimes work like that sometimes
doesn't
my cell project successfully produced
software which works itself and you get
another others don't
I think what I'm getting at here is the
differences between success and failure
and the difference between programs
about program but greater in the field
of programming that is a lot of other
the cocaine if you're building a house
you can have a bad build you can have a
good builder the differences between a
good bill of the bad bill that are
fairly sworn you can see it very easily
the difference is between a sort of good
software person unless about the huge
illustrator to see why do you can't
write large software projects as muslim
for small sort of bridges well I don't
have the answer to all these questions
but happy thoughts which I hope to share
with you today why couldn't we have come
to over the last 40 years of messing
around what one of the problems is
recruitment I took these self-identity
advancements on most a few years back
this is difficult and complicated they
asked the people that they want a C++
developer or they want a someone that
knows HTML or JavaScript or they want
someone that knows some other reason
technical technology now this is very
strange because it's just like sort of
our
saying to Salah I want someone that can
use a circular saw or I want someone
that could use a pickaxe or something
like that would you want if you're
building out a good builder you don't
want to sort of someone that's good at
using and how to use a certain door now
this is exactly the same software you
don't want people who know skills such
as knowing Java or JavaScript or they're
like COBOL or what everyone you want
people that know how to do the job and
this is one of the first mistakes that
you see a lot of companies make they
recruit people who know tools they don't
know people who know how to program so
this is a lot of rubbish
you should come happens when your
programs will know show that they're
productive this is not easy to find out
somewhat less productive you can only
give that that if code ask them to write
into its proper writing even gas the
water heater before and ask them to show
you some old code it's quite easy to
find out whether someone is actually
productive in writing Carol you are
certified someone that sort of says oh I
don't want to that I'm very good at my
job I don't want to learn anything else
that's really easy technology moves
forward you want people that compared to
learn new things that if you look at the
a lot of demanding universities teachers
will they teach what they call to be
into science right
a lot of them actually teach programming
languages they don't actually teach
people how to think or what to do
you have the right mindset you have to
think it's fun you don't go into this
profession you don't go into software
development simply because it's a way
bringing in nothing and paying you
mortgage on your house you go into it
which I think it's fun you don't think
it's fun please do something else I
started making a list of the ideal
programmer I stood in this man to become
a spirit understand technology operating
new technology understand the grass
mysticism a factory of birds is
beautiful they went all along and make
the conclusion you'll never ever find
anyone that meets all these requirements
what do you want changing the topic
cycling our summer chemistry with these
night later to get back to your elders a
very interesting paper press University
and it was a paper about programmers of
what programmers can do or what they
can't do the first thing is there is no
correlation programming with the age the
gender and the educational attainment
no tests no normal intelligence tests
can find other person program or malls
years ago I worked with people from our
age or the bottom generics who wanted
have a test to see if people program and
we sent a number of our best programmers
to
to psychologists and psychiatrists with
deep interviews to try and work out what
they think what they think well I
thought it's a good fun I think the
people who went on the test thought it
was an absolute disaster
but nevertheless we sense there are a
lot of people that the counselor kept
backing from this well they're all
reasonably intelligent and the main
characteristic you can say about these
people is that all beginning and that he
minded that was the sort of main
interior that they were so had their own
views so there's no caste and then the
other things Malcolm young people have
an idea about how programs should be
written
people marry forget the edition
of the kids in science establishment
learner programs top-down experts
building the bottom up but that's the
way it happens and that's why all this
modeling stuff is little crap they don't
work that way you cannot actually make a
model of one doing and then transform it
into current step-by-step the only way
of doing it is to try a little bit of it
and see if it works and if it doesn't
work you throw it out you write another
little bit of it it's a sort of
iterative bottom-up top-down process it
goes one extreme to another nevertheless
you'll find lots of books about you
about a programming that was actually
kid you into thinking that it can be
done in the sort of rational programmer
and rational engineering sort of way
this suits managers very well because if
you're a manager you like to think
there's a nice process and you can
predict via an end result it doesn't
suit people are actually trying to do
the job because they know that is
actually a little early she doesn't work
that way
and God you could develop as a good
program but not vice versa
that's interesting you have a lot of
good programmers who find it very
difficult about their code but find
someone that's when you couldn't finding
books of their cost and the fact that
program person is also a good good and
did their programming very strangely
that I used to find in Ericsson that
there were two categories of people that
tested software the categories of people
who were actually good programmers to
find bugs not only could they find both
even correct them there was a category
of people that could find bugs but had
no idea why they were caught what was
going wrong
now the second category of people always
people who are bad programmers and they
ended up in testing code City because
they couldn't get a job as a programmer
so watch out watch out so testers you go
testers make sure that they can actually
and write code and say can't make code
tell them to go make the coffee or
something like that then the last one PR
are like this one program another hole
like de práctica can't expect you to
make programming quantitative analysis
will find it easier the entire field can
be summarized or they don't a lot of
people think that a lot of tools as what
makes a good program you just give them
a good thinking on the genesis and user
tips or something like that you think
and you department do everything like
that there's actually nothing you can do
in the tips you can't do with a good
Emacs econo-mode and you don't need my
tricks that's what you need are the
tools we do the job
the important thing is actually wasting
time are occurring oxygen but when you
use that version it was a lot easier
so there are three types of people and
again you know the old joke about the
two types of people there are two types
of people who are those who think there
are two types of people of those who
don't really change the job there are
three types of people the people who
definitely learn to program don't need
any formal education I'm sure you can
across some of these people that people
that seem to sort of absorb programming
and the new languages and new skills and
new operating systems and you in tools
it seems to come in through the skin
sort of like osmosis they don't need to
do anything it just seems to so happen
that people will be program time years
ago and a good respect good job now
there's a third care people there is a
lot being true what programming is about
or how it work to help the program how
much we can offer these people are in
the software industry the logins never
be our kind of singing purposes in the
program you have to remember that the
third category by far the largest of
categories so remember this remember you
have to make sure you get either one or
two if you're in five people and if you
have Indian industry yourself because
they combined little more than the two
or on my chemistry there's number three
do something else there are far too many
people at the software that that's why
we see today that they're lion companies
sending a lot of their software
development to places like China and
India simply because management believes
you can't do anything without having
thousands of people if you can't do
anything about thousands of people where
do five thousands of people you find
them in China in India and they're a lot
cheaper than they are in
so I software should be developed by a
small number of good people and small
number of good people I'd say that
people good programmers probably because
of the developments probably 10 times
more efficient than the bad one
okay if I have a hundred people in my
team the local team for the final ten
good software programmers they can do
the same thing well how do I get ten
software be I pay them twice as much but
maybe twice as much and it's going to
cost me an cost game the factor five
anyway so you can't get yourself to
people but you have to realize hey good
software people a lot make sure they
motivated don't use bad software people
well we assess a dimension that says I
sent a lot of people to a test than they
came to know conclusion all the rest it
wasn't actually very easy way finding
out people recruiting people if you have
to do programming you just give them a
bit of code to write you've given a
simple program okay
go away here's a whatever language you
write write the surprises
Sudoku solver or some simple program go
and do it and so something which they
probably haven't done before and looked
at about two hours later what they
produced good program will be able to
show you that it works but what was very
very easy to recruit people different
majority of companies recruit people
discovered this yes and it's important
to say okay
good programmers do have other
characteristics they do not be able to
talk to other people
one of my people I work together with a
once in his name because it would
embarrass him is talking king of the
world talking to anybody so
a friend who works together with him to
communicate all this requires
nevertheless is one of the best programs
I thought strange it's good to people
that even grumpy it's good that sector
programmers children as good as they
don't smell characteristics which is
very useful but the main characteristic
is to be able to write code and you can
be fun and testicle find that very very
easily the very few companies ever do
that well characteristical program needs
to enjoy programming the need to develop
won't want to develop user applications
if you I want to find out what the
customer needs to deliver it whether
it's atomic bombs or whether it's
whatever it is they want to find out
what's the customer want not being a
person on receiving end of the atomic
bomb the person on are actually
developing it sometimes you have
customers don't know what they need
programmer has to be able to dig into
the time faster people workout and a
good programmer a good characteristic is
be able to find out what people actually
want I know it's easy a good program off
to continue being a programmer now
there's a program with a lot of large
companies a lot of thoughts companies
through route to money and experiences
powers to become a manager so a lot of
people sort of there are other managers
of the bad programmers with ambition who
actually filter upwards in the company
which is why and a lot of companies
you'll find that the managers are lousy
programmers and don't understand what
the other the people of the working
we're doing simply because they had
ambition knew they couldn't program the
easiest thing was to become a manager so
I program and continue being a
programmer not become a manager or
salesman or something like that yes I
think it's fun another characteristic of
programmers in ancient appearance of the
good problem he or she will eat
interference by somewhat under two dozen
that's not what they're doing now how
many rights have code you written today
nice to a relaxing my system to the
other graduates today and I say I got a
new matey
what backwards mess if I made it simpler
just don't like that sort of talk they
want things to be measured you can't
actually measure productivity a program
in compromising wasn't unusual a lot of
new things that that's my talk by the
way she's talking about the new program
also their programming languages to
operating system applications and most
importantly a broken program of designs
making experiments and a good program
and enjoys for the experiments fail
because they know they've learned
something I can't do it that way that's
another thing to the or but what ten
times slower fended it that way because
I wasn't the my program was making the
caches of the line ass failure
experiments which fail are useful and
you have to enjoy making experiments
when they are
where they fell and a good programmer
learns from his or her mistakes
that's what programming is about trial
and error process you try things out
they don't work you try things they do
work you have to know both of your
successes and your mistakes let's say to
travel and error-prone process and also
isn't that it's very hard it's a very
nasty thing tactical management in a
large company that you're the
programmers actually don't know what
they're doing they're just testing ideas
but down there when you come to think of
it it's all about travel now did you
write a bit of color the first thing you
do is you put them into a compiler
you spent three three hours staring at
the code together with the syntax errors
a cushy don't forget the compiler the
compartment tell you where the syntax
errors are and then you correct another
than you wrote or found any crashes and
you said oh widening crashing I find
that where it crashes is all the time
trying things out things of technically
it's not working you go back again and
that's a very important message which is
not understood in a lot of these books
of software engineering is trial and
error
that's what sort of what programming is
about like to think it is as engineering
discipline you'd like to think it's all
nicely present it's not doesn't work
that much a good programmer wants to
spend time testing its testings fun and
a lot of people who say oh my god
someone else contested I don't want
people like that ever work you're
hopeless a good programmer my training
necessary documentation a lot of big
programs have piles of powers of
documentation which do nothing except
curves the document shredder at the end
of the day you have to think what
documentation is important what do we
need at the end of the project it needs
to be current documentation so wire
system is designed in a certain way we
need
how it works and why it works how it can
be modified what you tell make the
structures are what they do go travel
likes others and teaching others it is
fun it doesn't think that's a trend over
there they can't program over all these
come into my room again okay it's fun
okay your friend can't program kicking
out but surf it that's what are you
doing teach you because the wall prints
turn around they're very good at doing
something easier than thing good program
likes looking at the old : st. gosh but
I wrote that but now it works contain
yolko thinks it's fun and they look more
like sending new features to assist them
so actually a lot of that is not much
thing about writing system the first
time writing system the first time
containing a system are two completely
separate issues neatly hopeless people
my category see people over there tears
and projects although those that are
either three aspects which reporters
you'll find that which is useful by the
paper above you have a consistent vision
of what you're going to tell them you
have to know why are you developing it
and you have no how are you going to do
it with three important things you get
any software project work or any team to
work together on what it's ok so you
have a detailed specification that's how
much fun usually because you can't mess
around with it sometimes
for example when we make best stations
we have a detailed specification which
came from a horrible institution go 3gpp
which described the air interface
between the telephones and mobile phones
the base station but obviously you
couldn't change that specification and
was not working right now so sometimes
you get detailed specification nothing
new about it
sometimes you think that specification
is a standard that you have to follow
this is the case with that sometimes you
have a vague idea what you all the world
would like a new new SQL database where
I should make one most people like a
chat server so I should make one now
that's quite good enough provided you're
capable of working out the details
yourself but you know what it is why are
you doing it a big idea
well this is a recipe for disaster
telling a story which I shouldn't tell
you
clerics gnostic also means 50 probably
counts
in the 1990s there was a project in
essence replaced the latest exe exchange
with a new one and the management
probably know what they were doing it's
all they employed about 500 people I
think he came up to a thousand people at
meow I think what up in the building and
they said designing a new system they
didn't tell us what the system was
the system why they needed a new system
so all these people started writing
documents of being away and working like
a small temper issues of talking to each
other they develop committees and they
developed hierarchies and they develop
new operating systems and programming
languages and all sorts of things after
the end of around five years have been
spent over 1 million pounds that's a lot
of money his message about the project
was discontinued and then he won't go
back into this the rabbit hutches
nothing doing other useful things
afterwards interesting story that taught
me a lot I was not involved ëthank not
was I'm sir watching you from the side
watching over what happened soon
actually not reported in the press
because it was crushed up this is it's
not timing I don't mean worry about
moving his head open careful I'll tell
you later how it was done because other
than very interesting notes which you
have know why you're developing
something why are you doing what you
doing you need to see the big picture
you to think it's useful writing
software you don't think this doing
anything useful is incredibly motivating
and a lot of people working companies
for their development ellipse business
software forget they don't know what it
is why they're doing that just kind of
specification that just asked to do it
we won by motivating people you have to
sort of see what you're making you're
not making it the old story of the man
hammering at a bit of stone what other
says well I'm doing a minister why am i
doing the height and I can make it
square bit of stone the other developer
says ok why don't have any better stuff
I feeling part of a great Cathedral yet
that much of it because now the whole
big picture why you're doing it
and if you know you're doing it
something useful you think it's a good
thing to do people will be happy and
work well now how is the important thing
how is we get down to technology there
must be a strategy for how the whole of
your problem fits together now you can't
have a product with lots of people
making various parts with all the
different technologies you have to have
your fitting together you can use
different technologies of different
parts ok that's fine you should go to a
writer here you know that we use
different technologies in Ericsson for
making now for example our control
systems on our basement processing
there's no way we could you tell - based
on processing because that's fusing
programming DSPs and doing things would
you have beauty through gigabytes per
second through the system no way we
could do that but the other half making
use valid for other things which more
sensible
yes know how it all fits together you
have to how the parts written in one
language operate another not be a
reasonable choice of technology the
reason company we're doing it this way
because the management told us that's
that was your reason you're doing this
way because it seems sensible we have to
show you why dream sense you have to use
technology people feel it right let's
try this trend is good this will be
doing this a lot of times I've seen
people using you are male modeling tools
and they know this is a lot of crap
another day she shouldn't work but on
the other hand they've been told to do
this by their managers and they're doing
this and you think those people are lazy
do you think those people right - come
on the dogs it just right calendar they
go up to whacking kids meet their wives
in the evening because of the capitalist
sister Katie I divide that probably
other reasons for that film using this
software
the result of alien just be nice there's
a another way she met here at not on
these something I miss going to do Keith
a richer that has our rivers and it's a
nice book who lives in New Zealand slow
excellence is not optional and so
evidence is not optional very true you
have to write good code it has to look
nice
geez well since we don't have ideal
program a software development team has
to have a lot of people I tried to go
through the theme every community needs
to see I sent people to the All Blacks
never bring me that rather to rip me
actually let me be closely you'll see
why I hate agile programming I hate that
you're programming without missing a
tooth this side and I'm missing a tooth
that side because I got it kicked out
when I was playing with me
I kicked out in a scrum which is why I
hate that you're programming you have to
avoid a meat-eating after and the team
which organized sensibly so no bikes
muscle bike
oh uh shellshock well i'll talk this out
loud you can all hear me the back anyway
yeah but you have to organize a team in
a sensible way do not organize the team
by having a crowd of systems people
carrying a crowd of programmers have
crowds at debuggers that's the wrong way
to organize a team you have to have the
right people I talked about that job
good programmers be working then our job
for a long long time before the word our
job was invented that a lot of this
ground extreme programming can't learn
all the rest of it Dino roar as they're
talking about a lot this was scrapped
masters backups it's okay I don't mind
that so stuff really works you can
organize things that way but let's face
it there's far too much religion of this
agile business good programmers organize
themselves properly without having to
have a textbook coming and how to do it
they know how to do it instinctively or
by themself we have people examples of
good technically competent people making
software in an agile fashion who've
never read a book about agile
programming or scroll it worked
so who did he in a firstly the Guru the
most important thing about the Guru is
he should know what or he or she I tried
to be supportive you correctly say these
things and looking at the root of my
regrets and revision she's here more
he's that's the way it is I'm sorry
about that
it's nasty fact about software which I
think we should do something about
Brooke each program needs a guru main
thing about the Guru is the Guru should
be able to understand the application
understand what needs to be done you
should go over to come to the Guru say
how does this work
the Guru must be the person that defines
the overall architecture you should make
me have one viewer maybe have two
viewers and pretend you should not many
of them have someone understand only
feature the guren needs to explain to
explain to other people how the system
works in the details the Guru has to be
a programmer
I've seen a lot of people who think the
software architecture can't program
little recipe now don't have to be a
person as you quizzes you it doesn't
know the answer to oppression those who
to go to ask how to get the who to ask
find out the answer the next time they
also the last descent question will be
all talks in themselves you need the
whole around an experimenter you need
someone that can jump into the system
anywhere and correct things and get
things working he's worked with
different separate technologies the
experimenter has to be able to do
anything the person that you say well
the really disaster occurs and no wrong
with the customer the experiment that
could jump in and do something there
when you developing something you're
getting nowhere you push in the
experiment and he works out what to do
you have to determine that that means
its simplicity and excellence making the
system simpler the sp2 performance mayor
in the system to see if he will white
house loan it what to do about user
friendliness is an important
characteristic to experiment worth
getting that developed the deficiency
your extend to forget about now but
making the system so it's easier to
develop easier than the tank this is
what the experimenter job going round
not actually being assigned to any part
of the system but going around messing
around various bits of it you have not
someone someone that maintains that what
why how spirits are the project someone
the connection reason of being
enthusiasm make sure that the aspects
are actually care thought about a lot
forgotten the now as for how the various
but you can't well think that's a
project I'm you have to approach in that
we are very very flexible project
person is doing this again is a hard
programmer you have to be sure that
people drug projects actually know how
to program there's a normal profession
in large companies project managers
project managers again the people that's
escape from programming because the dot
like you can't do it side vocopro really
emerging managers instead and this is
completely the wrong sort of person that
I was a project manager
their mechanics we have to put the
structure on their software you have to
have a build system you have to have a
system where we test system you have a
version control delivery system in
emails and wiki's and communication book
handling systems you have to have
mechanic to make sure the whole
infrastructure hold tools infrastructure
and Chile works and the whole Billiton
system actually works keep it red in
Greece that means all the wheels five
things which go goes wrong these people
are usually into operating systems and
right new drivers if they need to and
nevertheless know people that can sort
of equally program sent mail config
files or equally sort of go into an
information management system or you can
go into the bunches that you can run
maybe they don't actually do the job but
they grease the wheels will make sure it
works for other people because these
people have to be programmers as well
super tester you really have to have
somewhat a really sadistic it only
thinks that the testing is an ayah point
the books of the system I'll show that
what's wrong to work at all the peculiar
things that can happen what a system or
ha the super caster has to be able to
explain the faults and they found can't
just say I did this and it doesn't what
didn't work has to be able to go to
people responsible for that part of the
system and say I did this it doesn't
work and I suggest you change this and
this to make it work as to understand
what's going on there have to be someone
work checks that coverage analysis being
done on the testing all the coding
to test it no big gaps nothing which is
not definite test isn't it the other way
I hope this has been helpful so the
person I call the percentage is not
really say this this person has to be a
very friendly person if you come for the
people I'll say there that I know I
didn't I'm sure you can fix it you have
a librarian sometimes the same person as
the mechanic in this poverty the tech is
the overall version presenting checks
thing things of gently and correctly
make sure that the whole system is
actually ticking away the system that
could software is actually being put
into a good configuration management
system whether it's or whatever it is it
doesn't really matter as long as you've
got one anyone can produce pressing a
button but needed you need this quite
often the same asleep becoming document
later the persuasion the documents were
applications nearly as well as the guru
who write the manuals please notice now
what needs to be documented what doesn't
need to be documenting it right
user-friendly man you understand the
needs of the people who write the
documentation I've seen time and time
again manuals written by people that are
shoes everyone understands the system
completely or I've seen manual written
was associates simple that it excludes
all the detail that were needed
documentation is needed and document
that has to be able to write clearly in
the language of the using usually
Englishmen in unison yeah document has
to give program you have to work when
something is unclear document that has
to be able to read the code understand
it and then you say that's right well
that's what I
it's quite often people program things
because there wasn't specification at
that time and then the the peach of a
program that means completely
undocumented because no one understands
how it works it has to be able to
understand and then of course at the end
of the day of the Batman these are the
programmers anyone that works and spends
there are days that totally try the Mara
fashion has to be back there's no other
explanation for it
who programmers should be able to tell
they have any aspects of their bills and
the group program is an individualist I
see from time to time that especially in
big companies that need to put even a
huge open plan offices thing if it works
Brooke Romo has to be efficient was self
into a quiet room work by the reserve
for some time come out of their shell
and then tell other people our world
that an individualist is an actual
characteristic program my question you
need to ask is this at the end of the
day you have no you have to process
after how is the system you know you
have to the house of architecture if the
party of its program yes they built
rights within how to attain a version
control is done
if you don't have a processor and it
done suddenly doesn't have been written
down but it has to be completely
understood we don't have the process and
you're in trouble you have to know how
everything works with it developers off
of there
on the other hand if you believe that
you have a process and you're down the
process you don't need any so kind of
people they just have to follow the
process and they don't come out then
you're in deeper trouble that's a if you
believe they always have to follow the
process you're in deep trouble but you
have to know that it's a process and
there's a way which destroyed the start
was initiative in America - thank you
good thing I recommend you read that
because it actually explains a little
bit about processes now talk the bits
now I have mentioned much about airline
that's what you all came here to hear
but so I put say a little bit by the
airline before I finish before I do that
just remember these four buzzwords the
far as software development you know
what you're going to develop yesterday
why you're developing it
how do you develop baby who is going to
develop it you haven't competent people
you have to know what you developing the
product area who the customers are how
about technology you use those are the
fourth buzzwords trend into success in
in this area and we have management to
concentrate why individuals an HR who
usually succeed in recruiting to the
wrong people
so whatever good now go for again
Oh a lot of things I'm sure you
seriously know these better than us or
other zone concurrency distribution
compactness naeun :
well that's fairly obvious error it can
be handled separately you can do the job
code that's also important which is not
true for very many other than
navigations easy to view lots of
ready-made stuff available fast
turnaround times fast turnaround times
is actually one of the most important
aspects now they're like one of the
requirements we have this began to
change code on the fly and that's
because a lot of the equipment in
telephony you can't take down the system
to upgrade it to correct errors well I
actually had the side effect which I
didn't never thought up at the time if
they were fine and it makes building and
testing a lot faster it means that when
you actually have developed something
and you're testing at anyone's incorrect
something you can actually learn new
code into the system you're testing
without having to build a complete
system and that is a tremendous
advantage that's a in some respects
that's one of the best things about
their line you can actually load code
into a system and test it and you don't
have to restart the system built you
have zero build times I think that's
where the uniqueness why don't the long
the other thing which I think it's my
mind is very important it's very easy to
go there and learn ever I apologize for
the syntax but so once you've got past
the other the once you've got possibly
that the syntax it's actually a very
simple manage it's a lot simpler than
C++
job or something like that there's a lot
more powerful but simplicity is useful
but as I say qualitatively so you make
it concurrent you should be the sake of
existence and remember it's not good for
everything
don't try program DSPs they're like bad
idea I know some people into working in
a solarium able to get someone but today
don't climb it's also iterative you can
test ideas by protecting you need
prototyping you get things fast in there
that's one of the real advantages and we
get back to the sort of a trial and
error test your ideas find out how it
works
find out who's video it's ok it doesn't
work scrap into something unit st very
ground falls zero real time finding
personal emma fits the bill very well
and this is really what it's all about
it's about the speed of development
if the faster you can test your ideas
and quickly or get your product on the
popsicle market getting that first is
more important than anything else in
this program it actually more important
than that to get that there first and
having a full-featured system it's
actually more important to get there
first and having the system which is
their community freedom boats getting
your system our talk to the market
before anyone else does more important
than any other aspect because it's the
first person that defines the market the
first person sets the prices were the
first person that makes the profit
remember that that speed is what should
we make money from and speed is what you
can make money from inside where it's
not making wonderful super product it's
being there before anybody else is there
that's what that's where the money is
and since we all want money I suppose I
think if you're the ho
since we all want money that's what it's
all about well that's what I have to say
today that much about that I added bit
at the end because I thought was little
about there thank you all I came to this
by there and I hope you don't mind the
moment in here but ok any questions or
comment you have a coffee afterwards oh
yeah actually it's a very long story
that it was a complete accident
I'll tell the story look very very
briefly but when we first started
selling me I like to say that I started
a company called the airline systems
axiom of argax akagi's means limited in
Swedish we imported complete psychopath
who was the manager of the company I
thought he was a psychopath he was a bit
strange that yes firstly employ this
wife and let me employed all these kids
and then we started buying big cars
large offices and furniture most of it
and they're behind management above me I
want the money then decided to fire this
guy it was a very good thing to do and
they were going to discontinue the
company how nice of said oh well we
should discontinue the company that's it
sorry lads and so what we do I think
about it we'll have to find someone to
take it over and do run itself to us
that's it
well I might have a try for a few weeks
well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
