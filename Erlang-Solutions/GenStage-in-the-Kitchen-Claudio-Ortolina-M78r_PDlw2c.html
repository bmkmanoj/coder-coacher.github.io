3d it's really good to see a room like
most people so it's great so what I'm
talking about today is guess the title
gives it away gen stage in the kitchen
so yeah I mean Keith introduced me I'll
show again this coordinates about me
after if you have questions or what I do
is is simple I work at urban solutions I
work mostly in elixir and I try as much
as I can to keep close contact with all
the development in the in the community
which is also why I'm talking about gen
stage today there's people from the core
team in the audience I think I saw James
beforehand although I can point it out
now we so it's good - it's good to see
also familiar faces so let's imagine
that Johnny I mean he is around but
let's it less like if we can imagine him
asking me this question
so what would you like to be if you
weren't self to develop and the answer
would be a chef like or at least that's
what I like to try to be it's a it's a
difficult job but I do love cooking so
I'm trying to do the best next thing now
which is basically try to aim to be as
good as this person so if you don't know
him is Massimo Bottura
iran's austere francescana it's a
restaurant in italy and in 2016 was what
was the best restaurant in the world so
say like that's that's ambitious enough
I can try to do that but as I am a
developer I'm trying like through the
back door which is
troduce gen stage to model a restaurant
where I can point you a little bit on
the right hand corner simplified version
meaning that the way a restaurant and
the kitchen works that they it's a it's
fairly complicated it involves a lot of
people so well it's technically possible
to build the entire thing we are gonna
look at the streamlined version mostly
because otherwise we will need to speak
to ours and I'm already
sitting between now and coffee time so I
don't definitely don't want to do that
so before going into the details let's
look at gen stage who has have never
heard about gen stage before in the room
okay so Jess H is built to use basically
to shape and model event-driven data
flows so if you look if you look at this
example this is your traditional event
base flow so you got events coming in
your system and the entity that
basically lets this event committee and
we're just gonna call it producer then
you have something inside that does some
sort of like initial data processing on
these events and at the end of it you
have an and a consumer so think about it
this way you get analytics coming in
producer the second layer is for example
adding metadata to it and the third
layer the final consumer is storing them
for long term now in a traditional
system this uses a push mechanism
meaning the data comes in from the
outside world ten events at a time let's
say go in go in and they reach the
consumer now the question is what
happens when the consumer dies or
crashes or slows down even just just
becomes a bottleneck effectively you've
got a massive queue and the queue
basically means that the layer above
cannot push below so you got a second
layer you start accumulating stuff but
from the point of view of the producer
everything is good like it keeps upset
like that producer keeps upset in events
they go in so from the outside world
everything is fine which is not the case
so for example if you are consuming
there are the comes in for example
through a queuing mechanism you're going
to ingest events you're gonna say yeah I
know what to do with them I'm gonna
process them and because everything is
crashing most likely that will be gone
so a way to combat this problem above
from being able to recover this with
traditional methods like supervising
trees or like things that that is to
shape the problem differently which is
what Jane stage does so switch the
perspective around and go to a demand
driven flow where the innermost layer
asks for things to do the demand is
passed back up the stack until it
reaches your external layer and until
this happens until the last demand
reaches the producer the producer will
keep things that come in at that layer
they will not go down the stack which
means that if the consumer crashes here
things are all good but up there we
start crying we start crashing because
this and a point here because it's
easier than pointing at this point we
don't have anyone anymore that does the
work deppoh dead secondly the producer
consumer does not receive a demand so it
stays idle but because it does not
receive the man it does not demand
itself data for the producer so the
producer is accumulating and at that
point the producer can make a choice and
say okay I've got too much data I'm just
going to stop except the invents coming
in and you isolate the crash outside the
system how do you handle this demand
demand in a stage these are just like
we're not gonna look at everything about
your stage and just giving you the basic
coordinates is that it demands for
events per se he asks 5 then it
processes 3 and asked for more - in the
meantime so it's concurrent in terms of
asking for more data and processing data
and it keeps going and this is what if
you read about it is the concept of mean
demand the max demand which threw me off
a bit in the beginning so that's why I'm
mentioning them right here so the
one thing to know is that he optimizes
for to avoid why is it not going on
sorry okay yeah I'll just press the
mouse it processes while requesting so
that no one stays idle and then no one
noticed the typo sorry so let's actually
go to the to the meet see what I did
there again to the meter the topic we
are talking about a restaurant so a
restaurant has like some tables let's
say four tables for now but more than
that
and a waiter that takes care of them or
more than one for all intensive purposes
we're gonna focus on one waiter then a
chef and after that line cooks now if
anyone has extensive restaurant
experience and finds issues with this
please tell me later nodding the
questions later but again line cooks
they worry about a specific type of
preparation so for example if the you
are doing grill or they're doing they're
cooking things in the oven so they
receive only a subset of the orders just
specific dishes prepared them and then
once that's done there would be more
people involved than just gonna in our
case they're gonna pass them back to the
waiter and say just put them on the put
them on a counter they're ready the
waiter picks them up and gives them back
to the table okay so if we look at the
detail like just very quickly the
details of the things each each
component does so when you sitting on a
table people take some time to choose
the menu there's always the very slow
person that takes ages that doesn't know
what to get and then you basically tell
them like get this cause that's good I
was here last time and maybe you're even
lying about it but it doesn't matter
when everyone decides what they want to
get you just call the waiter if you're
lucky that just goes by otherwise you
signal very visibly and if they don't
show up we are
we're on a very posh restaurant like is
this the best restaurant in the world
then he had you have to be a bit posh
about it when you go there so if the
waiter doesn't show up in first second
you just get up and leave and after
ordering then then you'll be more
patient you wait a good 30 seconds after
your order and they have to deliver your
dish but as soon as they leave at the
first dish then you can wait a bit more
so they fit in the units they bring just
one at a time so all in all we have some
specific constraints about this then
again if these expires they fit this
time out expires
everyone leaves the waiter the waiter is
goes around collects orders from the
tables and then passes them back to the
chef doesn't do much else it pretty much
just collects things around when the
dish is already it delivers them one by
one to the table we are not gonna make
it more complicated and collect the
orders just one dish at a time and the
chef and this is where there's a bit
more I guess restaurant knowledge is the
chef receives orders and then figures
out in this order you go five dishes two
of them go to the line cook that does
grilling two of them go to the line cook
that does meat and one of them goes for
the stews so in essence it basically
dispatches things as as they come in and
each line cook receives a dish request
and prepares the dish and I'm
registering form the waiter when it's
ready so the waiter can pick it up okay
so we go let's go back to that diagram
so once we have this knowledge in let's
let's think about how we can use the
ideas we saw from Jen's stage to model
this problem so the tables place orders
now we don't have control over people on
the tables like they just place orders
and they call the waiter whenever they
like so we don't have a choice we have
to accept that as a given
so tables are our external border are
our events that come in
that they don't we can we cannot
schedule and we cannot demand for them
they will just come in and the waiter
just has to collect them I mean he's got
a thick notebook so it's gonna be okay
but then the chef can start to approach
this by demanding things to the waiter
like the chef can say hey I'm not like
the kitchen is now ready yet so please
don't come in with the orders just keep
them there for a moment like go around
tell some jokes
serve some wine here's some bread like
things that you can do just to keep
people entertained but until I'm ready
to dispatch orders don't bring me
anything so the chef demands orders and
we're trying to use here the terminology
from ghent state so that we can exactly
express that with them with the right
flow finally the line cooks they demand
dishes like they don't care about orders
they care about single dishes so they
ask the chef you have to give me exactly
the thing things I need to do so if we
if we see that then let's look at this
from a different perspective how do we
model this with actual dishes so with a
clever use of icons we have a steel and
a steak and then for like a fortunate
coincidence those two tables are
ordering exactly the same thing but it
doesn't really matter it's just it's
just what they ordered
so in this in this version or of this of
this architecture we have basically
against edge flow that starts from the
waiter and goes to the line cook because
as we said before we don't do with our
model tables through that because tables
are the equivalent of your open socket
that last data in so tables will use a
different mechanism to generate data but
we can start to say okay what's the
waiter well a waiter the only the only
purpose of the waiter is just grabbing
this this data so in essence a waiter is
a producer and a waiter is a producer
that we can live pretty much with
default settings so it's a producer that
uses as a broadcast dispatcher now
dispatchers are a way that Jen stage
provides to decide how to fan and
distribute work to the subsequent layer
so a broadcast dispatcher gives the same
thing the same event to all consumers
that are attached to it without any
specific routing rule so if you got
three consumers attached to the same
producer and you're using a broadcast
dispatcher they will all receive the
same thing now we got only one chef
because if you had to I mean it would be
a nice restaurant I think like to see
how the whole thing goes but we only
have one so we're just gonna have we
need just a normal broke-ass dispatcher
but when the chef demands the orders it
does the chef does two things first of
all he gets the order and breaks it
apart in dishes so from this point
onward a packet of data it's not going
to be the entire order or the table it's
going to be one dish at a time not only
that the chef has to decide who to give
the dish sorry I broke that sentence the
chef has to decide the line cook to give
the order - and can I have a small
applause for the for the English thank
you thank you that was a tricky one
but yeah so we just do Hey so the chef
is a producer consumer which means that
it receives data being a consumer but
also produces it because it transforms
it and passes it on and uses a partition
dispatcher partition means here's the
data I'm gonna run a hashing function on
it to figure out where it needs to be
routed and then I'm gonna pass it on to
the right department in our case our
hashing function is pretty much a look
up in a table it says like okay this
specific dish is stew so it's just going
to go to a specific line cook this
specific dish is a steak so it goes to
the other one it can be anything
depending on the problem this is
something that is left completely to you
to implement it's the default
implementation most likely it's not
gonna be what you need because it's a
very domain-specific operation so our
line cooks they receive the dish they
need to prepare so the first one gets
its own stews and the second one gets
sticks and there are consumers that are
set up with a specific partition so when
you when you boot a consumer and you
wanna you want to give it a partition
you just decided up front now this this
can be done like in different ways in
our case we know the topology up front
of our restaurant so all of our
architecture so we just decide upfront
we're going to have one line cook that
the stairs and well I could does that so
this is clear now before I mentioned and
this is just like a style sort of an
aside on what what something that I
thought it was pretty cool in in general
in elixir just to model something like a
table so a table each table is a process
and a process a being a table you come
other people deciding just by basically
keep passing messages inside it's a
inside a table process so when a table
when you sit down you can say okay this
Jen server process for the table starts
and people start looking at the menu and
then when you look at the menu they
schedule a decision which in our case it
just means randomizing over range which
becomes a pretty much the time it takes
for someone to decide and that once that
time expired once that time expires we
send the message for a decision and if
we get to the point where everyone has
decided so they let the number of dishes
in the state of the process is the same
as the size of the table then we inform
the waiter otherwise we just keep
looping and I think it's interesting how
the language
allows you to model things like time
passing or random events or things that
are things that you could find useful
for example if you work with with
hardware I'm sort of like mocking this
type of things it makes it very easy so
I just I just thought this was nice to
to share because it's a it's definitely
made my life much easier in trying to
build this simulation so we can now look
at the relationships between the
different components in that simulation
so let's look at how the table and the
waiter how you would model that and then
we're gonna we're gonna see some metal
calls but nothing no big chunks of code
because it this is mostly just to give
you an idea on how you would model that
but the nitty-gritty details are in a
repository which I may share although
the chorus is pretty rough around the
edges but we can see that later so we
had constraints around the table the
table was people were very posh and
picky so they want to make sure that
when they asked for a dish that order is
taken seriously up to the point that
they want to make sure that it's gonna
be cooked so to do that we can use for
example a call so Jen stage called the
table cause a waiter with an order and
this pretty much blocks until the waiter
can confirm that the order has been
processed correctly meaning it went
through the chef and is being cooked and
to do that we pass back we explicitly
the waiter caused a reply and with the
reply you can reply back to the table
now this may not be exactly what you
want in many instances like depending on
what kind of guarantee you want you may
want to use different type of cause if
you want to trigger this specific
behavior in our case I just went for
like the most restrictive option from
the point of view of giving reassurances
to the tables but the interesting part
is that you get to basically move that
concern up and down your entire
processing line so at any you could for
example because you get a reference to
the table when you call something on a
subsequent layer then you can decide
okay this is the point in my processing
flow where I can confirm that this
operation has been successful to the
outside color maybe you're gonna do
extra processing on it but it doesn't
matter like you don't necessarily have
to wait until that point so in our case
in forming a waiter requires a reply
from the server next and I shamelessly
borrowed the implementation of the
waiter from the one of the main agenda
CH blog posts where Jose was showing how
you would build an event dispatcher just
like a normal event dispatcher which
happens to be very similar what you want
from a waiter so you can model the
waiter as a queue while you put in an
order at the time and then the the
waiter goes to the chef and the chef
grabs that order and sources out the
interesting thing about this is that and
this is one of the beauty of of using
gesture is that this is completely first
of all hidden from the point of view of
the table and the chef will just shown
it here but it doesn't matter they don't
need to know and because and the second
is that the implementation of this
specific bits is left up to you so you
can decide what type of cue you want to
use inside a specific point inside a
processing line you don't have to use a
cue if you don't want to or you can
slice and return specific subsets of
batches the way it works better in terms
of performance or patterns like just it
just really is completely up to the
developer in terms of implementation so
in our case we can stick with a cue and
then how do how the let the whole thing
how does it get buying bound together
like this chef to bank to bound together
two elements in a giant stage pipeline
the lower level so for example the
consumer in our case the chef has to
subscribe to the waiter the chef has to
say okay waiter just like give me give
me the the orders now I'm ready like the
the kitchen is on so I can do it or
synchronously because if you put them
for example inside a supervision tree
maybe you don't need to expect to have
exactly confirmation that that process
has been completed synchronously you can
subscribe a synchronously and your
supervision tree will just take care of
responding when things go sour and how
do you model the relationship between a
waiter and the chef it's all done
through callbacks in from the point of
view like a waiter receives the demand
so waiter has to know how to handle this
demand in a similar fashion as chef
receives events so the chef has to know
how to handle events so two callbacks
are left to implement and they can be
implemented just by saying okay in
handle demand I receive a demand which
ends up being a number so how many
things can you process at this point in
time and then you just package that send
them back and then if you are keeping
track of them in the state because you
don't necessarily send everything you've
got down the line so you just say okay
I'm gonna send you the first two and
then I'm just gonna keep these ones for
later and in the same way the chef
receives a variable number of events or
orders and then does some processing so
this is okay I'm gonna take a bit of
time to figure out where they go and
then once it's done because it sits in
the middle because the chef is a
producer consumer it will return the
data that needs to be passed on and
finally without any surprises the line
cook binds to the chef every line cook
binds to the chef within a sync
subscribe call so they can
Vasia we are ready to ready to cook and
you implement the same callbacks except
that this time the chef has to return
the right dish otherwise they're not
gonna be able to cook it finally and
this is where there's actually Keith's
pointed this out for me when we talked
about it that it was a an interesting
thing to talk about you don't
necessarily have to use just sage all
the time because all of these things are
effectively processes that are basically
obstructions on top of Jen's server so
you can kind of mix and match depending
on what makes sense so in our case to to
pass bad data back to the waiter the
line cook calls that a cast operation by
passing a dish and this operation it is
provided by Jen stage but it doesn't it
doesn't necessarily return something
that by the end of it that goes in the
same flow as before because this this is
going actually back up in the direction
so we just at this point we're just the
waiter handles the cast operation but
does not return anything to push down
the line because this operation doesn't
need to trigger any further processing
because it goes back up but for example
the table because it sits outside the
table is served to an Omaha gen server
the table is a gen server so we just
cast with a dish on the table and the
table handles the casters you can kind
of do mix and match and see what makes
more sense depending on what you're what
you're building and it's it's
interesting because you get different
constraints and different results so the
demand in this case is we and this is
the important thing is always driven by
the line cooks they are effectively the
main they are potentially the main
bottleneck in the operation because they
are at the end so if they can go fast
everything else can go reasonably fast
however this wouldn't be interesting
without
a demo I think so I just prepared a
visual version of this which I hope can
display nicely let me just bring it full
screen so this is where I'm gonna ask is
this readable enough okay I'll try one
more is that better
okay so first of all emojis are great to
do these kind of things so so this is
running and this is a visualization of
that pipeline the pipeline is just
working on the hood is just gets
displayed in this UI every 100
milliseconds and we get that so on the
left hand side we got people deciding
and this is this is a plate and fork
emoji yeah I thought I thought it would
be more visible but it's fine people
decide they either either think they're
either waiting without grass or the
siding and then they basically when you
get to the point where the number of
dish is the same as the number of people
the order will be placed now this is a
fairly healthy situation in the
restaurant because the waiter doesn't
have any orders it pretty much means
just writes down the order walks to the
chef the chef's takes it and starts
going through the order and then figure
out where things go and each line in the
line cooks is a separate cooking station
so there's not there's nothing queueing
now what's interesting and what we can
do with some appropriate buttons is a
tweak how things can go wrong in the
restaurant so let's say that the chef
gets a paper cut and can you actually
see that number up there yeah because
it's cut off on this screen now this
takes a bit because a healthy system and
because we have a very generous time
outs on the tables things will go wrong
but it will take a bit for them to go
wrong so at one point we will start
failing on the left-hand side
and tables we start to pretty much go
just just leave the reason is that chef
Kate gets a paper cut button makes the
chef much slower than before so because
it's dish to figure out where it goes it
takes a tiny bit of time if we make it
slower we're gonna start to queue now
the chef is getting is slowing down a
lot because he has before it was just it
was managing to go fast and was doing
like one order at the time but now he's
queueing this means that because the
chef is queueing the waiter is queueing
and the waiter is queueing like crazy
like it's got 12 orders it's their
wedding it's like it is also worried
like the manager already has called them
he may lose a job and all that then
obviously micromanagement and pressure
help the situation the number of tables
lost is skyrocketing now let's look at
like the interesting part about this is
that let's give a plaster to the chef
just to show another chef is good the
chef now and you you don't see it in
terms of like you don't see the time are
changing but the chef is much faster now
the problem is the system now isn't a
basically the failure is is just like
cascading there's no at this point the
system will not recover we keep losing
orders but because it because the chef
is is not fast enough to exhaust the
waiter queue however know this part on
the right hand side nothing has ever
changed for the line cooks the line
cooks have been steadily cooking at the
same speed if that was the most
important part in your part in your
processing queue that would have been
unaffected your particularly they didn't
get more load on themselves even if we
now there's a way we can use to restore
this this situation but they are
completely unaffected so you and this is
what it means in terms of back pressure
the pressure is not on them
even if this
component is misbehaving the pressure
went back up one layer so the pressure
is actually a lot on the waiter now poor
waiter like and story on his fault but
the pressure is right there now how do
we recover from this the the only way we
can recover right now is to basically
increase the capacity of the line cooks
level I we've got a massive queue of
events we know that everything is demand
driven so we should we have to increase
capacity there to go to the queue so I
can give them an energy drink and made
them cook faster and that will slowly
improve things so if we give it an
energy drink
the waiter queue is gonna go down the
chef is fast from before because it's
got a plaster on but the waiter that's
what you tell to kids as well when you
put plaster let's just say like you know
you're good so that way you got
everything that is slowly going back to
normal
still the failure rate is not
necessarily stopping straightaway we're
still losing things because all of the
timeouts and all the things that were
open from the tables they are still
there but this will slowly normalized
over time so yeah so I mean I trust that
this will go down to zero if you're
particularly girl I can keep it on
screen or like we can do a countdown
otherwise I can go by yeah I'll leave it
yeah
okay yeah so so what should I do in the
meantime while we get to zero
because I got to my last light and my
last light is pretty much like you know
thank you and things like that so I
don't want to spoil it because I think
it's pretty good but I think it's a no
the only thing I hope is that this gave
you a good idea on what gen stage aims
to do I realized that the majority of
people will not model a restaurant which
makes me a bit sad but that's that's
okay I mean do analytics or whatever you
need to do like everyone has their own
job
but in the meantime let's just just take
a look at it it's still experimental so
it's not it's not stable things are
potentially changing depending on the
use case there are also other API so you
may be interested in - in terms of
wrapping this wrapping particular design
stage part with higher level of
abstractions but it's definitely worth
looking at when the videos from a
lexicon for Londo come out definitely
take a look at hoses talk about it
because it's fairly interesting and it's
got a more I guess more programming
related examples then the mind but at
the same time I hope they just give you
some idea about how things that you can
do like maybe in the gaming space using
gen stage yeah and I'll just bring yeah
so yeah I told you that it was a he also
looks suspiciously similar to the one
that was in the beginning of the
presentation but yeah so yes you can
reach me at if you have any further
questions or you can know just have a
chat whatever you like to do but thank
you
any questions it must be some questions
there yes as I said before if you work
in a restaurant please don't do that
please don't ask me anything okay I
don't work in a restaurant
Kenny how would you actually notice when
one of your stages is not behaving
properly so that you could potentially
add a new waiter or add a new chef
so the desert so it was a bit
tongue-in-cheek as an answer but no the
point is you notice because the tables
crash meaning it depends on what kind of
problem you have if you have a slow down
let's say that one of your one of your
parts in the processing pipeline is
subject to latency because it talks to
database or an external API and if their
latest increases your response times may
grow but you're not necessarily failing
the point is up to your at least in the
layer above but ideal in your external
border you should know when things or
you should like make a decision or when
things are taking too long or when
things are may go sour in this case the
tables have a timeout 30 seconds they're
gonna basically implode they're gonna
terminate and that's enough for for this
specific setup to just basically they're
in a supervision tree is stable and it
just gets respond and at that point this
failure rate would be enough at least in
this specific example to figure out that
things are going wrong now this gives
you one part of the part of the answer I
guess which is you know that things are
going wrong in terms of how you decide
why things are going wrong like what
part of the pipeline is slowing down
you can either do a bit of
instrumentation check the message queue
for each one of the processes like it's
basically it's similar it they are
processing in the end so you can debug
them in the same way you debug any other
process so by looking at possibly trying
to trace the state if it's if it goes
too much or check the processing queue
in case that that matters although it
depends on how its setup because
sometimes you just know that their state
includes so many events but the
processing queue may be completely fine
so it really depends on what your what
you're looking at but yeah you can also
reach me out of the boots which I can
show you something that definitely helps
in profiling these type of problems
support sponsorship plug yeah sorry did
I answer your question okay
I can repeat it so you gave their the
example of where the table of bots and
you've structured it so that the cook is
still cooking those orders even though
that the people have left hence why it
spools out how might you or what
features of gem stage might allow you to
handle them in a better way if you save
the front end notices that the people
have walked out and it wants to send
that message you know you can do so
demands if you want to like you can
cancel the demand depending on certain
criteria but so one thing that I didn't
do here which does that mean would you
use an ID
cuz it might be yeah you can you can get
rep so in a similar fashion as Jen
server you get references about by the
process who performed the for example
just H call if you do an endo call you
receive the reference of the process so
if I really wanted to I could possibly
just move down the processing like the
reference of the table and then just do
that as use that for example let's say
that you have like two waiters one
collects the orders and
one delivers the orders at that point
you will need that reference to say okay
this is the table that receives that you
can do it manually but there are
built-in ways to do it if you track
process-wise it's a fun little app if
you put it on github that to take out
then yeah okay say thank you another
round of applause please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
