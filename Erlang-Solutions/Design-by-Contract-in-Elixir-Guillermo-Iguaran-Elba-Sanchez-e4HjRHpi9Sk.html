basics on New York City what we do right
is trying to make commute there I have a
mess tired seguro ignoring the cost of
commuting and also helps environment use
and exceeding our databases systems
allocation system and right now we're
building charge which is brilliant so
how did we get here box and crackers we
deal with them every day and we try to
go at hand it feels like they'll break
in here that made a client that seems
tougher but sadly burned her her after
so if you defend that honey ever
happened so
what maybe the owner did was he means
done has changed when he was ready
yes so you all know that there really is
a software error also mortal errors but
we're not getting this too tramatic such
as the NASA Mars climate orbiter the
Arians variants 5 flat 501 who both
crash the heifer terminal Club opening
that left all those bags hanging around
them and the Mariner 1 spacecraft that
also crashed the Morris worm other
infection thousands computers and then
I'd urge that costed nearly four hundred
and forty million dollars so that's
that's the last month so in for this
talk we're going to take the the
re-inspire flight 501 as an example and
in 1969 t6 have millions of our error
cost the crash of the maiden flight of
the area's five European launcher
darienne's five faster engines exploded
a book that was not fun in a previous
models the rocket we use working
software from one of its predecessors
the Ariane for so 36 seconds later after
launch it crash why the summer had tried
to
from a 64-bit number into 60 and meet
space so in other words the money that
was compared was greater than it can be
represented in a 16 signing taker so
there was no explicit exception handler
so the conception went through his
normal flow crash the system then crash
all their more computers and it has the
crash the entire nation so this kind of
cheap trivial error is an error that we
are all familiar with in our daily basis
but unfortunately the consequences for
us are not usually that expensive so and
they are unified and team made a
research on why this happened and they
wrote that post morning about it and
they say you cannot blame management
something clearly went wrong here but in
this case the issue is technical you
cannot blame the language either they
were using a Ada and the exception
mechanism might not be the best in this
language but in this case not not all
the conversions were protected
you cannot lend implementation either
what they did was they removed the
congressional protection in order to
achieve performance which was criticized
but it was justified in theoretical
analysis we can also blame our testing
and but because and you can always test
more than you can ever test all and
testing shows the person suffers not
their answers so you can try to blame
the fact that they were reusing software
from another model but you have to blame
their reuse the specification itself
because the requirement that the
horizontal bias should fit enough 16-bit
I was somewhere in the
documents but you could not find it in
the code itself so this was unacceptable
in the case of the answers the absence
of any kind of person specification
associated with this reusable model so
we're gonna post here during a sketch
and start with a little bit of design by
contract theory and also with a little
bit of of history this Emma contract has
its roots in formal verification form
all specification and the first logic in
1952 whore describe the representation
of invariants and instructions functions
to pro correctness of abstract data
types the pre and post condition
technique was also first used by her
English in in these papers and then the
term was come the was coined by Maynard
and the design of a foreign language in
fact the current owner of the trademark
design by contract is a evil software we
need a little bit of their basic of
course logic because it is the core of
the deductive approach of the design by
contract so we for for this presentation
we just need let the first paragraph
that is formal reasoning about firm
correctness using pre and post
conditions this means if we start with a
state where P is true and execute same
then C will terminate in a state or Q is
true so
contracts as in daily life are self
specification that covers that covers
much obligations benefits and also
the constraints the software system has
to eat so it falls under the
implementation design we can typically
try to compare it with testing but we
know that testing that tests are to
verify the software works correctly
under sentiments done a sample cases but
if it's almost not possible to test all
the applications on during development
so we'd like to say that this I my
contract is a software correctness
methodology the document on
programmatically assert the change in
state cause muscle to buy a piece of
stock program back to our ends case
maybe this piece of code that is written
in an initial version which has a
contract saying that the horizontal bias
should not be greater than the maximum
bias could have done something to make
the launch differently but doesn't mean
that automatically have been avoided by
having the admission is a language and
methods supporting building assertions
as an assignment as we sign my contract
that's the whole thing to say but maybe
so in humans in humans at first it's not
an illustration of a contract between an
airline and a customer business
relationship between them as an
agreement in expressing in sparring's
rights and obligations so for me as a
passenger from connect to from barakatuh
to here turning I had to buy an
identical if I was five if I were doing
it online then greenness of the baggage
baggage to the airport and mean two
hours two hours before and my rights as
a passenger movie to reach the
destination and so my obligations as a
client must ensure
conditions and my my rights as a client
may benefit from from both collisions so
for the air none their obligation is to
bring the pack their passengers to
destination and they don't need to carry
passengers who are late or that has
unacceptable baggage or hasn't paid the
ticket so the suppliers obligation and
must ensure post conditions and the
supplies right may assume recognitions
so what are these preconditions are
opposed and both conditions they're
destructor of a contract so a
precondition usually in the requires
clause and the post condition they
ensure Clause the precondition
characterizes the responsibility of the
program that calls the method and the
post condition characterised is the
responsibility of the program that
implements the metal so if the
precondition is true when a metal is
called then the metal will terminate
return the calling program and the post
condition will be true after this and if
the precondition is not true then it
will do not so here's an example of a
piece of code written in April if it's a
routine call put that inserts a value in
a dictionary
and then we retrieve it later through
working so they're they're required to
das introduces and an input condition or
a precondition and ensure class and
introduces an output condition or a post
condition
most of these conditions are examples of
assertions or director conditions or a
contracts concept if you want to call it
like that that are associated with
software elements and the precondition
the count is the number the current
number of elements and the capacity is
the Mac is the maximum number and in in
short clothes has if the boolean query
word what that tells whatever certain
element is present and then the item
returns the element associated with a
certain key so how can all these theory
about design my contracts can help so we
as developers look for something where
while writing our programs quality when
collette qualities percent protein
ability follows but we also look for
stuff right now for this w for
reliability there are two parts of
reliability that highlight correctness
are robustness and correctness is like
the basics of the base and the main part
of design by contract because correct
software does what is supposed to do and
that's it for example if I want to check
online my - in my
I should be able to do it without the
transaction making my balance reduced or
increment and the robust software and
apps assertively in cases in which it
cannot do what it's supposed to so also
the assertions recognition some post
conditions can be automatically turn on
during testing just with a single
compiler option ever mind and errors
might be captained on assertions can
also remain turnaround during execution
trigger and introduction and most
important assertions are right
components of the software and it
automatically produces documentation
which is awesome so for letter support
there are several implementations of
library for design by contract for some
languages such as C C++ C sharp yeah
yeah script PHP Ruby between others and
unleavened is with native support of
design might conjure like elda close
your evil and rekt so what are we doing
to achieve something like this in any
series
okay so you can say she mention another
language right now there is no TV in a
list here and I think that 13mm I walk
the profession of EDA without further
belief or airman or digital is my mantra
so that's why we decided to build one
for a listen how for a listen wave rely
a lot in meta programming using mainly
macros some of the ground rules about
macros defender of democracy
don't write markers why my clothes are
basically Coast I didn't write posts so
you need to further estra Griego I you
need to be very careful to do something
- yeah because micro scale major program
very difficult to understand the second
role is jus the second ruling that you
must use - why because maybe it's too
hard in the when you are a star people
Mong Kok everybody else opposed it you
have to use
correctly he can be very listen for a
change like this but one tomorrow
Michael's are basically is a pollutant
rankles who is done in initial day you
can't remove the executed during a
compiling page what is he the the coach
wrong before viprinet program is
compiled and now uh now during that run
time so you can take them right both and
modify the opposite the three or the
language a modifying the behavior of the
application and how this is all set for
for us
so what is he to want to learn more
about macros I'd recommend of mu or
Chris McCall is very good it's a very
good introduction above all to use
bankruptcy in the lacy
yeah is very very useful
well talking bad about this and by
contrast we Lucy Elizabeth close to
extend a language other means of pork or
some construct to to support design ba
contra so we we are the post rapport
requires in the language on another
Cosmo for the insures with the language
and the macro basically we were gonna
find a city function during the the
precondition
Kaneesha will be secured before the body
of the function and the possible
creation will be execute after other
execution or the monster body is
something so for example in this sample
with knowledge of the recent argument
with are required by condition for a
spectrum we recall the number will be
greater than zero I will require the and
we also up on condition sign that the
number must be in a certain range so
like a you can say you can see is a bit
like the burner matching your new come
for a support for the Machine of one
number is mean you see in less than zero
both and in contrast you can have some
kind of complex condition of the new
kind adding is what you are doing for
the matching or what you are are using
works so that basically fold a of the
contrast roots right now in the America
we have indeed another C in working
working
so IQ very this is sample we are we are
pollinating among we had a mother for
homework for a ton of water so we had a
function to fill the pan with water as
precondition for the function field we
are acquainted faraday time is know for
already so we can feel it we we are not
so today they party the Barbie Barbie
choose the oven and they all should be
frozen we are now in the the result of
the function true should be the panting
the time food other neighborhood should
be closed at the oven which will be
closer so if we have another portion and
die in peace I think they done so these
are the portion we are required the
derrick what they the hood should be
closed under of what we should be open
so we can in there water can be 850 and
as per foundation we are having the
research should be they become empty and
both of their bother should be crossing
okay first we will really try to move
the business insistence we are creating
a new time the other day the food level
of water both ego saying the ink bottle
is very open so we would wrong business
okay ladies and please this one so
insulated the precondition is no man
so in the fall of decline the is using
the function
okay we usually attend repeated
recognition let's run the test again
20 lines we have space people tend to
like 25
okay so the guy sees the posse because
the recognition is that and now we will
see the other deaths
so we have another this another tip for
the empty portion first we would drive
by 16 I'll take these right mean the
decline is wrong if I sat on that should
be the luggage should be opening and the
barber is on okay let's run this is
purely because author a separately for
Commission is normal but now he's right
that is call it the pawnshop
but the portion when the Romani people
if you follow the implement with a
supplier of the is the intention
yeah there ever was a devotion was
supposed to Haiti the Tompa never was
one
so in order to be and with a level of
what emotion Monte's hero and that's
from a game
under the sappers are passing
as person you want to see the goal or
the library or the current progress of
entirety not the one where we are
publishing hang on people I have to say
knowing God was a big car in the
topicals the micros honor my personally
said you must be very very colorful and
in the studies very in my opinion was a
big heart o of the Sun all day
Rosewall was everything paavana clothing
Java Sami Farah I have to in the dance
to Chrismukkah very thorough methylamine
Alicia because she won her if he was
helping me a lot to the Sun the Sun
Quran even like to the forty-ninth fire
and he was helping me to get these ready
so what and what we can do we with this
iPod cantata is not on right now with
the library will be nice complement and
with our we can
something like in LA you need this came
from the contrast or maybe we can also
can a quick check test what else a way I
think we can generate maybe dots because
the contrasts are some kind of
documentation also hamanaka understands
how the push of words without having to
seen the full content of the conscience
finally I think we come for support
karana throughout the contract during
development or rather a dream promotion
in you go one two together extra penalty
in the application for the Contras or to
actively in promotions if you want to
have actual level of rotation in your
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
