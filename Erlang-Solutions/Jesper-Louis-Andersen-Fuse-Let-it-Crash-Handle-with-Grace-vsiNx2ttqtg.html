today is this this project up here
called fuse and which is a project I
wrote a couple of months ago and right
now we are at a point where it's
beginning to catch up to production use
at a customer so I'm going to present
the project and the background about
path behind the project and how it's
built and so on so forth let me see if I
can get this guy to actually understand
me this is better so the problem is that
once you have a large complicated erling
system there are certain things you
cannot avoid the first thing is that you
cannot avoid to have many many
applications in that in the early notes
you're running and you will usually also
have a lot of cascading subsystems so
you will have my sequel databases caches
foreign API is running on different
servers out in the world and the problem
is you don't control a lot of these
foreign things and then the problem is
when one of those cascading subsystems
they have errors the fingers get pointed
at your system because you are dependent
on that case gating subsystem and then
all of a sudden you have errors and
fingers get pointed at you and they are
saying well you're George you're earning
system is working like something really
bad because really it's wrong but what
is really the error is that the skating
subsystem in there that has the book the
idea of one you cannot really solve this
but you can try to mitigate it so this
is what fuse is about it's about
mitigating errors in cascading
subsystems huge implements a pattern
which is called the circuit breaker
patent and that one the first time I
read about it was by what is named
Michael Nygaard in his book release it
so a good analogy of what is happening
is that you have a few spa
in your home so if you overload your
electricity the fuse will blow and the
circuit breakers until it works in the
same way that we have a system as long
as it works like it should the circuit
breaker is closed and then when you
begin tracking errors in the cascading
subsystems of what you have you tell the
fuse that it melts a bit essentially you
say that you begin to see problems in
the system and once the diffuse is
melted too much that is once you break
its policy for how many errors it'll
tolerate it breaks meaning that rather
than going to the cascading subsystem
you just return immediately and say well
the fuse is broken you you don't want to
go to the target system so that's the
idea then then we run with the circuit
breaker open for a while so we're not
hitting the cascading subsystem because
we know it's broken we know it won't
work anyway and then after a while I fly
cooldown period we essentially have the
the fuse fuse cooling down and that
means we close the circuit breaker again
so we get connectivity back to the
system so it's a way to essentially
music a 10 hour in a cascading subsystem
by not touching it for a while right
fuse is open source and built mainly by
me and Tom as art has come with a lot of
helpful hints while I built it it's
built also with thanks toiling solutions
and the issue because they have kind of
allowed me to do it and use some of
their time for it so what are the
characteristics of the circuit breaker
why even do it well the first thing is
that you have no resource build up in
your own system so say you have a
database and you are trying your timing
out on the database while you have
processes in your line system timing out
there'll be resource building up
there'll be resources that you're
wasting essentially in your own system
while this is happening rain you don't
want that so by rather than trying to
wait for the time out just
and back and say this is ink on at work
anyway well then we don't have that
reasons resource build up the second
thing is that we don't have to wait for
the time out to him we respond in
roughly four magazines so we have a much
better latency even though we're still
going to report an error but now we
report an error in for micro seconds
rather than and say five thousand
milliseconds so that's way better the
next thing is that a client can
discriminate between a long time out and
an error because we can return a
different error message if the fuse is
broken and this actually makes clients
able to give better user experience for
instance if you have a web page where
you have some counts displayed those
counts might not be important for the
whole experience of the page it's an
added value but it's not important for
the rest of what you are seeing so if
you make a call into a server and the
service as well the fuse is broken I
cannot give you the counts we can just
ignore that and not render that part of
the web page and that means we can still
win still render a pace to the use of
even though there are certain subsystems
down right that might help going forward
and then finally if you have a if you
have a fuse that is an excellent place
to do monitoring on your system right if
you know whether another fuse is broken
you know whether or not a cascading soft
system is probably down so that's
another reason for why having a fuse
then I'm trying to do some things in
order to make this easy to use so it
Hell's You doc all over the place with
proper documentation and is only the
exposed AP is that are documented
there's a tutorial in there it's built
on Travis tci so you know that it builds
it uses semantic versioning that get
text in there so you can latch onto a
kid tech if you want that and then the
goal is to try to implement the circuit
breaker pattern in
and Erling a dramatic way and not in so
you can find examples of this
implemented and say Ruby or in Python
but just porting those into the Erlang
world wouldn't be early traumatic so I'm
trying to utilize other OTP things
inside to have while I'm writing the
circuit breaker so that's the idea so a
quick way of using it see ya so a quick
way of using it is that first you have
to configure a fuse so max I there is
the intensity of the fuse it tells us
that we allow 10 errors the max t is the
time frame the window in which we allow
the errors so this says we want what our
policies at most ten errors in 60
seconds and that's the sliding window
the name is just any name usually an
atom given to the fuse so we can have
multiple fuses in the system and
discriminate them the strategy is
there's only one strategy which is the
standard strategy at the moment so you
give it the intensity and the time the
Refresh is when the fuse breaks how long
time what is the great time before it
heals so in this case it's it's 60
seconds it's given milliseconds so then
you take the strategy in the refresh and
makes that make that into the options
and then you fuse install it so this is
dynamic health installation of the fuse
so you would usually do this in your
application startup once the future
application is running so once you have
configured the fuse you can use them so
here's the typical usage you ask the
fuse fight state and you have a you have
a choice of context you can do it
synchronously or you can do it
asynchronously and dirty which means
that you have eventual consistency for
the result that's way faster than asking
synchronously so there's a performance
consideration to make but as we will see
this there's a reason for why I have the
sink in there
and and what you get back is either okay
up loan so if it's okay you can go do
your work on your database if it's blown
you have to return some error thing
because the fuse is obviously wrong and
this problem when a timeout occurs you
essentially tell the fuse to melt itself
like the second example so in this case
it seemed I sequel that has some kind of
time out and then we have a connection
lock timeout in which case we mail
defuse a little bit a quite simple and
once it has been melded enough the
policy will say okay now it's blown and
then the ask will rip begin returning
bloom right it's that's the way it works
so where are they performance
characteristics of the system well we
have this laptop here which is a pretty
new MacBook and that one's 2.1 million
views asks per second so that that is
with a course so all it causes operating
and maximum maxed out while doing this
each call takes around three four
microseconds and I have a lenovo which
is the core i7 before this one so that's
an Ivy Bridge this is the has one and
that does roughly the same so it might
be memory bound I don't know and so
that's the that's the current the
current speed of the system of course
that's just a simple stress test I
didn't really do thorough benchmarking
on this I just needed a rough number and
it's another bound in the sense that if
I'm doing other things on the machine of
course I cannot achieve this because I'm
maxing or course while doing this I
think it's somewhat disappointing using
3000 4000 nanoseconds pearl look up on
an ETS table is I don't understand why
it's so slow I would have expected it to
be like 10 times faster so there's
definitely something I don't understand
and I need to dig into the code and run
/ fun it to understand what is actually
having in their own system of course
I think I mean normal I know that there
are two mutexes I have to take and there
are two dear M accesses and that gives
around 250 nanos so I'm off by an order
of magnitude roughly for this and I
don't understand why so I want to
understand it but anyway I do 2.1
million so that's a ballpark figure then
fuse has two things which makes it more
earlier than most other things first of
all it has a monitor that monitors
States and monitors state changes and
that monitor injects into the alarm
handler alarms when fuses are blown or
cleared so the way it works is as soon
as we see a blown fuse we raise an alarm
for that fuses this fuse is now broken
now you can plug anything into your
alarm handle and then export it to
necklace or whatever you have to do to
do a monitoring on this and then it has
it just raises algorithm so as soon as
you seen an okay for a while on the few
so it has mended and and it has been
mended for a while it please the arm but
it avoids flapping so if it goes down
and goes up immediately after it will
not return a clear in the race again
it'll keep it raised until it has seen
okay for a while and then it'll clear it
so it tries to avoid Fleming and then
there's also a Jenner vent in there so
you can subscribe to change events in
infuses and that's actually pretty
useful say you have a system that you
are hurrying and then you have Q in
front of things that wait until they are
ready to run full on this system because
there's a limit in there and you figure
out that the fuse is blown then you can
empty you queue because that won't work
right they'll just come here and they'll
just hit the fuse and be blown so what
you do is you listen just subscribe to
the event and once the event happened
you just clear the whole queue you can
do that because you have a venting in
the system so you just build a handler
that subscribe to that event and you
you're good to go the implementation so
so Tobin actually did just before this
talk it
talk on notation he calls visual early
and I've been a little bit involved in
that so this is the visual Erlang
diagram of the architecture I'll come
back to it but the next slide has kind
of like the textual thing and then I'll
I'll come back to the slide and try to
describe what it means so the way it's
built is that there are two paths in
this system there's a fast path in the
slow path so the fast path is the
typical ask that hits an ok because
that's the thing that'll have most often
the system so we want that to be bloody
fast if we have a melt that's allowed to
be slow so we don't care the way we
implemented is that we have an ETS table
and the fast path just ask the ETS table
directly it doesn't even go through a
gen server because that gives us
parallel axis we define read concurrency
true on the ETS table to get very fast
access this is the primary reason we get
the 2.1 million reads per per second if
you melt there's a few serve in there
and just sent the message to the future
and the future of our keeps track of the
policies and might flip the ETA stable
state from an OK to a blown and vice
versa if it heals so the server is a
single point essentially and then the
way it works entire internally in the
few servers that it maintains a list of
timestamps the most recent time stamp is
at the head of the list and whenever we
want to check a state we just walk
through the list and we prune away
everything that's outside the window and
that's very easy because they're ordered
so at a certain point reached something
that's outside the window and that means
the tail is outside the window so we
just cut off the tail and what we have
left is what we what we interested in so
taking the length of that list tells us
the current intensity and that'll
explain whether or not we are above
intensity or whether or not we should
blow the fuse this is the same way that
the supervisor currently works so you
have marks are in markstein supervisors
and they were
the same way it can be optimized quite a
lot and I haven't gotten around to do
that yet so there's not some
optimization possibilities there but
it's on the slow path so I don't know
whether or not is important here 12
demise so if we go back to the diagram
do I have a mouse I do have a mouse so
the way it works is that the client is
the process the few server here's the
process the fuse monitor here's the
process and the future manager only
looks at this which is the ETS table
containing the name of use in the state
of the fuse and the fuse managers out
here and not connected to the rest of
the system because if he crashes it
doesn't affect the fuse right so that's
a nice isolation property and that two
ways you can ask the fuse so you can ask
asian chronically which means that this
ask asian operation is living inside
this module a few server module but if
the client asks directly and then it
gets the state from here and returns it
here if it asks synchronously which is
the other thing then we actually go in
here but then we are actually asking
through the few server process and
that's not going to give us 2.1 million
queries the second that is going to be
way way way slower and there's a reason
for why i have both the sings and the
hazing and we'll see that in a while so
that's the architecture how it works
correctness right what is the problem
here the problem is that fuse is a
mission critical system in the sense
that you place it in front of cascading
subsystems and if it's wrong then you're
introducing more box than you originally
had that's a bad situation we don't want
that so the reason for that is so say
well it's a premium prime candidate for
extensive testing because it's it's
sitting for every cascading subsystem
core so let us use quick checkup so
quick check is used for testing all of
yous essentially and the model is that I
build a project based test first so it's
until all properties written before the
code is written which is which is a fun
rules who play by when you're writing
code they're not allowed to write
implementation code before you have a
property that describes what you're
trying to implement the way you do it is
you say well I have an empty property
and now I define a fuse in sole command
and define what that should look like
and then you have a property that only
tries to run in run store commands on
your system right and that of course
fails because you don't have the code
for it so you're going to implement the
code and when that works you say oh I
need a and askim and let me add that
yeah so you do it property based first
so it's like test test driven design
only that we are trying to extract
properties rather than mirror test cases
so what are we trying to achieve well
the thing we're trying to do is we're
trying to do what is called positive and
negative testing both so the difference
between those two is the positive
testing test the things we the normal
use of the tool right so we're just
doing we're playing along and we are
playing the game we are playing inside
the specification we defined negative
testing on the other hand tries to
inject faults into the system so we
might try to do something to a fuse that
doesn't exist or we might try to inject
a configuration that is not invalid
something like that and then we expect
the system to actually answer with an
error right if if we do something that's
wrong and the system says yeah where I
took it that I'm fine happily then then
something is obviously wrong with our
system so we do- testing as well the
other thing we do is we do parallel
testing because quick check can do
parallel testing on stateful models so
that means we really do have multiple
clients spawned at the same time that
tries to access the fuse at the same
time in order to try to weed out avenger
race conditions in there
because we don't want race conditions in
this code either and then we use pulse
finally which means that pauses a tool
in quick check that takes the Erlang
scheduler and controls it so you decide
the pulse system decides in which order
different processes run inside your
system so that means i can i can get a
random schedule meaning that if there's
a race condition in there I'm more
likely to hear it hit it because once in
a while I'll try a schedule which is
very unlikely in practice right
furthermore it has the advantage that I
can replay a schedule which is very
important because once I find an error I
need to try to simplify the code shrink
as squid check is calling it I have to
simplify my counter example while still
keeping the same schedule so I don't
kind of like lose grasp of the error and
that usually happens with parallel
testing where you you have an error in
the code but it's parallel and that
means it's very it's elusive and and
once you try to simplify the code you
change the schedule order and then all
of a sudden the bar goes away right so
pulse allows me to nail a specific
process schedule in there and that means
that i can I can reproduce errors given
a given schedule so it's a very useful
tool so that's also being used in this
project then in order to make sure that
we hit things we do requirements testing
so if you identify all the requirements
of use that 16 requirements North that
looks like this so for instance group
the installed group has requirement
requirement number three here that says
that we try to install a fuse with some
kind of invalid configuration and
there's a requirement says that we also
have to try to install a fuse with a
valid configuration right so we have a
number of requirements if we try to mail
something it has to be installed we also
have to try to mail something that's not
installed so that's the negative variant
of the first one and the same for ask
and that's 16 all of those the thing is
that
the crib check model contains these
requirements and tracks whether or not
we are using them giving a specific
tests so that means we can get outputs
like these so if you run the sequential
test for five seconds you get about 1200
tests these are here the different
commands we have tried to fire so we
aggregate until whether or not we have
hit different commands in the system
down here we have a requirements list
that essentially says what requirements
we hit for those tests so that gives us
a view of whether or not we hit all the
requirements we set up in ours test
specification or not so it tells us
whether or not we are covering all
things right I think I have an example
somewhere if I pick a winner get the
code
so sequential test five seconds see ya
ah so there's something wrong here and
the thing that's probably wrong is that
there's some code that doesn't work
let's see I know why I just have to
clean the code and then say that two
ways to compile the code one that makes
it possible to compile it with one that
makes it possible to run under the
quickcheck model and one that doesn't so
you have to use the right one on the
wiser loop phenyl so let's run again so
here groans that's better so in five
seconds so it got a little less test
this time around so up here you have the
command aggregation of all the commands
that was run and down here you have all
the year or the different requirements
format so this one here says that in
four percent of all the times in four
percent of all tests this particular
requirement was hit right so when you
run this for eight hours and a night you
can make sure that you have a couple of
million tests and then you have the same
here but you make sure that some of the
requirements down here that are very
unlikely gets more and more likely right
so you get a good distribution of all
your requirements that's the goal so you
do that so that's done as well the way
the quickcheck implementation is done is
that we use quick check to build a model
right so for instance infuse time is a
very important property because time is
what tell us whether or not we're inside
the window so what we do is we mock time
we build a model that essentially
controls time and then we use that
instead of OS time stamp when
we are checking since such that we can
we can control when time elapses in the
system but then we need to be sure that
our timing model is correct so how do we
do that well we use quick check to check
the model of time right once we had that
model we can use that in our real quick
check model so it's essentially like
math we build up lemmas we build up
small pieces of code in quick check and
we which Billups more piece of code that
we intend to use in quake check models
and then we use great check models and
those more pieces to make sure that they
are correct such that we can go to the
next thing and use those small pieces in
our real models so that's a that's a
nice way of doing it because that means
you you essentially building up stepping
stones of limas of theorems on which you
are you're standing the next time of
course everything here is approximative
so you don't have the guarantee that
things will be correct because of the
randomization property but I still I'm
still willing to bet that it is way
better than most other tools are doing
it then there's the monitor code it has
a separate quick check model because
it's a separate tool essentially so this
is one of the places where if you do
property based testing first you will
have your code guided by the property
based testing in this case what happens
is that you figure out that all the
monitor code can have them in isolation
from the rest of the code so that also
means that you can build a separate
check model to handle the monitor code
so the monitor essentially reads from
the ETS table into the fuse monitor and
then it invokes the alarm handler that's
the the way the monitor works so what we
do is cry check has this equals e
component feature that allows us to mock
certain pieces of the code base so we
mark the alarm handler until the model
what arrays and clear commands to the
alarm handler we expect the monitor to
make in a given state and then our state
transitions are basically setting up the
ETS table in a certain state and then
calling the monotones
what happens so now we are isolating the
monitor from the rest of the system by
marking things underneath it and
controlling things above it so that
allows us to check the quick check the
alarm handle so one of the problems you
will find when you do this is that if
you try to run fuse with pulse and use
this asing dirty access context then it
finds a problem in the code base
essentially the code is not linear
risible and you get out this diagram
down here which I'm not really going to
dig too much into and you stare at it
for like 20 minutes and then you figure
out where your race condition is so so
pulse allows when pulse builds a counter
example it can draw these diagrams that
tells what order in which your scheduler
has executed different things you can
see what order in which your program has
run and that then allows you to derive
what your race condition is so when you
look at this diagram for a while the
blue thing out here is is a process that
that implements time so it marks time so
what you do is you go down and you you
look at when when different processes as
for what time it is and what happens
inside the system is that you have a you
end up in a situation where you have an
inconsistent read so you have you have a
situation where one of the processes get
blocked for a long time so this is very
unlikely to have them in a real system
because the Erlang schedule will usually
just make the the guy run but when
running under pulse there's a real
possibility that this process will be
blocked for way too long so what happens
is that the my that the pause decides
that very unlikely scenario is going to
happen right now so he blocks the sky
for a very long time and then all of a
sudden you have one other process tries
to read whether or not a fuse is okay a
blown and he gets the wrong answer
because he gets an okay while the rest
of the atomistic guarantees in the model
says that it should be blown so in
practice I don't think it matters I what
what will have many practices that you
will have a few processes that gets an
okay while they should have gettin a
blown and that's okay because once it's
blown everyone else will see it as blown
for a while so it's just a question of
how many do you allow in the corner case
and it depends on how fast and how much
this few server process that handles the
melding gets gets blocked so if you're
not concerned about that you can use
async 30 and get your 2.1 million ask
spare per second if you're worried about
that you can use sink and then pollicis
it's okay but then your courage curious
before problem not be 2.1 million and
second especially because you're
essentially linearizing everything on
one process so you cannot get all eight
course to work right one process has to
work inside this few server process and
that would be way slow so you lose
parallelism as well on the other hand
then then it's little risible which you
could argue is right thing and that also
tells you why you have both the aging 30
and the sink variant because I think
that in practice most people is most
people would be happy with the asian 30
variant and the higher paradism compared
to the other thing so that's that's a
trade-off I give you the option to pick
there's a timing problem in there so I
made a mistake when I wrote the client
the brilliant idea I thought I got was
that I said well time is an injective
parameter so I have a number of clients
they want to do melt a few so what they
do with the client takes a time stamp
and then he caught a sense a message
with the time stamp inside the server
process because that's nice now I get
parallelism on taking time stamps the
problem is that the problem is that it
doesn't work
it doesn't work because say in the if we
try to take the worst case the worst
cases that I have two clients and
distributed notes and they'd both take
the timestamp and then they try to
inject it but one of them is on a note
that has a very high latency to what the
the target system and the other doesn't
so they might arrive in the wrong order
right or I might take the time stamping
it blocked right after I have taken the
time stamp it before I sent the message
because that's where my reduction count
ran out in that case I get behind in the
schedule and another one gets run gets
to take the time stem inject that so now
time gets injected in the wrong order in
the server meaning the time runs
backwards and that is a problem because
i have an assumption of time is
monotonically increasing in the system
so then you have a choice again to make
i could change the code such that it can
handle that time is not monotonically
increasing which leads to a lot of code
bloat because you have to handle the
special case so you have to sort time
now and there's all other kinds of
things that can go wrong or you could
just disallow it so I opted for the
simple solution that disallowed it what
happens now is that if a mrs. come into
the server this first thing the server
does is to take the time step and that
of course the gene arises time because
now it's monotonic increasing
interestingly enough it's that time stem
which makes this problem go be a problem
with pulse because then what happens is
you get the time stamp and then you get
blocked and then time elapses and that's
actually where you get the inconsistent
read so what we did is we once we
figured that this is probably a bad idea
we wrote a quick check model for it
thomas did and that quick check model
very quickly figures out that this is a
very bad idea and it produces a nice
counter example that says why you
shouldn't be doing this
so we opted not to do it and then we
well yeah skip that idea so that is that
was made timing problem we have in the
code and it took some while to find it I
mean we I was going down the wrong path
when I tried this because I wasn't fast
enough to say well it might be my
implementation code that is completely
utterly wrong so I was trying to fix the
code while it's probably much more it's
the architecture of the code that's
wrong in this case and the thing that
kind of like the kind the thing that
that hinted it was this quick chek model
essentially because once we began
writing that we could see that well this
linear I ever work in any way or form so
what are the results of using quick
check here first of all it slows you
down in my case it tends to slow me down
by a factor of three to five so time to
market is slow because well you have to
write the property before you write the
implementation which means that you have
to come up with the property before you
write the implementation that can be
hard it also means that you don't write
that much code you're thinking more
about what is the right property to use
and it is slowly getting into production
we haven't had any issue in production
yet in any places I know there are few
people that are using it there no issues
fire on github yet I have not used any
time for maintenance on this coat yet
and I think that's the story so the
initial release might be slower but I'm
willing to bet that you will get way
less errors on the code base afterwards
because you have so much higher a bar
set with the profits based test so
that's that's definitely a win another
interesting when is that Creek check is
enters jests
paths that you shouldn't have and that
makes the code way way you know the
triggers that you can do what you can do
is you can say rather than handling this
code path I just make that thing illegal
to do return Barak and then delete the
code for that code pad a really good
example was that when I have this
configuration thing here here initially
max I so what is the range of this value
here it's 10 but what is the valid range
that's a valid question so initially it
was 0 and more so positive or zero so
what happens if you give an intensity of
0 well that means you can't or 80 melts
in some window that kind of doesn't make
sense does it but I allowed that which
means that if you start in the blown
state and never ever can go out of the
blown state but if you look at the code
then you get a duplicate code path that
handles that case completely isolated to
the other code path that is the positive
path so this corner cases interleave
doubles the code size so once you figure
that out you say to the quick check
model well don't generate that zero case
make it part of the illegal thing right
and then return an error if you try to
give a configuration where max is zero
that then halves your code size you have
to implement so that's only half the
size of code that I can expect there to
be box right so that's that's the idea
there remove that problem entirely by
just ripping out code so i did that
instead and i think that that is
essentially where you get I think that's
essentially where you begin getting the
big win from quick chek and doing it so
much up front as I did in this project
because that's that's where you begin
really the thing is it gets way harder
to implement code if you have to write
the property first
right because you have to come up the
property and that makes you honest in
the sense that you're not going to write
some code unless you really needed so
what happens is that you become much
more resistant to just adding another
code path because well hey that's
because you know that once the creature
model we can't hammer you on your head
and say that this doesn't work unless
it's it's real so I really think that or
creature was a win in this project so
yeah let me see you where I have a lot
of time I have no more lights so do
people have questions there's one there
Dabney so actually I have two questions
yeah the first one is it seems like
performance was really important but it
was unclear to me whether there's one
fused server for the entire node or the
first one use that's one per node at the
moment okay is there any reason it
wasn't perfused that way fuses don't
interact with each other currently
because so the reason I I really thought
about that my my expectation is that
males are rare and on the slow path
since they are in the slow path I
currently didn't want to optimize for
this before I really needed to do it my
expectation is if you do that change the
model can be used on order it so my
guess is it'll just work if I were to
make that change but I also want to see
that the melting is the problem before
doing it because you're right having a
single few server is the contention
point in this case and one thing that
might be better to do one thing we might
win by splitting it is that if you do
synchronous asking where you go through
the few server then having multiple of
those would give better parallelism
right unless everybody contends on the
same views but that's not likely that's
definitely an option
um and from my understanding like on a
regular server with something like ntp
time can move backwards is that a fraud
as the vm take care of that or will your
fuse just being a weird state for a
while that depends on what you are using
so if I think currently that it it
actually does it the wrong way one of
the weaknesses of using quick check like
this where you control the time is that
I build a model of time right and the
model of time is monotonically
increasing but ntp by default isn't
right it can skew so unless you have
some kind of thing in the kernel that
handles x cube with some operating
system will help then you're in trouble
the the fix is quite simple the fixes to
substitute OS x time for Erling now
because Erling now actually does have
this protection on the other hand that
might that might shit melting a little
bit but i don't care in this case
because melting is on the slow path so
that's that's a really good suggestion
for a fix and that would essentially
eliminate that problem there was the
question done there's no only the
testings runnable with proper or without
quick check currently no the reason is
that some of the features that are used
in this project is not part of pro
specifically proper does not have a an
equivalent to pulse so you cannot
control the schedule and proper does not
have an equivalent to the component
parts of the monitor the monitor check
the mocking is not part of proper either
so those two those two makes it hard and
the other thing is that Creek check
nowadays have a different ways of
defining stateful machines so they have
something called group commands and I've
used group commands
this project and proper doesn't have
that so that's another problem you have
so you can translate a lot of this into
proper and run it in proper but there's
a translation effort I mean it's it's
isomorphic so it's just mechanical work
but you still have to do it I think
currently so so yesterday John Hughes
had this cubic CI tool they essentially
make made a quick check continued since
great environment in the spirit of
Travis CI where you essentially can run
quick check tests on their machines so
that would be a really good thing to
enable in this project right because
then once you have a pull request it'll
automatically get run on quick check and
that that would be the way to get this
going with with this open source project
if you do not have the model I mean or
if you do not have quick check yeah
because I mean I mean the model is the
model is written here so so that's
that's that's there it's just a question
of running your change on the model
right yes sure there's a common test
case in there that runs a very mentally
test on it that checks for basic
correctness and that's run as part of
the travesty idled yes more questions if
there isn't thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
