everything so I'd like by show of hands
how many of you work in a start-up and
keep your hands up how many of you are
contemplating joining a start-up or
starting 10 all of you all did yeah I'm
so sorry for you I'm so sorry because
these are the facts and you can you do
these measurements the number of
different ways the numbers just don't
look good when you start up so you need
to figure out how you're going to run
about it and how you're going to avoid
it so looking at those who fail that
there could be an exercise of a pain and
tears and blood and sweat so we will
avoid that but they'll still be pain
tears and blood and sweat therefore the
other ten percent but we're going to
look at what makes them succeed because
that's what we want ultimately there
there so and this is also from this
Forbes thing that if you have a product
that's perfect for the market that's a
good sign of having a success uh-huh
there you don't ignore anything you
don't let anything slip by you don't let
regulations or other things you on top
of everything already here you can break
a sweat now if you want to consider
doing these things but these are the
things that works for these you get a
company director grows fast if you're
just lingering rude you're probably
going to end up in the ninety percent
there and then the last thing from this
report that actually falls into my pet
peeves here is the team you have there
knows how to recover because you're
going to take a beating over and over
again you're going to make mistakes all
over the place so you need to learn how
to recover from that so the core message
here is you need to be evolving your
your startup and you need to be building
your your entire app and start up with
failures don't ignore that embrace that
and here's an example where this
actually follows the curve or what Draw
Something had where they had a number of
users over time it was going fine just
working their way up then they had a
huge c6 spike and was it was the
trajectory was like this and and
everybody that had put money into it was
like yeah it's coming out but then this
happened boom the thing didn't scale and
we all know the draw something ended up
at success but when they ended up in
this situation they switched the couch
space and Erlang powered technology so
this is what you want you want a line to
be behind you as a start-up there and if
you want it you need to do a little bit
of research and also think about how you
want to do it so this is one it's a good
book there it's more operational than
some of the other ones so I like that
one because you can just go apply things
and take it from there then notice the
title that a subtitler iterate from plan
a to a plan that works that implies you
don't know why you're ending so you need
to be ready to iterate all the time and
the way you wanted to do this is but you
want to do experiments to figure out
what works there yet you look worn
around having hypotheses about something
anyone want to go prove or disprove that
hypothesis it doesn't help saying i
think the users will like this and then
you just build it now you need to do a
little more intelligent than that
they're there and then they talk about
this the pivot this is where you change
direction not on the whim of something
but because some of your experiments
showed that you need to do something
different to be successful and in total
what is it that they are asking you for
clues now asking you to fail fast
because it's the failing that gives you
the learning just doing everything and
not getting anything out there noon in
any new you need to get things out there
and make them fail and it has to happen
relatively fast otherwise you'll end up
the ninety percent grade arts of
startups so that means you need to
embrace failure and as as a culture and
as humans failure is something that feel
we've often feel stigmatizes us we have
to drop that if you are afraid of
failure don't do startups you need to
learn how to enjoy that
it takes time but you'll get there so
how do you go from zero to actually make
a ton of money and you can substitute
whatever currency you want just as long
as it makes you happy there so the first
stage is you need to figure out if the
problem you're looking at and the
solution you want to provide has a fit
and this doesn't mean that you have to
build anything this means you go out and
test the waters by talking to people and
say oh I know that's this problem over
here I'm thinking about losing in the
solving it in this way will that work
for you that's the kind of feedback you
need and this is a cheap way of getting
it don't build everything in nine months
in the silo go out there and get some
cheap feedback there then the next thing
you want to look at then you want to
make sure that that's this problem has a
fit with the market because otherwise
you might have a solution but there's no
market for it so you need to make sure
that there's a fit there too and there
are also ways of doing that without
having to build everything out unique
you can take these and then finally
because we want to make money at the end
at least enough to survive so you need
to scale it somehow and the focus in the
first two stages it's the same focus you
have there you have a focus on validated
learning and pivots so here you're
really talking about I need to fail so
that I can find the next thing they'll
bring me closer to what works this is
how you want to work and then it stays
free here the focus changes because now
you have a fit with the market you know
that you're on the right track now you
just have to scale it there so now its
growth and optimizations you're looking
for see any experiment you're doing now
it's an optimization there so that's how
it changes and here's his big danger
zone because normally you will end up
asking for money somewhere to do this
and normally you end up asking for money
between stage one and two and what does
anybody that stucks money at you what do
they want interest yes they want money
back so they are already thinking about
growth so that's a mismatch there so you
need to be really careful in that face
because you're running around making
failures all the time I need to pivot to
figure out what I want to do and you
have an investor going down oh you need
to scale so i can get my money back so
be careful in that zone there and and
some of the things you can go into this
and this is where everybody that's doing
on have my favorite technology for
something they talk about development
speed and let's be honest most
developments tax today they have decent
speed when you're trying to develop and
put something together that might be
some quirk somewhere I never that but
it's pretty good unless you choose to do
everything in a simply language but Sir
that's a different so this is not going
to be my our primary concern so we're
going to focus on the experiments so the
thing is you want to try new things all
the time so you can fail and learn from
it there at the same time you want to
keep the system running so the things
that are actually working and might be
bringing in money are not being taken
down by your weird experiments and if
you have a coda like me in the company
you really need protection because I
write code and I make things break
all the time I don't think I can fix it
fairly quickly but that's just my
delusions of grandeur but that's a
different thing so for this you need
supervisors so that means that these
Erlang system already has something that
supports you in going off on doing these
wild things which is awesome makes you
sweat less and then when you talk about
the pivots there so then it means that
whatever you've done terms code why's it
needs to be able to change easily when
you figure out that you're on a long
track or these reuse parts of it so the
things that plays into this in the
ecosystem we are in is you have
functional programming going for us we
have no sequel there we have protocols
and then we have of course I can't do a
slide take without the golden Trinity of
airline so that's the fail fast share
nothing and failure handling so over the
next slides I'll be going through how
all these different pieces have a role
to play in how to make your startup
successful in failing fast getting to
the money there
just so that it's not just lean startup
guys that gets the credit for this or I
come up with something here this is what
Edison said and he's long gone I have
not failed i've just found 10,000 ways
that won't work it's the same attitude
you need to take and bring into these
things expect to fail but expect to
learn from it that's how we grow and
then of course on the more torque
ronnian stylists and all failures they
are created equal but some are more
equal than others so let's go into that
so there are things called good failures
in this setup so that is the failure
that leads you to insight about your
business about what makes money that's a
good failure because young you one step
closer to the thing that works so
everything in these things every tiny
thing that brings you closer to a
business model that makes your bank
account have black digits at the end of
the month is a good thing so these
failures we welcome because they've
taken us off the track down to something
that doesn't make money so this is the
the key point here then we have the bad
failures and they're really bad bad bad
bad bad we want to avoid these so
downtown you too bad quality software
means again consider if you want to hire
me because I write bad software so let's
stay out of that there and then you
don't want to make any choice that limit
your ability to learn from the business
failures if you've taken a tech choice
that then makes it difficult for you to
do the pivot and take the learnings that
are really bringing to closer to the
money then you've done a really poor
tech choice so for all of these things
about understanding the market and
everything you also need to have people
that are confident competent on the tech
side to make sure you make the right
decisions and stay loose are there and
then people been talking about these
different things for a long time so Fred
Brooks wrote this wonderful boot vogue
about the silver bullet how many of you
read it this is way too little go get
that one it's it's really amazing it's I
figure so 30 years old or something like
that now but you still have to read it
there so he talks about two types of
complexity that's the essential
Plec city that's solving the problem
this just things you need to solve to
get anywhere so that's the complexity
you're born with and then you can't Fig
get any easier than that and then
there's the existential complexity
that's this stuff you put in but making
poor choices and that one you must
minimize it if you don't minimize that
and just run around like a headless
chicken or rather a headless schools
because that's more dramatic there
you're gonna kill yourself slowly but
surely so this is one way you need to be
really really aggressive about avoiding
this extension complexity is bad and
it's one that you cause yourself so
there's nobody to blame there's no
crying in the banker I chose the wrong
technology stack yeah you chose it had
to make that choice so don't go there so
and then when it when it comes down to
this with complexity you also change
ability so eighty percent of the
lifetime of your software is spent on
maintenance and that even also applies
in when you're doing a start-up because
you have to look at your code most of
the code you've written it and you have
to do one of those pivots so you need to
be able to take the code and understand
it and see what you can reuse there so
make it easy to change and then in terms
of making things easier to change in
most of these things you need a data
model how to handle your data and this
I'll do will be slightly mathematical
about this your first that data model is
wrong your second data model is wrong
and since I've started math I can now
apply an induction all data models are
wrong which means that if you buy
yourself into something that's fixed
forever on a data model side you're dead
so therefore you need no sequel because
the flexibility you get from having not
all these schemas and fixed frames or
around you without allows you to have
that the velocity of your development
drops slower I'm not promising you by
not choosing no equal that the
velocity doesn't drop velocity always
drops the first line of code is always
eat eat in the most easy one to get in
it gets the more difficult time but
let's try to make things we don't drop
too fast
and you should not use schemas please
don't do this yeah don't do this because
you have a well you can do it if your
middle name is schema and your last name
is fun upgrade if you run around saying
that I'm by the way I'm talking scheme
of an upgrade then it's okay use schemas
because then you know what it is you
dream it you live it there point here is
spend your time on the features not on
schemas so that means no sequel and then
since I come from a company that doesn't
know she called database how does react
a wii fit into this picture because then
basically before you scale everything
runs on one machine if you think you
have a business model that from day one
needs 10 or 20 machines you're doing
something wrong the scaling part is a
rich man's problem you need to get the
first paying customers before you go
anywhere so can you do react avion one
node yep you can but it's not optimal
because react is meant to have this
follower thing with all the notes taking
data and everything there you but you'll
get benefit benefits unavailability when
you do scale but anyway we in a minute
scale we're not there yet or so how does
it feel in so what you have to do you
need to use the towel to give you
freedom does everybody know what the dal
is no yeah data abstraction layer I'll
have a sticker for y'all find a sticker
for you that's good exactly it's the
data abstraction layer you want at all
costs to abstract the way how you're
storing data this is software
engineering 101 it's not even start of
101 hide the way don't let the database
leak into the rest of your code base
because one day you're gonna get fed up
with react and you won't put something
else in oh that won't happen you'll get
fed up with Cassandra after four hours
and then you want to switch there so
what you can do in the meantime is to
make sure you have the data abstraction
layer in place and then you do the no
sequel with amnesia very simple record
has two fields a key and the value and
you stuff whatever
wander into value because normally
amnesia has the structure and everything
you just use two fields and you can
stuff whatever and the important part
here is the really important part is you
get used to having a key value thing the
way you approach your data and that
means the moment you're ready to scale
and the ready when you're ready to pay
us money for react licenses and all that
fun stuff and support you just switch
then react and you don't have to change
anything above your data abstraction
layer and you have to do that anyway
even if you go with Cassandra we won't
be friends anymore but anyway so just
remember this but you can start with
anisha and then nietzsche runs beautiful
for these things are there and if you
don't know how to use that take a class
with Francesco and you'll know how to do
it hey there then some of the things
from the golden Trinity of Earl and
share nothing that is super because that
means that only one thing brace when
something is wrong in your code you're
doing an experiment and that's one thing
that falls over and you're just smiling
yeah I'm getting the feedback I need
there and no more and then another thing
on failures because when you have these
systems the likelihood of a big system
like this now we're little further down
the road but anyway so this won't work
programming errors because some of you
hired me so I'll put arrows into your
code sorry that's what I do for living
there you have disk failures and you
have network failures those are not my
fault I promise you that's not me but
they will happen to you all the time
anyway so that means you can't ignore
failures that's kind just going to let
led to an epic failure on your behalf
that oh you can't get around these
things and the way is the way we notice
these things that's why we have Murphy's
Law anything that can go wrong will go
wrong and that's slightly pessimistic
but you need to live with this and the
they also say that this probably came
from whatever can happen will happen but
I'll promise you this you won't get
super nice things happening by accident
you need to work hard for it if you get
accidentals goodness just drum dumping
out of you did the typing you're doing
all the better view but don't don't bank
on it there and then we can see that if
you want to do something with 14
tolerance in mind there you just take
whatever programming paradigm that's out
there those are mostly fault intolerant
that's also where we're headed fireside
chat yesterday that there's earning is
just mentally different on a different
planet and that means in these
situations you need to deal with all
errors or you don't have to die and it's
the entire thing it's in your entire
website or your entire thing it's just
go on when you have one error which you
don't like because then you end up maybe
you end up looking like Dustin Hoffman
rare-earth there but you end up having
to protect yourself and going around
doing defensive programming all the time
you need to fight it all the time and
that this the outbreak movie I never
understood why they made the general
remember there's a general in outbreak
they have this thing with this the
disease is spreading and everything and
then the general comes in and he's in
erlanger he's a true erlanger he just
say let's nuke it let's fail fast get
rid of the disease there and for some
strange reason the first area in the
movies is portrayed as a bad guy I don't
get it yeah there you go so then fault
tolerance and that's Erlang alexia fault
tolerant by the sign which means that
you can say this wonderful failures I
embraced and managed this feels really
good when you can say that on the movie
front this is of course Bruce Willis in
die hard because he's just having a ball
there and he'll get up whenever he fails
he'll just get up there that's the
benefit of having a supervisor or
machine gun depending on the situation
there and then just to prove that this
is not just fantasy stuff there we can
go back to Ian Henry's study heated for
motorola back in the day when i worked
there so he had yeah we have to have the
numbers up here so he rewrote a C++
application yes granted that's not a
fair comparison c++ horrible all that
 but anyway it was written by really
good engineer so maybe it's not the best
thing so the application code that saw
of the problem remember this is this
about making something that makes your
end users are happy so they'll pay you
money but kota solves the problem this
is the app code and you can see here in
the c++ thing yeah these two things it's
less than twenty percent of the code
that is addressing what you're trying to
make money off the rest is just all that
mumbo jumbo you need to do in or other
languages memory management defensive
programming what have you you don't want
that you want the early learning
experience where you have over sixty
percent of the code addressing the needs
of your customer what's going to bring
your money this is what you want there
and we can thank the founders of a long
for this thing so you had free x with an
earning and that means in this just
embrace the failure embrace this so you
can get into this mode of focusing on
generating lines of code that makes you
money that's how it works and then
another thing you could do and twist it
slightly because failure seems to be
important somehow if you can wrap
failure so that others can proceed
without dealing with those failures you
might have a product so this it's a
proxy thing so there might be a business
in there and that's actually react so
you have this huge amount of machines
you're running react on it and
everything the disks will have failures
and the network will have failures look
how I've removed the software errors are
programming errors it's because others
have coated most of reacts so I can't
take down the system with my coding it
then we'll get to that and and then the
solution here the rear puts in to deal
with all these failures and wrapping
failures in something that's a product
you can sell we replicate data to
counter that notes of failing in our
system so we have this normally free
notes or we replicate too so you can
have two notes failing and this the last
one will still have your data so that's
good and then you detect those you
provide substitute so you keep riding 23
notes all the time again we have
wrapping failures from the end user to
make sure that he can survive there and
then after that
have the handoff we return the data to
the rightful owner so everything is
structured well again and then we also
have active enter entropy where you do
repairs after failure at and on top of
this if a specific message has gone lost
or something there you get these things
so this is where we try to wrap failure
and then packaged it up and sell it as a
product and it works we're making money
so that's good at least people are
paying us money so that's let's put it
like that so the thing we're looking
into is that here we're sitting here
this is software development you have
your entire team they're sitting there
and enjoying whatever design meeting
they're having right there and the guy
at the far end of the beam there the one
that's the first to fall off if somebody
starts pushing out there that's the
product owner because this is like
football or any team sport you don't
fire the manager if you're losing no
you're well well you do fire the
manager yes ok which means i'm a top of
engineering and passion ok yep that
was so scary for there no but you do
fire the manager all the time you don't
fire the team in the middle of the
season you don't yank out the entire
team and put a new team in and said tell
the manager you're doing great let's
continue no no it's the guy in charge
that gets fired so if any of you are
product owners be scared you're the
first to be decapitated where once it
hits event so so business benefits here
and this is where you as a product
ownership stop smiling you have only one
process that diet which means that
continued service of everything else
it's not like your entire thing is down
so that's one thing from this wonderful
finger along OTP gives you there and
then if you have a corner case it
doesn't happen all the time you could
fix it when you feel like it when
there's a return on investment on it
yeah listen to that that's the kind of
bought room talk you can do when you
have a long hair backing you there
because you are in charge you fix it
when the cost to fix it outweighs the
cost of just having it and do manual
fixes you're in charge now they're there
and that's not the software being in
charge that's
you want if you're leading anything or
running a company you want to be in
charge you don't want to let the code
you've written to control you that's the
bad thing for you there so actually here
now we can have total drum roll or bus
words and everything you have a software
architecture that support iterative
development and they can come but
everything else they have but they can't
come in and compete on this one the
Nordic gayest guys over there forget
about it they don't have an architecture
that supports this so we spot on with
this yeah and then I've been told that I
normally yell at people every time I
have a conference go on stage so I'll
try to control myself now then just say
this very gently very very gently it
doesn't make it any less serious but be
very gentle now say this is not a
warning it's a fret and i'll expect
explain to you what the threat is about
yeah we want clean api's you put one
module in front of a nap and make sure
that you all access goes through api
calls in that module and even inside the
app you have an API for each little
thing you're having any using that API
to talk to it period and then you might
go away with it wait a minute you eat
some of your own maybe not yeah and then
I say oh you if I have a pet kind of
just bang it a message like boom it's
got a message that's Orleans good for
message passing everything and also no
please don't notice I'm not yelling at
you I'm not yelling at you so next thing
is I know it's against server can't I
just conserve or call it and just do
that because I know the pit and
everything how do you want to die i'll
make sure this is the fret and the
promise and everything in it here
somebody will get medieval on you if you
do these things maybe not me but
somebody else will and then the warning
will be here and you remember this i can
read it for those who can't read it it's
your own fault what did
laughs tell you about sending messages
without using a module API that's the
fret here I'm not I love yelled at
anything I've just laid it out nicely
and maybe I should work on the way I
present this but really really don't do
this you're gonna kill your startup or
you're gonna kill the next person that
it starts looking at your code which in
all honesty might be yourself don't do
this piece please you'll make me cry so
wait so how do we solve these things
then and put some other things in there
so we actually stay disciplined about
this because this is also about
discipline so that's why I need to go to
look at protocols and i'm not talking
about big fat hairy protocols in big
documents and telecom standards and
everything been there done that got the
scars and all that fun stuff there no a
protocol is basically how do things
solve a problem together you need to
make your components work together in a
nice way so you need to focus on that
and the thing is you can then come into
to do what I call ostrich development
you can document these protocols that
are in your system or not they're still
there so the question is do you want to
run around coding like this and looking
slightly stupid and just waiting for
some of these accidental complexity
things to hit you or you want to be in
control so you need to get them in early
and then another trick here is if you
make it this sign error and you're
talking about design it's cheaper than
changing code simply is changing a
little diagram should be cheaper than
changing code if not find a different
editor to do your drawings in yeah and
what you need to do to document these
protocols is you need to have an
interaction diagram that tells you
something about which types of messages
are being sent between the different
processes in your system and you need a
message sequence chart that shows how
the flow of messages are between the
different components and you can try
again be my guest try to live without
this this is still happening in your
program
either you make it explicit and you talk
about it and you manage or you ignore it
and run around like an ostrich and try
to make software that works it's not
going to work in the longing that mean
also means that when you try and do
these things there's some hints about it
you should limit the logic that goes
into a single process because you can
avoid all these messages you can charge
but shuffling everything into a process
don't do that try and make small simple
things and then be complicated call
orchestration of things to others and I
have an example here how many you notice
this board game acquire this one again
it's too few it's an ultimate the
ultimat capitalistic game you're just
trying to make more money than the rest
of the people by outsmarting them come
on go get it anyway read about on the
net so the idea is that you buy stocks
in companies and you play place things
on the board tiles that make the
companies grow and then you want to buy
of course when the company is small and
then sail again when the company is
bigger so that's the idea in the game
and then you want to go and let's have a
look at this embassy for for buying
stocks here they're so so we have a turn
process here and can you see my pointer
here no you can't so I'll just jump down
here and do a little bit of pointing
yeah so the turn process here it's
asking the player and which corporations
do you want to buy stocks in its giving
a list of cooperation to choose from and
you come back with a list of choices of
the stocks you want to buy and then for
all of the different corporations you go
in you do a reserve to the bank say I
want to reserve this particular stock
for buying and here you go okay the
price will be this and here's a
reference so we know what we're talking
about so this is certificate for this
stock there then the next thing is you
then you want to debit your own bank
account with the price of this stock and
we get an okay back because we have
enough money to do it this is just a
success case and then you say you give
it by on the reference back to
Bank you get an okay back and then you
add the stock you just bought to your
portfolio and then you repeat until
you're done and then the turn will send
the by result back to the player with
everything there do you like that design
oh it's good good I made the design so
you shouldn't like it it's horrible this
is way too complicated there but this is
the first thing I came up with and I
hadn't written the line of code apart
from coat being more expensive to change
there's also a mental thing if you've
written some code over I don't want to
change it it's it's my coat it's in yeah
that's also a thing you need to let go
of by the way so you can simplify this
so in the loop instead here we have a
way simpler way of doing it you're just
telling the bank I want to buy a stock
in this call cooperation and the bank
takes care of asking the account if
there's enough money getting okay back
adding it to the portfolio and say okay
price back and then you can also have
the error handling in here quite easily
this is a lot easier there there and it
didn't come around to me the first time
it rarely does because these things can
be tricky and some of the ideas that
goes into this and also there is
something from the phone book her clean
code and I think had I read it back then
before I started these things and had to
etrade my way through this and finding
the right protocol for this and get it
out then this temporal nature of the
first design that would have been
avoided I'm very very confident that i
would have voided that error in the
first place well maybe not just accept
that you'll do these mistakes but find a
way to do it before it becomes expensive
then we want to put all of this together
so with all these different tricks of
how good things in the earning system
and everything can work for us and the
techniques to put into it so how do we
put it together well stateful is the new
black so if you're running a website
that has no stayed in it then don't do
it in Erlang don't do it in Dixie stay
doing it it in what
ever other thing just don't bother go
coming here but you need to staple
things and that's also where the money
is so the architecture for this is you
throw in something to get a good end
point there Phoenix cowboy depending on
where you are in the world then you have
your cool app because it's cool because
it's going to make you money then you
have your data abstraction layer and
then you put in ria kv amnesia depending
on how far along you are in your scaling
remember scaling is a rich man's problem
so you might want to consider starting
with amnesia in the no sequel trick mode
like that because then you're ready to
throw in react later and on top of it
you can throw him Elle or whatever your
other things there this is the super
fancy stack if you want to go with this
you can do anything else but the other
things is what we have in our ecosystem
that will support us in iterating fast
forward and getting all these benefits
I've talked about earlier so failures
here embrace them learn from them you
need to go through these stages that
first without writing any code figure
out if you have a problem and solution
fit work it a bit get a little thing
going see if you have a problem market
fit and in all of this fail fail fail so
you can do the pivots and get closer to
what what's really making money there
and then they'd run growth optimizations
a lot of money you sent me a thank-you
card at the crispness and everything for
following this guide so everybody's good
there and then you use the techniques we
have here the golden trinity of Erlang
with fail fast share nothing failure
handling you have the functional program
you have the protocols I have the no
sequel remember these things and go back
to this ring and you can always come and
ask me for an advice on some of how
these things you should be done there
and then above all all else try to make
the good phages do not make the bad
figures do not choose Cassandra Jews
react ya know okay that's a different
thing yeah but anyway make the good
failures because that's how you're going
to end up with the money in the end
and that was it we're hiring by the way
there go see our stand talk to them
figure that out and also you can still
try this collector set out there so
that's it thank you questions did I
scare everybody away from doing a
start-up no not quite how many startups
have you done me well I've done nothing
on that front there I've been in this is
part of the things where you work with
companies and when we work at the
airline solutions and trying to help
them steer them in the right direction
and making them take their tech choices
they're there so I'm just a parrot here
on these things there I just know how to
fit these things in when you have a
problem of a client when we went out to
them we tried at least I tried to do
these things for these difficult cases
with custom and say no no you need to do
these things in this order to succeed
and yeah some of it has worked some of
it has now protect the innocent I will
not protect myself in this some of the
advice that was given turned out not to
be okay but a lot of that actually
following this what's good there
Oh Torben do you know do you could you
experience a particularly in a situation
or a case where a start-up chose wrong
technology and then they fail Foster and
chose the right technology do you have
any use KO I mean a case study or
something like that can you explain such
a case study yet that's the best case
there's draws draw something because
they were were on a nun Erlang based
technology that's the first sign of
you're doing something wrong there and
they were failing and then they switch
to something that was able to to do the
thing and but they had all the metrics
in place they had all the feedback so
you can see that now we're failing we
need to do something about it and then
they switch really fast because it was
not too far long for them to do
something about it what are those new
tricks well those metrics are how many
users are having too long respond times
how many are being told tonight and how
many leave your site very fast because
it's not working so that's the kind of
metrics you need to put in place under
your under the hood so you can see these
things but that's if you take the book
like running green lean that's a number
of different things you could be
measuring on to see if you're still
succeeding or if people are starting to
run away from you instead of staying
with you yeah so that's a whole whole
metric part I haven't talked about that
but that's something you need to hook
into this so you can see when you're
failing that's also when you're doing
any experiment any experiment here is
this you need to have a measurement on
it you can't just you a blind experiment
and go hmm that looks kind of nice no
you need to come up with a hypothesis
that you can falsify by collecting some
data that's how you work these things
otherwise you're just going to end up
with love Philly Philly and then you'll
be off on the wrong track oh you have
been talking about along and Alexis or
the beam basic assistant so what's your
opinion about acha or the scholar based
framework for ya Scala acha acha yeah
would you recommend a start-up to use
Scala I mean acha
sorry Scarlett acha so there it's just a
prolonged way of dying because skyline
acha they are so complicated in
themselves if the only thing that can
warrant using them is if you're really
familiar with them and you have a
problem way it's mandatory for you to be
on the JVM other than that and if you're
starting up from scratch please don't go
there it's so mentally taxing on you to
do the complex stuff that is in Scala
and akka the concepts are way simply an
erlang an elixir so you're just going to
bury yourself by unnecessary complexity
by choosing a technology that just
raises the against accidental complexity
simply my head hurts every time I read
Scala code it's just too sorry thanks
for the answers
hey gentlemen so you talked about if you
have all this complexity built into your
calls by sending messages directly into
the innards of your application what
advice would you give to folks that want
to slowly unwind that and build a better
ap ice like you're recommending I'm
asking for a friend ok Tony thanks for
asking for your friend and you can tell
your friend that you work it message by
message you take the first message when
see I'm sending this it's bad rabbit in
an API call and take that and factor it
all through and then take the next one
just do it sliced by slice and get back
to the right track and then you you'll
feel the stretch here here being less
than this because every time you remove
one of them you'll get no right back to
your normal height there so that's
message by message to do these things
it's the only way you can work with
otherwise you're going to die in
refactoring everything in one go and
that's what scares a lot of people
because you when you come in and you
tell them dude this is actually bad you
need to fix this and if you have to fix
everything no no no do it one message at
a time there and then every time you fix
one you can also slap yourself there so
you know don't do it again that's called
negative feedback so yeah good all right
give it up once again for Tobin Hoffman
