that's common to both languages because
it is the airline computer that's being
proposed and then we map it to real
physical hardware and elixir follows the
same model that doesn't violate that
computer it just has a different space
on it the one thing I wanted to take
away from it was to not approach if
they're coming into a liquor in Phoenix
in particular because that's where a lot
of folks are arising to not approach it
like every other web programming
language they've worked in and to
actually take the time to explore the
underlying you know concurrency tools of
our the Erlang has always provided
because I think it can note you know
putting some really amazing result I
would say there's there's an emotional
quality to programming that you know
historically relying programmers just
don't understand we're we're a bit off
on that on I respect so great
documentation great getting started
guides great tooling there's a certain
tolerance of pain that they're laying
folk have endured and maybe and
sometimes enjoy that is probably
pathological it's certainly not
mainstream like some things were
frustrating when I was starting but
mostly it was just fun it was it was
giving myself an opportunity to learn
something I didn't know it was on a side
project so it wasn't I wasn't getting
paid for my work I don't have the
stresses of performance at work I think
it's awesome like learn go outside your
comfort zone the fact that the electric
community has invested so heavily in
outstanding documentation outstanding
tooling great and fun testing if there
is such a thing I mean I think the doc
test taken from Python I've always had a
lot of fun with that and while there it
is an elixir bringing a lot of fun I
think
to the boss
and then lo and behold you have an
underlying platform that is really
outstanding we've all developed these
really amazing systems for doing things
and we're like putting them together and
mixing down this and there's a lot of
interesting outcome you see these go
ahead refer you to be on the globe so
I'm really interested professionally in
critical systems in in fault tolerant
critical systems and it's much more well
documented the machines that appear in
space programs than say water pumps in
industrial settings so there's a lot
more research material that's available
to me the other thing is it's more
engaging to talk about space and then
space is cool yeah it's pretty obvious
when things go wrong so it's easier to
get across these notions of safety and
correctness and fault tolerance in that
type of context which is why in fly
space I've given talks about water pumps
which is what made me think about it
you know everyone just fell asleep well
I like the keynote yeah well I learn
more about space every time but that's a
lot of fun yeah yeah I go and put the 3d
space book question before I was there
so I've actually I've actually written
some software they execute inside
satellites
well you never know that might be an
idea okay a new house sort of evolved in
that time
