you a really fast talk about what I did
as part of a group project at a boot
camp and just some thoughts that we had
on Alexa just to share with the wider
community majunior so like none of this
will be metaprogramming I think this is
the bedtime story version at the end of
the conference so my preamble I used to
protect journalists in Beirut actually
discovered last night kind of
embarrassing Lee that I think elixir is
actually an Arabic language word but a
fun fact for the conference came to a
makers Academy which is a boot camp in
London and did 16 weeks all in all a
ruby JavaScript was sacrificed at the
altar of TDD ping pong etc and now I
work at a music company called uncle and
do you have any musicians in the house
part-time full-time professional yeah if
any of you have experienced as part of a
bollywood-themed barbershop quartet and
can also play the tuba yeah we got you
so that's not a joke we really need that
so yeah that's where we're at right now
and this is my team this is where we
work together in a group of four sort of
Daniel male and part-time franciscan
monk Andy who we put together a search
engine and we just learned elixir in for
our final project so just a really basic
thing of what we did we created a URL
scraper scraped URLs from a page shoved
them into the database then took one of
those URLs put them in a different
scraper that went to that URL scrape the
data from it put it into a different
database and that was the Delphie side
of things and for everyone who talked
about their love of Greek myths Delphie
is the Oracle Padilla's the mouthpiece
and so we had a complementary side to it
which is the query engine where we
looked at the database that had all the
data in it and ranked results and very
crude
great crude algorithm and they appeared
on this color page which obviously is
modeled on google and as sort of just an
example of the spider that we ran which
we were told under no accounts to run on
our boot camps Wi-Fi we did think about
going to maybe like rival boot camps and
doing it loving up the competition we
just got banned from some coffee shops
instead so this is what it was when we
were running it it's just maybe maybe
maybe won't work here now say this is
just it feeding into the bed database
all the stuff we scraped and so we
program so we're just talking about
elixir are all are sort of WTF moments
because we came from our backgrounds was
when we created fizzbuzz it was the
first thing that our coaches told us to
do in terms of learning a new language
and all of us individually the four of
us sort of had a yeah WTF is the way to
describe it some swore a lot left the
room when we realized how you could do
it an elixir and it kind of encouraged
us sort of to write or try and write a
search engine and it obviously because
of the Alexis power and its concurrency
but I mean more than that we actually
really enjoyed working at it and I
really like what Johnny said about not
sort of community bashing we always I
think we like Ruby in a thankful for it
for giving us an introduction into
programming full stop but we we loved it
i'm licks and we drunk it and so we felt
that it pushed us to write clean code
really like the documentation the
community is amazing we asked so many
stupid questions on slack and people
were so helpful to the point where they
even said no no you've just forgotten a
bracket that it which was really
encouraging so I think we wanted to
convey like sort of speaking on behalf
of everyone is that when we left we
didn't find any junior jobs at all in
Alexis so so these people have all been
missing in action is Lexi juniors I
think what a lot of people are talking
about in terms of developed
community it would also be great if
there could be some sort of like maybe
some sort of avenue for juniors as well
I know it irritating and I know you'll
love submitting pull requests to all of
the terrible things that we write but I
think yeah it seemed to those though
there weren't a lot of functional
programming positions for juniors and it
was just food for thought as to maybe
why that was and I'm happy to be
corrected if that's untrue but that was
just our observation so as a quick
roundup of the things that we did and I
hope you enjoyed it come find me and ask
her any questions about afterwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
