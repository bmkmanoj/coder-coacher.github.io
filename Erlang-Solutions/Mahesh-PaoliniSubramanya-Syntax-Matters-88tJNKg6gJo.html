audience one two great two people broken
therefore I can't approach anything in
tech comm unit which is even better so
first of all it turns out there's a huge
monitor down there so I can see what's
on the screen up there that's good but
there is a monitor that shows my notes
which is not so good let's give me that
way end of that so uh today's talk is
about syntax and it's basically inspired
by these syntax wars so just a couple of
quick show of hands here primary
language Java boom three four five six
seven primary language Erlang yeah Joe
raises his hand back there there's a
surprise Python Ruby Wow lots of movies
how about something weird ap l0 pretty
cool a reasonable smattering of people C
or C variants thereof Bunter okay so
pretty much all of you pretty much have
gone through some variation of the
syntax for this sucks of syntax what
that sucks or Linux intact basically
sucks and you invariably end of the
syntax frameworks in fact a pretty good
way to troll pretty much a teammate
ignis and I can guarantee you to troll
the or like mailing lists it just say
something about syntax and off you go
half the for those of you are going to
be watching
going to listen to Jose talk tomorrow
about Alex their half controls about the
Orlan persons a fixer thing going on is
syntax it's got nothing to do with
anything else looks like Ruby that's bad
that's good whatever and that kind of
inspired this whole thing so getting
started there before that a bit about
myself on mange pas fini subramanya I
head up software for a company called
ubiquiti networks so if anybody here who
doesn't know me who knows what ubiquiti
networks is or a skirt of us anybody wow
that's zero we are the largest network
hardware manufacturer that you have
clearly never ative we're huge we're
worldwide where you know multi-billion
many many billion dollar company and we
are not responsible for the Wi-Fi in
this building that mount should know
this big boy it would be working
perfectly anyhow I head up self with
this company we provide hardware
services and just insert some marketing
sphere about how great we are in
whatever good enough moving on syntax
syntax flame wars since actually works
pretty much suck but they were great way
to troll the thing is usually either get
syntax matter should you get this other
one which is syntax doesn't matter and
the thing is syntax actually doesn't
matter except what it does which is kind
of a grease employer putting it but the
thing is it's not be the point and kind
of going to get a kind of going to get
into this from the perspective of
languages and for the next over 30 maybe
40 minutes I want you to think about
syntax not really from a program
perspective but from a language
perspective just think of programming as
yet another language spoken language
oh one more question and that's it I'm
done after this one how many of you
speak more than one language this is
your most of you should if I did this in
America how many things be more than one
language in America you get usually 1710
forty percent of the audience the tech
conference you usually get a lot more
between 30 and 50 because you have a lot
of Indians in tech conferences in
America which promotes helps if you take
aliens out it goes poof back up zoo it's
really quite bad so speak multiple
languages your poly blood you kind of
instinctively know and you just speak
these languages because you grew up
speaking these languages the thing about
languages spoken languages syntax is
prone to reflection of that language is
a reflection of the culture that rather
language about and can screw your pretty
bad stupid example number one that's an
average for Conover so pointlessly yes
green one that's an angle to a condom it
is pronounced anybody here any Indians a
nice altitudes and the Indians 0
thousand units or 20 oh that's a script
based on an old pre Sanskrit language
that dates back to some priests ass for
days it's still used oh that's
pronounced poorly but it's written eight
um I only because you don't have this
weird Earl of sound in English
exist and green basically means seller
it all at lemons it's actually a wee bit
more complicated their variations of
this but to stick with that it's sour
there's another they will leave which is
altering the aging arrow because there
is no else out which is a tiger the
thing is it looks different in the
syntax here is different in English
isn't acting the same damn thing which
quite frankly if you open the fridge
because you wanted a couple of lemons
and you have the wrong thing in the
fridge would be a very bad idea then we
get the question is why you have a tiger
in the fridge or alternately what you
have lemons in the fridge you're not
supposed to put in the fridge to keep it
outside but either way the point is
wholly a bully are two completely
different things but not in English it's
just us what that work but that's a
simple one it's just here's your ledger
that doesn't exist in English therefore
the syntax is incapable of expressing
that very specific for me there're sound
slightly more complicated that thing is
pronounced cada que har a simple easy
and it is the flavor of killings you
know you're hot how do you do that in
English you don't we just say it's
harder you say it's chilly auditory say
something like that which or in spicy
mob which is my favorite super trace
ever like what do you mean spicy hot
yeah it's hot but then again the point
is this particular word is a thing that
doesn't even exist in another in English
but it's a word that exists in hella or
much by the language is Spanish simple
it's all your fault take this yet
another step further that is a word some
culture which actually has no
translation in English it is a very
contextual word word it roughly
translates
that particular sensation of shyness
when you are okay however you are at a
friend's house okay persons this year or
half seconds I know you like it's a
great dessert lap seconds and you're
sitting there you're like yeah but I
don't want to take seconds because that
not be the polite thing to do now they
know you're being polite you know your
reply they don't you know your be polite
that particular sensation is called
subculture in Canada I'm serious I'm not
Ming Tsai now I could do exactly what I
did I could go to this entire you know
description of what this means and say
please don't feel that way or if you're
in South India Bangalore you'd say some
culture purple beta which roughly
translates to don't feel some culture
and it explains everything it covers a
good two minutes of description of what
i'm trying to say syntax effective
remarkably useful thing in that one
particular case and of course in other
cases it's canada which basically
stopped evolving in one sense but 150
years ago getting that in just a moment
but the point being that the actual
syntax that you're using the actual
letters that you're using are really
relevant based upon the particular
situation you're trying to get out so
far so good applies to programming
languages soon monads funk you know what
that is writable not going to say it
anybody you know whatever you know what
I'm oh that is what Sam on an official
basis well yeah I know there's some a
better some smart aleck in the room
going yeah you can do one ounce and
visual basic oh yeah you can that it's
kind of stupid thing to do
but you could let's go to in Haskell
again could do what an asshole in fact I
just found one in stock exchange because
everything sucks I stack exchange but
still the point is you can do a go to an
asshole again remarkably stupid thing to
do but you could do it but the context
the point behind this is the specifics
of the syntax even those simple words go
to which is that there's a typo too
invasive can we meet you know
diddly-squat in a different program
programming language or the word
multi-head just totally encapsulate
everything that we tried to say but
means absolutely nothing invasive which
kind of takes you back to listening
which is in the end it's about the
language you're using the language
you're speaking with language you're
programming which kind of takes me back
all the way that which is what earth is
a languid what we mean when we say
language when somebody's complaining
about the same types of structure of a
particular piece of code what are they
arguing about if you're trying to tell
somebody that you know they don't talk
so good or some even more radical
version thereof what exactly is your
point essentially what is your point you
say that you no speak English good great
I know either whatever the point is
languages are this insanely complex
beasties which people have been trying
to do some kind of categorization about
forever they were trying to classify
these things for ever there's
million ways in which you classify
languages spoken languages start with a
simple one everybody seen some goofy
version of this thing you know the
language tree it all began with pro
indo-european languages sad stuff
happened just not actually quite true
because they're also the proto Native
American stuff and there's other stuff
out in Far East and whatever things that
came from the river valley civilizations
it doesn't matter there's old stuff
there's stroking other different ways to
do get Chomsky and chicken burger did
this yogurts work in linguistics to
figure out to basically do this
classification of languages and let's
not go there it exists it can actually
get incredibly complicated and goofy the
thing about all of this there is no
matter how complicated and tricky you
can make language classifications the
shaman you'll make it even more
complicated it even trickier and even
more difficult to understand guaranteed
phd's for generations to come and the
thing is it's not just that this is all
exceedingly small print it is a chart of
the history of programming languages and
most pretty much anybody went through
one of the this thing in small print
would find half a dozen languages they
know that's not on this chart because
you know somebody's coming up the new
one every day somebody finds an old one
that nobody ever talked at a while back
which isn't on that chart but the point
is there is some level of classification
that you tried to do say this came from
that and that came from something else
and not give to something else whatever
life is good or maybe you try and
classify things differently you talk
about structures stupid example because
there are a lot of stupid examples here
what's that thing it's a green card so
far so good so it turns out another way
of classifying languages is by structure
you say they're left brasserie languages
and right gradual abuses left crunching
languages because always get this one
mixed up in the left matching language
you put the descriptor before the term
that's a green card green card left
Patrick in Italian mark Canha ver there
that's a car greedy italians a right
branch of language so Spanish shows
basically a lot of the Latin based
languages so far so good right branching
most Indian languages most Southeast
Asian languages or background check fact
they're hardcore left branching it's
like virtually impossible to find any
dry branch and stuff in it you always
end up with the descriptor before the
term there shall goofy African should
say goofy there some after the languages
and some obscure languages that are
purely right Roger purely read watching
to the extent that you don't say in one
car is a car one date it's a language
it's fine or returnable English of
course is the goofy one it's been all
over the place there's some left
branding stuff there's some right
granting stealth English is cost you
more chaos than you can shake so many
sticks that hold that thought get back
to that one give you the same
programming languages that's a really
obvious one you got imperative and
declarative a declarative and logic and
functional oh this looks so nice right
you can do this and you can end up with
this perfect thing it's a lambda
calculus based language and largest
perfect except it's not really socially
because what you end up with is even
though you'd like to believe that your
languages can be nicely classified into
left branching a right
what are the equivalent is they're all
in English Java now has spread to
everything and if it doesn't get willed
after tomorrow pick a language it's
pretty much got terms like pretty much
any other language except apo which is
understandable but that's a separate
issue earlier but the point remains that
easy and yes you can sit around and you
can classify the language 70s wait 17
ways to Sunday and nobody said we're
going to come to you and say young that
is the perfect language that is
imperfect syntax that's the correct way
to do things because that depends upon
what you learned where you came from
what you did what you speak which is not
what I learn where I came from what I
didn't what I speak because in the end
there are billions and billions of
people out there where the correct
number is by a half all of whom speak
languages all of them speak different
languages or do it differently and they
all seem to do it remarkably
successfully at them by the way save
programming languages take your
programming language of choice early
wait this language ever except when it's
dark and it's a violent insert language
of choice it it's a function of who
you're talking to and what they're doing
and so on I'll get to in a moment the
thing is you got built into people huge
chunk of them or multi degree but it is
a multilingual you should just think
about this be possible languages they
might code in multiple languages too but
stick with the speaking thing for a
moment you got people who are
multilingual great how do you
communicate with them the thing that
you're tend to forget is there couple
different ways of doing it one is the
obvious one just put up signs in all the
languages you know the other option is
give it a good shot because people have
figured out anyhow usually sometimes not
always what's that mean it's pretty
obvious it's wrong but it's all be proud
to know what it means you're not going
to walk over to this one look at that go
huh that's not authorized reseller go
somewhere else works poor grammar like
you give a either that or maybe you
should you get your speeding ticket what
are the other but what is you knew what
that meant when you saw that kids in
particular typically exceptionally good
at this because the thing is the
important thing here is we all learn
languages differently but when you're
young you don't really know or care that
much about the rules you get the rules
from your parents or from your
surroundings effectively what happens is
when you're a kid you look at the staff
and you're like okay fine I know what's
going on I know what the supposed to be
you pick up hopefully Preston's glass of
water and you say glass of water and you
say water glass where is a glass water
course a needle which is finding oh
whatever pick your language of choice
bikini they are well tell you but the
point being you got the point across to
somebody more importantly you explain
what that thing was understood the u.s.
of course because in the US no
nobody take this step further we're
going to go into a very outside to excel
in just a moment but one of the amazing
things is when you learn multiple
languages where you learn to speak
multiple languages you instinctively
break down certain to evaluation break
you become more amenable to looking at
the world in different ways this is
actually this isn't me this is Chomsky
this is even before tomski but language
is a deeper reflection of not just great
structures but if the culture that the
language is created it remember son
culture I guess there's a lot of
politeness in bangalore what's one in
India once upon a time it's a thank you
the particular type of pro likeness that
required the creation or that one word
some culture to really hang out the
point as to what is going on and I
suspect that didn't exist in d Oh pick a
totally different culture in Norwegian
the thing is what i just said four
spoken languages advice exactly to
programming languages too and odds are
if you speak multiples weldon languages
and you code you're much more open to
multiple programming languages and this
is kind of the point bag on centric
study the extremely eccentric study that
are conducted and said that four last
time basically went through a whole
bunch of people that I know which makes
it outside failure and said and just did
a call it correlation between the poly
parts and the hog black programmers and
there's straight sixty percent percent
correlation through those two what is
even more fascinating was there's an
eighty percent correlation between lon
monolinguals English Java English Java
English shavon a mind that could also be
because they're all in the US
all in Java that separate story
altogether but the point is that does
seem to apply in both spoken and
programming languages in that when you
are so fixated on one way of looking the
world you tend to just avoid any other
way of looking at this the going back to
kids though we're going back to the way
people learn languages the way you learn
languages varies depending on what it is
that you're learning can vary
drastically for that matter you know we
tell you to go with some doubting so far
so good it hindi your ruffle purple
approximation you'll be Jonah this thing
needs absolutely nothing to you there
are no preconceptions you are you know
Italian you want to learn Hindi it could
be gibberish distributing it earlier but
you're walking there with your mind open
and you can pick it up pretty rapidly
doing them the interesting thing about
this one though is you will learn in the
extremely well assuming you're doing
because part of learning is if we part
of the point and learning it is you will
understand what about the culture about
the weights broken the people that you
speak to put how do you speak it at
center etc because you not read any of
these preconceptions with you at all it
looks different sounds stupid but just
the fact that it looks different me to
treat it differently where you we can to
be that way we don't let okay not like
we tend to interact differently with
people who are not like us whatever that
means third and last APA reference here
gorgeous chunk of appeal there nobody
knows they appeal to others may that's
what you use to multiply two polynomials
together in apo gibberish right but the
thing is this piece of code if you wrote
this out in pick your language of choice
that's not a PL or variant thereof jou
or something this would be like pages
and pages and pages and pages and summer
pages of code but and it would probably
take you about a week to write in Java
probably think you're weak to write this
to just cuz it short doesn't mean it's
easy but the point there mean that it is
so different when you learn apo you
learn JPL as compared to this french and
italian Oh little quite similar in fact
there should learn and in fact you know
what if you know each other you cannot
rent or Spanish pretty rapidly because
they look quite similar which is a
different way of learning languages and
it's also the same reason why when you
look when you know see when you know
Java you can pick up C sharp humanly but
if you can the kindly relative the same
except for all the dotnet entertainment
they do but they can also be a problem
there you see these two and for a moment
pretend it's me I member I'm American I
don't know anything other than English
say hey yeah well that's an a
the DNA this is English these are words
in English I'm bringing in all of my
preconceptions from english ii to this
so for the moment pretend english
actually protect a large chemical
english is left branching remember that
green car so when i see the green car
and i'm speaking in Italian I won't say
mark can I bear they are severe they
bout to know which people will actually
understand people do understand because
I speak cartoon Italian but the point
being that it's not great Italian
trotting remotely corrected value that's
because I just assume that since this
looks like English whatever that means
the English rules apply to it the
English methodology applies to it which
is what's this is where syntax can screw
you up this one won't screw you up
there's a visual basic it's easy to
understand hell it looks like English
right whatever this is Microsoft Excel
ease it's barely English it's totally
not function it's one of the most
frightening things of the world why is
it brief aside you know might one of the
most striking things in the world there
is a website that I strongly recommend
that you guys will take a look at it's
called the European spreadsheet risk
group school you'll find it it's just a
list of all the monster catastrophes
that have occurred because of Microsoft
Excel errors the latest is of course the
Rygaard grown off they Rogoff thing that
makes me talk down has taken a Europe
one spreadsheet error but JP Morgan lost
six billion or because of one of those
and so on and so forth but it's because
it's this it's totally cryptic
understandable unless you know my chart
Excel stuff being that it's not but
that's seven story take yourself further
than you look at this
say to yourself yeah not quite sure it
means it's a sharp it's basically this
comprehensive comprehension and in
f-sharp easy simple if you know that
it's a list comprehension you understand
that I am eats l is less than whatever
so far so good so yeah there's some
functional reason comes into it and you
get a little bit more context but
theoretically if you approach this in
your little bit about functional
programming you can jump into this with
all your preconceptions you're looking
at this in the you're saying hey this
just likes a charm it's not pretty sick
yourself it's just like C sharp and you
write these reams of imperative code and
life gets horrible if you ever run into
Adam Greenwich just asking about this
you'll go on for hours stinking in our
lab totally incomprehensible I make
sense to me make sense you're Joe back
there and from others startup appear but
to most refuse totally pointless but
this is just like the APL thing that I
mentioned you see this you don't
understand what's going on so you don't
assume things about it that are not true
or their art or whatever don't make any
assumptions in this case the syntax
matters it tells you a lot about exactly
what's going in there without having you
take me wrong turns the thing is to take
this a step further a lot of what we do
when we speak it's about error
correction this part of the context we
have these syntax being the way it is is
so that you don't make any errors in
interpreting this thing you put here
nothing you will but you could hear it's
much less likely the
is and I keep saying that thing is when
I said natural languages select
programming programming languages
they're not really with a kind of law
from a Chomsky sure to burger
perspective they are but in reality not
so much spoken languages are brilliant
and error correction see that it can
read it it's one of those goofy things
about the way humans read all we care
about is a first letter in the last
letter we don't care about anything
between the two we just have a rough
idea what words are try making a mistake
in syntax in any program that you're
writing you don't even get to a point
where it belongs competitive spits it
out immediately and says hey you know
some tanks that are here the thing about
error still and this has to walk to do
with programming in a moment errors lead
to evolution for those of you may have
attended garrix talk on software is like
biology errors are necessary for an
ecosystem to evolve for systems they're
all four creatures creatures have all
spoken languages are rife with errors
they're all over the place that thing's
a telephone though we know well okay
that is a telephone believe it or not
for those of you who are younger than
whatever that's a telephone the thing my
telephone dealing with the condyle word
for telephonist count as a tough in
language it's not telephone it's
telephone knew about a hundred something
all years ago people in
that state basically said screw it were
not making up words because they make up
words for different terms when they
showed up it was just like in any other
language and different people that have
different words with same thing it was
getting incredibly complicated so they
just started speaking used at end of
everything seriously telefonu a point to
room I bet would be called a point to
move even to the point now where even
words that have words in Canada you can
perfectly you can express perfectly well
by seeing you at end of it a very common
verbal tic in Canada is now verb model M
a deal which roughly translates to verb
the noun so for example a computer on
model turn on computer light off Marty
turn off the light but the weird thing
is the people that I've said this don't
go to shine English I'm seriously my
wife was in where was she small town in
the middle of karnataka state in south
of India never know where checks in to
the hotel the room is dead cold she
looks around she can't find the air
conditioner thermostat so there's a
bellhop doodles in there and she says
hey how do i turn off the air
conditioner and the guy goes so she
tries a couple of variations and gets
absolutely that and she says and i quote
air conditioner off Martin and the guy
goes oh ok he goes and turns it off and
the kid mr. Cates with the syntax
matters she had put it in that
particular sequence room to the oh she's
speaking Canada I understand her but if
she said turn off the air conditioner
you slow I have no idea to say god
forbid she said how do i turn off the
air conditioner which to him sounded
like blah blah blah air conditioner
syntax matters the way structure the
things matter it causes that causes
languages to evolve you now have this
entire thing now for volume that never
existed the Canada more than our years
ago now exists it's part of language the
goofy thing about this is this applies
to programming languages to evolution
exists everywhere I'm pretty August of
java version 1 2 3 4 5 6 to keep
throwing more stuff in the kitchen sink
and God knows what into Java it's
evolving same with any other language
pick a language it's got new stuff in it
there's like 47 versions of haskell for
crying out though II just brilliant but
he just kind of like quasi fountain to
the other one pretty exists in its wake
do we do a programming language though
is they evolved very slowly because they
don't accept errors in syntax the only
accept errors in requirements which is I
guess a good thing but still except for
one variation thereof scripting
languages pearl is probably what what
used to be one of the most dynamic
languages out there for two reasons one
is when people added stuff to pearl they
invariably screw something up oh it's
awesome you see any pearls back and you
wait your way through it and there's
like 47 error conditions and edge cases
in everybody knows what they are she's
crazy it's a wonderful language in that
sense but part of it is also because
pearl is very pragmatic I mean it's you
do it use it to do things now what
immediately now not some time later what
you can use it for just a bit
complicated date but the vast majority
the use cases are do something now
dublin that careful world ever show up
how to show up you features creep in but
they all tend to be very pragmatic and
scripting languages evolve so in the end
syntax matters or maybe does it I know
kind of going back and forth on this day
but the point being syntax matters what
it doesn't doesn't matter what it
doesn't but the one thing I can pretty
much guarantee you is complaining about
syntax is a pretty stupid it's a
language the syntax is part of the
language you can't look at the syntax
and go that's wrong that's the wrong way
it should be that way seriously it
should really not be that way that is
the worst possible thing English CU t
cut b ut but PT portal what why is it
not beauty puppy nobody sits there going
but that's why I refuse to accept this
you just go ahead and stupid it's
English but oh god forbid there's a
semicolon to edit at the end of the
statement o heart who cares put the
semicolon there it's a language just
move on Charles good entertainment but
the point is if you ever find yourself
trolling well okay if I start rolling
because you wanted to troll rock on but
if you're trolling because you mean it
you know it's like oh god no this I
can't believe you have like a fondant
beginning and end at the end how come
there's no end farm what function
matalan and fun who made you God there's
somebody out there said yeah great it's
fun it ends with any
I don't know it seemed that good at your
point cool move with it begins event
doesn't mean nothing else can happen
right it's a language it's the actual
specifications and the syntax is
probably the least important thing about
it what's important is the concepts that
that's in types of use to express just
look at the text that he put down there
and just go ahead and just the way that
it's expressed if you ever wonder why
it's a particular oh by the way if
something is remarkably stupid that's
okay to just say to yourself see you tea
cup beauty but pinky put and move on
nice yeah it's stupid I don't care I'm
just using it the kind of wraps up when
you're looking at this when you're
looking at a piece of syntax really
looking at a troll or a flame or
something ask yourself well don't ask
yourself on but when you're looking at
any kind of discussion or question or
commentary or anything about the syntax
used in a discussion ask yourself the
following more the parties to the
conversation because remember this is a
communication right any conversation has
two parties unless you're talking to an
irredeemable narcissist can have two
people personally prefer to person B to
be told you're proud or a bunch of
people talk to each other to become to a
computer but at the end of the day you
are talking to somebody else let's
assume the other party involved here
when you're talking to somebody else the
question is who is the other person
you're talking to so do you pick
something Haskell since I picked her let
me see three hospitals a single
the world that's what you're going to
work it awesome perfect it's got this
elegant syntax in our new stamping
nights well okay sleep mats reading
about this in text whatever it's great
so you're working and everybody's using
node.js what you do when you could say
I'm gonna use hospital and then go for
another job or you know it's like who
care since no okay maybe you do care but
the point is the person of the other end
of the conversation the person that's
using note your company your boss the
paycheck etc they depend want that so
it's something you have to ask yourself
you know what's a point man what I'm
doing just to kind of do a little bit of
a flip side to the Sultan though so you
sit there going hey you know I'm pump
blood I speak many languages I'm great
I'm awesome I use the right tool for the
job any job I used to write tool that's
our casual diners because I'm excellent
at what i do question is what is the job
that you do it seriously who are you
talking to ever the node.js bit why are
you talking to who's the person at the
other end of the tool chain how meses
airy is what is the thing that you're
doing for example suppose we need to
build something that is dead reliable
and just has to work and once you're
done they were walking away they just
need to keep running runner level
seriously right in your leg you're just
run you are don't write it in job it
will just run and then grab something
will do something right but that's not a
knock on job that's just a point about
origin stories of languages for lamb
origin story for power its reliability
several user length you want something
together love you want something that
has a million other developers that can
manage it once you move don't read each
other great perfect little work and
subdial energy for you that's awesome
the point is how necessary is it and one
of the end conditions who are you
talking to your talk to a Java shop
right in Java you're writing your talk
to a visual basic job I mean shop you
know the answer how quickly do you need
it this can go against the other ones so
it's absolutely the right tool for the
job at this particular case would be to
write it in APL choose me right in the
or volcano one that's not make fun fake
do besides I already did my three
references it's a bunch of statistical
stuff you need to write it in our that's
the right tool for the job here you
don't know that's a problem but it's a
right tool for the job right screw that
reading pearl you need it this afternoon
it'll work maybe you'll get done by this
afternoon almost certainly as far as
that doesn't conflict with me how
necessary is it if your crappy pearl is
going to take the back down because he
delivered it as a community broke don't
write any pearl just walk away from the
job but do you know you need to ask
yourself these questions so when
somebody says sin tax matters your ship
type doesn't matter that is really
really not the point because there is no
such thing as correct syntax there is no
such thing as wrong syntax syntax just
is it's a part of the language whatever
the language is that you're using the
point is communication you are trying to
get somebody to understand what you do
it whether that's
computer or somebody else on the other
side or part of your team or whatever
the specifics of the letters and the
terms and the glyphs and whatever you
use to write the application that you're
writing are the least important part of
the thing that you are doing and when I
say the least I do mean a least
important part and there's one thing I'd
like you guys to walk away with from
here it's the furrow in fervent desire
that the next time you see a troll or a
syntax or disimpact sucks kind of thing
you just said delete any move on or you
just you know close the tab whatever it
doesn't matter the troll doesn't matter
the actual syntax matters from the
context of the language that you're
using but there is no correctness
involved with it it's kind of like I'm
actually no there's no point in either
manager just is part of the language
there is no such thing as a good
language or a bad language they're just
languages it's your usage of the
language that is important stick with
that and that's my little rant for today
any questions anybody
so it strikes me the longer more lumens
look at at the end it works for my muse
that already exists and no customers
already using it but there are languages
and development it seems like the
argument put still hold for in terms of
the debate being worthwhile when you're
talking amongst a group where one person
that comes in saying you need to change
this for the syntax and the art is
because need to appeal to this certain
community over here do you have any
comment another person might say no it's
not if it's at foes of me it doesn't
actually match up in our context it
would be a mistake to adopt that so I
was curious your thoughts on whether
it's worth trying resolve those
questions well they were right so the
question is for newly four languages
that are developing when the debate
boils down to something like we need to
change the syntax because of reason x
what does want to do and there's a short
answer in the long answer i'll stick
with short answer here the specific
example given we need to pick syntax x
because it's going to appeal to
community why is almost certainly a bad
idea unless what you're trying to do is
create a language that is going to take
org community one as Creston mentioned
earlier there's a new life airline like
there's this new language for the mixer
that's popping up in the other language
machine which essentially looks like
Ruby and the idea is well not Jose's
point but for a lot of people it's a
wonderful thing because it looks like
movie but you sure thing the fact that
it looks like movie does not mean it is
the fact that looks like for me this
meets anybody comes in thinking it is
Ruby it's going to hit something that is
not going to be so you can end up with
as a system where you got a whole bunch
of people writing Ruby of your language
Russia which is great for Ruby but it's
terrible to be realigned perspective and
by the way when I say relax perspective
I don't be relying the language but I
mean you're like the concept i want to
write reliable stable fault tolerant
systems you're not going to get it
magically writing elixir or robot for
that matter which are struggling up
getting it right in Ruby a slightly
different way of responding to exactly
that point which is to take away the I
want two people that community part of
this is syntax debates from a language
perspective or age-old that always
happened they always will happen people
are still complaining about what is
correct English what's proper english
know the accent you should speak English
it so when we talk about programming
languages the weight thing stick to get
added is over time and I mean seriously
over time the next revision of ruby is
going to contain food but awesome the
next revision that's next year or six
months or whatever fine to connect that
I neither i nor you should actually have
an issue with that should be more than
happy to argue about because that is if
anything I'd say a functional debate as
in these are actual capabilities you
want add the system to me that is more
redolent of the word for telephone in
Carlo I want to see telephone you look
great awesome rock on blue one or
everybody decides that as of tomorrow
every single government document is not
going to say computer it's going to say
what's a French doors in a door or
something like that yeah tour the
network which is awesome made up a word
that says computer it's landed in and to
sheer force of market
Dublin marketing or people marketing you
got into the language party bit for non
answer though it is a bit on topic for
that matter Hodor let's give mine a ship
