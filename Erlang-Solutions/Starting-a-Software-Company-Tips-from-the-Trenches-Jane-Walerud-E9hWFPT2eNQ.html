there would be so much activities going
out on in the gang world today so thank
you and there's reports on the changes
thanks I'm really happy to be here you
happen to be my very favorite people in
the world right if you're the kind of
people very favorite people that's true
people who work with me actually know
that okay but I'm not one of you not
really I'm fat female 50 not very good
at computers really not I have a hard
time printing out Monica asked me to
print something out and bring it this
morning okay to do Orkut
so since I'm not really one of you but I
like you so much
what can I do well I'm actually pretty
useful I make your ideas into reality
okay that's my dog that's what I do over
and over again I'm never the one that
comes with the idea I'm never the one
that builds a product I just build a
company or get whatever it is done it's
a skill - okay it's useful so anyway
I've had three chances in my life of
being in working with people like you
only three one was at Stanford I went
there and became part of the group that
worshiped computers early 80s but then I
graduated and had to get a job who fell
in love with the Sweden moved to Sweden
evolved it so you know that was gone and
over about two years later three years
later and then I found this my my
husband it sold a company and I thought
I didn't want to work so hard anymore
and I was it was in summer Sunday
morning and I read the whole paper you
know
bicha we're ease and the want ads and
everything and found this ad for sales
manager for airline systems and I
thought about it said well you know what
would I really like in a job I want to
work with really good technical people
deep technical competence that's first
and then I'm really tired now because
I've been working like hell that area so
I want something kind of sleepy and slow
thanks and what skills do I have when
I'm on a good technical salesperson or a
reasonable one anyway so I can do that
so I applied for the job and thank
goodness got it and yeah that was number
two two months after I arrived at
airline systems airline Ericsson forbid
the use of airline in its new products
so things got a little bit hairy York in
gray Avenue came up with a very good
product idea which I replied you saying
well who would buy it and why I knew why
would anybody buy the first one and I
was told to go help him so I moved to CS
lab okay okay so once again
Yuki's idea I follow along sure okay who
would buy it why what what does it need
to do not my idea just let's put into a
box hmm okay at CES Labs then who'll
come mill rooked had a really good idea
let's make airline open source and I
said open source what's that you
explained and I said hmm interesting
never heard of that before so he gave me
a paper called the cathedral and the
bazaar I read it and then I read it
again and I read it again okay yeah we
can do this Erickson wanted Airlines
spread okay they'd spent five years with
airline systems trying to get it spread
trying to sell it and ended up how it
was an internal consulting on
organization and nothing else no
external customers if airline wasn't
spread then there was a good chance that
the language would rot that there
wouldn't be enough people using it so it
would be
good career move to use Erickson to you
say I know Lauren Erickson new exciting
things would happen in the world in air
and I wouldn't be part of it right sort
of the rotten people would want to do it
and would be bad for Erickson so they
decided for very good reasons to forbid
the use of any new products extremely
good reasons so it's impossible to sell
something out of Erickson if Erickson
itself refused to use it right
absolutely impossible so what can we do
we can give it away which is open source
right so who decides that and how do I
persuade them and lots of pressure in
the computer science lab group everybody
was very unhappy who were considering
very we were discussing in great detail
how to murder a certain people we had
very I remember Mike said that well this
person has a boat and I would just take
my I've learned how to dive and not tell
anybody about it and then swim under
water with one of these really fancy
things no bubbles behind and put a put
them sort of a limpet mine on the boat
you've seen this in James Bond I'm sure
and I was thinking of a bunch of bloody
or things but yeah we found out who
would decide this and okay started to
persuade a star to persuade and
Erickson's management was saying well
you know maybe but geez what about
patents what if we're infringing
somebody's patents we have no idea oh my
god so I went back to serious lab and
gathered the game and I remember this
clearly a whole bunch of people staring
at me saying write and how likely is it
that this will happen that's at all
about 60% but if we don't get the
patterns fixed then it won't happen
that's for sure
so Clark and Joel well look at the paths
and did what was necessary I can't do
that right I have no idea about all that
stuff but they did and they fixed it and
it was done and in December of was a 98
we got Ericsson we got air long as open
source it was amazing
most of us didn't believe would actually
stay open source so yes Joe that's true
we a lot of people set up not me because
I can't do that set up by copy so the
instant the second that it was put out
open source with the right license they
copied it into their own machines and
they got a copy with the right license
on okay it was a big deal so Ericsson
wanted Airlines sold they employ they
employed me for the project of getting
Airlines spread they didn't really care
about the money involved in airline they
wanted Airlines spread far enough so
that Ericsson could continue to use it
or start to use it again that's worked
okay it's worked and I'm judging by
those curves that Barry Briana was
saying back there era Lange has been
growing people will be coming and it's
really working okay be honest said
something which was also one of those
ideas okay remember I don't have the
ideas it's really too bad I wish I did
but I don't
Your Honor I said you know the owners
only really to steady states for Eric so
for for airline it's either a secret
weapon for Ericsson which will allow
Ericsson to develop software products
reliable software products that nobody
else will be able to do or it's spread
over the world and everybody uses it and
knows it is a proprietary liable systems
in between there there's an opportunity
hmm okay I better get back to be my
being a kind of a strange character when
I was visiting CS labs for the first
time I was for some extremely good
reason wearing a skirted suit in heels I
don't generally wear that but I was
wearing as goods which was a terrible
mistake and while walking on a talking
on a mobile phone walking down the
corridor to find my new room which was
going to be beside be honest and not
many people were wearing hard-soled
shoes and as he is though certainly not
high-heeled
so they came out a few heads poking out
of the rooms behind me and who's that I
hear this clearly and and then I hear
and I know exactly who said this what
can I say exactly who said who's that
she's gonna work here
no yeah she'll never fit in and I made
sure I wouldn't because I have trouble
with computers and I couldn't get
anything printed out for three months
and nobody would help me okay
this is what's known as mobbing guys
you're not forgiven but I and I learned
how to read lots of long documents on
the screen like this are right so I
don't fit in I know it all right but I
do like you and I do make useful things
out of it but I'm a strange character
and can't get the damn printer to work
now yeah another thing about being a
strange character last time I was here
over and oh in the center of the city I
guess it was I appeared for dinner and
sat down at some table near in the table
sort of who split into two groups one
whom I knew and one him I didn't and the
ones who I knew were in some lively
conversation about something I didn't
understand at all and the other ones
looked at me and said this woman looks
probably homeless she's here for a free
meal can we help you who are you and I
replied well who are you the recognize
you
well we do this and out in the other for
this project I said oh that's good who
are you
and they looked like and then looked
over at the other people on the table
and I think was cocky said oh okay well
yeah I know can I get you some salad
right fine I was allowed to have dinner
but yeah I do look really weird here
so yeah I make ideas into reality it's a
different skill set than many of you do
I mean you guys make out your ideas into
reality by building
products usually I make them into
companies or persuade them through
management or something like that get
money for them that sort of thing and
humans who specialized right that's why
we've overrun the planet were
specialized we need to have a set of
different skills and if you've got too
many one kind and not enough for the
other things don't work so well you
wouldn't believe the number of companies
I've seen who have nobody like you in
them and think they're gonna manage they
won't just oh okay so this idea about
airline an open source whole convoluted
ard at least he was the one who
persuaded me about it you know do this
what's the hot ok here anymore
good idea right ok let's plan it mm-hmm
yeah it's gonna work and get it done and
then all of them lost patience as the
Ericsson as it took a while to persuade
Ericsson managed to take such a very
momentous decision it's a big decision
ok and it took a while and people were
very frustrated and started to fantasize
about wording people write this Ericsson
is a secret weapon in a mirror light of
the secret weapons and that was very
important at the time
ok Joe Armstrong said something at the
time as well they are putting in
tolerable pressure on a bunch of very
smart people and they think we're going
to be crushed we won't we're gonna shoot
out the side you know what we did we
shot out the side this was a group
called Bluto okay blue tails team was
formed in the worst possible manitou
manner absolutely terrible none of the
guys accepted me and I wasn't a guy had
ever met a customer most of them had no
but no buttons on any shirts they owned
generally wore socks with her sandals
and were perfectly lovely people and
could do miracles right so I was the
only one who knew anything about money
or sales or customers or anything like
that and I said and I was going they
said let's start a company alone do you
realize how much work it is
well and and and I thought I came up
with a wonderful the way to kill all
possibilities of making a company we
have to have a business idea first
because nobody ever has a business idea
right it's just these things are like
golden eggs they're goose legs they just
don't exist so I thought that this is a
way to keep them quiet for the next 10
years or so then they'll come up with
something about it you know open a
hairdresser so they said oh that's no I
know calm at all no well we have lots of
business ideas we've been sort of saving
the moans we sent on postcards to her to
each other so that somebody hoping
somebody will read them on the way and
do something with them truth this is
what people said okay so I said oh let's
meet at I think it was at Joe's place in
a week and we'll go through them Yeah
right sure
oh I'll be at Joe's place in a week not
a problem better huh we had 42 business
ideas it was amazing okay so what do you
do with 42 business ideas and this is
part of what okay so what do you do you
say we've got to choose well what do we
want in a business idea well we were all
employed at Erickson time so the first
thing was Erickson shouldn't get
completely crazily mad at us with this
business idea so that cut off about half
of it right next one right well we're
young and new when a start-up and if we
can think of a competitor to the idea
right now without doing any research
then the market is already established
there's already a leader we're too late
if you can't think of them right away
then there's probably still a chance but
if you can think of them right away
giving you how 42 that's you know throw
those away
okay still a bunch of thought I forget
exactly how many let's call it I said
well right I mean the only salesperson
around here and I only do business to
business sales well I can do business so
nowadays I can do business consumer but
back there
really couldn't all right so it has to
be business to business no business to
compute and consumer ideas besides
they're expensive when you have to
market to consumers you have to spend
lots of money because you have to get
message into lots of people's brains in
this heart okay so half of its around
half of them disappeared then and then
okay and we want a product idea where we
can have sell a new product to the same
customer over and over again so you can
have a seller suite of products the same
customers over time we had two ideas
left and we voted and it turned into
clustering on the Internet basically it
worked really well in some ways we sold
it for one hundred and fifty million
dollars after eighteen months which is
good
however okay what's wrong with it twelve
founders eleven incredible techies in me
it's a little bit unbalanced slightly so
you need to it's really wrong when you
do building a team you generally want to
have even power between the numbers of
people amount of intelligence amount of
drive between the technical side and the
commercial side just about even if you
employ new techy really ought to employ
a new salesperson right not even so
twelve to one wasn't even and it became
quite clear that we weren't making
enough sales we made very little sales
in that boot sales history and we could
develop incredible amounts of products
very quickly so we made a deal with a
company to develop a product for them
while I was trying to sell their I now
know ease and a couple more we're trying
to sell what we had to ISPs and that's
where we sold the company was to the
people who did the OEM product and then
they threw out the those of us who were
not techy quite quickly right so Eric's
are not mad at us not too much
competition yet right
the right kind of business the kind of
business what I was going to need I
needed to have them help me sell and the
only way somebody like the only way
anybody who was involved in blue tail
was gonna be able to help sell was if
it's gonna be a deeply techy cell where
people love deeply techie people and
really loves gurus if you're looking for
somebody writing you know with with
fashion or whatever it's not gonna work
right so you look at what the group you
have you say okay well what can we
actually do
looks like deep techie sales is probably
something with reliable systems mmm more
and then you say well maybe this idea
here maybe clustering right and what
news what more skills do we need and
let's bring that person in I think about
who we could possibly bring and you
start building the idea and the group
and sort of a iterative process until
you get down to usually about even
numbers of commercial and all and an
techy people usually an idea that has
various different it's about it that are
really good and then you go for it it's
not really all that difficult and you
can get to that point within about a day
or two once you have the idea of course
I never had the idea but Joe had 42
where the gang had 42 right about the
team building if you clarinha who's all
over the place here once upon a time I
was invited to a I was an investor at
the time after Peter I was invited to a
Christmas party December 2004 at the
incubator at Hondo's the school head
says Stockholm School of Economics and I
was getting had or they want to go well
Engel is there and it's always fun to
drink lots of wine with Engler so I went
there founding a lot and was on my third
glass of wine I believe maybe fourth
when the evening's entertainment came up
which was all the little companies that
were in that in Turkey bata we're gonna
make a little presentation and there was
some blonde guy talking about a building
system for the not hey no that's a good
idea in English entrepreneurship watches
put down my glass of wine and go find
that guy okay and I want I didn't
recognize him
so the guy that I did know who invited
me there said I said who's the guy with
the billing system and he said oh that
one over there to not be not the one had
presented who turned out the sir burn
Nicholas had presented and said but I
didn't know that so Thomas bomb God and
asked him a few more questions and drunk
as I was within about it and it got
really loud there so we went over by the
where the coats were hanging okay okay
right I'll do this so within an hour we
decided on doing a deal together because
I knew what technology cuz Karnas idea
fit airline I knew that there are people
really good people in airline they've
had extra time and they need a little
money and that I could give them and I
knew how to start companies and they
were really three really really good
business people so we had a good strong
group of business people to match the
good strong go perfect Eddie's already
for the beginning so that was really
good was all decided was in about an
hour on the way away from there I think
I called you one baby Mir he said I've
got it I've got it I've got the new one
by I think April we had then that the
first customer in that was pretty
amazing that was you want behave Emir
marked in Kirkland you could have in a
truck or an Hawk and they looked good
that pretty damn amazing so what was
good about karna what made me go wow
that's perfect well first of all I've
been looking for an airline based idea
in order to be able to work with people
like you again and on it for a while
second of all it had a lot of good high
margins okay so if you make if you have
good margins then you can make a mistake
and you're not dead if you have low
margins and you make a mistake you're
either data you're talking to VCS again
I've done that in Ellen which is a
probiotic company that we had to low
margins and it was a constant fight for
money because we couldn't in the star
you know he'd make a mistake and there'd
be a problem in production or something
in it all the money would be gone
immediately right
whereas in Kona the the the margins were
pretty high okay very high for another
thing about it was okay was
business-to-consumer but their sales
process was business-to-business which I
can understand okay this is good it was
a pretty clear value proposition if you
put this into your website you will sell
more you will sell 30% more which is a
and then the business the the eShop
itself can decide okay well if I sell
30% more than it's worth quite a bit and
they didn't charge much it was still
high margin so this was a very clear
value proposition and in addition it
didn't require behavioural changes from
people like me I know how to pay a bill
I'm a little bit leery of waiving my
mobile phone near some terminal and
having money deducted from my account
because my mobile phone yeah it's mostly
my pocket that not always and so that
there's there's a certain there's a real
attraction in new companies that build
on the same behavior that everybody
already knows okay you don't want to go
in and say that now everybody will
change behavior some people manage that
Facebook is mad at that but most people
can't do that
so after blue-tail what happened there
was a bunch of companies up here
sponsoring this place okay there's
clarinha there's signups there's Taylor
there's coral office there's Ericsson
again right big time Ericsson again
airline consulting airline systems for
your labs I don't know there was some
there they had Kubek there something
that I really didn't recognize right so
huge explosion there's been a deluge an
incredible number of companies started I
think partly because the opportunity
because airline does make it possible to
build reliable systems and also because
enough of us were out there we made
money in
in blue tail and we're out there ready
to start the next company so there are
then blue tails children like Clara and
sign-ups and then right now I'm working
one of bluto's grandchildren called
techno networks because the money from
there actually comes well partly from
signups and people come partly from
setting up so it's actually boot tales
kid kind of fun and there are a lot of
us like that
okay there's a lot of companies out
there so and I think we're all
exploiting the same opportunity that we
can actually we know how to build
reliable you know how to build reliable
systems fairly easily and there's a lot
of systems that really ought to be
reliable so let's do it yeah you build
one thing or the other
right after Bluto for me remember I just
take other people's ideas and make them
reality know what my own right well okay
I'm kicked out of the nice group of you
guys Nortel didn't want me there anymore
because they were they Nortel is a bit
of a problem they had cheated on their
bookkeeping not once but I think twice
or three times and they were had gone
went from Canada's biggest company to
bankrupt pretty quickly but anyway I
started ten more companies ten so I'm on
my tenth no of them for were just
investments where I was maybe on the
board a little bit of those three have
gone badly and I've been very active in
lens way I think many of you know of
loans way contact lenses on the networks
and on the net there that was fun that
was some fifteen percent growth per
month and I was there one day a week so
fifteen to twenty percent so every time
I came I said well hello Dino who was
the entrepreneur is there a crisis yes
there is ok then I go fix like them pact
lenses or whatever it is or hello Daniel
so crisis not at the moment
ok the company is five percent bigger
than it was last week how are you using
your time
is there any chunk of stuff you've been
doing we should employ something for
right it was really fun and within what
was about two years ago went from four
people starving in a basement to fifty
five people and a hundred million and
turnover and ten million on the bottom
line and saw it that was fun but it
wasn't airline and it was not my idea of
course they don't mind we also I did
panopticon which is data visualization
for the finance industry which is going
really well into around 2008 when the
finance industry sort of went wrong and
that was going very well again not you
guys unfortunately I did Ellen which is
probiotics for woman medical technology
when I was v president we listed it
because we needed money they always need
the money right and got a few customers
and starting to spread the probiotic
tampons around the world was it Toby
also somebody else's idea if you look at
a computer screen you can if you Toby's
got cameras and sensors and stuff so
they can tell where you're looking on
the screen and for handicapped people
badly handicapped people if they look at
one space direct one place directed
excuse me my Swedish interfere long
enough that is quick right so you can
have a keyboard up there and click and
actually spell stuff right stuff and get
the computer to type it for you may I
have a hamburger please that sort of
thing you can write your memoirs when
you have motor neuron disease yes it was
a good idea there I did something a
little bit different and went from took
the game from four point six million
euros in turn over the year before I
started to four point six million euros
the quarter I left in two years okay so
again not my idea really good technology
and right so let's just make it company
other
and all right to do this right right now
I'm doing something called tech loan
networks tech note
it's Luke Gore's idea I'm sure some of
you know him Sean Hein is involved I'm
sure some of you know him Tony wrote
vows invite he'll be speaking soon so
it's a bit of airline and it's a lot of
Lisp actually so this purse all most
like you guys and we make mobile
broadband 30% faster and it works does
it accelerate mobile broadband works for
3G LTE WiMAX Wi-Fi manage buffer bloat
it honestly works product works it's
stable it's solid and it takes a while
to persuade telecom operators to buy
stuff from a stupid little startup right
so we now have two references and three
handshake deals and 18 I think it is
trials requested so 18 files request is
a pain means we just spread over the
world no but accelerating and it works
and it's Luke's idea it's a good idea
it's a great idea and I'm happy I have
no this is another one of those gangs
right it's a gang like you guys so I'm
not gonna leave if I could possibly help
it but I'm doing a few things a little
bit better than I did in blue tail I
hope thank god I've learned something
employers we're about evenly balanced
between tech and sales there are nine
sales rep to two internal people who are
mostly sales so that makes 11 and we're
total of 20 right we're almost almost
even a little bit more sales but then
more of the sales people work part-time
so tech love networks I'm having a good
time it's two years I'm having good time
and maybe it'll work so but what the
problem with technical networks is is it
customers okay
when you're building a company if you
can choose it you want to have a fair
number of
there is not too few and too powerful
just a fair number telecom operators it
was a bit of a that's the problem I mean
there were only what 1200 in the world
they're big they're in groups operator
groups and so really not 12 hundreds
more like 400 and that's a bit too few
customers also for a company because
they have more power than you'd like
them but they'll be able to negotiate
better than you mortgage though depress
prices and get things in what it was
better yeah that is Tecla networks
weakness I'd say there really aren't
very many more I've been a start-up
course leader and one of the things
that's really important is to take a
look at that right how many customers do
you have clarinha had a whole bunch of
them we thought there were 2,000 he
shops in Sweden at the time they may be
were are there a lot more customers in
that at the moment I really don't know
how many but lots in each one if you
miss one it isn't deadly if you say the
wrong thing or give them the wrong price
it isn't deadly in in Florida it is
rather bad in tech though because you
don't have don't have enough customers
so clarinha customers marketing to
consumers you have an idea like that
it's expensive I've done it it's usually
the rule is the share of the amount of
money you spent out of the total amount
of money that everybody spends is the
market share you get share of voice is
share of market okay so when you're
competing against a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
it's a bad idea
okay so that was another bad idea with
Ellen we competed basically against
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson so marketing was very
expensive think about it if you're doing
a consumer that maybe social networking
has changed this map I made an
opportunity where it's possibly cheaper
to reach consumers it's possible I lots
of people are betting on it maybe I
don't know but generally no so watch it
on the customers
okay okay another one another mistake
I've made called substitute technology
something coming in that was going to
kill you I had a company we invested in
a company which did casual gaming you're
standing at the bus stop and you're
pretty bored and you bring out your
phone now you do something like sooo
don't go on it for five minutes right
great idea perfect I do it all the time
only I buy my games from the App Store
right we didn't have the App Store this
was started before the App Store but
just before the App Store and well
didn't work very well because operators
don't actually get to sell very many
games to people outside of App Store and
the Android store nowadays may be a
little bit Wilder but there was a period
when nothing was sold outside the app
I'm sorry and that killed this game this
company called technical or telco games
but so timing it was a great idea but we
died same way with panopticon great idea
fantastic technology and we saw the
finance industry and well the fine I was
energy just about died right that bad
Tommy
we had a physics motor for gaming from
mekin where you can you could set
parameters so ok the gravity in my
virtual world is this the friction is
this and the air thickness is this and
then if I then throw a virtual glass of
water against a virtual wall then the
water will spread like this right and
the fabric will flutter behind a person
running like this very cool stuff
extremely cool stuff and used al awful
lot of floating-point calculations you
can imagine so we sold it to somebody
really wanted it which was a
floating-point chip maker stupid very
stupid floating-point chick makers are
basically dead because the people doing
graphics board took over that right and
when you mind making
chip it seems that there's around it if
you make a mistake by making the chip it
takes around 18 months before you can
get the next one wrong go on and 18
months is an eon in the gaining
situation in the gaming industry so we
were there and we had this great cool
technology and we could have sold it to
a graphics card maker or we could sell
it to the chick maker and we sold the
chip maker stupid chip maker went
bankrupt y'all lost money and
unfortunately the competitive the
competitors physics motor won because
they weren't in the part of a bankrupt
company and it's really not as good
technology that's too bad
the best technology doesn't win so that
was substitute technology instead of
needing a chip you can use a whole
graphics card whoops
oops another thing is watch out for the
government okay not necessarily your own
government but somebody's government
Ellen I once again medical technology
medical technology is bloody scary right
because it takes forever to get
something approved and buy that and and
the rivalry is really really strong so
that people will steal patents and steal
computers and and and try to copy stuff
it's really it's tough business and the
regulator's who decided whether what we
did was a medicine or a equivalent to a
band-aid couldn't agree with each other
and so in different countries we had
different regulatory regimes to follow
and the ones who require that would
behave medicine you know that that means
human testing and many many millions in
the world and the ones who thought we
were like a band-aid they were at each
other's throats it was really hard to
find what markets we could get into
where we're safe to so yeah that's
governmental problem that's regulators
at each other's throats making a
difference medical technology is a bit
like that it's not only that there's a
government called China okay
China wants into the solar cell industry
as a matter of fact is basically buying
the solar solar industry at the moment I
have a solar solar company called
midsummer really cool technology what
you do is you use the machines that you
used to use to make CDs and DVDs and
sputter onto them and make them solar
cells a set of CDs it's really good
because you've already followed the
technology curve down to really cheap
for the solar cells right because you
follow them for those CDs so it's really
cheap technology and we're still cheaper
than the Chinese
but those margins I love so much they're
gone it's still profitable but it's not
you know print one and sell it for ten
times what you printed it for right it's
one I print one and sell it put 1.3 5 or
1.5 times what you sold a food which is
not nearly as good okay China's bought
that
China is pushing everybody out of the
solar cell business there are
biotechnology they're investing in
companies they're making sure that
people can sell solar cells for much
less than the production cost in order
to push everybody else out of the
business they're doing the same thing
the mid-semester body okay it's okay
because we're still cheaper than anybody
else China's doing the same thing with
the telecoms industry I hope you know
that okay Nortel is dead that was of
course a bookkeeping problem over five
alcatel-lucent is close to dead motorola
is dead Siemens Nokia Siemens is not
doing well and honestly I'm going out
and talking to numbers and numbers and
numbers of telecom operators I've met
I've talked in detail to let's call it
40 or 50 operators last three months I
have met no one who has any ericsson
equivalent not watch it what they do is
they've bought they put money into who
away and - ZTE and a cash-strapped
operated and they're all cash drop
basically ones I talked to at least get
to have an entire radio network for free
as long as the that operator buys
everything else they need for their
radio network through who away so who
away then knows what's necessary more
than what they already have okay and
then what do they do without knowledge
will they coffee whatever it is that
they would what else is necessary right
so that's pretty scary that's scary for
Tecla networks I think it's pretty scary
for Sweden because of our accent I don't
know that we can actually do much about
it but I think what we can do is try to
pull it together a bit and realize that
the threat is there it's out there it's
big okay
I have not met anybody with any Ericsson
equipment yet - a little over two years
a typo okay the first year I didn't meet
many people but really no go away you're
a bunch of smart people and they have
the government vacuum and China wants
high-tech industry they don't really
bring up the bring themselves up into
the middle-income sector up into the
upper income sector and they would like
solar power and they would like
telecommunications - good choices I've
heard that European operators have
decided to buy enough from Ericsson so
that Ericsson will survive that reminds
me of once upon a time I was at a
company named digital and the big
competitor was company called IBM and
companies decided to buy enough from
digital so that IBM wouldn't be too
uppity Digital is a dad right
very still entry who away is now
building a huge barrier to entry if they
give away a whole radio network and you
can only buy stuff well then it's really
hard for anybody else then who a way to
actually get there right and any new
products that the operators by getting
me that we coffee by whole way it's also
patents
okay now patents have turned into a
horrible thing in this kind of a group
because you see patent trolls everywhere
you see people really misusing them but
without them if you don't have any kind
of a barrier to entry in other words if
you're doing well and somebody says oh
they're doing well let me copy them and
they can easily well they will and the
value of your company goes down and your
jobs disappear generally yeah so it's
pretty necessary to have some kind of a
barrier to enter patents help they're
not perfect because people can right
around them right if you have patterns
you can at least if somebody attacks you
can at least trade right you can use our
patent if we can use your patent they're
our Twitter estar need to do something
where the people who owns a patent can
say that this patent can only be used
defensively not offensively in case it
ends up in the hands of the patent troll
there are things one can do to protect
themselves but it's really a good idea
to have some it's a terrible thing but
you need some barriers to entry in
patents are one of them another one is
brand names it's easier to buy faster
tcp/ip over old mobile broadband from
Eric's and then it is from technical
networks let me tell you it would be
nice to be called Ericsson rather than
technical networks in sales but we're
not customer relations are a big one
people who trust you and say that we
want to buy from you we like you you
trust you your products are good we have
a long relationship we can work with you
if you have a lot of those that's
valuable that's a barrier to entry
because somebody else coming in and
trying to sell to those same people
well me no no we're not really
interested we buy from those people
instead pretty hard to break but I've
noticed in around here this group this
lovely group is that there's speed of
development and sure shear just product
quality
sign-ups is like that I believe all
those times I believe also I was a pound
Bluto was certainly like that we had no
patents because we went it went too fast
we decided rather rather to develop
something really good then to get a
patent right
around here this gang can do that pretty
impressive you're competing against all
the other six billion people or seven
billion people on the planet you can do
it not many people can but it's nice to
have okay you can also have something
called network effects that helps but
that's only when you're huge that's what
killed really the caracal gaming company
is that it was so much easier every
buddy was in the App Store and then why
do I do anything else so barriers to
entry help and then another thing I did
absolutely wrong well as we do the cell
to the right people selling companies to
the right people is a really important
thing okay and some of you will have
already sold companies and others
haven't but please check okay we thought
we were selling to Alti on the web
systems which was again their people we
knew and sort of trust it okay well at
the time they were selling themselves to
Nortel which was a gang people we
neither knew but sort of trusted cuz
they were sort of like Ericsson like
well we shouldn't have nor teller was a
bunch well the top management of Norton
was perfectly awful yeah too bad I
didn't get to stay around
I lost my game of you a gia the this
company that we sold the vi thing also
terrible idea they went bankrupt take a
look at their books take a look at their
idea see if the company you're selling
yourself to is actually worth anything
so we're time if you say and you also
say look at the entrepreneurial gang and
see if it's works coastal contracts we
sold man suede is something called
Coastal Contacts it worked not at all
why did we sell then sway well there was
no money around but not much so we
needed money because people pay their
bills at the end of the month and lens
we needed to pay it salary on the 25th
of every month and right around the
first of the month we had just
incredible amounts of money that it went
slowly down and it slowly down and then
we needed to pay her own it's always at
that point you did to borrow money and
then it went up again over three days
right and the banks refused to to give
us enough money for that to cover the
25th 26th month so we had to sell okay
we found a partner on the other side of
Atlantic we thought that was a good idea
because opticians who were getting
killed by internet lenses could possibly
get the European Union to regulate so
that you can't sell lenses over the
internet or they could do it in the
United States and Canada were probably
not both at the same time you're
watching out for the government we sort
out the Coast College hacks took all the
money that was made in Europe and spent
it on with certifications and big
conflicts and we tried a man who or then
we try to management buyout back again
and it didn't work
war basically war so I've sold a couple
companies to the right people but not
often doesn't work it's much better to
try to grow yourself honestly okay so
what I'm saying basically as you hear is
it look you can start companies you can
do it you can build a product you have
the idea you probably ought to build a
team around it with about a few of the
commercial people the balance you but
you have ideas you can build products
this is amazing it is absolutely amazing
you can do it and you have obviously you
know the technology which will make your
systems reliable which is also very good
okay well why wouldn't we do this well
maybe you can't find enough commercial
people quite possible nobody in CS lab
would ever met anybody like me before
she will never fit in and I never did
really well they exist there are in
Sweden is talk on entrepreneurial mingle
parties where you've got a bunch of
people with badges on all looking
hungrily for an idea it's true they they
exist there my daughter goes to them
this is people all have a nobody has an
idea and they're all looking at each
other hoping some
you say something there's the Stockholm
School of Economics has something called
there's a Stockholm School of
entrepreneurship okay
those are people from kth and Stockholm
School of Economics and Comstock and
stop news University right almost all
the people there are commercial they
have very few technical people there and
their ideas in general are completely
abysmal they're nothing like yours okay
there let's make another tailored search
on the internet company what is that the
thousand twelve hundred not much fun but
they're there these are people like me
no ideas we can make companies can't
build a product no ideas but hmm can do
stuff okay so you can get commercial
people the commercial people sometimes
come to me say how do I meet people that
are really techie and I said oh lucky
what are the places that they go like
and drink beer that I can go there and
like find them I don't think so there's
hang gliding I suppose you can do that
right but so if you could find out if
you can tell me where groups have you
gather I will tell the commercial people
where to go and try to pick you up
another projection is the best product
never wins and as always the bad guys
who win and commercial people are
nothing not to be trusted well yeah okay
in the same way that I can smell
nowadays not smell but I can feel that
who is a really good techie a little bit
at least I have some feel for it not
much but some many of you probably have
no idea what a good commercial person
feels like right get references personal
references because the way a good tech
is a good technique they can build
products right and have good ideas the
way a good commercial person is a good
commercial
persons that they build companies well
that are profitable generally and we're
the techies get a fair share of the
company and nobody gets cheated okay a
lot of commercial people are out there
to cheat saying whether an awful lot of
web programmers out there okay they're
bad serve everybody everything okay but
you take references right another
objection is all these startups they
fail right Jane you've been so damn
lucky out of your eleven five of world
class companies and three we don't know
yet they're probably pretty good okay
three failures so far that's amazing
you're so lucky you're so amazing I'm
not okay I'm not it's never my idea your
ideas are just as good as the ones that
mine aren't okay it's not that you can
also think about what the definition of
a failure is for a venture capital
perspective it's a failure if it doesn't
make around 110 to 100 times the money
in around ten years okay well I think
that's a screaming success that's maybe
clora right but you don't have to be
clora not to have a successful company
if you're looking for building
interesting stuff and having customers
you really like and making a good income
and being able to afford a summer place
and feeling secure and having a good
retirement and maybe having a company if
I don't know 30 40 50 people that to me
sounds like a roaring success maybe not
out of a VC but it is a success it is a
good life people who have companies that
are fairly small tend to be in general
there's good research so aniseh tend to
be in general happier than people who
don't
okay it's a matter of happiness life
quality and yes it works it's not
impossible and especially not for you
guys okay really not think about it
another thing probably thing cuz it's
too much bloody work and it is it is
great on two years a little bit over two
years in a tech low and I'm tired I'm
always tired about two years in around
about three years in I generally I hope
not this time but I'm generally out and
then I'd say I'm gonna go and pension
I'm gonna be retired now this is it this
is if I want to be I'm gonna take care
of dogs and how the honey bees and
nothing else I never do but this is
always my dream why do I feel that way
because it's so damn much work it's
really is a lot of overtime for about
two years
get going three maybe okay right how
many of you actually work overtime today
I would say most of you do right yeah so
you'd work for yourself instead or for
your group basically you for your team
yeah yeah it's a lot of work if you if
you actually are one of these people
like many people I know who really can't
do a lot of work over a couple of years
to a marathon like that then no maybe
you shouldn't but then I don't think
you'd be here because learning airline
and coming here that requires that
you've actually spent a fair amount of
your free time learning something very
difficult not just watching TV so you
actually are capable of this if you want
to all of you another objection we
really it's better to launch through big
companies and it is if you have a
product that you can get and you can
build it in Ericsson and Ericsson put
can push it out that's lovely and you
can do it and Ericsson can generally
push it out it's perfect
it's just that big companies also need
to focus I believe that koruna at this
moment has three products okay
billing an account and this new kind of
billing thing three it's been seven
years three products right fawni isn't a
very big company three is pretty many
big companies need to focus so you'll
often not get space for your idea in a
big company they won't want to do that
because really their strategy is to do
solar cells and they're not going to do
solar cells that are they're only gonna
do solar cells that make power they're
not going to do ones that do thermal
heating you know just know that's not
our strategy we won't do that and you
have this wonderful idea you're not
going to get it out there so you have a
wonderful idea that you really care
about and it doesn't fit into the
company you're working at strategy it's
not going to happen there so what you're
gonna do with it send it on a postcard
to your friends very frustrating that
was amazing good another thing is that
there is a belief that if you are loyal
to your employer your lor employer will
be loyal to you yeah exactly it doesn't
exactly work anymore but it was that way
maybe 30 40 years ago right and if and
big companies would reasonably offer
more loyalty and then lower those small
ones I don't find that to be the case to
put it mildly okay I find that if you're
a group of six and or 10 or 12 or 20 or
luck Varitek the right now we know
everything we know that Alex's birthday
is next week kid Alex right Sean's son
um there we know an awful lot of stuff
about each other and we know that Jane
is for instance having a speech here so
not gonna not gonna call Jane today we
know about each other we care about each
other we know who's dog is sick we know
who's gonna who's thinking about a puppy
who's got hamster you know everything
and we care about it right we know that
you who was up late last night so don't
use having a nap don't wake them up it's
okay we'll fix that's loyalty right I
haven't noticed that and the bigger
companies I've worked for they're kind
of really caring about each other groups
unless the group has been like the CS
lab where it's been steady for quite a
while
and often they aren't in the big
companies so that's another reason you
can't expect is there there's problem
with financing right how the hell am I
gonna get started I have no money or you
know you have no money or you don't you
need to get something working in order
to sell the first time and it's just a
there's a problem with starting right
well first of all you all have an
incredible advantage because you're
doing software you don't need to build a
factory you don't need to buy a shop you
don't need to buy inventory you just
need to sit down and program something
right you read on what it is and sit
under so that's a very cheap way of
starting very cheap so you've got an
amazing advantage there the other thing
is that Sweden is actually number three
in the world and amount of venture
capital there is available per capita
first comes the states then comes Israel
then comes Sweden actually there is
money out there less than there was it's
hard to get but it's there people
actually come to Sweden and try to pick
up entrepreneurial companies find them
however they can't find you guys so they
have the same problem they're commercial
and they don't know where to find you
not really but they're there it's it's
not easy but thank goodness your ideas
don't generally require a huge amount of
money to start them when you have
something is starting to roll then it's
easy to get mine so financing yeah it's
a problem but it's not that bad mm-hmm
all right so what I guess I really want
to say anymore and I've said because
I've done this now 11 times you can do
it you have the ideas you can throw the
products you have the skills you've got
skills that other people are just dying
to meet you as the rolling rolling stone
so I thought I'd come punch a quarter
you can girls are just dying to meet you
well I've got a bunch of commercial
people who are just dying to meet you
there is that there is the possibility
of building your team
and you know having company it's a
it's like having a baby sort of oh you
care about it you think about it you say
oh maybe I should do this and what's
going on it's really a lot of fun it's
not hard it's not hard and work than you
already do and it can be quite
profitable um I'd say fair a number of
us in this room can say that yeah it's
profitable it works you can do it that's
really what I want to say about how to
do this please do it okay it would be so
much fun to have a line be part of even
more startups have a gang more and more
of you become independently wealthy it's
fun why not go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
