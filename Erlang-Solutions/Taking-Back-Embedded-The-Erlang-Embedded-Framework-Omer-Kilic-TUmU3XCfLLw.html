I'm an embedded systems engineer at the
Erlang solutions I'm part of the Erlang
embedded project which is a
collaboration between university of kent
in england and lange solutions also in
England we're looking at ways of
adopting well help speed the adoption of
Erlang in embedded systems and we've
been playing with low-level interfaces
and stuff which I'll be talking about
today so the idea behind well let's
start with the outline we're going to
look at the current state of the
embedded systems and then we'll look at
all angle skip this really quickly
because we all know where line and I'll
focus particularly on the actor model
and talk a bit about why we think it
makes Erlang a great fit for the
embedded systems of main and then we'll
talk a bit about how we model and
developer line systems embedded Erlang
systems bit about the project and some
fun stuff that we've been playing with
unfortunately the term embedded systems
is a bit like the term cloud these days
it can mean pretty much anything and
everything but traditional definition of
embedded systems is a particular system
that's designed to do very specific
feature functions and features that are
very limited so going by that definition
you could say that you know an old
mobile phone was an embedded system
because it could only call make calls
and send smss etc but if you look at a
modern embedded sorry modern mobile
phone it's more like a general-purpose
computer you can play Angry Birds and
check emails in it and stuff like that
so that kind of goes against the
definition of the term embedded systems
but i think it's it's a better idea to
just think of embedded systems as small
devices that run processes that are not
say x86 or desktop desktop or server
class processes I'm talking about are
more mips based devices basically so
embedded systems are getting more and
more complicated and we're utilizing the
system-on-chips platforms that are
becoming larger more complicated and
very difficult to manage with the
current tool chains and methodologies
that we have in the embedded domain and
we also have this beautiful term called
the Internet of Things which practically
means everything is becoming connected
and distributed there are some fun
examples of that I'll talk about in a
minute and then we're seeing more and
more multi-core devices that really is
not fun to program using the standard
tool change that we have in a mad world
and we also see lots of coprocessors
being bolted onto our little CPU cores
to do specific processing tasks it's an
exciting time to be a hardware engineer
or an embedded designer because we have
some very interesting stuff happening
like the rapid prototyping 3d printers
and putting stuff on Kickstarter and
getting community funding for it etc so
really there are all these combined make
designing contemporary embedded systems
or the future embedded device is really
difficult let's look at the Internet of
Things it's unfortunately you can't
really see anything with this but this
is just to show you the scale of
distribution of embedded systems in our
world so we have buildings IT network
retail transportation industrial it's
everywhere there are predictions that we
will have 50 billion devices in a couple
of years time more devices then there
are humans around and if you look around
you'll see people with tablets mobile
phones 3g enabled Kindles and it's there
just too many of these devices and
managing the distribution of these and
the context that they act in etc it's if
it's becoming really difficult and are
some words
it's actually getting a bit ridiculous
as well so we have fridges that can
tweet or you can upload your pictures to
your fridge apparently who would want to
do that I have no idea or we have
distributed bovine networks where you
implement senses to cow and cattle and
all sorts of animals so the applications
are not just based around our homes or
server rooms or they're everywhere
they're inside living creatures as well
which is quite scary and there are also
enabling factors that make developing
embedded systems quite easy the first
one is the Raspberry Pi it's a small
little embedded Linux board that is
extremely accessible very very
affordable and the greatest thing
perhaps is the buzz around it and the
number of exciting projects that's
coming out and enabling other people to
get ideas and merge them with their own
ideas and create awesome things up until
a couple of years ago getting started
with embedded Linux development has been
extremely painful and very very
expensive now you can just buy one of
these boards for not very much money at
all and then if it breaks you don't feel
bad so my computer just exploded sorry
and if you want to develop a custom
product now you can just buy a 3d
printer and then design your own
enclosure or mechanical pieces or
glasses in this case and building a
product is not it does not require a
room full of engineers it's responsible
something just using your desktop
manufacturing capabilities you can take
an idea from you know the very idea
phase to the actual execution of a
prototype device very very easily going
back to the complexity of the devices
that we deal with
this is what a general-purpose
system-on-chip device looks like in
terms of functionality there are loads
and loads of things happening there
different cores of processors so you
have cpu cores GPU cores DSPs ISPs I
squared C interfaces everywhere and all
these different devices connected etc if
you consider that the main tool or the
main language that we use an embedded
world today see you can see how managing
all these things concurrently or
juggling interrupts etc as can be quite
painful this is just another example
just to show that you know all these
devices have this complexity built into
them it's it's yeah we need a new way of
thinking about how we architect these
systems to back that claim up about see
this is a recent graph that I pulled
from a website that shows that the
prevalent or the dominant language in
embedded systems the last year was C and
funny enough the trend line is
increasing so we're going to perhaps get
more and more see and there's nothing
inherently wrong with see it's just not
the right tool to deal with the modern
problems that we have like concurrency
or distribution these things are better
handled with higher level frameworks or
higher level tools and that's what I'm
going to talk about in a minute when i
get to the alignment so how we actually
architect these embedded devices how
what are the methodologies that we use
so three approaches you can I to do a
bare metal programming it means that
there is no operating system you just
write really low level code and write
your own handcrafted interrupt service
routine etc this is not very realistic
for you a moderate complexity device
because you need to write a lot of very
fine-tuned very low level code and
generally this is only viable if you are
producing something
extremely specific or niche and you need
the speed by by ditching the operating
system you get extra speed obviously the
second column one I think is the RTOS
the real-time operating systems this is
a very minimal operating system that
gives you certain primitives that you
can build applications with and there
are some parallels between our TOS world
and Erlang which I'll mention in a
minute the third one and I think the
most popular one today is the embedded
Linux which is essentially Linux but
smaller and with some interfaces
external interfaces that will let you
talk to hardware etc for the project
we're only interested in the RTOS and
embedded linux class device devices
because we don't we can't run Erlang on
bare metal yet so in an RTS you get the
notion of tasks akin to our line
processes and then they the operating
system itself gives you primitives or
the facilities to do some messaging
between these tasks I do this shared
memory hardware can be quite dangerous
if it's not managed properly so you also
get mutexes some forest locks facilities
that will let you do safe control of
hardware and the operating system also
provides some scheduling as well if we
look at embedded Linux it's again you
know linux but smaller but when you go
from an arduous and embedded Linux there
a certain mismatches in the
methodologies that you are used to and
also accessing device drivers etc or
accessing devices while a device drivers
it's quite messy so we are trying to
look at ways people architect them
better systems using our TOS is embedded
Linux and then upload the features or
the the bits that make more sense in
higher-level languages to ER line well
still keeping the lowest level
interfaces and C or any other language
that you might want to use so just to
repeat myself we are not trying to
replace see we're just trying to make
things much easier by using Erlang to
deal with the higher level complexities
of the system so we all know Erlang is a
declarative functional concurrent I'm
not going to read this all there are
some very relevant features that make
Erlang a great tool for metod systems it
feels kind of weird when I have Joe and
drove it in the audience to talk about
Erlang so I'm going to skip these slides
quite quickly so one interesting thing
about Erlang is that I I think it's fair
to say that it was originally designed
for embedded systems telephony switches
are by the definition of the term
embedded systems embedded systems so
they were managing calls using external
links and because of this because of
this legacy Erlang has great facilities
to talk to external bits of code or
external hardware wire external drivers
etc it's one thing that's crucial in
embedded systems is that you need to be
able to recover from error conditions or
failures and I lying again does provide
great tools to create robust systems and
it also implements the actor model which
lends itself very well to abstracting
silicon so silicon by its nature runs in
parallel so each individual function
that you have on your system on chip
device is independent from the rest of
the system you do have to from time to
time communicate between those blocks
essentially but really you can architect
or model your system on chip system
using a set of Berlin processes actors
really nicely we talked about this
just second ago but fault tolerance and
being able to recover from a failure
condition is absolutely crucial in
embedded systems and again because of
the history of being you having to
control external devices Erlang has
great facilities to deal with this
problem in which you can have nifs or
you can have ports and this is crucial
when you're trying to control external
hardware so I'm trying to approach this
from a bottom-up sort of level with this
project because I think that if we can
have a fine grain and you know
structured control of the actual
hardware itself then creating
applications on top of a well-managed
system is will become much easier so
when I say you know we have to use we
have to talk to hardware I mean we have
to create sensible driver mechanisms
that will let us control all the little
bits and pieces of functionality that we
have in our system on chip devices so
the actors are great because as I've
mentioned you can think of your little
system-on-chip device as having
independent little blocks that run in
parallel and access great make modeling
the system quite easy because they are
self-contained and there's no shared
state and using actors you can build
very modular systems that you can slot
in into your applications etc so we all
know about these it's they use as
asynchronous message passing this is
again an important feature that can be
used in architecting embedded systems
because most peripherals do communicate
using some form of a serial bus or you
know just a bit banged interface etc and
the ability to queue messages in the
inbox and then deal with it and do some
checks on it etc is a very useful tool
and the fact that actors only have
limited capabilities perhaps is it works
in our advantage as well so they can
either make local decisions change the
internal state spawn new actors to deal
with things or send messages to other
stuff and using these primitives we can
model individual functionality within
our blocks quite nicely and let it fail
is again something that's very relevant
because hardware fails and you know
being able to recover from it is
absolutely crucial again I'm going to
skip these slides because you all know
about these but being able to contain
errors as they happen in our runtime
system is good very very good because
let's say your button driver failed you
don't want your entire embedded system
to fail just because a non-tree well a
small portion of your system has failed
so by using the trap exit flag we can
make sure that the propagation of errors
are contained within individual modules
and do not affect the other parts of the
system so again let's have a look at
this you can see that some of the things
are actually connected together and you
can use a collection of actors to create
subsystems and then use maybe a brain
process to tie everything together this
this almost is replicating the black
black box methodology or even the
hardware description language is that
the hardware guys are used to being able
to just implement small modules and have
a top-level description of your system
with signals connecting things together
is is a very hardware lot it's very
similar to the methodologies that the
hardware guy is used in say the FPGA
world and logic design world and so on
now this sort of fine-grained
abstraction do does have its advantages
and sometimes it's also a curse you can
create shorter modules and you know
depending on how you structure your
system you can maybe we use the little
blocks that you have done and
application code tends to become simpler
because you know you don't have huge
amounts of error checking etc embedded
into modules and testing is an
interesting feature because Jen
traditionally embedded systems require a
lot of testing and they have to go
through quite a lot of certification
stuff if they're going to be ever used
in SE military or medical sectors and so
on so this this is a double-edged sword
if you can actually do some quite cool
things just using very very fine grain
Erlang actors or it may just become too
difficult especially if you're working
as a team and the actor model itself has
no inheritance or general hierarchy but
luckily OTP does give us the sort of
primitives to structure things sensibly
and for certain embedded applications
the async message passing can be a bit
of a problem before ninety-five percent
of the stuff it's it's okay so with all
things considered we think airline is a
great forcus traitor of systems so using
your language the systems language does
make sense and that's why we're trying
to develop libraries and tools to
control hardware and to demonstrate that
you know you can't afford to run a
higher level to to manage to manage the
complexities of the embedded systems
okay let's let's talk about Hardware a
little bit on a traditional embedded
Linux system you have two methods of
accessing hardware you cannot because
these peripherals are generally actually
most of the time memory mapped you can
just open dev mem but there's I mean
this is I mean I'm sure you
done it before in your first computers
when you're learning how to program etc
writing directly to the screen maybe etc
but the problem is this is potentially
very dangerous if you do some dodgy
pointer arithmetic you may actually
destroy your system by twiddling some
bits in a power management unit or
something along the lines of that so the
other safer and more same method of
doing this is why I using kernel modules
and generally the kernel modules for
embedded protocols are Hardware tend to
expose sisyphus entries that you can
interact with just like normal files but
if you were to just say I'll write
everything in Erlang you don't have to
dive in to see and pointers and that
sort of stuff as an example I'll show
you a little gpio driver that we have a
GPIO is a general-purpose i/o device
which is essentially a pin that can be
an input or an output so before we can
use a pin we have to initialize it by a
pin and Direction variables and the way
we do it is very simple we just open
this class GPO export make sure that all
the entries are created and then we just
write the direction of the pin that we
want to use it as these are there are
two options it's either in or out and
then we have a file descriptor that we
use to talk to the pin afterwards if you
have a raspberry pi or a BeagleBone if
you actually run this you'll be able to
control leds and stuff and writing to it
is just a simple case of rewinding the
file and sending one or zero to it and
reading it exactly the same it's just
the other direction of course and you
can also release the pin after you're
done with it so one of the this is
essentially what your gpio driver can
look like this doesn't work
unfortunately for
or all the cases there are some old
cases where you have to use pole system
calls or select and that sort of stuff
and then you'll have to either use ports
or CC port maybe to prevent your runtime
hanging if you were to use an if but
generally you for simple stuff you don't
even need to go down to sea level to
write your drivers so gpio concurrent
gpio access let's say we have a pin
process that talks to our actual
physical pin 17 we can just use a little
structure where we send messages
directly to it but the problem is
because we may have other processes
sending conflicting things through the
pin this this may cause problems you
don't want to rapidly rights to a pin
conflicting values if it's some
mechanical say DC motor or something you
may actually kill it so having a proxy
process or like a little abstraction is
what we're looking at so this is a very
simple example of course but we can have
a GPA or proxy that can prevent pin
clashing pin states and we can also
implement all sorts of different things
to it like like detecting the toggling
rate if it's dangerous slowing it down
or generating an air conditioned we can
the sequence detection and so on
utilizing the inbox that we have thanks
to the actor model arguably this is just
a look in the tradition no sense of
embedded design but not quite because
you can do some pretty clever stuff with
it as well now we have a little demo I
don't know how well you can see it
because should have been murdered the
video really but just to show you that
this works and it's kind of fun I'm
going to have three LEDs connected to
three different pins
and this is just a simple module that I
have I'm initializing it first one is
connected to 18 so if you can't read
that it says l0l kills LED start 18 21
and 22 here you can see the actual light
emitting diodes I turned one on and then
I made a syntax error I think I turned
the third one on and I'm just going to
have the middle one blinking every half
second while it's doing that I can turn
that one off and then turn it on again
and so on now this is obviously a very
simple demo but the idea of being able
to control hardware separately or
hardware block separately is applicable
to higher level complexities in systems
that we have as well another thing we're
interested in is being able to move our
applications across different platforms
easily so if you think of a hardware
driver and the little application code
that uses it you can divide it into
three different bits the first one is
the component API which is a high level
set of functions that your say little
sensor might I use this the second one
is the peripheral API that actually lets
you talk to the hardware that depending
on which interface it uses and the third
one is the actual driver implementation
itself now the components API in the
peripheral API are actually Universal
they don't change I mean I squared C
buses I squared C boss depending on
which platform or independent of which
platform you use and likewise your
sensor will only have you know a
predefined set of functions on every
platform so by keeping the two layers
the to higher levels Universal we can
move applications between different
platforms easily so an example to this
will be could be a temperature sensor so
the sensor API is going to
b get temperature calibrate maybe
something along the lines of that which
talks to the i squared c bus driver that
implements transactions and that sort of
stuff and then the lower layer can be
Sisyphus entries or i/o control sysctl
or it could just be memory mapped voodoo
so this is the sort of stuff that we are
playing with just an overview of the
embedded or lying embedded project we're
also doing some hardware development to
help people explore things so this
little guy is a nap tur for arduino
shields for the Raspberry Pi it lets you
plug one of the many hundreds of
expansion boards that the Arduino
platform has to the Raspberry Pi to
provide further functionality to your
pie and this one is you might have some
of you might have seen this we use this
in our Raspberry Pi tutorial two days
ago it's a little demo board that pretty
much breaks out all the embedded
protocols that the raspberry pi gpio
expansion hitter has so we have a port
xpander here that has some mixed some
LEDs in some extra switches we have an
spi analog-to-digital converter here a
temperature sensor and a little
potentiometer and some buttons and so on
these are all open source stuff by the
way I really need to update your lying
embedded site but they will be available
they're very very soon the idea behind
this is eventually we will be providing
some modules or documentation that you
can download and follow along to look at
how we can control things come currently
using your line of course you don't have
to build one of these boards we also
provide a simulator again which will be
released soon hopefully so if you don't
have a physical hardware platform you
can use simulated hardware modules and
again experiment with concurrent
hardware access we're also looking at
how we can expand this to
look at expanding project to look at
interesting new and novel architectures
that we have like this pile ella board
level device which utilizes an epiphany
processor that is a very low power
16-core device the each core being a 1
gigahertz risk or and see if we can
offload certain things to to the
coprocessor to speed things up
especially in the areas of it's an image
processing or voice recognition and so
on if you're interested in playing with
this in your Raspberry Pi you can
download Erlang you don't have to
compile it yourself we take care of it
for you just go to the Erlang solutions
packages page or downloads page and
we're also putting together an extended
version of our tutorial session to look
at embedded linux and drivers you
probably don't need our line 101 but if
you're interested in learning more about
how to develop embedded systems using
airline do get in touch so I I think
that's about it actually if you have any
questions or if you have any bits and
pieces that you're not satisfied with
please let me know and I'll try to
rectify it up hey
erlang does not fit on tape it processes
unfortunately no you don't have any
immediate plans to look at minimizing
erlang to run on say cortex m3 or m4
clot and for probably class devices but
that doesn't mean you can't really use
our line in that context as long as you
can make sure your back-end services etc
can accept you know and give me stuff ah
you can run it in much lower memory than
that uh probably 16 megabytes will be
plenty enough yeah I don't think that's
enough of our sunny beam has lots of
POSIX dependencies and you know
generally don't get POSIX compliancy
with a bit systems or small 32-bit
systems as well
original
so I think yeah there has to be a new
implementation I don't see the current
beam being slimmed down to fit onto
those small systems
it's so Robert enjoy seems to be
interested maybe we'll see it happening
yeah I'll remind me to give you more
raspberry pies and stuff as we course it
bribe you with some raspberry PI's say
why not relying on Zen does give us some
ideas as to how to get rid of the actual
userland sort of implementation stuff
and there are some other interesting
things that's happening as well like a
chap has ported or lying to run on a
real-time operating system called
Artemis that's probably more relevant to
the sort of bare metal kind of stuff
that you know or running is on a smaller
scale processor I I haven't seen any
figures on that but I'm fairly sure you
can run it on much slower memory than
say 16 megabytes and in quite small
flash as well so there are some
interesting things happening in that
domain there are a couple of people
trying to run Erlang on what's the
operating system kit so not linux or bsd
but just a sort of very minimal
operating system implementation i can
dig out some links if you want after
ping me and i'll take some things for
you cool
so yeah Robert mentioned that the Erlang
guns n project actually uses beam but
instead of you know they think if i
remember correctly they integrated it
into the colonel so next time yeah so
too yeah okay thank you very much sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
