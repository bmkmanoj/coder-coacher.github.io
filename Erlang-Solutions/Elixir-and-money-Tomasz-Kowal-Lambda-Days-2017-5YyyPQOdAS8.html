would like to say that I really love
programming conferences because there's
so much new information I can learn and
learning is like one of the greatest
feeling and also when you can join the
dots and speakers often provide this
insight that can join information that
was previously distant in my mind it
just helps to form this knowledge but
there's a greater feeling than learning
new stuff and this is unlearning the
stuff that you could wrong and for me I
remember the first time I felt that
feeling was when I was taking the course
on Coursera which was called model
thinking and one of the models they were
presenting with normal distribution and
usually people know what is normal
distribution so if you have some random
data and it follows the distribution you
can calculate the average and standard
deviation and within three standard
deviations from the mean
you get 99% of data points but the
example on the course was about real
world and it was about over booking
flights and when I first heard that I
was like I must have got that wrong how
could you also book a flight if I would
create a database system for flights the
first constraint I would put is there
can't be more bookings than seeds
however it makes sense if you think
about it because let's say we have a
plane with 200 seats and usually about
20 people don't show up and the standard
deviation is 6 so if you over booked 20
minus 3 standard deviations seats which
is in this case 2 there's 99 percent
chance he'll be perfectly fine and in
this one chance in this one flight of
100 the
you will just refund the ticket for for
this poor guy and and the end maybe not
even that poor because he will fly for
free and may even enjoy that so at the
end we sometimes think that our system
needs a constraint but that's not
actually true and there are many such
things both in financial systems and in
elixir so I want to divide my talk into
like two parts the first will be about
properties of financial systems and the
second one will be about properties of
elixir and why does it match this domain
so the first thing and the first
question I would like to answer is our
financial systems a seat or base so
let's define both terms so a seat is
something that we probably all know it's
about databases and basically SQL
databases so a seed stands for atomicity
consistency isolation and durability and
there are two things that I would like
to focus on in this definition so first
thing is consistency and this is the
first definition of consistency today
that any transaction will bring the
database from one valid state to another
so it's only about what is inside the
database so the thing that is inside
must be consistent and must follow some
rules the second thing is isolation and
it says that concurrent execution of
transactions results in a system state
that would be obtained if transactions
were executed sequentially and this
sequentially is a really strong word
here the other definition is that the
transaction will behave as if it is the
only operation being performed upon the
database so let's say we want to
distribute a database that follows those
conditions so we have two nodes and they
need to have the same data so we just
replicate all the data however there are
two processes that write to this
database one of them hits
a second one hits note B and at this
point in time
because the data needs to be seen as
sequential by both processes they need
to communicate but they communicate over
unreliable network so if the network is
down
they just can't perform the Rite they
are unavailable and this is what cap
theorem states it says that there are
three properties of distributed systems
consistency availability and partition
tolerance and you can only choose two of
them and given that partitions will just
happen
we basically trade between consistency
and availability so this is a second
consistency definition today and it is
consistency in cap theorem and it says
that every read receives the most recent
right or an error so it's more connected
to the isolation definition from the
asset then from the then to the
consistency definition however yeah it's
really simple and now there is a third
consistently definition which is
consistency in consistency models so I
said that we can trade consistency for
availability and the third definition
says that consistency is set of rules
that must be followed by transactions so
this is really vague and works better on
an example in consistency models there
is for example strong consistency with
which corresponds to this consistency
from Carr theorem it says that you
either get the most recent right or an
error but there's also weak consistency
and weak consistency is also a little
vague because it says that you will get
the most recent right if some conditions
are met and then we can specify those
conditions for example one of those
conditions could be if enough time
passes we will get the most recent right
and it is called eventual consistency so
it's a it's a subset of weak consistency
and in the eventual consistency we can
also
create another subset which is casual
consistency and it means that if the
things if the transactions are related
to each other somehow they will be seen
in order and the subset of that again is
for example read your rights consistency
so the casual relationship that we
defined is that if someone if one entity
writes those transactions or one process
writes those transactions they are
connected and they will be seen in order
so we can see that it's sometimes
problematic if we talk about consistency
because there are three different things
that we may want to talk about how this
works in in practice so like in very
simplified model we again have a
database but this time it trades the
consistency for availability and if both
processes write something to the
database
they immediately succeed the database is
available and then later they may
synchronize what is in them and
sometimes we lose some information so
for example here we lost the notion of
which transaction was one after the
other so they're both there however we
don't know if the order is the same on
both systems and that is totally fine
for many cases and this kind of systems
are called basically available soft
state eventually consistent so the
question is our financial systems a seat
or base and I thought for a real long
time that they have to be a seat and I
remember that one of the first examples
of mutexes on concurrent programming was
about balances so let's say that Alice
wants to send money to Bob and she sends
him for example ten zlotys or ten euros
so we first calculate we check if alice
has enough money on her balance then we
subtract this from her
at this to Bob's balance and this is now
stored in some variables and then we
update actually updated the alice's
balance and bob's balance however in
concurrent programming the processes may
the process may be preempted at any
given point in time so let's say that
this process stopped working where the
line currently is and then someone sends
Bob 1 million dollars and he's very
happy to get that money however after
this process sending 1 million dollars
and then the first process kicks back in
and sets the Bob's balance back to this
tenth Lotus or 10 euros and Bob's is
very sad about it obviously so of course
this is a great example of new Texas
because you'd have a new tax on entire
transaction but this is a really bad
example of how financial systems work so
no one in their right mind would do that
basically what you do is you always
start with a balance of zero and then
you have a set of transactions that can
be mutated at all so for example an
example of transaction is sent tens
letters from Alice to Bob and this
transaction will be on both of their
accounts and then if we want to
calculate how much money they actually
have they we simply add all those things
and in case of Alice because it's in the
front part it will be minus ten zlotys
and in case of Bob it will be plus ten
so question for you are financial
systems a seed or base and the answer
like in everything in IT is it depends
so for example if we have a papers like
in Poland you can just swipe your card
if you buy something under fifty
slaughters so this is a case of base
transactions so the amount on your bank
account
can be subtracted one or even two days
later and it will be definitely out of
order but if you are buying things for
more than fifty slaughters you have to
enter your PIN code and in that case the
transaction is almost immediately on
your on your bank account if you want to
check it online so this kind of
transaction actually is a seed and even
more if you want to send a big amount of
money is there a question yes
yes but this is also another case so we
can't update transactions this
transaction is not updated the refund is
another transaction that is placed on
top of that one so the this is actually
a seed so and and the other case I
wanted to talk about is when you send
big amount of money like for example
twenty thousand slaughters and it isn't
a usual amount that you send you get a
call from the bank so this is like the
most in the most a seed as it can get if
you involve a human being in the commit
to the database okay so if if we know
that financial systems can be sometimes
a seed and sometimes base let's now talk
about elixir so I had a talk last year
about elixir and elm and I also started
with cap theorem because I wanted to
show that some properties of those
languages are nicely connected to this
theorem and when I stopped talking
someone from the audience asked me ok
but what do you do at Club collect with
elixir so I said we had this financial
system and we take money from Club
members account and paid to sports clubs
so they don't have to do the accounting
and they have their money on a weekly
basis and we can even allow paying by
installments and the answer was really
surprised
oh so you can do financial systems in
elixir and then I realized that there
are two things that I didn't say and
first thing is that in our case we can
trade the availability for consistency
because we're using direct debits and
they're processed in one or two days so
basically if they are out of order we
don't care and second thing is that even
though elixir is a language that makes
trading consistency for availability
easy you can totally ignore that you can
ignore this fancy stuff and there are
many other benefits so
another question for you if you could
choose because we actually can choose
our system doesn't have to be perfectly
available and it doesn't have to be
strongly consistent what do you think
what data based solutions did we choose
[Laughter]
because it's the simplest version so in
in cases where you can decide where you
can use just use the simplest solution
and the databases that impose most
restrictions are usually simpler to use
okay so another thing about elixir that
is sometimes not widely recognized is
what is actually they let it crush
philosophy so Airlink and elixir share
this let it crush philosophy and what
does it mean is that when we write our
programs we almost always almost always
use the equal sign which is the pattern
matching operator and it checks if
whatever is on the left side has
whatever is on the right side has the
shape of the thing that is on the left
side so if we want to write something to
a file it may either fail and return a
couple of error and reason or it can
succeed and return okay so what we do
here is we don't try catch every
possible error because as we've seen on
the keynote complex system fails in
complex ways so we instead of trying to
check all the possible error cases we
ignore that and in case something went
wrong the error handling is somewhere
else it's in the supervision tree and we
usually try to restart the process from
the beginning and it doesn't mean that
we don't that we always ignore error
cases it's like file right can return a
reason for example in our entry and in
it's part of our business logic you of
course use it so in case the file is
there we print success message in case
of error we display dialog like would
you like to create that file and that's
totally okay but it's still your
business logic so you're concerned with
what you want to do with your happy path
and you almost ignore all all the other
cases and in case something is wrong you
try to restart it couple of times and if
that doesn't work then we go higher in
the hierarchy up to maybe actually
crushing the application but it happens
very rarely it's surprising how often
just restarting something with fresh
state just clears all the problems for
example we use Heroku for deployment and
if you check their documentation they
say that dinos are restarted at least
once per day to help maintain the help
of applications running on Heroku and
the help of application it basically
means that there were some applications
that had memory leaks and in many cases
instead of letting them grow they just
rested them once in awhile and it just
works
what's more they also delete all the
changes to work on file system so if the
problem was introduced by writing to
some file it will also be deleted and as
I said that that is that's all
surprisingly many problems and it just
makes your system more reliable because
in case of errors that for example
database errors because of lost
connectivity you just retry and you
probably succeed if this is not a
permanent error and in case of parents
are you're still screwed okay but the
problem we've let it crash philosophy is
would you like a fly a plane that is
programmed with let it crash philosophy
in mind because I would I would because
the only programming language that I
know
has this philosophy is Arirang and
elixir my transition and I know that it
actually helps preventing problems and
crashes because what we usually
associate crash with is is this like our
application stops working and there's a
blue screen of death and it's it's
terrible however if you look at the
history of programming like for example
the Apollo 11 primary guidance
navigation and control system they had
this case where landing on the moon took
85% of CPU power and the 15 percent was
reserved for for example inputting
comments by the crew and checking the
altitude for example was a command that
needed to be run by the computer however
there was a hardware bug in the radar
system so it used 13 percent additional
CPU power
so basically when they started the
descent they were almost there were
almost no CPU power it worked correctly
and when they tried to input a command
to check what's the current altitude the
command crashed and that was totally
fine because the scheduler was built
around the notion of priorities and
landing and radar which was necessary
for this landing had higher priority
than commands that will be input by the
crew and this is the same case we've let
it crash philosophy in our rank and
elixir it contains the error in one
place it doesn't let it spread through
your application and corrupt the data so
I like more for example when people say
it's a happy case programming or let it
fail fast philosophy because it just
works better and even Loic who created
Erlang webserver recently wrote a blog
post about why
that crash is just the wrong choice of
words from the marketing point of view
and I was like dude couldn't you publish
this two weeks later now everyone will
think i stoled it okay so how our system
in cop collect works so the part that
I'm currently working on will process
transactions that will be sent by some
other subsystems it will be the server
on this picture so when we try to send a
transaction to this server it's not
enough to just send it as synchronously
because the client really wants to know
if it worked so the server does some
processing accesses the DB then again
does some processing and each of these
steps can fail independently so in case
the first processing step fails nothing
is safe to the DB in case last step of
processing fails we don't get the
response so what we usually do in such a
case is that the client when creating a
transaction first saves it locally on
his disk then performs the sent
operation and then waits for response
and saves that response and is it enough
so that those two systems know that
actually everything is processed and
everyone knows about this transaction
and then the two generals problem the
problem is that if you have two armies
and they need to attack the city that is
in between them at the same point in
time and they need to send messengers to
communicate that our it is extremely
hard because let's say that the first
general sends a messenger like let's
attack tomorrow at noon can they attack
if the messenger got to the second
general no they can't because the first
general doesn't know if the second one
got the message so the second one sends
a confirmation yes
let's attack tomorrow at noon can they
attack now no they still can't attack
cuz ii general knew that the first
general will be hesitating until he gets
the confirmation and he doesn't know if
the confirmation came in so let's send
the third messenger even if this third
messenger goes through now the second
general doesn't know if the first
general knows and so on and so forth
basically even the infinite amount of
messengers doesn't solve the problem i
mean it increases confidence ii at some
point they will be like okay there's 99%
chance that we're attacking at the same
time but it's never 100% and there are
really complicated protocols to achieve
synchronous ii between two systems
however we simply don't need them
because in client-server architecture
only one of the sides is really
interested in the information being sent
to the other so the client wants to know
that the server got the transaction so
in case something went wrong and the
response wasn't saved we should we try
and it's the clients responsibility and
server it sends the response however it
doesn't care if client got it it's the
client responsibility to retry and
speaking of retrying how can we make
retrying with transactions if we have
something like create transaction
endpoint and we only specify the amount
and from who - who the transaction
should go it's not enough because in
case of retry we wouldn't know if this
is like the same transaction or it is a
new transaction just with the same
values so one way to solve that problem
is to always generate IDs on the client
side so it's very common that REST API
is use post method and then return the
ID of something that was created and
this is a problematic design because
if we don't allow duplicates it might be
harmful if we don't get the response so
it's usually better to create the IDE on
the client-side and then use it to send
a message to the server and this can be
achieved using put methods of HTTP
requests so we first created the UUID
and send the message and we're pretty
sure that even if we retry we will get
the same response because put guarantees
that it will be idempotent and we don't
have to worry about IDs because uniquely
unique identifiers when they are created
the the search space is so big that it's
more probable that your old development
team will be eaten by wolves in the in
their respective flats then the keys
will crash okay so to sum up our
development how people see elixir it's
great for distributed systems it's great
for complex stateful communication and
it's perfect for base databases and how
do we use Alex Red Cloud Connect we have
a single node service we have a client
server without state and we use AC DB so
right the heck do we actually use elixir
and it is because it has many other nice
properties that are probably less
marketed so for example one of them is
that it keeps side effects in check
because it's immutable so testing in
imperative programming usually includes
setting up some state running the tested
code and checking out the new state in
functional programming with immutability
it's always setting up a data structure
then running a tested code and then
checking new data structure some from
the programmers perspective it's almost
the same it involves the same amount of
work however if you want to run those
tests if you have a state that is shared
at some point you can't run those tests
in parallel and in functional
programming if you have just data
structures you can paralyze your test
and that's pretty nice
so elixir encourages programmer to write
your programs in a certain way so
basically there will be a set of
transformations on data so we start our
pipe chain the this operator is called
pipe operator and it basically takes
whatever is returned by the previous
expression and puts it at the first
argument of a function so there will be
a series of transformations where the
first one will gather some data some for
example call external services read
something from database then there will
be a logic that may be arbitrarily
complicated but it's good if it doesn't
have any side effects because it will
you can test it more easily and then
there's a point in your code where you
return all your data at once again
calling external services or saving
stuff to DB and that is for example how
plug works in elixir plug is a library
that is base of Phoenix framework and it
abstracts away all the impure
and Link HTTP so you don't have to
receive stuff from the socket
this is impure you don't have to send it
back this is done by plug with developer
does he only receives already parsed
data structure called con for connection
and this cone has everything that you
need to know about this particular
request you set some other fields in
this request for example status and
response field and then pass it back to
plug so at the end testing something
like plug is really straightforward you
set up the data structure and there's
usually helper for that you then call
get request which tests almost entire
stack because it goes through a router
for your controller for the index action
and it returns the comm where you can
check if it has proper HTTP status
proper HTTP response so it's really nice
for testing there are however case
where you would like to do something
impure inside this transformation so
let's say that in the middle you really
want to save something to data base
given a some condition so instead of
directly saving stuff to data base you
can defer sending this to to this last
point in your program so basically what
we want to do is to apart from the data
that we already need pass one more data
structure that will hold all operations
to the database that we want to perform
at the end and in an elixir there's an
ecto library that is database wrapper
and it has the concept of multi muta is
a data structure that just keeps all the
transactions that we want to do on the
database in one place and then we can
run it in a context of transaction so we
pass this additional value the multi and
the same as before if the condition is
true we add to the multi the insert
operation however if the condition is
not true we return the multi as it was
so if the world and the operations are
before they will still be there if it
was empty it will still be empty and now
we can test this without touching the
database we also set up the data
structure as before we run given piece
of code and it returns both data and
multi and at the end we can assert that
the data didn't change this is the
expected behavior ad that the multi is
there and if you think about it it's a
really cool concept because it makes
testing much faster you can test for
both positive and negative case and you
don't touch the database and then you
have like one integration test that
really checks if if this fits if this
connects but those other cases
corner cases don't have to really touch
the database during testing there's also
a situation that is opposite which is if
you want to read something from database
and this is a little bit simpler so
instead of reading something just in
this place we can pass the module name
that is our repository as a function
argument so what I did there is I made
the repo lowercase and I'm saying that
the default value this slash slash will
be the module repo so in case of your
application code if you want to call it
nothing changed
you still call it with one argument and
then the default argument will be
capital our repo and it will do the
thing you want to do however when you're
testing it you can pass the repo module
explicitly so you quickly create this
repo module that will behave as actor
repo and then pass it as a second
argument to this function and then you
can check your logic independently from
the database there are other benefits of
elixir for writing business logic and
this is firstly no callbacks
so elixir tries to be very explicit and
at some point in time people asked for
example - if it will be able if they
will be able to run some code when
updates operation or database is
performed and the answer was resounding
no because if you really want to do
something like that just make a function
that firstly updates the database and
then does your stuff and call it in your
code it will be very explicit and also
if at some point in time there will be a
place where you want to just perform the
update you won't be surprised that there
is some side-effects happening outside
of your code it also has great
performance and this is probably the
reason why we are running
it on just one note so for example there
was a case of bleacher report who said
that they had 50 servers running Ruby on
Rails application and they rewrote it to
elixir and now they're running it on
five and it's probably over provisioned
that that is quote from what they said
so this looks like a really great
performance improvement and this is what
allows us to simply run it on one Heroku
instance the other thing is umbrella
applications so elixir and Phoenix are
trying to solve the problems that were
before in Ruby community and in Ruby
community
it was very often the case that
applications grew into this big
monoliths and in Phoenix now it's very
common to split your application into
smaller sub applications and even though
it is in one repository and can be
started at one it gives you some
benefits of micro services because if
you have application a that depends on B
application a can call staff from the B
application but not the other way around
so it's a good way to isolate your code
and you have to think a little bit up
front about your design and at the end
it gives you many improvements of micro
services without the hassle of actually
deploying them and creating a
communication over HTTP
of course there are also some drawbacks
and for example rapid evolution of
language can be a disadvantage so just
recently I needed to update actor 22.3
and it required changing the rit of
functions in all of our models which was
around 50 or 60 places so even though it
was almost easy to automate I still did
by hand because I really wanted to check
if I'm not missing some
I think and I needed to test it
unfortunately we have a good test
coverage so I was pretty confident that
it was okay but you have to keep that in
mind that the language evolves so for
example the trick I showed with multi we
couldn't use it because when we started
the multi wasn't even a thing yet so
it's not in every place we would like it
to be
second thing is compilation time so
usually when you're developing the
iteration time is really quick because
in Phoenix there is hot code roll hot
code reload and this is very nice but
there are some problems with compiling
for example if one module calls the
other module if the other changes both
need to be recompiled so in extreme
cases for example when you change
configuration file that is also compiled
all your application is being recompiled
and that might be annoying and it is
also partially solved by the Umbrella
applications that you can simply test
and run in isolation but still at some
point you need to run this build that
checks everything and has integration
tests and it just will be slower type
system in a lecture is optional and what
I mean by that is that there is a tool
called dialyzer which allows you to add
type specs to your functions and this is
a pretty nice thing however it works
best when all the dependencies are also
statically checked by dialyzer and it's
rarely the case
so phoenix isn't because it has so many
libraries that aren't and they won't be
probably for a long time however I think
that I'm more than happy to trade type
safety for the performance and the ease
of development that elixir gives us
another thing is libraries and I put a
question mark there because actually
there wasn't a library that wasn't
available
that I needed to I don't know write
myself or search too long
there was only one case when I wanted to
use graphite where the library wasn't in
the hex repository and that meant that I
had to manually resolve the dependencies
and at the end I didn't use graphite at
all so that didn't really matter so to
summary what I want to tell you today is
that elixir needs success stories for
companies that are smaller than detail
report but that don't operate at scale
because exhale is also a great language
for just writing your normal crude
applications and it solves all the
problems that Ruby can solve and
sometimes it even does it better and it
case of concurrency there are things
that Ruby just can't do because of
global interpreter lock and this second
thing is that don't assume anything not
only about financial systems but about
any systems if you're not 100% sure what
the properties are because we often
assume too much and at the end we can
shoot ourselves in the foot so I think
that's all I wanted to say if you like
this stuff you can follow me on Twitter
and if you want to know more about club
collect or even work with us now's the
time for questions thank you sorry very
skin question before lunch you have told
us that it's a good language for
available high-level applications and
based on the rank and it's easily
distributed but do you know if there is
a support in the in the language on the
libraries for vector clocks for
communication for a casual consistency
already done in in this ecosystem if you
really need this
functionality it's it's more than sure
that you will find it because it was
built for that and there are many
libraries like that I think that if you
want to search for particular one I
would recommend checking out reactor
core so I have one more question for you
you are talking about
elixir performance so I have some
problem with a ranked performance and I
think it's connected with elixir
performance so maybe you know the answer
it's really true that when you are
creating something in everything you
need usually less cause and it's works
much better but when we are running our
system in very big scale when we meet a
virtual machine that works on hardware
with multiple cores I want you to our
machine have a lot of problem with
mapping its schedulers to course when
there are multiprocessor environment if
there are many cores of single processor
it works great and where we have the
same number of course but with more
processors for example two processor
with six cores instead one with 12 cores
the performance drops very much so do
you notice similar problems in your
career so personally I haven't so I'm
not sure I will be able to answer your
questions I believe that there are some
flags to the virtual machine that should
be used to allow it and in in worst case
scenario it might be beneficial to
simply run two instances of around
virtual machine both running
on the single processor using its all
course and just interconnect between
them but as I said that that is an
extreme solution I think and I think
there are people on the audience that
are more qualified to answer that
question so I hope with you in contact
with them and what was the largest
environment you are using how many cores
processors so I remember that I was
testing this Co MapReduce framework and
it was on the agh University of Science
and Technology and even though I don't
remember the details I think that it was
around a supercomputer it was one of the
cluster of smaller computers so the the
one machine with that there wasn't the
case that I was running it on one
machine with many processors it was
rather clustering it on small commodity
hardware because that's usually cheaper
that that's what Google also does for
their environments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
