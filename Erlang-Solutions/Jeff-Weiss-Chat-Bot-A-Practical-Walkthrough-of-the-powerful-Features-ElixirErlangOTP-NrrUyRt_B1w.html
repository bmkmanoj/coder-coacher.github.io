Jeff I work at puppet and I'm gonna walk
through how I've used a side project to
learn some of the more powerful features
of of air lying elixir and OTP so I know
this has to be the longest most boring
title ever so beware her there are live
demos ahead so you know and those never
ever go wrong so so first a couple of
caveats I still consider myself an
elixir and airline beginner I will
probably tell you things that are
incorrect I'm sorry
it's definitely not intentional yeah
that's this is how I feel sort of
floating around especially with the
table I thought I understood a lot of
the mechanics of how to do various
aspects of airline and elixir but I
didn't really feel like that I had that
visceral understanding of when to use
specific things and how I should use
them and when to make that transition
and what those trade-offs were and for
some respect I still don't I'm still
learning so so in his excellent post on
being a senior engineer John all squall
references sort of knowledge acquisition
and skill development and the visceral
understanding I'm talking about shirt
really shows up down here in the expert
level right this intuitive grasp of
situations and right now I'm still
somewhere like maybe novice or advanced
beginner I needed a non-trivial project
that as it expanded would force me to
refactor and incorporate and redesign
things and incorporate the things that I
had learned but yeah not yet fully
internalized that would lead me to this
intuitive grasp of the situations so I
made a thing it's bad I knew it would be
bad but I needed to go through that
progression and almost no books and
tutorials
really follow this route save for
Sasha's book like certain action which
if you haven't read by it is
wonderful it goes through the process of
here's the thing we've reached the
limits of what it can do okay let's
improve it so he doesn't much better
than I can do so I also have Erlang an
anger on my reading list so I'll get to
that eventually - so why why a chatbot
so at work we use the fork of Hugh bot
criminate er yeah it's a robot and and a
puppet because puppet labs so just a
quick show of hands of people who are
vaguely familiar with you bots okay so
about half so Hugh bot was developed by
github primarily as a way of doing chat
ops so where they would have not only a
public record of what had been done for
automation of deployments for bringing
junior people on or new people they
could quickly see oh here's how we
deploy to production here's how we
handle a DDoS those sorts of things but
but also as a way to force them to
automate a lot of of their things so for
those of you they don't know Hugh bot is
written in node and nodes execution
model means that if there are any buggy
extensions it brings the whole thing
down so that's the idea it will not
bring it down that's not the idea but as
far as chat ops so we use we ask you but
internally we tend to use it more for
things like you know tracking karma of
like things that we like that our
co-workers did or image searches ticket
references but we also use it some for
deploying to production but
unfortunately since since the the no Dex
huge model if there was a bug in say the
karma module it would prevent us from
being able to deploy to production which
is is awful so that's that's really to
me like that's when we couldn't deploy
to production one day I was like this is
what Erlang is all about an isolation of
all of these these processes so I also
had a co-worker who
had an IRC BOTS of his own and wanted to
extend it to do like Riker quotes from
enterprise the next generation so so I
was like wait a second I can I can do
that and and using bit Walker's so this
is a second talk in a row to mention
Paul Shannon filters work Paul if you're
watching thank you
he has an ax IRC library he also did yak
sorry I'm so so yeah I an IRC BOTS so
when it all goes wrong during here you
can point and laugh starting about now
so as as we learned during during Josh's
talk the network doesn't necessarily
cooperate here so I have set up a
hopefully it's still set up an ad hoc
network for Jeff Weiss so you should be
able to connect to it this is the host
name for the IRC server so if you have
an IRC client please connect to it and
then you can the channel elixir Kampf
you can start sending some civil
commands to - oh hi bot it should it
should say oh hi as soon as you joined
the channel that's how it got its name
so you can do things like that likes
request Clause saying give it some karma
I have a Markov engine so you can say
like markov joe armstrong which was
seeded with the text Joe Armstrong went
to the Future in the TARDIS so there are
a couple of other texts that have been
run through the Markov engine so you you
probably won't get Joe if you do just
mark off Joe Armstrong you probably
won't get mark Joe Armstrong with the
future and the TARDIS you might get some
other random string unless you actually
said Markov Joe Armstrong went to the
Future and then it should complete it
for you that should be unique enough so
during the talk I'm going to talk about
three primary things that I've used and
I will demonstrate all of these so hope
that's the plan at least if it would
cooperate so if you're trying to connect
to networking you're having problems let
me know and maybe we can have someone
set up a hotspot but I think I think it
should work we tested it right before
lunch again
so Supervision trees clustering and then
the live code update
so again none of these are specific to
elixir but as a as a new to elixir I was
also a noob to airline despite my two
previous failed attempts with Erlang
which they failed not because of syntax
or anything airline specific but mostly
because I didn't have a project I didn't
have something to apply it to where I
would sort of go through the process
that I eventually did with with elixir
so this is how I initially thought about
supervision trees so let me put the mic
down here so you can hear it so that's
the IT Crowd if you're not familiar with
it that's the perfect scene for for
supervisors
however OTP actually provides a much
richer framework than than just that so
that what I do off the app initially
it's like Oh elixir Erlang you need
supervision trees like okay great I'll
make a supervision tree what should it
look like it's like I don't know I'll
just stuff everything in under this the
single supervisor which was great for a
while when I had a problem with with the
bot and it crashed but it would usually
be something originated from the client
it would it would cause me to reconnect
but if any of these specific pieces
failed just those will be restarted the
problem though was when when the IRC
client had a problem because of a flaky
network connection which you know I was
running on my laptop closed my laptop
opening it again or go from wireless
access point access point to wired
networking all of those things would
sort of cause this client process to
freak out and it would have to be
restarted because the client process
maintains a reference to each of the not
the brains each of the box so that when
a message comes
IRC this client process says hey I got a
thing do you need to do anything with it
so yeah so yeah if just this would be
restarted these other these other BOTS
wouldn't know that they needed to rear
edge astir themselves with the client
process so what whatever it's a simple I
receive bot I was wearing on my laptop
it was fine to restart eventually that
got to be a pain and I like to practice
pain driven development so when
something isn't big enough pain for me
to actually care about then I automated
so I had I had a few options one stop
running an IRC bought from your laptop
billing so that's done I usually run it
from our OpenStack infrastructure at
puppet however I shut it down so I could
run it internally here you usually tries
to connect out the free node but we
actually with the with Anton no ad-hoc
network you don't have access up to the
Internet so I'm actually also running an
IRC server on one of my bigger beams so
I guess I could still be running it on
OpenStack there I mean I can restructure
the Supervision trees so that a death
and the client process in its connection
to IRC will eventually resolve itself
I could also fix the reconnect logic in
the xrc which I haven't done yet Paul if
you're watching I'm going to get to it
eventually when it becomes a big enough
pain for me so this is this is what my
supervision tree looks like right now
so you'll notice I'm also using
something other than one for one right
so almost all of the tutorials that I
went through say like here are the
various research strategies but you
almost always use one for one I was like
why why would I reach for one for all or
rest for one and you really have a good
understanding of when I would do that so
in this case what I did is I structured
it out
the brains that actually maintain some
sort of states into a separate
supervisor primarily because you can't
have multiple research strategies within
a single supervisor which I learned the
hard way so particular workers couldn't
you couldn't say this worker needs to be
even if that worker was a sub supervisor
rest for one or all for one
so the the brains are pulled out and
then I have a connection supervisor so
that if any sir I'm probably off-screen
now if any of the workers from this died
it restarts them all so the advantage
that I have here is that when this
client process dies from a flaky
connection what it will do or or from
IRC flooding good thing where it will
kill all of these spots and restart them
and when they come up they'll rear edge
astir themselves with the client process
so which this has a reference to and
passes down to the other ones so i could
have also used rest for one if i had in
over here instead of having this bond
supervisor sorry I went off camera again
so I could have obsoleted this Bob or
not put it in the bond stupor visor and
just had these BOTS also part of the
connection supervisor and use rest for
one which then I would have to maintain
an ordered list and if anything prior in
the list died it would restart
everything after that which would have
certainly worked well for the client
process but then if I had say an error
in the karma bot it would have also
restarted the markup bot which you know
would have been fine the boss wouldn't
like it but it seemed it seemed a little
brittle and I would have to remember
that war was important when I was
specifying that workers in the
supervisor and I knew that was probably
a bad idea because I'd like to say that
future Jeff is
more than current yeah so I tried to try
to be nice to my future son so plus 3
this is where the hoop starts to get
really interesting or go wrong I'm gonna
need your help
so if you are connected to the ad hoc
network I would like for you to start up
I distributed a lexer session so you can
do I X - just name your name and then
your IP address if you use an ipv6 I be
addressed because you don't have a
self-signed self-assigned ipv4 that's
fine it'll still work - - cookie young
so show hands of people who are going to
at least attempt that ok so 10% issue ok
and then once you're connected I would
like for you to connect to the cluster
so you can do a node connect
oh hi bot and then this is the IP
address on there it's a self assigned IP
address on that network
so if you if you didn't hear that and
certainly the recording did not
Christmas machine just said Wow Chris
you should not be so trusting he would
say this his computer was muted so yeah
what what I do is I'm running a node
monitor so as other machines connect to
the cluster I detect that I read in some
some code send it down to that
particular node and compile it there and
then start executing code on that
machine so in this case in this case I
pipe down through OS command to Apple
script crank the volume up and and then
ran to say command with like Wow back
tick Who am I you should not be so
trusting yeah
so by the way I now have all of your SSH
private keys and AWS credentials so
let's let's take a look the i-x session
here about what's going on see so you'll
see some some things so some of these
logger
debug commands are actually originating
from the people have connected in to the
cluster however since those processes
were spawned from my machine my machine
is set up as the group leader and so all
of these debug messages come to my IX
terminal which is incredibly helpful
something's going on oh good we've got
people connecting to the to the IRC
channel too so yeah so all of all of the
debug messages and logger messages
coming to to my console is incredibly
useful for trying to figure out what's
actually going on and so you'll see
you'll see something here about like
somebody else is currently spamming so
the first person who connected I
actually don't know who it is right now
it started issuing commands to to the
cluster to the oh hi bots on that
machine to send me private messages so
it's now oh hi bot is sending me some
some messages it's reading some poetry
from thermocol krakow poet so yeah we'll
use this to demonstrate some of the live
code update stuff that I've got later so
we'll see that these messages change so
hopefully at least one person will stay
stay connected to the to the channel
okay so let me start up okay right so
while I begin to talk about the security
model I ran some code on your machine
it's only fair that you run some on mine
so so you can you can do these commands
I you can save this symbol for the the
node two variable it's a lot easier than
trying to type it out every time so what
you can do is you can spawn some
commands on on my machine and they
should they should occur in you should
at least see the result of of the Markov
bot in the IRC channel so all this does
is talk directly to the brain
it's the bot that actually does the
communication to the bot portion so
there's a brain portion and a portion
this will just implement the state so we
would give elixir 50 more karma and if
we were to go to so yeah it greets me as
I come in okay so if some people had
already apparently added karma for
elixir now it's 103 after my initial
ones so so you can see the result there
of other people executing the code on my
machine to modify the state and then it
eventually shows up out here if someone
can run the Markov bot command or should
I go back to the slide so people can see
what it is probably this one so if I get
somebody to run that while i'm in the
IRC channel you should show up here
should it doesn't necessarily need to be
i say it's sort of this is this is what
you're seeking the Markov chain with you
could just as easily seed it with joe
armstrong has anybody done this hands up
or
okay Chris says one second
so yeah I'll quickly I'll go to the
clustering security model slide and they
know then I'll come back to this so
there's a clustering security model okay
done so you'll you'll notice as you as
you learn more about the distributed
airline industry elixir there is no
security right it was built during a
time where it was assumed that you had
full control over all of the nodes and
the network in between so as you saw for
me launching code on your machines to
harvest your SSH keys so by the way I'll
be making commits as you on github yeah
you need to be very very cautious with
with the distributed airline because
just as easily as running things for
this a command you know you can you can
do an RM RF of any node on any of the
cluster for any node in the cluster and
wipe out somebody's machine so please
don't do that this is a very nice and
accepting community and welcoming like
let's not do that to each other during
my talk doesn't feel awful and
responsible for teaching you that okay
yeah yeah so it's not not just air lying
and elixir commands that you can run on
other other nodes in the cluster it can
also be any system commands so my crazy
idea one day is to have a way to
bootstrap news so as soon as they
connect to the cluster they asked
someone else hey what code should I be
running all that code is sent
to the machine and it automatically
starts learning the things in
cooperating so the eventually like you
don't have to set up an ode ahead of
time you just connect it to the cluster
and it brings down whatever the current
version of the code is and it stays so
we'll see if I ever get time to actually
do that okay security model rudimentary
clustering failover so so I have a
spammer I don't know who it is
so by spammer I mean someone who's
sending me things over here so did not
yet there would have to be a capital I
sorry the Markov thing is this case oh
yeah we're doing three paler so I have
someone who is let me go to the IRC are
IEX oh yeah great so whoever was
spamming looks like it was Chris he left
and then I elected this is perfect
timing I elected someone else to be the
spammer and so immediately it picked it
back up and by spamming I mean sending
reading poetry to to me and IRC so I had
an idea of like how I could do this
clustering on the drive into work one
day when I was scheduled to give a demo
of this to my peers the demo was
scheduled for 10:30 I arrived at work
around 9:15 got some coffee thought
about it and had about 45 minutes to
implement it which I did so that's not
to say that like I'm awesome
because I'm clearly not what what is
it's the power of the ecosystem so I
don't know of any other language or
runtime system that will allow you to do
any sort of cluster and failover like
this in 45 minutes there may be tools
and frameworks that you can use but not
anything that's built
into the language or the ecosystem yeah
it's amazing so next live code update
okay so I'll quickly go through some of
this because Martin and Martin talked a
lot about it much more in depth then
I'll go I will demonstrate some of those
things but it really comes down to you
have two situations one where you have
state that you have to worry about and
migrate and one where you don't so if
you if you don't have state that you
care about then you can just reload the
code so let me let me demonstrate that
so what yeah so I am somewhere in the
middle of one of the poems and if I in
IRC say crash it will crash if I
actually hit enter there we go
it will crash the literary bought the
one this reading and it restarted at the
first poem so I have an unhandled
exception in that in that bot and and it
goes up to the supervisor it says I died
because I had this unhandled exception
and it restarts it and if I go to the
i-x session you may even see okay yeah
so there's there's a sec trace and then
it immediately restarted it sometimes
it'll have interesting interleaving of
the logger messages and you'll see that
the literary bots you get the restarting
message before you actually see the
stack trace but it wasn't in this case
okay so yes I'm hailing exception
everything is terrible so I have I've
got a couple of choices I can handle the
exception and
have to Torsten seppuku and go back to
Java or or I can just go ahead and get
rid of the yeah so as you saw here I'm
raising the murdered exception so I can
I can just get rid of that from great
and if I do it are okay reload it is and
now if I come in here so we can see
though I bought reading the poetry to me
if I try to crash it again it just
continues with where it was so that that
codes been reloaded on the fly it had it
had continued sort of where it was
before with with the state so however if
I have if I have some state that I want
to upgrade again that that process that
Martin Martin talked about earlier in
much greater depth is suspend the
process reload the code run your state
migration and then resume the code so I
have some somebody left
they weren't the spammer it doesn't
matter so if I have by state that I care
about then then I have to migrate it so
what I'll do is I wrote a couple sort of
helper things so you didn't have to
watch me type like if you ever want to
feel insecure about how slow you type
watch the lexer sips it's amazing how
fast Josh I don't know maybe he speeds
it up that's that's what I tell myself
that he speeds it up but so so I have I
have some helper methods so the first
thing that I'll do is I'll do it
case so it will we'll do this thing it's
a while I actually have a sleep in there
pretending that it's gonna take a while
so that we can demonstrate that don't
let me go back to IRC before that
happens okay yeah so we saw several of
them come through at once once it
resumed so those messages where's my
cursor those messages were queued in the
process mailbox and so immediately after
it was resumed it was able to start
processing those again and so I can can
demonstrate it again if I don't I
decided it Oh tired of all the yelling
let's go let's go down case so again my
grading taking a while I'll go to IRC
that death is part of the problem it's
not okay so the process resumed and now
everything is is down case so those
those are fairly simple migrations if I
wanted to do maybe a slightly more
complex migration again not terribly
more but title case and I've ever tried
to write a title case method it's not
just simply string up case or string
down gaze I don't think there's a type
of case function built in the string but
so the type of case is where every
letter is every word is capitalized then
we'll go back to you I are seeing pause
doing its thing there we go
title case so yeah
so what's next I haven't been
investigated pets or debts
yet for for the back end for the Markov
engine I just have an in-memory data
structure so eventually I'll take a look
at that and sort of its extent expanded
out I would like to also eventually work
over the XMPP transport I just haven't
gotten to it yet and once I do it'll
force me to redesign some of the things
so abstract away some of the connection
specific step for IRC so I'll probably
get rid of the client process nonsense
that I have in there now I'd like to
make it easier to do the bot creation so
you're not so tied to in this case to
IRC that'll probably happen with XMPP I
also like to have sort of cluster
distributed box so there's some
discovery of who has the connections to
whatever the underlying transport is and
I could probably implement some of this
over Phoenix which would also be
interesting but so that as you connect
to the cluster you could run a box
specifically on that cluster and it
would talk to whoever has the connection
to whatever the underlying thing is
whether it's XMPP and a HipChat or IRC
or something like that so this is an
unordered list there's probably gonna be
other other things that would be
interesting to come up so what questions
do you have
I know that was a pretty quick walk
through it only scratches some of the
service but hopefully at least hearing
other people around use machines talk
sort of reinforce that the clustering is
powerful to get you know with great
power comes great responsibility what
questions do you have anyway Chris
so Chris's question was I mentioned that
I would like to have a node monitor that
as things connect would would send the
code down to to those machines and
determine what they need am i aware of
any projects that already do that and
how much have I researched it I'm not
aware of any projects that you know
right now if there's something that does
that let me know it's really interesting
but I haven't researched it that much
it's just it's a crazy idea this way
Josie
okay okay so what what just I was saying
is that when you connect you can
traverse the load path of the other
machine grab all of the bytecode files
and transfer them across okay okay he's
saying that's done in AI ants for auto
completion when you do a remote shell
