conference the person I totally
the person I wanted to come here
infiltrated single mark
he's a video of rich people they make an
amazing work making progress with lisa
has been working on this for a long time
we just know that a big company owns a
super big project approval rate
developers take it easy only time and
the other will take a lot of time to see
a lot of things from him I'm sure that
you have a 11 12
I mean achieve that year king would come
in New York they work like on the
Phoenix
Cordia we had a lot of amazing talented
it sounds like again more at the time
what they welcomed up max so enjoy I
think you rush to the backwards and I
know happy the years I was in Argentina
in public interview and I was attacked
and raped a kilometer and so I was
production scale you can't really talk
about that 47 and driven two hours so
what I'm going to try to do is focus on
some core areas think are important but
let's start with some background
unnecessarily you know what which report
is but if the second biggest sports site
in the world behind ESPN surrounds on
2008 I started out as a rail pilot whose
realm of bio and then over the last
eight or nine years we got all of them
there's a lot of like that into an
imagined the landscape has changed quite
a bit
2008 I was right after the iPhone was
released which meant that most is happy
that most of your breaking news via
email so it wasn't like you know
education for everything clearly that's
changed I mean when I flew up a
transmission occasion from dealt with in
my bag that got on the plane which is
you know it's just you chose go to
showed us how the great things are now
about the elixir leading over at least
report I don't have a formal LDS
background putting a little philosophy
and economics and the algebra fluffy
thighs are things we you know study
determinations of computer science and
the way we food Frizzles was the
function and so I'll just oriented
programming while I was able to come and
early do it it never felt that
comfortable to me it was always been
confusing are enjoyable employees of
order later and attendings and
functional programmers cultural program
was and they had lots of natural because
it's just functions you know it scoop
some functions would you things together
in and so you know I include in place in
the world an attempt to show and as a
real developer and there for a few years
but I was really looking for interest
for different kind of from the
programming language and we tried a
small project with scholars work and
that didn't work out very well
whoever ease it didn't click and then I
play guitar my outing music and is the
language there's a framework called
Elbert own course recorder but Erin and
enclosure and so this is rages was fun
and I started to spend some time with
God and time to get somewhere worth so a
copy with closure on it that I had a
wizard
and Commedia was this is really amazing
enough right never even considered early
has been optioned ecologist or likeness
in Texas various familiar a Texas
reputation for being from esoteric and
and the background you know the telecom
person you know what wondrous telegrams
but it was a successful incidences
because the students I started with a
laser I was able is because I learned a
lot of emotional roller in principles
with closure I was able to then
plateau solicitor with relevant ease
because it looks it does look like Ruby
which is enough to get you into it
enough as we realized it acknowledged
retrieval so it's sort of like a baby
switch does it work and in that time I
started Everett that we support was
using
loser video is you know a big company
doing these things and great thing is is
that a sorta I don't care about yourself
I have no interest in sorted
although has more complete report for to
the time that I have I'm outfitted by a
Moses had learned a bit about sports
again oh yeah I know what maybe a
championship had helped those big old
big orders who's the local team these
are the kind of things but also work in
the back is like I don't if that is that
we could be half but instead of leisure
working about sports
could be at all I don't just want to
mention offenders it was not because it
does still the data that we could
represent the data in a very similar way
that we represent the data that we had
now so that that's me that is connected
a little easier to to solo and again we
have this new fancy logo this new Messi
app and it's a ton of next thing because
it's a combination of sort of two and a
half to three years of work where we
started with this sort of Asian platform
that is shifted from desktop to mobile
and are designed as well beyond certain
ages in the same way yes and we
basically inflate Donna tighter rewrote
our entire system or the majority of it
and elixir on the backend and then we
did react didn't note on the front and
now we had the time to design so it's
really a Wendy's company whatever it
really is we can talk about the
designers the product managers and
stakeholders to all the developers and
QA and so on we all hit handiness and so
it's really nice has sort of package
have together like this and so when you
say its scale does that mean the ice
what the heii's about you quick so there
isn't sort of absence is actually sort
of a debate materially physically think
big growth in all of these metrics but
this was especially brilliant solution
applications come up is sort of one of
the reasons why we're having the issues
that we are having or we started looking
to list in the first place so you know
in 2007 you get a female inside summer
if you happen to go to website or maybe
they in the email itself with the
constants of the articles we don't you
go to the website
course we send out a notification
you know we to some of our bigger market
or subscriptions have upwards of 20
million users so if you did
notifications from your users even one
to five percent ability to open them
open the app then suddenly you have a
problem a veteran heart rate and one of
the other problems was that since it was
actually a problem of prosperity in this
bed police report became successful
early on because it was the only company
at the time that was what allows your
followers individual players and several
professional games and your local games
so we were able to you were able to
follow all these different teams or
players and so on and when you open the
app that maybe you had to merge these
all on demand it was very useful to
Casting things you could catch the
individual screen because it's that's
the same for everyone
but this change is likely unique also
the pagination these kind of things so
an individual together and which in turn
Ruby isn't the best at marking things on
the flight so we turned to these
problems where we had in VIP is more
more integrated fashion strategy to show
just a sort of fake of real-time updates
and everyone just double cash you know
but it failed but it has to be the most
so we have we would always have a lot of
problems especially when I started when
we are still on the older platform being
on call every developer coca-cola wants
a week from every month and it will go
on like this a lot of the time respect
firefight a lot of kind of all we have
offices in London as well so that means
that if the cache doesn't bust is 3m
thank you I got to fix it was a really
sort of demoralizing time because
builders do that the developers quietly
do the things that we do like I enjoy
high program in creating they not fixing
things not trying to keep things running
so and October 2014 was our first commit
for our first illah drug and the
listener 1.0 it just been really
meaningful when I was still go to your
way so we were really on the edge 2000
things and this is a few months before I
joined and I kind of amazed
potential person because we started with
necessity we started with the part of
the abdomen disease the most health
which is the part of the absolutely most
important at all it was the partners
powered all the information every time
you open the applicant may connect home
and we decided to that first right and
partners at some point was that projects
also seeing that we have the issues of
how we gonna fix them and the literature
can be captured has all the old triple
appoints in current default columns
availability kind of things but it also
looks familiar like I can get with a
vintage boat to adopt with our life for
instance because we would have had each
functional programming advantage in your
language than we've had to do the same
thing we could sort of take it with the
liquor and soul which I've got it up and
was really important with potentially
teachable rolling we didn't want if you
can't to dolphin aspire you can't for
things for people or developers do
things they don't want to do you're not
going to be around for very long you
know in San Francisco you have lots of
opportunities to developers frequently
change jobs so it's not in any way Keeta
developers happy so forth it was the
right combination of new technology and
a serious problem that we were having
and you know every company has different
problems every company is different
regions were really looking at your web
search Academy but regardless of your
scale if you don't have a big you don't
have to this kind of scale if you're a
new company here or if you're trying to
buy you delicious and why would you want
to do this and how can you do it
successfully so I think given topic
recent purchases with top over timing
and I'll miss my experience with with
this I think there are three sort of pre
tenant that you sort of have to follow
in order to successfully about the lik
certain there's been all combat these as
we go through them but the first one is
reasonable expectations second is
consistent code and if there is training
developers and you can't do all these a
certain interval together family one
without doing the others or they won't
they won't work where long countries it
all together so let's start with
reasonable expectations
so expectations this is reasonable
expectations between the stakeholders
and between the developers as well
because they're going to be lots of
print up when you're adopting a new
language or any language and when you're
adopting the literature when we adopted
this they're ones that many guys and we
had to look and we have use a lot of
early libraries to sort of fill in the
gap in the meantime
and now we'll be back is a good thing
because Joe's able Mina has been don't
French ELISA wrapper for Erlang library
because they are likely to release or
both compiled onto these zones are like
those in by code so they should live in
harmony but there were a lot of poems in
the early days with the way the
different libraries versus different
entities so but that's fortunately all
that's taken care of not and one of the
big things is the you understand that
each ability purchase program because
developers if you're working very well
what's the point of developing new
features for this because they're not
going to work result you might as well
not development at all and I think this
is probably just telling why for the for
the far side of things where they're
saying here's a potential
promise for this new language how we're
going to what are the types of people
you have to make in order to present to
happen and also you have to understand
that the lengthy code that we had was
hedging written by a number of people
over the years and you know there's
nothing in software is temporary there
are lots of pictures in there five or
six year olds six years old that this is
a temporary basis is possible and it has
things we never let cement in their
probation it's been around long enough
and while in the beginning we are the
complements basically we need to know is
not a part of the opposite half of the
problem and we can continue to develop
the legacy apps that are doing fine but
there are decent understanding that if
developers are continued because open
legacy app that means is going to check
those you have to rewrite that
potentially later in elixir and that's
ok because when you write them and when
you one of the sort of the nice things
about free reporting level of legacy
application code
was that if you don't even want to let
you to write it again do the jury
understand the logic in it and that's
the balance or a way to expand survey
knowledge in these headings and while
teacher development slowed for a while
in the end we'll come back to that a
little bit later and then intended to do
is keep I keep like we're a relatively
small development team of twenty or
twenty five developers but we have we
can't lose the type of campus I can't go
down we can't be too ambitious like
everything has just placed because we
have users who use the app and the site
all all around the world all your honor
of the day so admission before we
focused on these big big decisions and I
said that when you open the app then the
merging of the screens and that was
where we started to do but we didn't
just sort of say okay we're going to
make this the app offline I'm going to
do this but we managed to do was which
of all of the absent sort of goes all
over the content things and whichever
one with most Popkin sort of that by
rivers but River sorted by popularity so
this will lead popular strangely and
then after the Olympics throwing to make
people checking and blocking or your
size stream so we're able to sort of
play around with that and if the stream
account for you know an hour or how or
whatever they're likely warning users
and notice that because no one's
checking it and it also was still in a
time before kini
that's one point so then the Phoenix is
introducing pretty some changes as well
which means that yeah there's a time
where every week or every week there's a
new Phoenix release and we had to go
back and reevaluate the thing the way to
rewrite in code and the way that our
understanding Lister changes we'd adult
with it and so that gave us all a time
to do the things that we need to do is
get up to speed and we we use the
instance rewriter thought of using a
property to to not Ralph to go to based
on the content type and not constrained
to go Peter could be scenic average hip
Alexia
but there's another
a new Row 3 new library called terraform
certified boring 10 and it's a Phoenix
app that lets you basically do that it's
much more dynamic and it does a really
nice library because it gives you an
understanding of the request and
response lifecycle and the state
application so it's a really nice
teaching tool as well
now in our case we had at that time up
to speed on the comp constraint so every
time we had updated it was very clunky
and prone to errors so there's lots that
are ways to do it and then another
things anyone who's ever dealt with
legacy code or unmaking hones update
guide loads you know the way that data
changes or depending the retirement you
getting up with this sort of unwieldy
API they don't want to do it but because
you have iOS or android client that may
or may not be able to do some things or
this product will but you thought that
you end up sticking with it you have to
keep going and usually it was just
frustrating because we're ready to do
that in elixir which is fresh meat fresh
another game why do we have to use the
lazy response and so what we just doing
was a very simple thing where we had a
sensation layer and the new analysis on
the left is elixir and that's be behind
API to the way that we wanted it the
bill is like the average hospital
extract and just basically translates it
so that the clients both from the
website and doesn't be an android site
can still operate without any knowledge
that it has ever changed and this is
really nice for us because we did a lot
of change over the last over the first
year of development elixir not so much
to me I felt but there was one big API
change where we sort of any male point
sort of finally understood about how she
how model that is functional programming
and I'll come back to that sort again so
we wouldn't have been able to do these
projects presentations and we had to
every time we updated the the a theology
had to universally a guy or some decline
so these things are both about a lot of
times to be able to do what
whatever we wanted to do as long as the
lady app could translate that to the
client so that was really helpful in
instrumental in us getting our first
soldered sugar app in production and to
start seeing a benefit to loser and we
realized pretty quickly the benefit to
the loser in terms of server savings and
just overall performance and reliability
I mean 30 silver hiccups now again but
for the most part we were really
impressed with it so much so that at the
time we thought you know let's just
start with this one after they will be
up and go but Alyssa makes it an
employment heat that we expected to go
to that's return it and this was the
second sort of plan which is consistent
code at that time there are two or three
of us they were working on were to ask
the rest for working out either features
on Lydia or maintaining like it yes and
when the city started really early
villagers we just sort of get at how
things should go like because the work
we do that around a lot of purely PFS
directory structures very similar to
rail that people are familiar with the
interactors is not real but that we have
interactors directory which makes no
sense not the basic sort of subject but
it just isn't in any way and it helps if
you better but wonder they can drop
beneath in this being criticized for if
it has to learn thrills but it
especially a lot of these things for you
so that you can start to data so that
when you do start understanding concepts
you can take it and so on criminal theft
and then maybe that time you decide jump
Enix is too much second it was a mixup
with Claudia cowboy fencing but for us
it was really good for the teaching tool
to say here's how you do it and once you
get comfortable done then you can
explore to be pretty open and you can
sneak them in as well touch your back on
jumpy side of things and you can do so
you can do it okay pretty cool and at
this point Phoenix had finally reached
1.0 and going back to when I first
entered a bluish report like the reason
I joined later report was the team and
because I wonder right Alyssa and so we
had a simple event app that was pensions
that data credit cards
for articles because we we collate
articles and other content data from
different sources and we kind of parse
the data as we I ever had this problem
it was an internal a scope so once it
wasn't customer-facing but if you trying
to fetch to me to meet your old at the
same time that would you timeout this at
the second time I was in the internal
thing or it will just get your flows
unusable that we have tech issues filed
and it was you know didn't work well but
there's little simple is that one
controller just fish and it had models
based on the content type or different
types of content such as something that
sells want the simple things like
geniuses escalator kids for Lucia so in
my entrepreneurial sort of way I wrote
the up it took about a day that we put
interruption and having confidence we
realized that where's the list be asked
if you add multiple URLs to fetch be
kind of exponential increase in silicon
with the in Surat it was tiny in tiny
pieces for home so he's not getting it
we stopped messing we got the 50 girls
at one time because we never have used
to get rotisserie it was really nice and
rewarding to see how easy was to
breakfast link'll a peg to see that it
performed well so religion is rushing
and that's still production that which
is pretty focused I think it was like my
second week on the job but give it a new
language that giving I was still finding
out everything I really had no idea
right took time write code and elixir
get in the way so we're going to use
that as an example of how to write code
but how through having consistent coding
vendors she can make it better so this
is a function that's no longer the
newest on screen its first pair remains
for analysis
second it does the week three things
pretend the HTTP makes a request based
on a response either returns an error at
the bottom you can see or it returns a
body and it strips new on cursors and
it guesses based on what kind of content
hunted incidents it does in a return to
eventually so clearly I was raped by a
speaker because I have to both matching
by direction here I use the Python blue
pigment conditional and then you can
message do it with a function otherwise
um but so you know really bad I mean
this is been ailing so if there's no
juice that I should like with what I
knew about programming a device like I
never should have done this like but
yeah let's just
I will take that shape and carry with me
and so once we decide that elixir was
potentially something we could use
without imagine teaching someone else
high schooler or any of you impeaching
someone has beautified you to look at
this is your example how that means
you're going to have it's not going to
work so unfortunately you know let's say
that I requested this which I did and
around that time a library right okay
now which has been really helpful with
us the first standardized way
applications look the printer is a
static analysis tool went to the next
book credo is it doesn't just tell you
you're wrong and the recipe answered it
tells you you're wrong and this is why
your own and you can even first you can
zoom into the actual error itself like
it is a much more detailed response
which is really great because when you
service it you know you have people in
your learning elixir and every time
there's a problem you have to go to the
other developer or more experienced
developers day wise doing this or work
you just say okay this this library
culture is this I'm going to do this the
move on because if you don't learn
anything and also if you continue and
have to ask someone else why this
announcement too long you think
eventually either a or the stop asking
you because you're knowing the other
person or be a person
a few because they keep getting
interrupted in developers really don't
like being interrupted as we all know
and that means that in this economics is
very superficial thing by design so
there were no application logic
questions those are the questions that
developers come back other developers
and those are things that are
substituted things that you can actually
walk through and both sides alone is
enough so Kratos is opinion as every sin
alpha stool that is but Sicilian execute
is configurable so we sort of modifies
the things and so we have to basically a
standard prego configuration for all of
our apps now so now all of our apps at
least superficially impose the very much
insane which is a really which is great
because it takes something out of the
developers hands like I don't have to
worry you know as someone doing this
someone you have I know that because we
have quite a hooked up to our CI that
expect early warnings or errors and
we're not big build will fail I'll fix
it so that's that's a real relief for
everyone because everyone avocado
missing and cocaine code reviews or
whatever with bitches automatic and
consistent and and you know one of the
really cool things about the elixir
community over the last two three years
or so is that it's a homing transmission
hoping the way they did understand how
how the language itself works how how
feigning towards the Canadian public
three is going to be a big change and I
think it's like it's in the right
direction it was said earlier and x2 has
changed a lot as well we started with
active changes weren't even a thing
so change a surgically instructor
validate data before you proteins that
are modified into the database and we're
developer to crazy things before Texas
can also change that for a real real win
for us and everyone drinking sound but
credo is the version can create each one
has a new configuration and so you only
see if we like the changes if you like
to change you incorporate that as we
don't we we leave them with another time
but it's nice to see everyone in the
community sort of learning as we grow
together so you run photos it will tell
you that this function is too long
complex and bad
play to that for Turk's way but that's
essentially the meaning so it's so the
first thing then yeah we should do is I
would would recommend someone's where
the function is is doing too many things
so it's pretty apart into simpler
functions so this is something like this
the name is still terrible but now it
tells a story
you see exactly what's going on each
function each try the function does one
name it's four month URL within the data
and format a common site
another thing is that I think it really
changed the way that we were to think it
in sense through getting words what kind
of content we have we we have content
types so let's declare design is my - we
died okay I replace the element again
and so on so it gathered a lot of books
that way because we had a lot of bugs
with sort of guessing as to what kind of
content we are going to do and very
explicit and I think that I'm not sure
this is something that a lizard or niche
Jose has sort of champion or this is
sort of an early thinking that elixir
has adopted but explicit is very
important I guess even in sort of you
have to explore your function and notice
it in line so maybe some is best came
from her life but I like exposing its
origin message you don't get you to
space that the way you do
it's very extensible as well now any 22
any time we have a new carpet
not change that in your function here
and the things got big we could break it
apart into other things but it's much
easier to do it this way than the way we
have better performing on the bridges
function you have you would go all the
way at the stage into the first row
certainly in the series put in is the
next thing that I really like to get
hectic and dilated
and Simon and we're both onto the
dialyzer and extracts and one of the
presents is that people can argue about
functioning like a functioning
possession there's other people in the
audience that
why don't you do that but with high spec
series it's not only up for debate
dialyzers best your writer you're wrong
and I think that's a really good thing
there's a list article at new at the top
originally by credit very cold the
neverland and he has little quotes about
about dialyzer and it's event or maybe
is in the life of indifference
this one way is saying that he thought
he found a bug and I loved it but it was
turned out that a laser print was
corrected he was wrong and it has a
subjective metric measure and so what
your function does as to what it takes
I would outfit I think it's really
really good what is it serious thing I
mean people can get a witch's Mira wary
of silage or in high spec in general
because the error that you get back for
confusing and can be kind of
overwhelming especially if you retro
actively decide tex-mex and you have
thousands of errors which we sort of
things but you know that if you wanted
to go but I think with Google search
means they're easy to find the answers
to these things so if you think kind of
people to think who are interested in
learning a listener will probably be
able to use a computer to find the
results of why there is doing this
incorrectly to help with our there's
more about about how functions operate
and open another interesting thing is
that that learner doesn't seem to care
about the specificity is so let's do
that so change that an example it's so
you can use a map and dialers rule
passes if it returns a map and you can
use the struck at the output and
islanders dialyzer is okay with that as
well because this drop is just the name
map and then finally an estimate change
that it's okay with that as well because
it's just a specific struck which i
think is interesting to hear the i who
kind of surprises and that you could do
this sort of cascading certainty but the
point is the same is a type of map i
guess and i would be the more specific
union the better because that's the
point of doing it so let's go as the
function the public function so this is
how you cut it high spec is you ruin it
take the string and it returns an embed
so within that you can design custom
types which provision earlier ago I
think it's really nice in some ways I
prefer this documentation or anything's
easier to read in documentation because
yourself subjectivity about it I mean
you can even make a type for this and
type URL which would be even more
specific so it becomes exactly obvious
what's going on but in general caps URL
here happiness here is a way for you
know in case your pilot experience rolls
and down this is I can clear not so I
don't think that this is clear enough
documentation wise because the function
name is so terrible we have no idea what
it does we know what the implicit is but
we don't really know why this is named
that way so which ones up to
documentation now I think like the onion
playing that Josie the collective
working have done put a lot of work in
is making sure the documentation is like
is of primary importance in elixir
exactly which it earlier if you go to a
text document is the doc condition there
that all use that both formatted X X
table so we really have no excuses to
not read with documentation when Jen
speech was announced like it was last
year there's a slide which Jose had
working said where it said that Jim page
had a thousand lines of codes and eleven
hundred lines of documentation and
that's not by accident like business
this is the process something that that
I think the list recording is really
time to push we get if you look at this
there's libraries they're very well
documented in it and that's a really
nice way to get involved and they took
nearly as well because something you
know documentation is subjected if you
look at some Excel function it doesn't
make sense to you and you want to
contribute and make a pull request and
added applications exhibits which
they're cooking things thrilled to have
people make documentation request
because by making the documentation
clear that means more people be coming
into the community and it should also be
ways to get started with the open source
and
kind of things so what doesn't mind let
that indoctrination just how you thought
functions are is up then and jump
attempt efficient extraction is done at
URL and formatted according to the
defined constantly so that's the nature
and one of my things I think and I don't
do this in practice right after by the
internet idea is that if you Dappy your
functions first you have missile model
exactly what your function should do and
then also help with naming and that also
helps with just understanding exactly
how the data flow through your
application so with that in mind let's
rename it so fetch and extract and that
primary obstacle a better than four but
in you can and having the respect having
a dot and then the function with this
sort of readable English makes that it
makes it even someone who's never really
program before along with the understand
English so you can have some idea of
what this function does compared to the
beginning function which is perhaps we
have no idea what that would do
and so what's the you know what is well
between us do like to talk about code
consistency and why this is important
and this me is sort of it this is sort
of like the rough drafts and leading up
to the code review I know that I guess
people have mixed feelings on code
reviews like I work accompanied to EE do
code reviews of working companies to do
an essential or sort of menacing code
reviews which are really terrible I
think your mission report we've we have
a nice with some nice balance with sort
of reason anything of I don't think of
code reviews is something to I when I
first started programming I would always
be nervous or like even like my first
full requested weight report as very
nervous because here you hear it you
know coding is it's not a science it's
in many ways the creative endeavors in
art form that you because you can do a
lot of things in similar ways but and
you can do it in any ways or in elegant
ways and it's you know it's a little
creation that you may be sort of help
the blank page and you've created
something so
when you just look if you don't have
this code standards in place you throw
your code up you have two idea what what
they look how people are going to
respond to the code it may be didn't
know maybe they have an idea of how
things to water or so on and so forth
but since we have these standards in
place both the reviewer and the
developer know exactly what to expect
and it becomes much easier if you don't
have a big thing to plate then you
shouldn't submit the code for court for
a full request there's an input I didn't
stretch up go because it's read like HSL
a button in designing for scalability
was early in OPP early facilitate
solving any of these problems
concurrency the bullet point scale has
availability zones on fault on but at
the end of the day is still just economy
language heading into the crucial being
because especially with all the high
fidelity and the waters well deserved
but the one the hype has got a real
obstacle here is that it's not a magic
bullet it's not some potion that will
solve your problems there's a
programming language it does these
things very very well but it's up to you
to be Villas vicious vigilance and to
and to do the due diligence order to
reap the benefits it's not going to do
it for you so back to this motor view we
sort of got over these bullets except
for testing but so whenever a pull
request is submitted the site analysis
has already been run
tech specs are course it's the word in
progress but I'd like to have Oliver EPS
be at second light the functions of
document is and we also have API
documentation in elkhorn and we have
good test coverage which a lot a bit
more about but this is basically
describes the state of the poor request
before the student interview
in addition to that we have sort of
company-wide standard that we put in
place before service and this is not for
robust dependable boosters before an
application is released into production
so we have service review which sort of
the engineering leads come together and
decide how you know what's important
elixir out what's important to note out
how do we evaluate you know how
testing a new logging so we sort of take
all of this essential but in some way
sorting stuff and take it out of the
hands of developers and say this is how
you know this is how we as bad bass
performance
how would you laundering this how we do
monitoring this how to do arrows error
handling and so on and so forth so it
becomes sort of a checklist it's like
okay I've done it I've done it and
because you know if one person likes one
library or one person another library
then you know which one do I use is up
to me as it's coming up so my
standardizing is across the company it
makes it a lot easier and it becomes
just it's wrote the toilet place you do
it you check it out and with all this is
waiting up to is that you focus on the
code in the code review and also with
the developers you don't have to worry
about which logging library do I use or
so on and that doesn't mean that our
standards don't change it just means
that at this time at this point time
this is how we do things and it is might
change so our standards or vistas I
guess they're moving slowly whether
they're fairly set in their ways and by
having standards in place so much easier
on the developer and on the reviewer
because it's I mean I'm just as guilty
this is anyone but if you're busy in
someone's to review their code and
you're looking through and you see
inconsistencies and naming or spacing
you say let's fix these and then code
reviews which are backed and that's
really the antithesis of what a code
review should be you really need to
focus on the application logic and when
newer developers are doing learning
a-lister we spend a lot more time with
in the code reviews and what's one of
the really cool things about having sort
of been one of the first at which
reports they use to learn elixir and to
start teaching other people about it is
that when these people who you've been
teaching structuring things in ways that
you've ever done so you start learning
from them as well and I think that's
really a really wonderful thing to
happen to to see how they have sort of
understood a problem and they came up
with the solution that you had no idea
or that you wouldn't have done and in
turn it becomes a two-way street the
code review is essentially an editorial
review and editor
and like if you have a pair publishing a
book even if you're the greatest you're
born a sword I know how it's not
something everyone has an editor and
having this place means that you'll get
a lot more out of it and so the final
sort of penance or or pillar is training
developers you know when we first
started their work it was sort of self
selecting who was using a lipstick like
who was interested elixir and and you
can see who was excited about it it
wasn't excited about an event and the
Payette actually worked out very well
because it everyone was really want to
use a litter we have a problem because
we still need to have developers
maintain legacy code so once we defend
its her goal and with the lip so we had
we thought okay so and from this point
on any consumer making apps will have to
be written into it sir and maybe
internal tools we can still write those
in another language but it makes a lot
more sense to already some summer
savings for performance we have to use a
literary at that point you know it's
like there's sort of three groups I
guess there's people who are excited
about a new technology that it's equal
to or a sceptical image people who just
have no interest in it and they want to
do things the way they've always done so
you should expect some pushback I mean
this is people we're all creatures of
habit we all like to have our property
the same way we all want the same way to
work or we do things in the same way and
ask someone to say to take something
that they're comfortable with and do
something that is familiar and
unfamiliar and different way there's
going to be something better so and for
the way that we Abraham we overcome that
was to make it as easy as possible
don't be antagonistic you know I think
it resists earlier that recursion was
one of the difficult things that people
think up and with and with teach and
develop ability I've got this recursion
for whatever reason is if this was to
teach end so one of the often asked
question was so how do you do
and literally what you've written and
it's one of the things that you don't
have understand you either understand it
or you don't
and so making easy means that you'll sit
down you'll go over it today just you
know you start with the simple case and
then you build up and it's pretty wild
to see how quickly you know the light
goes on in their eyes and then suddenly
they know reversion and they go back and
they do things that they want to do and
another thing by having these imports
and code reviews for newer developers it
means that you can sit down and go over
the code and one of the things that we
found to be successful is they you know
test matter of course test matter in any
context but when you're teaching someone
that I wrote a new language and executed
for instance it's very easy to use very
easy to get up and running it's very
easy to to to cover your test cases and
we use a library called X coveralls so
we can measure test coverage it measures
percentage but I don't really care if
you have ninety-six percent average or
99% or 100% that doesn't here you can if
you have a hundred percent at unit test
then you know things are not going to
potentially be hit is the way you've
prepped to do and you know every now and
again they'll be something like health
but only gonna test an adorable plot
back and forth but but has by extra role
also to show you that they be code that
you have covered so you can have a much
more confident idea of the tests or are
effective or not and so by having these
tests in place the neck means that you
can sit down and you can refactor
competently because if the tests are
passed in your outpatient probably
doesn't you know in science behaving as
expected
so people were as you would expect
Bionic ruby ish code you know myself
included when I started I was sort of
using Ruby idioms and elixir and they
sort of worked I mean because it works
but it wasn't idiomatic and so teaching
people how to move away from your
statements or using case statements are
using function definition this is a
really nice way to teach them how to do
that and it was really well because all
of our back-end developers are the co
developers now it's decision it will you
know ups and downs right but
assessment to the system that we put in
place and also our developers who were
who were keen to learn this new language
you know another thing that glasses so
how have you find a list of developers
you have to hire developers there aren't
that many others result if you hire
airline developers or what are the
qualifications that you that you look
unless so we when I first started which
is what we did for to the white board
interview or you do something for a
tricky question and if you memorize it
then it you've been write it and you can
do it for the enterprise but it really
has to tell you it's not how you're
fitted a let works so we since we're
traditionally root shop we give them a
place where our interview process works
with you do phone interviews to sort of
you know if there are the bits that are
on their CV it's a nice way to gauge
interest in elixir Joe why are you
following it which news you know who
these people are and what people Ivory's
do and it's a good self if it is
selecting process and then depending on
whether the person is familiar with
Luther or not will give them a coding
challenge which is which is essentially
a contest that's very similar to think
of it you do it work like it
depending on the if you're a junior
developer senior so I will just attest
accordingly but it's always like to
measure to the test
not to how well you know Ruby or how
well you know Lister but how does it
have you designed an API what you know
how you think critically like these are
things that you can't really teach I can
teach I'm going to think critically but
if they know Ruby really well I can
think it particularly in a critical way
it's pretty likely that we can transfer
those skills to a listen so that's how
we've hired rich each other elixir
developers to have come on and several
it's almost Amelie sort of one of these
I guess missing the vetting about lizard
is that because our problem is so stable
now we don't have to hire people so
we're doing a lot more with a lot less
or what's the same so that's a good
thing as well some so I thought for a
while about these different things and
you know they have probably all sound
well good but you know just are they
effective how long have we been able to
measure success first of all it's an
ongoing process I mean you know it's
three years now
we're still courting legacy code the
last sort of
chunk world I hope I really hope that we
have done by the end of the year because
so that will be a relief for everyone
and finished earlier our standards are
changing as we understand how to do
lifter better how to read their lips or
code also we move from Lala's to sort of
micro services e-type architecture and
blenders and how our lives are worse we
switch things around a lot so I imagine
that in a year or two years or our
infrastructure or platform whole look
very different than it is now and we
have sort of a vision for where they
pitched a matter of figuring out the
best way to get their thing the stakes
happens I mean even in a different
experience programmer and in a language
you're familiar with you're going to
make mistake on when we sort of decided
to redo some of the schema we just
having the cycle down for a few hours oh
it was it was a problem but this is why
we program about the beginning about
having reasonable expectations is that
by pressing by front-loading the
potentially problems they're going to
eat stuff house between products and the
developers you know we all understood
that we're working towards towards a
common goal so you know we have to
average to never again but we're moving
toward something better and because we
had this promise up front it was it was
do a lot easier to work through those
together and contrast rapid development
to what I started in the beginning where
future developments load once we had
gotten the first iteration of our app in
production and was performing well
suddenly parts to play okay so we waited
for a year to get these features you
know Joe now is our kind of Euler put
yes what you promised us and one of the
long one of the apps for a long time was
different content actually sort of I
guess what makes Witcher 14 each now is
that we have a voice that people really
like there's our poll they called us the
amphibian sports which is funny because
the Jews like MTV is stated and it
sounds like the person who wrote that
article was probably in their 40s trying
to
but comments appreciate it it's so
appreciated and but but what I guess the
point is is that what makes richer
progeny now is the way that we tell the
story and if you only have a limited
number of content types it's harder to
tell the story so I think when we have
to litter at the production we had five
or six content types
and I think there are seven eight nine
coming like that that have been on the
back burner for Prague for a long time
and this is when we decided okay the way
that we've been doing things or having
any sort of technical models to the
database video type or so on that's not
that's not really a very good way to do
it it's very cumbersome and difficult is
every time you add a new content that
you have that a new table or later
migration and so with us change this is
a great way to do this so we were able
to take these changes and make a more
generalized database for general shared
content that has sort of they're almost
every type of content has common fields
that many other ones have more specific
deals but it was a way for us to to
quickly add all these other content
types
so this is a really nice way for a new
developer to contribute to look it up
immediately
so I'll give you a quick so this is
about an interchange of function one of
the apps for a long time was that be
able to be able to change the content
type so just like me to break news
they'll come with the tweet and then
they'll have an article or a video or
something to explain it in more detail
and this is what we wanted to do on the
app itself first go get the suite up so
people come to the app or those gonna
push notification immediately and the
app will either by the time they open it
they'll appear article up or they'll hit
they'll still have the tweak and then if
they go back to their article be in
place and that was really really
difficult to do before because again we
were kind of guess which kind of content
that but here we explicitly say this is
this constant time and we have a insert
change other enough they change their
functions because they just they behave
in slightly different ways when we want
to change the constant that and another
sort of thing
in hindsight it was really obvious was
that think if you look at the
documentation for changes they have a
definite change that or if you do guinea
fowl just change that and it's real
quick it's like I you can call it
whatever you want to doesn't matter if
it's just a function there's no sort of
magic here it's books which meant that
we could cast it and do a change that
and then we could do whatever we wanted
with that they sought to change that so
here we have the content type which
let's say was on an article then it
would validate based on that article
type so here's an example and this is
sort of what it looks like with the with
a lot of the television but nevertheless
you can see what's going on so just
article gif photo and so on and then
each of these validations can be
validated dependently and you can
combine them is I guess it's just you
think it's just functions but that's
really what it is and it makes it really
really simple and really easy to to
change new things so what you sitting
like a day for a developer to do and
involve migrations and accepting they
took a couple of hours and it was really
cool because the developer who is just
learning lipstick azules but you know a
very small number of lines of code and
then here in the app you can see
discreet you can do this discrete part
of the app that you did and you did in a
new language it was really cool and
because we were able to do so quickly we
did all of the remaining content a
couple weeks and then approximately had
a problem of too many options so now we
have all these options we don't know how
to use them effectively in the app so
there have been you are asked for
product or a comment that's for a while
because we're still sort of evaluating
how to do these correctly but it's been
really important to develop the voices
we should report and to develop how we
want to tell the story of the content of
the streams and one of the one of the
things that we focus on is this year
world if you open the app you can see
that we have sort of a big base for news
say screens so if you're a vocal fan or
River fans yeah so just a bonus then and
it says they have a really
sports don't know that they have a
soccer match they have a game anyway
something happens in Boca and so will
create a stream based on that event so
then you can tell the story and in here
a Boca fan we can present that to you in
a way that if your team is winning we
can make it a very happy stream and if
your team is losing we can convey that
emotion that you would expect for a team
for half of appeal as a battement your
team is losing and spend a different
experience we want to reflect that on
the applica than something that we've
been able to do with with this and with
the elixir in general and another way to
measure how successful we've done the
business to see the number of
contributors on all of our lives about
because I made this claim that we kind
of developed all of our back-end
developers and written code so we should
be able to see that looks like it
somewhere and number of contributors
isn't actually good so this is the model
that has been around to being upon blue
short time and there in 59 contributors
which you would think would be every
developer who imported Bleacher horrible
history of company but I have not made a
single contribution to that which I'm
very proud of I haven't even clone the
repo which is nice as far as that didn't
I made at after joining the to report
but now it really flat so this is the
first one we chopped 23 contributors and
spin out of 3 years of reduction out of
3 years in existence it so event after I
talked about the beginning home
interviewers about the amount of time
and this new athlete diminutive app and
it's been in production for about 10
months and number eight ten people
already worked on that and terminally
have 20 25 developers several I think
that's pretty pretty good
click validations are kind and I have
the lamp I think we're about 12 elixir
wraps approaching out but this metadata
I believe here because when and because
we've been able to we have the great
stable platform now and I'll talk about
a little bit a little bit more but we've
been able to do this sort of bio
secondary applications like this
metadata app like one of the things that
we should
early days with having very purple very
high ranking SEO meta data defending
them when we went through things shifted
to mobile we stopped sort of for
whatever reason putting an emphasis on
SEO and you know I'm not I don't know
what I feel but various things at Owen
and because we have two spare developer
hours who was like you know physically
we can do this relatively low hanging
fruit and we get better at app and so
now all basically every part of every
article literally got bleeped reporter
or every time you go to page W report we
have a massive amount of data about that
and it depends on if it's breaking news
hasn't forgotten its game that's where
data and it was a relatively simple app
to write but it's something that has
paid off really really well for us and
sort of the final claim is the NFL Draft
so it's in the Union essentially we you
can some of our biggest traffic spikes
have been through on expected breaking
news and the and before then FL dropped
our biggest traffic spike was jinx five
or six years ago whatever majors longer
whatever LeBron James was from Cleveland
to the east that was our highest number
concurrence and know that it was
expected because he was winning out
something but it wasn't like the NFL
Draft so Dennis I've got consistently
either our high traffic night of the
year or before one of the highest and
this last draft who was in April and it
was the first year that all of our core
components have been auditor and it was
really important that this doesn't fail
because in the past we like to for for
your nose there's some problems with the
draft and basically this draft is the
barometer for how well they doing him is
doing so everyone makes this very
seriously and I was very nervous because
I've been championing alizarin United
earlier and just person especially in
fencing and yeah
what failed about the ISIS the
automobile at the front and because
nothing can go wrong
we everyone's on call everyone's in the
office so I think that we were trapped
started five and it went so nineteen
specific time and in the past year
yeah we stayed around so eight thirty
nine just make sure everything was going
well so the draft started rolls for
observers are sitting around we have the
family analytics dashboard up waiting
and the first the first it goes in and
all of our phones start you know we get
the chirp for the notification of
success that's great you know things are
working and then traffic spikes to the
point where I was our highest numbers
concurrence by more than thirty thousand
and it's about fifteen minutes so we're
coming you know I don't remember the
exact numbers but it was huge like and
as I'll show in a third and it covers it
for a while and you know we had like we
have sort of rough times about where we
feel like we should we can handle
traffic and it just defines it sorta
theory I mean was working we're just
sitting there and it was it was a really
nice feeling it by about six o'clock we
were being tacos and they're not 6:30
everyone went home and it was by far the
most successful dress we've ever had and
it was really insensitive to everyone in
the development tired on the product
side there's we've been able to pull
this off you know basically moving in
part from a lacing system to a brand new
system and one this performed really
really well since I can talk forever
apparently our push notifications was
another thing is oh really really really
excelled uh I'll just give it a quick
blurb but it was really you know he
talked to your stakeholders and saying
we want to do this new thing this new
language because it give us compared to
whatever it sort of goes over their head
what does that do for me and what is not
really the push notifications was
something that if you can consistently
deliver notifications the fastest then
people got be more like to the user app
but if you consider if you deliver
notifications in Sicily
we're going to look to competitor death
or just or align your app at all so we
had our previous iteration with what
kind of funky kept agility slow
operations and then it sent out all the
notifications it was on a new Alyssa rod
it immediately charts sending a
notification so within Lincoln is a 100
millisecond before saying you ain't
updating the app I was another vegetable
game we got tickets to work and what the
game was just answered my phone buzz
with the final score so it was really
nice and it was something that the
product people know because they have
the Predators after our ass and we're at
was considerably faster it really is a
validation of that the people who
program the streams the content
programmers they will you know they're
like what you guys done this amazing it
was so much better now and people on
Twitter responded positively with low as
a nice and someone burgeoning but to
express their support and admiration for
being a push notification system so that
was really nice one so these are the
spikes further the first night of the
the first visible weekend of the NFL
Draft is Thursday
this is a Friday night and you can see
and each round of the draft happened
it's less traffic our temp was already
spiky because it's Trevor versus an orc
or drastic Twitter's were you know sort
of things and so clearly we had some
have some big fight but had to be
performed this isn't a hundreds of
seconds so it's like 120 percent I and
this so
our highest spike was well looks like a
third of a second which is pretty good
we want to have our goal is to have
everything sub 100 milliseconds for
these outliers kind of bother me but I
think there is a file measures it's
generally good and validates that we are
having success with a lizard and you
know from a personal sample is missed
earlier like this giveth time to stress
and developing like I don't like
fighting fires are like being woken up
in the middle and I to deal with a
catching problem like I really enjoy
what I do and I think all of us probably
enjoy these about
wouldn't be here that funny got new
things they've had and it's really
demoralizing to not spend time
developing and I think that obviously
which report is benefited obviously the
developers do benefit but for me
personally like in addition to that like
I get to do what I enjoy without being
interrupted or without being Eruptor
less and so that's a really really
really great thing that for me like this
is the core of why you should consider
nothing a literature because you either
spend time doing what you love and just
appear my parrot talks about Hong Kong
availability we're not quite there yet
but working George's the goal that we
want half and finally just they believe
in I'll Christian I reading a book
called adopting elixir classic trust me
you have much better sources to trust in
Jose Andres should be a sport end of the
year and the whole idea is that they
were sort of a gap in the market between
learning a language and how to apply all
the things so this should be a less
Remley version of the talk with much
more information and the idea is that
you can get the information you know do
what you have is in the language this
will help you get the get into
production and monitor and all these
things that so I think that'll be really
good if this is something you consider
so and finally
hi-yah right before your last live on
hold again from Gaza so today I mean
yourself information liquor online now
and you know look at our length that's a
lot of the things as well because you
learn a lot from that the illiterate
slash channel it's really really really
warm and hardening and they will answer
most questions which is one of the
really nice things about the electric
community that is very inclusive and
very welcoming so with me and there's
nothing like oh it's a radar I think
that's the platform attack a weekly
newsletter which have results of the
topics and then there's little weekly
which is by Renee who's the author of
trade up so those are also good sources
to find information so that I think that
that should probably covered in the book
should be up for the year so yeah so
it's not too much longer okay
no way to go through the program
haha former Louisville sir well what the
hardest part for you start working on
returner start doing it okay Mexican
questioning how much of the of the great
concern that you have with the elite era
one from Lindsay harmonies from the
previous knowledge that other developers
on the team were having from Leia I
think that there's probably people once
we understood the problem Saturn so that
we wrote an illustrative was who's there
and because this is different sort of
mentality like eight years ago
traffic was not subordinate now mobile
traffic so most important but we
actually join probably the developers
then try wrote the same app in Ruby is
approval concept rooted in overture and
you later on I'll perform the review so
I think that I don't have details as a
supervisor but there was a I mean from
this is my complete they didn't really
want to use a new language we've been
using around forever so why would you do
something on it on a relatively untested
language but a dealership outperformed
it and we actually trying to do some
sort of crazy thing with great in Ruby
to mimic concurrency and iterative you
know you don't threaten Ruby it's going
to bite you at some point and it really
causes some problems so I think that
even with the domain knowledge I think
the daily traffic would've outperform
the the other out but yeah it's earlier
like illicit or like not good for many
things with the makes it not good at
doing so as long as you followed in that
demanding elixir is the better choice or
not just for much for Ruby ending who
than it is a paradigm shift just because
with multi-core
built in Antigua 97 was when like the
research team and Ericsson first started
with multi-core early and and so hurling
were multi-core support wasn't an
afterthought it was built into the
language BM brother so just like the
fact that the number of scores increase
literature where elected will become
more efficient sorry I think that it's
hard to make it ours meant for anything
the liquor knocking on door my donger or
whatever who only have you allotted
something that are like this creative
energy
I saw was for some folks will be
developer and I am stronger they were a
little bit about the hardest part for
homes making their shapes from one to
the other
see I think the because my tactic
remembering with closure in the past
like I think that would have been a
hardest cooking the recursion internal
understanding a new immutability and
that would be the hardest but I think
the hurts part was sort of figuring how
to monitor how to how to measure how an
app is performing not just because with
the ruby app in Russian if the CPUs at
dividing and another instance with the
interrupts it doesn't she used for
monitoring how your app is performing
and then we started using a calendar
that was that was probably the hardest
thing was dealing with the Erlang
libraries kind of trying to parse that
or like quoted kind of resolve
dependencies that was really visible to
accessories accelerated every third or
five or six seven different dependencies
so it are mixed file it was we had
include all the dependencies and then
override through all of them and then
when every whenever any one of them
updated one of their libraries and we
had to do go through that process again
and again so that was the first part of
England's just even with those
dependencies in the beginning
any commercially already allotted but
piercing on health I understand you to
the decision was made before answer but
how do you sell you know to people that
make the decision to make a ship to such
a younger technology if you treat it
like an experiment and then you see
other son I think the the time I think
the candidates were no going elective
and there was a proof concept and a lot
of the things I've talked about like a
documentation contracted balancer of the
selling point also the fact that elixirs
new bitterling is not new and in the in
the existed for whatever reason or
length or literature failed to pick up
we could always move back to her life
because if we if we learn how to use
elixir then we can probably learn new
your life context to figure out how to
do that so I through hedged our bets but
it was a really big gamble I could've
blown up horribly wrong
but it worked out really well i you
mentioned that and now you have kind of
like services who you expand a little of
that how you communicate are using a
email video to be years of ligament yeah
so i part of what we did was i was
taking things beside it so we sort of
identify from shall be moved into
service in what you'd expect and for a
lot of the averages we were using HDD
called and now we're moving towards next
page rather than Q but because our
priority was it is working it doesn't
have to be the best solution like we
have a lot of things that we can improve
on and sort of how each service talk to
each other is one of them
another thing is deployments like we
when we started there weren't really any
resources on how to do it so we put the
app in it in a container and entered an
elastic Beanstalk which again is not
ideal but it's worth going up for us and
now that we've got not well no we solved
the problems that were causing us all
these headaches now now
goal is to realize how the stock
together how that how they're structured
and also how we deploy the apps hi so
wondering um right now in the program
world
we're trying to make decision we move
many from a REST API t4 global person
clock uppers and I was wondering if you
have an experience that because I've
seen very little library server to
fibrates opportunities for linker oh
yeah that's we have to every month lease
or have an architect's review board
meeting lee certain size like for
longer-term projects and continually not
backing up last month and that's
something that we're trying to that's
something that we want to evaluate and
better way to instead of using a rest or
JSON to use something else but I really
I asked for that by the way something
that best they were considering in your
question
my vision is a pure experience on the on
the market
I actually mentioned that to some
interview subject into the template
sporty similitude neutralino to people
so you will be come EC is to meet or to
get l1 programmers in the US market I
think it depends on the industry thing
but for us we actually haven't
interviewed any Erlang programmers all
of the applications are that consider
comfort evidence Ruby developers who are
interested elixir or sort of elixir like
starting a little developers 100
vertical time
Bowie so we have a monthly knee up like
three years ago we started the wizard
meetup in a dust and then there is an ER
likely at the dinner around for a lot
longer and so we will organize with that
and then Francesco and and coming from
an apprentice go and Harrow up aisle hi
I'm Alex and I know mr. president we
searched and stuff it'll be a good idea
to combine the two and the nine
certificate though we can see sort of
what the each other creative doing the
via loops remain I mean you really can
learn a lot about the theme and we also
and the other two are there like meeting
is there one about different things of
you ladies doing so the answer question
I think that I must have order our
meetups we have I think probably
three-quarters to our other developers
and a quarter or Orlan developer so I
think mostly online developers are
employed at drilling developers words
probably have to be with the developers
are so are just copies
developers allowed one is there any
certification or I know they already
asked you about materials but there is
certification or I know of course that
will they will take you to pick one
candidate over the other no I mean I
like to have a maternity certification
as they do is very workshops and
different places so that Pauline time
ago yet with their likeness course and
other courses so obviously if you have
if you completed that then that shows
down the you're interested but thank you
to this you know I'm interested a lot of
things where I'm not competent to know
things necessarily but if I've gone to
the effort to get certified with one of
these courses and that's a big leg up
yeah
thank you a whole lot well good for you
yeah so I heard up you just have to walk
it with movie developer that they were
turning into 82 so probably take for you
to change a developer intuitive a lot
what would be basically diluted in a
teacher I knew that it was a person you
know some people pick up in wonder the
others but if we basically start play
with learn using like that programming
with the book or the textbook just to
understand like the since madness and
connect with the language and then we
would give them small sort of course
chunks functionally they requested a
legacy code or sub that they'd written
and then they debris write it into
liquid because make it sort of take it
or do it as well as they could and then
having the impersonal reviews was a way
for us to teach more idiomatic elixir
and I see like two to three weeks before
their first videos in the production and
then a couple months and they're
reporting on
an app by themselves or with or without
with a team
