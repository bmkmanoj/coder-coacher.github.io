this title when I originally submitted I
was just thinking of different words
that were associating with some concept
I was playing around with and I sort of
strung them together kind of in a
possibly gimmicky way but there are some
interesting reasons I picked these
specific 33 words so why is there we go
so first of all before I go into each
words each of the words I want to kind
of touch on a overarching theme here
sorry I want to talk about the the fact
that era laying makes trade-offs and we
all know this really well it's not the
fastest language it's not the the most
safe language it's not even the most
dynamic language in many senses it's not
the most scalable language depending on
what you're doing we're still working on
you know the many many many core world
and there are tools that maybe Trump air
laying in in doing that in some areas
but erling is very deliberate with every
single trade off it makes and all of
these capabilities build a really rich
environment and every time we we use our
lang all of those things are at our
fingertips and if we're not really
orienting ourselves to take advantage of
all of these things it just goes to
waste and we're just wasting all of
these great features and i'll be going
over one of them today specifically so
live don't worry this doesn't mean live
coding i'm really i thought of doing one
live experiment where the failure of the
experiment was actually the points that
way I you know demo gods could not fail
me
I would just crash a node by showing how
tracing can go out of hand but live
means all of these sorts of topics i'm
going to talk about our live systems and
things while you're not necessarily
running them in a harness you're
actually touching live real code real
code path stuff that you would actually
run in production even if it's during
development distributed is important
everything you do in air laying is
somewhat distributed in this process
sense but there are also you know the
the dist oral components to to consider
and this is a this is a really
interesting point where problems come up
and where limitations of sort of easy
ways of thinking break down and we can
talk about why that's a problem with
tracing and spying the interesting thing
about this word is that we can do a lot
of instrumentation and there were some
really great talks on instrumentation
but the problem with a lot of that is
it's sort of forward-thinking
instrumentation where you need to place
something in your code like a log
statement or some sort of code that
emits some metric to another system that
can be collected or some sort of point
that can be configured explicitly to
give you behavior you want the specific
intent here is to take airline code and
somewhat spy on it without the airline
code needing to adjust itself to your
needs at that point in time you can
extract very very rich information out
of the system and you know even while
writing this talk I was surprised by
some things I didn't even know I had
access to get and hopefully I'll be able
to share some of those now when I first
submitted this talk I was also working
on this little experimental tool a
clouding it was a tool that was sort of
born out of this idea of using tracing
to an
hence some of our testing of our system
as well as troubleshooting of similar
problems in production there were some
really interesting similarities between
the two and i'll talk more about the
similarities that you start hitting when
you're doing types of development and
air laying and operations in ER laying
in bed it's a really unique thing I
think to the air laying and OTP system
but yeah so I submitted the talk
brilliant you know I will work on it and
then hopefully show when I would I what
I built at the at the end so so the next
step was I had this first prototype I
call this the fancy toaster but really
it was like okay I have the specific
problem and I have a really slick way of
solving it and it was basically a way to
extract this information automatically
using little little declarative terms so
they were kind of like properties if
you've ever used property based testing
be able to say I expect these things to
be called and with the arguments I
expect this model to hold for what what
you observe and it worked in a couple
cases but it was really really easy to
break one problem with that is you don't
always have very clear one thing in one
thing out patterns in your code you
could have one thing in and a thousand
things out and deciding when you have
enough of those things to make a choice
or specifically which ones to ignore in
some cases became harder and harder so I
started thinking more about this actual
prototype and said well maybe i can
adjust maybe i just need something
simpler and then i can tell the system a
little more about what i want
specifically rather than leaving it so
automatic that it feels magic so that
was prototype 2 you know okay fine i
won't build the toaster but i'll make it
really really easy to get what I need
out of this and this this prototype was
was fine but the the issue here is it
wasn't much better than just
a couple extra handy functions here
they're on top of you know otherwise
standard airline features and the big
things ended up being mostly things like
safety features if you're in production
the last thing you want to do is
overload the system just because you
were curious about what type of data was
being passed into some function and that
that I've done a couple of times
fortunately not in any completely
earth-shattering ways but I've
definitely crashed nodes doing this so
this this was a learning process of sort
of how to do it safely but it didn't
necessarily feel like it was moving the
ball forward for me so I kind of went
back to the concept so prototype 3 I
started thinking more about what the
different parts were that I was dealing
with what what if this bigger problem of
doing doing all of this work setup and
teardown and gathering of information
and the analysis wasn't actually one
problem it was a series of problems and
that what I really didn't want was this
one simple thing I actually wanted
something completely different and what
what I could have done was built a
series of simpler tools so the context
for this whole process of prototyping is
worthwhile to know because it's it's an
interesting way to think about the
differences between developing and using
some of these features of airline versus
other languages so I work at a company
called clouding and basically every
single employee without exception is
involved in the day-to-day running of
the business now for some people this
means they're there on support will be
answering emails but for much of the
engineering team unless they're actively
developing something there
doing operations work and this
operations work is basically you know
the direct equivalent of you know making
sure things are running smoothly and if
your code that you applied last week has
issues then you're going to pay the
price if someone else's code does the
same you're going to pay the price and
so the way the team dynamic works the
way your own code review works the way
you feel about developing changes and it
pushes a lot of different pressures on
on your development that wouldn't
otherwise exist so this sort of
responsibility pushes you to start
re-evaluating you know what's okay
because you're not just sort of going to
an iteration releasing a product and
then doing some QA and then getting a
bug report back you're literally
responsible for actually working and you
will be up late if it doesn't you'll get
paged when you don't want to if it
doesn't this sort of thing brings a lot
of creativity to the table there's a lot
of there's a lot of room for I guess I
would call it change in your natural
trade off as a developer if that's where
you're starting or if you're an operator
and you do some of the development that
changes as well you start understanding
why there are limitations with how
things are actually run and what can be
done to simplify that so you know maybe
a better title for this talk would be
one of these being a creative operator
or you'll never develop the same way
again which is very true after after a
few months at Cloudant and even today so
I'm not going to go over all of these
other things these are things that I
could easily talk about in the same
context there were great talks Brian's
talk yesterday morning on
instrumentation
at Admiral was great really shows the
value of having information so you can
make decisions very often you have a lot
of that information but you need more
and we'll talk about where some of these
things come in during testing how you do
testing and airline it's really tough to
to know ahead of time what's going to
work and what's not there are tests on
there were talks on property based
testing and those sorts of things I'm
not going to go into that either and
best practices ideas on you know how to
actually roll your releases or you know
all of those sorts of things are out of
scope as well so this is all about
tracing so a couple quick asides because
some people might disagree with some
things I say this is not necessarily
saying you shouldn't be using certain
preventive mechanisms and focusing on
those when you can you know your unit
tests and hopefully even property based
tests are huge huge benefit but likewise
there's a lot of code that just doesn't
fit well into that if it's not a state
machine and if it's not a pure function
a property-based test isn't necessarily
going to be easy to write or even write
correctly and you may find that you have
something that you think covers what you
what you want but dud doesn't actually
generate all of the cases that could be
problematic and production likewise
there are lots of ways those things slow
you down at the wrong points in time I I
do believe that a lot of organizations
need to invest in in their tooling and
basically know where they're going and
be smart enough to stay the course and
say okay this is going to hurt now and
we'll get there but if we take a
shortcut and don't invest in this kind
test of this kind of coding practice
then it will hurt us down the road
that's great but also you know
businesses live and die and you need to
release a product sometimes so there's
going to be a balance to strike so the
other part to this is it's okay to be
dynamic it's okay to not be formally
verified it's okay to actually not be
sure how things will work in every
single case as long as you know what
your course is going to be in what
that's going to affect so err laying
which is really mostly beam and OTP with
some syntax so I don't know how many
people here have actually started you
know as a developer in Erlang just
breeding the source code I highly
recommend this it's not necessarily easy
to go through some of this code some of
its really old so sometimes that's a
little painful to go through some of it
C code that is much harder and it's
portable c code so in terms of
portability you're going to have a lot
of if deaths in there and you're going
to have to sort of figure out what code
is actually being run in some cases and
that that can be really challenging but
it's worthwhile doing because you see a
lot of ideas and UCL useful the use of a
lot of things you wouldn't know
otherwise existed and techniques that
seem to just sort of be lost or implicit
and implied and not really shown
anywhere in the documentation so yeah
fortunately a lot of air laying is in
Erlang so leveraging this code base is
sort of an example a pool of things you
can learn from is really beneficial I
also recommend looking at you know what
things compile to there's you know
quarreling there's the beam code that I
is actually generated and there's the
actual bytecode that's run below that if
you really want to see that as well
these are these are interesting to look
at and they're part of how i would
recommend discovering things like our
lang trace now the other link trace API
is more than just this call but if we if
we look at trace 3 i'm just going to go
ahead and click through on this think
should open a tab is it opening now just
do this okay i'm not online so i guess i
won't show this actually maybe if i drag
this over here this is a cool program
called dash and I've got offline copies
of lots of different sorts of
documentation so air laying and we can
go to trace here I just wanted to show
this will kind of go over some of this
but it's got a lot of things to go
through a lot of a lot of different
things you can be aware of call is
probably the most common thing people
think about when tracing is said but
we've got returns we've got exiting and
running so if you want to know when
something scheduled and in what order
things are being scheduled running is
amazing because you can basically get
exactly that information will talk about
the caveats with that garbage collection
it's actually really great to be able to
start measuring and saying oh yeah we've
got a lot of garbage over here i'm
curious how much it's it's actually
cleaning up versus versus holding maybe
i've got a leak somewhere and you can
you can actually look at what the what
the common start and end times are as
well as heap sizes now the interesting
thing about garbage collection is you
could you can still do you know airline
GC and sort of compare before and after
but you don't really have the same sort
of natural flow point for that
a lot of those you know selecting the
right processes to do that on and can
also be difficult without tracing so I'm
not going to go through all of these but
goes on and then it goes into your
messages which I'll show later so about
this the beam is is is really it's a
complicated evolved piece of code so
when you look into the tracing
implementation there it's somewhat
scattered I mean its most of its in one
place but it's very low level it's
directly in the line of certain parts of
the dispatch mechanism which is which is
to be honest you know completely dynamic
and really really interesting but not
not the best piece of code to read here
I'd recommend opening things like dbg
Earl this file is a built-in app that
does different types of debugging
utilities this includes a rudimentary
tracer there are dozens of other tracing
libraries in Erlang I'm definitely not
the first there you know there's 28
years of history so I think they're at
least like two dozen most of them are
dead or you know just deprecated but
there are some great ones and I'm not
going to be able to enumerate all of
them so pardon me if I if I leave that
out so beyond that how does tracing even
work you know how does anything in inner
Lane yuvan work it's obviously
trade-offs like I mentioned earlier
every every function call in in an
erlang system is somewhat dynamically
dispatched say somewhat because it's not
exactly deciding out of all functions
what to run it's very explicit but the
interesting thing about it is it's used
for a number of a number of features the
the main main sorry
the main thing that that you might think
of during during this is hot code
loading so you need to decide which
version you're calling it's a really
interesting capability you also have a
couple other things related to to
tracing but the capabilities of of this
are definitely because of trade-offs and
if air laying suddenly started in mining
all of this code it be very very hard to
get the same sort of value out of this
so i highly recommend considering you
know that you pay for the speed and
there's a good reason to use it so the
main API let's let's actually dig into
this now so we have trace pattern trace
pattern is really useful for things like
call tracing so the flow of actual code
now we have an MMF a module function
arguments tuple there and that is
including a match back in a flag list
the flag list guess we can look at that
really quick on dash here if we go to
Trey's pattern so that's without the
flag list ok so the flag list
here we can see trace pattern flag and
then trace pattern flag is global local
met up with the pig call count call time
these are interesting to know exactly
where you want to match specific things
but the idea the idea is basically to
say this is the code i'm targeting but
it's not quite enough because you have a
second half and this is the pig set so
you need you you have sort of an
overlapping if you think of it as a Venn
diagram you have you have a circle that
represents your pigs and it intersects
with this this MF a set that you've set
to to be the thing of interest so if you
say here here i show hid spec can be a
specific kid existing pigs or new pids
or all pits usually you don't want to do
all pigs unless it's a very simple mfa
that you're calling but sometimes
sometimes you need to brute force that
just don't be surprised if you get tons
of messages existing is really great new
is probably the most common one outside
of a specific pit that way you don't
disturb things that are already in
progress or halfway through some some
process that way you know if you spawn a
new pad let's say you have some sort of
requests going through the system you
can basically trace it starting with
that process you pass a flag how
basically says is it on or off am I
negating these pigs or am i adding these
pits and then the flags these are all
the things I mentioned before you can
pretty much receive any sort of
information you'd want to know from a
erling primitive standpoint there are a
couple of these flags that aren't
necessarily things that happen but data
you want have added or changed as time
goes on or as trace events happen one is
timestamp and we'll get into that a
little more another one is
on spawn and set on first link those
those basically allow you to slowly grow
the set of pits that you're interested
in based on what happens to the page so
if a pit starts another process with
that flag it will automatically follow
through so about the pattern matching so
this MFA isn't necessarily one specific
thing we can we can be a little more
generic than that so at the top here we
have acne and any function and any sort
of arguments then we can say acne print
money and notice that it's print money
and then an underscore there so it could
be print money with no arguments it
could be print money with a million
arguments it doesn't really matter which
print money it is that's the one that
triggers and it's just that name we can
specify two or you know some simple
number where basically it's a count so
we can get a little more precise there
one thing to not do and I really really
recommend you be careful about this is
never to be too big of a wild card if
you expand it to all wild cards here
that will trace everything well
everything for the processes you have
and if you're not careful you'll be
tracing your tracer and won't go into
why that is and how that happens it's a
really nasty feedback cycle another good
it's so you're talking about where the 0
to 2 is not a specific argument in
tannerite almost case yeah well this
next slide talks about getting a little
closer to something specific so
sometimes you want to be able to say
okay I really want this many arguments
and I want the second argument to be foo
and I want this other one to be a number
or whatever you know you can you can
pretty much do anything here that is a
function head so this includes a guard
clause you know the when and the the
actual arity and pattern matching that
you would have in a function head so
there's a interesting piece of code that
you can get out of our line from dvg and
this is reimplemented in many ways
through many other modules so it's not
that uncommon so you have this fun to ms
clever little name that takes a shelf
function now in this case it does not
allow a different kind of function to be
passed because i don't know how many
people have played around with anonymous
function representation in Erlang but
there are actually two kinds there's one
you define in the shell and this is
compiled to sort of an ast node and when
it's evaluated it is evaluated as sort
of an AST walk it doesn't actually do
any sort of being compilation it's slow
you don't tend to want to do things with
these kinds of funds if it needs to be
performant but for interactive prodding
and those sorts of things this this sort
of expression is just fine what's great
about this is it's also just a great
little abstract format so we can look at
this and we can tell everything with
this ms transform library that we want
to take this fun and we want to
transform it into a match spec and so we
can look in a look at an example here so
I've got matched back at the top with
this function being called
I've got this function that takes two
arguments recipient and 42 so I checked
that the recipient is the atom me and
the second argument has to be 42 just by
regular pattern matching and then I tell
it to return trace this is kind of
basically saying if this matches I want
you to basically do this thing even
though we're not actually going to call
something return trace this is sort of a
way to flag in the tracer saying this
the spec needs to actually run run this
return trace thing so the the match spec
that ends up being built from this this
fun looks something like what's below
it's actually exactly what's below this
would actually run if you did both
because the patterns would would match
on both so I would much prefer right the
first it's a little hard to read the
second you have this this guard in the
middle that equals that is a little
awkward to read and for airline unless
you're a whisper most of the time it's
out of order return trace notice that
it's not a function call anymore it's
just a result so that the first thing is
the captures second thing are the guards
the conditions and then last is what you
actually want back from the match and so
this is where airline basically says
okay in this case if we pass what I
really want is for you to return return
the trace so this is a positive match so
now we can use this in our MFA or match
spec is in that arguments position and
it will give us a much much more precise
trace in this match will execute
extremely fast inside of our line it's
very much optimized so another thing to
know about tracing is that it's
asynchronous so we call that trace
function somewhere now we're word where
does tracing
actually go it goes to that process that
you call those things in so that self
basically becomes the recipient of a
flow of messages large large flow of
messages from all of these tracy's all
of those pits so you need to make sure
that you carefully select this process
you shouldn't be necessarily needing to
do other work in this process because
you may get a lot of other messages and
fill up your message box things that you
might receive look like this there are
quite a few more but these are some
interesting ones receive obvious
semantics there it's you know got the
quotes because it's a key word but you
know it's an atom just like everything
else send I really like this third one
send to non existing process I didn't
know there's a way to figure out that
something was doing that but this is a
great way to find any sort of dead or
dumb code you have in a system and sort
of audit oh yeah okay I am actually
every time I run this path and the code
I'm doing some useless work let's get
rid of that so stuff like that is really
nice then there's a the obvious call
that is returned to and returned from
return tues very much related to call
return from is really useful return from
allows you to basically take a different
stand and say I don't really care what
you're passing in as much as I care
about the actual result you may have
something that takes five minutes to run
or something that's called a bunch of
different ways but you really want to
know are the results that is returning
back all saying or valid or and I
expecting the right things your turn
from is another favorite of mine spawns
exits GC i mentioned exceptions
definitely look at the docs there so
timestamps are another thing i mentioned
earlier the timestamps are actually
appended to these tuples and then the
trace adam at the beginning
becomes trace underscore TS so you will
have to handle different tuples in your
tracer if you decide to enable this the
caveat is the time stamps actually cost
a lot and it's not the tracer that pays
that cost it's the Tracy because at the
moment that that trace triggers it has
to create a time stamp it has to
actually go find out what time to
include and be somewhat accurate about
it sometimes that's necessary sometimes
you do need that pretty accurate timer
so you can serialize things very
accurately but there's another issue
here this time stamp thing also can can
cause a lot of a lot of slow down and
contention in in your tracers I mean
Tracy so be very judicious when you use
this sometimes it might be better to add
the time stamp when your tracer receives
it rather than force it upon the world
every every time you want to get some
event so that kind of gives a quick
overview of how that works is really
easy to break these things I'm going to
rush through a little quicker here but
breaking things is usually ok inner
laying but in this case if you're
touching enough code and specifically
touching enough code in ways where it's
covertly you know the code isn't
designed or written this way you may
actually cause some serious issues I did
mention tracing the tracer so you know
if you have this wild card and you end
up running this on the process that the
tracer is involved and you may you can
actually see recursive expansion of this
food tracer handle tres tres call food
tracer hint you know and you know you
like is wrapped each time this happens
and you do stuff and that just expands
bigger and bigger and bigger until you
know you've got giant terms
your tracer you need to be very very
careful about not allowing this to
happen one of the first ways to do that
is be very careful about your pattern
matching just don't allow anything in
you really usually don't need everything
there are other things this underscore
pattern causes as well overload is one
so if you ever watch reduction counts if
you ever you know get process info on
different things you know that things
are executing pretty fast there are a
lot of things going on now reduction
counts don't really mean function in
vacations anymore but they are somewhat
related and unless you want hundreds of
thousands or millions of messages to be
generated you need to be very conscious
about this now you can have you know a
million messages in a mailbox but you're
going to have many gigabytes of RAM to
support that and keep in mind that this
isn't just the fact that something was
called it is a copy of everything was
called with that includes the binaries
references to large binaries you can
definitely create some some large leaks
if you're not careful another one is
critical paths obviously there is
overhead with with tracing you don't
want to enable it on something that you
know needs to be in a tight loop
sometimes you want to make sure you're
you're one step back from that or two
and maybe slowly move closer to to that
critical path rather than start there
and realize that whoops I just I just
timed everything out and now you know my
users are getting 500 s or something
like that another one that's a little
more complicated and unexpected at first
but makes a lot of senses in noisy group
leader if you're tracing you're usually
doing something and then sending output
somewhere now this output it's through
different types of for matters or i/o
calls goes to the group leader and then
the group leader handles that the issue
with this is you can create a lot of
noise on this and other things maybe
to try trying to do something important
with this group leader you can basically
halt the ability to like see interactive
output if you're not careful here or
even input you can crash the ability to
say oh I want to send this thing to the
shell well the group leader already has
10,000 messages to handle before it
handles this line input that you just
gave it so it's not going to get there
for like five or ten minutes and by then
you know who knows your notice down so
the fact that your tracer may be sharing
these these group leaders is very
dangerous you probably if you expect a
lot of I owe on your tracing should set
a separate group leader and manage that
or do loadshedding will go into that as
well so there are a couple tools there's
dbg this is built into our lang it's
very easy to use you just start the app
so dvg start and then dbg tracer and
then call dbg TP or TPL with the pattern
that you want to match and then you tell
it what to print out what information to
print so all calls or only calls on
these processes or whatever information
you're interested in it's not the best
but the fact that it's always there
makes it well unless you really want to
strip it out of a release it's always
there it's nice to just have go to recon
is recently grown a tracing module it's
really nice it's really simple I really
like this one will get into that into y
tres URLs actually really nice it's got
some nice integration with things like d
trace d traces a little out of scope
here in the sense of you know i'm not
going to talk about system level sort of
holistic tracing and the sort of the
combination of you know what system
calls were made between this function
call on that function call and how often
am I gcing versus sending these packets
out you know in four
like that red bug is a common one I
don't recommend it as much I it does
have a simpler interface but it's you
know the amount of effort required to
pull it in I feel like recon has more
more value in terms of other features so
I I don't tend to use that one much
anymore but it is there and is worth
looking at if you're curious spyglass I
would have recommended but recon is
caught up on the basic tracing part and
that's what I would have recommended you
use so I'm not really going to recommend
that one at this point so safety bailing
out is is difficult if you've overloaded
your your group leader so this is one
where sometimes you want something that
automatically will bail out for you
recon will do this for you if it exceeds
a certain threshold it's one of the
reasons i recommend it be sure that
whatever sort of tracing you're doing
doesn't interact with other people who
might be on the system I know it cloud
it we have multiple people sometimes
looking at the same problem at the same
time and you would be surprised how some
of these systems interact you could
easily cross paths by sharing dbg at the
same time dbg is a one user library
likewise with certain parts of recon you
need to coordinate I don't know of any
library that really does sort of a multi
operator you know segregated tracing at
the moment so be careful about that you
don't want to step on each other's toes
so a couple quick advanced things on
tracing and then we'll talk about about
some discussion points so distrel
interactions is is a hard problem when I
first tried to look at these issues you
know the first naive thing i did was
okay I've got a list of trace events and
another list of trace events and all
add these together and start looking at
what happened and you know maybe try and
roughly order them in time the problem
is is you don't really have the clear
cause and effect unless you have a lot
of work to to put all of those dots
together and you end up having to trace
quite a bit in your system to make sure
that okay these two functional modules
actually are working the way you expect
them but they go through you know a few
hops through some RPC mechanism and a
few other things making sure those
things are linked together is is quite
difficult the main way around this is to
make sure you have a clear module or or
place where r be she starts and ends
that way you can efficiently say I want
things that enter in here and exit over
here to be connected and join
unfortunately our line makes it really
easy to just call anything anywhere I
mean you just have the message send to
whatever and pit which could be on any
node and that node that pit could be
running in code on you could even you
know RPC to whatever you want and that
sort of a discipline or lack thereof
creates a lot of problems for tracing so
this is something you need to design for
state machines is another one it would
probably be better to show in code so
maybe we can talk about this after it's
a little more involved but it's very
similar to what you might see in
property based testing where you have a
sort of model of what you expect states
to go through and so you have a tracer
that knows what it's expecting to read
and things it needs to react to and what
to connect in each state so let's say
you have something that starts up and
reads through a bunch of things finds a
set of things it needs to do sets those
aside goes through each one you know in
each of that process where it is and
then when it's collecting results and
you know you can basically create a much
more coherent output for your tracing
information so i highly recommend
building up these things if you have a
lot of messages that that cover a long
lifetime these are really good for those
things you're tracing that may take five
hours to complete you know let's say you
have data moving between two nodes and
you know gigabit link is not going to
move a terabyte instantly so you know
you should have something to sort of
track that in stages property testing
and i don't mean property based testing
I mean property testing in the sense
that you can have an idea of what you
expect two points to have and instead of
really trace it recording the fact that
things happen you can record whether or
not certain properties hold in different
combinations of these things and say
well I think we're actually not holding
up to our invariant here where you know
when we restart this worker we expect
this uuid to be this but this thing is
sending some other piece of state and
this never matches so it it restarts
from a different point you can you can
do a lot of things like that these
property testing techniques can allow
you to reduce a lot of that so you don't
have to store a lot of information this
is really the only way to do long-term
tracing because unless unless you want
to over load your system with a lot of
i/o and basically create a database you
may have millions of these points over
the course of 24 hours and really what
you want to afford is whether or not
certain things held and where the
outliers are and you can keep track of
those so spyglass itself quickly on that
so code loaders are a little lacking
this is one part of spy less I'll
probably actually build upon and focus
on as the actual library rather than
some of the tracing things and then rely
on recon for some of the actual
system instrumentation there's not a lot
of value in duplicating effort there so
that's one thing I'm going to do but
furthermore while I've got some state
machines and some property checkers for
tracers I would like to create some some
more generic things but it's very hard
to do that automatically as I talked
about during my earlier prototypes but I
still do want to find a way to build
somewhat of a cook book either templates
or or things you can easily use so what
I imagined spyglass might end up looking
like is a system that creates a remote
shell that allows you to easily move new
modules and code start tracers monitor
them tear them down cleanly make sure
it's cleaned up make sure you're not
overloading the system and in making
that really really easy that way you
have a safe way to operate rather than
sort of running into the wall saying
okay I need this information and then
finding out that there are a lot of
caveats so that's the main portion of
the slide deck you guys have any
immediate questions or discussion
all right thank you we can we can talk
