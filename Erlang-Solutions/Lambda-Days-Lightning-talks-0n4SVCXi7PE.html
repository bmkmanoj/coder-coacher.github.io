bit of a
I it's a bit misleading because I'm not
introducing closure to you I'm talking
about introducing closure to a large
development organization and so it's not
another this is what functional
programming is talk I think we've had
several of those already so what I'm
going to talk about is a project that
thought works is working on thought
works is a large consulting company and
we work with various organizations and
projects to do software development and
try to help other companies build
software better so I'm going to talk to
you about a project that we're doing
with the student loans company in the
United Kingdom the student loans company
is a the government organization that
handles all the student loans money in
the United Kingdom so they process
billions of pounds a year in loans to
people to help them get an education the
project is a set of services and
applications that support the loans
process so our project is to transform
the sort of their development
organization which is a massive number
of Java developers working on mixed
platforms from Oracle databases to
banking systems and all manner of things
and we're slowly moving towards sort of
a micro services style architecture and
early on in the process we we said you
know like why not branch why why are we
sticking with Java which has
traditionally been well at home in many
large organizations um so we looked at
closure not necessarily in opposition to
scala we it's just that we had a lot of
expertise in closure and sometimes you
you don't pick the technology based on
necessarily what the best
is for the job you pick it for what's
best for the people who are working with
it and it just so happened that we had a
lot of closure expertise so what we hope
for was to try and build projects that
have less boilerplate than Java which
you certainly can get with other
languages to you it was important to
have a JVM support because we had a lot
of legacy Java code to work with we were
hoping to have something that was
interesting and fun and we thought it
would be a better fit for the domain one
of the interesting things about finance
and the student loan system in general
is that there's a phenomenal amount of
rules that dictate how much money a
student gets when they receive it how
they receive it and so on so you know
building a rules type system in a
procedural language like Java can be
quite daunting so it's it's a fun
exercise to do in a more functional
paradigm so things went okay things have
gone okay it's a year and a half long
project two years now almost and we had
some good stuff but we also had some bad
stuff many of the team members are quite
new to closure and functional
programming and there were some
interesting assertions made earlier in
the day and yesterday about how exciting
and easy it is to look at functional
code and understand it but if you're
coming from a legacy of 10-15 years of
Java development it's actually quite
difficult to shift your thinking and so
we've we did run into a little bit of a
long learning curve there we discovered
that we actually didn't have a very good
body of knowledge around what it means
to write testable good closure so we you
know there was a talked earlier about
solid design principles and the
functional paradigm and solid design
principles are an interesting way to
guide your code towards building
something that's
oh it's kind of the best you can do in
that model there's no need for solid and
functional but we weren't dealing with a
roomful of computer scientists who know
how to deal with monads or who could
explain a monad so it is quite difficult
in a practical situation to apply all of
the functional principles to get to
where you need to go we don't
necessarily have an idea what good code
is but I can tell you now that we really
know what bad code is it's just things
that are you know not extensible things
that are rigid things that are difficult
to manipulate and so we've ended up with
some things like treating namespaces
almost like classes we fall back on bad
Java design patterns so we end up with a
proliferation of small namespaces that
end up not being fun to work with and
you know you can deal with bad code in
some other languages through automated
refactorings but there's there's a great
book called refactoring by martin fowler
and there is no good refactoring hook
for functional programs at the moment
and there are no automated tools for
refactoring closure at the moment
although intelligence cursive is coming
along really well in that domain so
these are some of the tricky things that
we've run into you that it sort of
slowed our velocity but there are
certainly some positives so these are
some quotes from the designers and
architects at student loans developers
are really excited about working with it
it's it's really put a lot of energy
into the teams and into the organization
it's they found that it's very good
marketing for developers they're getting
really good interest from the community
to hire new Java developers and even if
they're not hiring a specific closure
developer the factor of their doing
closure provides an excellent marketing
tool and definitely has a future and
even within the teams just to sort of
talk about the buzz that's been built up
we actually student loans how many
developers and an experience designer
have collaborated to bring closure hack
nights into student loans so that's
quite interesting for a large government
organization to actually help people
coming in after hours and eating pizza
and starting with you know closure
Cowen's and then working up to overtone
which is a really cool music generation
library and now they're building a web
application completely unrelated to
student loans work but working on a
mobile app for people who travel around
and work alone to check in with their
employers to make sure that they're safe
and so on and even business analyst and
project managers have sat down and
started writing code which is really
exciting so this kind of goes back to
you he know which talked about how
scratch makes programming accessible to
people who don't program every day
enclosure is starting to make it
accessible to people who do the same
thing in student loans so this is a
quote again from one of the lead
architects that absolutely there is a
future for closure at student loans and
it's brought diversity into the
organization so they will continue to do
closure projects but even the ones that
they will do Java on they can at least
take things what they've learned from
one domain and apply them to another
that's all thank you very much
thank you very much we had a partnership
time for questions okay thank you very
much once more there were so how many
people at pablos currently ranked
cultures full time every day um there we
are that's a good question I I know on
my team in slc there are about 12 of us
I know that we have other closure
projects going on in London I don't know
about other parts of the world but yeah
it's it's something that we're very
interested okay thank you very much
so um do we have many scholar developers
here yeah yeah people know what Scarlett
check is a quick check things like that
yeah okay so problem I've had with
Scarlett joke in the past is it can be
quite frustrating when you have to
constrain a type to be a particular
value so if i had a if i wrote a test
that looks something like this and i and
i know this is going it's going to fail
where I expected every every integer I
passed into into my so I read that wrong
every every integer in into my property
to be positive I need to do I need to do
something slightly different and I need
to constrain this like so not obviously
this this doesn't make much sense but
we're in a lightning talk so so this
this then passes and then the probably
the problem comes is when you end up
with quite a few of these like so and
then we want to make sure that all of
these is it is this is this legible it's
okay and like so and then when it comes
to running this it should I thought yet
over
so no I've completely failed right but
generally generally in the past when
I've run this it gets to the point where
the the criteria is exhausted so you see
here like this is what I was trying to
write I'm quite sure why as I'm like
that but Pudden is that what it is I
need him to put panties oh is that so I
need them what here or here yeah okay
wow you're right cuz no okay believe me
believe me I put no preparation into
this um is that this can exhaust the the
checker which means you know your tests
don't don't don't work as as they should
so I put a little thing together to
constrain the type so rather than saying
we've got an integer is that we want to
tag the integer and say it's only
positive so so it looks something like
this and then rather than having this
constraint afterwards which federally
happens after the generation we can just
say that straight away I've done it
again
and then that that just works because
I've constrained this on the type but
then I've also managed to pass this
through as an integer Oh does that make
sense what what I've done there um this
is something i wrote i don't know if
this is of any use or people had any
feedback or things like that but i wrote
a few of these tags so we can say
absolute so then that's greater than or
equal to 0 so if i said that then that
word that would then fail because an
absolute value has to be greater than or
equal to 0 but then I've managed to
constrain this on the type rather than
having to have a set of constraints
after the types of defined so spread
open up to any questions or a discussion
really yeah hi oh yeah yeah sure yeah
so yeah sorry this I'm looking at so so
we create a generator for that type so
for absolute here we then say just call
absolute and then you know with java if
you if you call absolute on integer dot
min it still stays in into the dot min
so we just recursively call that again
until we get a value and then this is an
implicit for a numeric of absolute and
then that's the type of we're passing it
and then I've written a few of these
absolute positive negative ordered so
you give a tuple and then what's
returned the first value is always less
than or equal to the second value so it
might just be useful in some case or
unique so you have to pour and what
evers returned the two x is always
different yeah with this is this useful
to people to people have this problem as
well as me write your own project
knowledgeable or what you're doing is
already testing I try to do it as much
as possible it's but with personal
projects I'm not always the most
efficient tester but that's just my
personal ones yeah but then I honestly
I've found that when I am doing this the
types i'm usually using a usually rich
enough but i'm not dealing with
primitives so that i have to create an
arbitrary for whatever time I have and
then any constraints with then going
that the implicit like that the
generator there but sometimes just maybe
you know when I do want an integer and
you know i'm going to construct a list
of n i want to make sure that n is
always positive and things like that
that's where I'd see these being useful
ice probably i've not tried it but i
only wrote this a couple of days ago so
yeah but it would be nice to say you
know you have a ordered and always
positive so then you've got to pull and
the first one is less than the second
but they're always both greater than
zero and things like that yeah that'd be
quite an interesting implementation but
I'm not even trying back here visions
I'm about to give you two tips that I
think will help you immensely and first
of all these ideas are not mine Stifel
lush I think came up with them and post
it then under the title a modern space
cadet and basically the first tip is to
remap your left shift key on the
keyboard to type left parenthesis and
the right shift key to put right
parenthesis because as developers we put
a lot of brackets right so why do we
have to press Shift + 9 or 0 that
doesn't make sense it's much better than
just press shift left shift of right
shift and I told that I told that to a
lot of people and they usually ask me
two questions the first one is are you
closure develop developer and no not
really that and the second question the
second question is but how am I going to
type uppercase character uppercase
characters and it still works like you
put the parent if you press the shift
key alone if you press the shift key in
combination with a character then you
will get uppercase character yes gged a
long shift is very happy happy okay
maybe yeah but I use but if your editor
already does that or something small
yeah and the second tip is to map your
caps lock key unless you are some angry
person because the castle key is pretty
useless so we can map caps lock to
either I don't know ctrl key or met
key or escape so depending on which
editor we use and I think it's much
better than half that one useless key on
the keyboard yeah so that's all thank
you and I am going to post the link on
twitter so we can find that post easily
yes sometimes I'm gonna take some time
to introduce enhancements to the most a
keepers my dear usable in comments this
case
I think okay hello I'm your tiger i'm
from the netherlands and i work for a
company called Syria and we'll
consultancy in the netherlands and we
bought cool stuff right and i'm also
organizer of the I'm sandals cada user
group when we organize a lot of meetups
so you're always welcome to come and
speak and all right there till then can
we speak or just a tenth I wanted to do
a quick introduction to Skara for anyone
who has no real experience with column
you know who view has no experience with
scala syntax because of you have some
experience most of you are cool so yeah
what i want to do is set up a quick
project using SVG and do hello world and
take it from there you will well what
fits in the center five minutes left
Salome to make a project what you
normally do is just make folder for the
project so it's a hey projects going to
my project and to make this an svt
project all you need to do is make a
project folder so f I am also motor and
now if I do SBT it would just start the
project it will now compile anything in
here what we now can do is start cause
oh this is big enough for you to read
and I've called soul I already know this
from know you and I can do this is
standard standard rapper where I can do
interactive evaluation and if i would
have imports in my project these are all
available in this console to you can
just work from where you are
and try things out with the library
using if you get stuck somewhere anyone
do some quick checking in close all you
can do stuff like create a list yeah and
then the rapper will return to you what
the type is it X me your first to type
so for the first thing you said you can
see that it says rest 0 it was your
result of 1 plus 1 which is an integer
so this is very handy but I rather use
an egg an ID so if we just say we want
to do a hello world all we need to do is
create a object which extends a nap and
then we can do have a loot and if I know
yeah I now run this it says hello world
it's wonderful right so what I want to
do is show you some contracts to doing
creating a linked list so if I would
make a linked list I would make a visit
aight trait linked list and then make a
case class note which takes a value
string and a child of the type linked
list how much time do I honest four
minutes
and a case object which shall we call it
nil something with Mike male promised
reserved which extends linked list so I
created these things now I can make a
new link list by saying I have a note
which takes hello which takes notes for
this child it says world and because I
don't have a child for the last I'm
going to use a default parameter here
which is the my nil if I now execute
this code into files but we see nothing
of what it is we do printing go towards
the inner gif a linked list of notes
like a cons list anyone knows how these
things are so the things you see here is
a trait which is in skies it's sort of
like an interface and an abstract class
yeah it's a very useful thing where you
can have fat interfaces you can add
semantics to an interface or you might
know it as giving it to default
implementation and here we see a case
class which is a special form of class
so this is a very easy way to make sort
of records or data wrappers and think
people type class or something don't
know what so it's a very lightweight to
come put in data in a class if you have
a database records you can just use a
two-pole but you can also give it a name
so it's more recognizable and the things
in case plus gives you is that
if I now would make a new note like I
did below I now have the value available
here as a member and this is all
immutable so you can only get things out
which can't put things in and what you
do see is I do not need to use something
like new because the case classes in sky
special sugar which generates a lot of
stuff your unique for this for so for
this you use the factory method which is
a standard method which is created on
the companion object of this class are
you guys following yeah which these
sugars to apply and which if you would
see the actual implementation would look
like so I I know sort of making my
companion object myself and it would
have a function which wants to fly which
would take a string where you going come
on it's not tiny to do this standing up
sorry it was the value and child list is
wonderful do the college manual is and
here you would do something like new
nodes and then fill in values out I
think you get the drift what happens
here so this is a factory method which
is generate for you and a lot of other
things are generated to in in the case
glasses that are the equals functions to
compare denies function etc so that you
can easily compare them so I find out
make two K's classes like notes I think
machine takes conclusion went haywire
and positive glass ah right thank you
yeah I'm going in fast ball so I don't
have a lot of attention span for paying
attention to things like that so if I
would do this something like this it
would tell me that this should be equal
well if you would do standard objects
reference embarrassment you would say
get fault because they're different
objects in there may be different
addresses please execute now what did I
do oh sorry
like it's true right and another nice
thing you get in Scala is that I can now
say if I know what with my food in there
I can match on it and case it's a node
with value this will probably break
communities I can now say print line so
the case class also have things called
extractors which is sort of an apply
this is scope which allow you to get the
members out of the mini machine so you
don't have regular case switching but
you have a special match is karma which
is just pattern matching and you can
extract data with this I can expect the
value here but I could also say well I'm
in something that's a note again so I
can go recursive and I would have a
value to and have something I don't care
about yeah so anyone want to see
something special before did time itself
you like this isn't special yeah okay
yeah but does anyone have a hint of what
they want to see
person when we have at least we wanted
to be either not O'Neill is there a way
to somehow like force there is possible
to create other custom that X and leave
please yep sorry if I said she'll trade
like this then the only thing that can
extend to nameless are those which are
declared in this file and so nobody can
extend it if you would really want to
restrict it and i think my case plot
here should actually if i would say i
want a string I think it should now
complain that this would never match was
I'm not sure yeah so it's now come on
thank you and I would say this is
fruitless test because you still try it
only has the two members now than mine
ill and I'm trying to match for a
stranger this will never happen so this
typing it helps you to to allow you
compile to tell you it there is no other
option so if you seal it and you can
have the certainty no
this may be I want to share some common
about how to use scale a language on
Android devices only few minutes 20
minutes or three because I is not
development of droid 4 years ago and two
years ago maybe one health here no I
felt programming with a scalar on it and
when I started this was real the tool
which you know probably svt is extremely
powerful but it's horrible and when you
don't know what's what's going on when
you start and when i started and then
till when yes iguana hello the tools was
not prepared but now if we someone is
interested to do the whole new
application of droid with Stella now
those planets of sbd are very useful
it's just walk properly and but I what
okay tell me when you start to try to do
the mobile bay scallop great is in
summary you have two problems to solve
one yes at that scale up library has
five weeks
describe library speech and you need to
deploy this library with your cock fight
because there is no package resolve
another way to to do to the net and
problems that the dalvik is DM by OEM
cannot hold more than 65,000 of massive
reference yep and you need to create
your application configuration of of
that was was was horrible now it's not
something i will do is exempt from down
my party dress BTW and everything is a
later date if anyone would to develop
applications on Roy I will do do
recommend yes that now it's very simple
process and is well maintained by the
open-source products like an Android SDK
flag and this is everything
right very much and I think this was the
last short talk last session of this
conference so I would like to thank you
all for attending I hope it was a nice
experience for you I hope was a virtual
time and we need to visit us next year
as well please if you have any comments
yes miss a distance please write us an
email or contact us in the other way
please does nobody think where should we
go which direction what should we do
better what you like thought you I hope
you like the ring that's if there are
suggestions that we like to give
impatient and once more thank you very
much for your attention and hopefully
see you next year
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
