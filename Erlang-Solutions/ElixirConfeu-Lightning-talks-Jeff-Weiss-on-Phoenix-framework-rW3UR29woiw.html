in Chris's Phoenix workshop on Wednesday
Wednesday Wednesday and since I work
mostly added automation company that
deals with sis admins I think about
operations a lot and one of those things
is how to instrument applications since
we don't necessarily have a new relic
agent I was thought i was looking at
what Phoenix outputs and one of the
things you'll see in the logs often is
the water well put how long it took to
do a response and I thought well if that
can do that then why can't we send it
off to to STATS tea or something similar
so I quickly wrote a plug to ship the
response time information and request
counts off to stat see that will show up
down here and then I also wrote
something that publishes the
instrumentation information to its own
channel and so what I have here is a
phoenix app that uses a plug that
publishes to a channel and then this is
a separate phoenix app that listens to
that channel and will plot the
information in v3 so here we go so i'll
just do row i've also have random sleep
times over here because otherwise it was
all sub-millisecond and stats d can't
handle timers that are less than 1
millisecond and then it would have just
been a flat graph on d3 so that it
wasn't very exciting so I'll just
quickly do some refreshing here and I'm
refreshing as quickly as I can and you
see the the information starting to show
up down here and then the d3 graphs
showing and you can see that these
things actually do line up like here's
the 21 milliseconds and 21 milliseconds
the 3333 yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
