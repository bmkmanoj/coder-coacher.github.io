one one
one slot away from from beer and and
receptions and stuff I know you guys are
you know looking to get to socialize I'm
going to be my name is Tony Falco by the
way I was a one of the cofounders of
bash which makes react and I'm one of
the founders with orchestrate which is a
service I'm not gonna be talking about
orchestrate today what I am going to be
talking about is observations of some of
the trends that we've seen in databases
database technology over the past five
years and in particularly focusing on no
sequel in the emerging no sequel segment
and taking a look at the forces that
shaped it and and trying to extrapolate
from from the sort of forces that got us
here and some of the new forces in the
market we're talking technology forces
and business forces a sense of where
databases or data storage is going to go
so I'll say upfront that that the
approach I used was to to look at a very
broad take a very broad view of the
sector which includes looking at the
sort of financial and commercial aspects
because as I began to look at previous
database the trajectory previa previous
database markets you really can't
understand what's going to shape the you
know the technology until you understand
the invest you know the investor of
climate you know things like the IPO
climb and I mean if you look at my
sequel the story of my sequels is is
intertwined with what was happening in
the markets at the time I won't spend a
lot of time on something like my sequel
but I will you know as this quote from
Mark Twain implies I will reflect a
little bit of the expectations in this
market but the core thing that I'm going
to be doing today is focusing on the on
the sort of technological forces or the
technological trends and widening the
aperture to look at things besides
databases that are going to shape that
so bear with me as I go through sort of
the market part of it because the market
part in the end the so the the marketing
part and
I was the marketing part or the or the
market investment and employment are
going to be really important once we get
to some of the conclusions about the
technology but this is all data that I
either accumulated or I was able to get
through reference from from other
research let's start off with first of
all the timeline it's really interesting
when I put this together it was pretty
it was it was pretty some pretty amazing
I didn't realize couches we had been out
so early that cloud was a service so
early but if you look 2005 CouchDB was
written as a replacement for Lotus Notes
you had AWS launched in 2006 and then I
think 2007 was a very big year
personally was a very big year because
that was when Justin she he emailed me
the Dynamo white paper I was actually
flying across country to move my family
to Cambridge to start basho and Justin
had emailed me that paper I was reading
it on the flight and it was like one of
those big like yes moments you know it
was really it was awesome because we
were talking about different ways to
make a scalable back-end for for the app
that we were building at the time we
were not building a database at the time
but the BigTable and dynamo white paper
came out neo4j introduced their
technology and there was simple DB
moving forward you obviously react Mongo
Volta more and I have up here two
important events or elasticsearch of
2010 and then you know those services I
thought that in 2010 you began to see a
maturation of the use cases those two
sets of blogs I mean the Netflix blog
about testing Cassandra and getting a
million operations per second for under
$1,000 doing it on three separate
availability zones simultaneously and
doing it for under a thousand dollars
just an awesome piece of engineering
writing and there's a there's a great
paper written by the the message team at
HP at Facebook for all the ways they
patched HBase to to make it behave in a
certain way that that it demonstrated a
maturation in the market
it saw the real use cases for each of
these databases being put into action
with the sort of adaptations and it also
showed the sort of changes that were
being made to existing databases to make
them behave in a certain way which is in
fact sort of the trend where the trend
that we're headed towards so I thought
that the that very important in the
history of this sector has been the sort
of academic contributions and that's why
I called those out so I also wanted to
again I tried to find just data wherever
I could to support or you know to
understand these points one of the
things I looked at were job trends and
this is you know this is a this isn't a
direct indicator but it certainly is a
an interesting sort of a trace element
to see what's happening in the market
and if you notice all sorts of that you
know all sorts of you know language well
actually the language thing I want to
talk about because the language and the
jobs around no sequel are very tightly
very tightly track to each other so the
languages I chose to have up there
Erlang node Scala nodejs which is for
whatever reason separately and then I
included no sequel and you'll see this
sort of you know around the same time
that these languages we're beginning to
find heavy adoption you also saw no
sequel and I think that there's there's
a really good explanation for that that
that indicates or that gives us a strong
indication of where where we're headed
so the no sequel projects that we have
out there one of the other things that I
counted the number of no sequel projects
that were in production that didn't
exist in 2006 and if you kind of cut cut
out couch there are like 28 no sequel
products or projects that have
production instances running that didn't
exist so there's a bit there's been an
explosion of a project and the forces
that caused that explosion are all I
think they're pretty identifiable and
those trends are actually accelerating
so
I thought that I thought that was an
interesting insight we're not going to
be able to talk about all of them today
in fact what we're going to do is we're
gonna start limiting it by first
imposing a taxonomy that was first
suggested in a similar form by James
Phillips it's you know nothing
groundbreaking but it's a way to sort of
begin to slot the use cases you know to
create some coherence out of those 29
projects and what you have is
documenting kV now and and this makes no
makes no adjustment or makes no
modification for the for the scaling
properties or how distributed they are
we're just talking about the sort of
query pattern you've got elastic search
in react search and search neo neo4j and
titan and there are several others but
you were talking about some of the
prominent ones Cassandra and HBase for
column you know that's pretty obvious so
that's the that's a way to think about
this this you know sort of winter down
to this 29 to you know about to about
twelve and then if you want to look at
the no sequel that are back commercially
why are we talking about the no sequel
projects that are back commercially
because as we will see the commercial
commercial influences on technology
decisions are pre undeniable so we've
got these technologies in couch base and
couch which obviously has separate
MongoDB Cassandra Rhea Sumi react and
and and graph and neo so you've got an
elastic search so these are the
companies you've got sort of two
software companies with of different
sort of strategies I by the way some of
the reasons that I use these ways to
organize it is I wanted to stick with
with things that you could measure
things that you could that you could you
could cite there's no place where you
can get accurate numbers on downloads
across the sector or real customers and
real users so one of the frustrating
things about evaluating you know the
progress of the sector is those sorts of
numbers so we had to look at a number of
sort of related or or slightly removed
indicators so you see in in in almost
every case there is at least you know
a significant there's probably about
thirty million dollars with investment
in every one of those in every one of
those projects if you if you total the
the investment so there's a there's a
sizable the market has decided that
these are the sort of the projects that
we're going to we're gonna make a bet on
and if you look at the the actual
allocation of investment and this is
taken from CrunchBase you see manga
10gen you know by far the leader but
double almost double the closest other
company and then you see a pretty even
distribution for elasticsearch Rioch
Couchbase and in data stacks and then
smaller funding for again this is
probably wrong it doesn't talk about any
strategic or style and investments this
is all from crunch based from public
sources it's probably low but Dalit but
the distribution is probably correct so
you see what what I think is important
here is there's been a quarter billion
dollar bet on this space which means
that the market if we can talk about the
market as a single thing which for the
sake of this conversation we're gonna do
do so has made a bet to the tune of a
quarter a quarter billion dollars so far
that that there's something going on
here that's that has commercial
potential part of part of that bet is I
think an almost crazy set of
expectations around revenue according to
a 4-5-1 group and according to some
research that I've seen from like
benchmark capital which isn't a venture
firm but it's a New York firm they're
expecting massive compound annual growth
rates which are basically that's an
historical assumption the only the only
place you ever see those kinds of
compound annual growth rates are when
you look at analyst analyst papers it's
just I don't know why they do it because
it's provably wrong but I used a much
more conservative and in fact a little
bit aggressive historical growth rate
of 35% and you see that if you extend
current revenue that you can get from
like a couple of sources including the
four five one group report you can see
that if you project that out it's a
hundred and sixty three million dollars
with the revenue why does this matter
it matters because you've got two
hundred sixty one million dollars in
investment and one hundred and sixty
three million dollars worth of revenue
and that means that the commercial bet
on these projects on these town these
technologies and these companies some of
them are not going to get returns and
that is going to have an impact on those
technologies we're we're we're naive if
we don't look at the future of this
sector being influenced by the fact that
some of these companies will not succeed
in the way their investors want and
that'll lead to things like liquidation
or merging I mean we saw it with
Couchbase and you know with Couchbase
it's a beautiful biometrics and
successful company now but it was really
the merging of two different very
different technologies and you know it
that was that was really the the sort of
the consolidation of two of the
approaches so we'd also don't know how
this was revenue is coming from
professional services versus software
licenses which also impacts valuation
but we will as technologists be impacted
by the bets that were made by investors
whether we like it or not but it isn't
it isn't that dire so if you look at
valuation in millions you see that 10
Jan is often the case the leader gets
you know majority of the value in the
sector and then it's distributed sort of
you know 20% to second-place 10% that's
the sort sort of the the the pattern
that you see but it's really interesting
that you've got a billion dollar
valuation quarter billion in billion
dollar valuation that's as a single
company that's a that's a success so the
sector has the right kinds of
expectations the you know
the market things is gonna be around
it's gonna be successful that's the sort
of question that you get asked by more
conservative enterprises this kind of
data is what is going to begin to open
up you we had fasted out like Comcast
and Disney you know they were using no
sequel pretty aggressively pretty early
but in order to really get into the
enterprise they've got to believe that
this is a technology that's going to be
around it's this sort of indicator that
that will that will mollify them the
other concern that that that adopters
have is you know talent are we able to
find talent and so this is the the
indeed calm graph for no sequel job
growth I thought it was interesting
obviously in 2010 something really
really caught fire and it was as we
remember from the timeline it was also
the same year that you saw really mature
blogs from Netflix or you know really
you know Steve seeing Netflix and H and
Facebook embraced these technologies and
you see that you know in in real terms
by the way if I were to put Java up here
Java would be at 2% it would just it
would flatten this this graph out so you
know but I'm I'm sorry Java you could
I'm my sequel so in Java is the same way
if I would do it to the their
programming languages so still
relatively it's still absolutely in
absolute terms very small numbers but
you know pretty rapid growth and this is
as to be expected there's there's really
no surprises here I think the trends are
interesting you see HBase and Cassandra
as both in relative terms increasing
their if if job descriptions and and and
and and and solicitations of employment
can be used as a another indicator then
you you know again lacking you know real
usage and real download data you have to
look at something like this it's clear
that the that the interest in people who
employ people is is really increasing
for those two technologies and I think
that's important because the properties
of those two technologies fit with
you know the the overall technology if
we there isn't even a stack anymore
where that's going there's another
interesting point here and I'll leave
you with this sort of suggestion that
and then we'll get on to the the
technology trends the fact that three
years ago three and a half years ago
there was an acceleration in hiring and
people were being brought in I like I
remember two things I remember 2008 a
venture capitalist telling us that
databases were a solved problem and now
we have 29 new databases that didn't
exist and I also remember recruiters
looking for people with like Cassandra
five years of a Cassandra experience in
like 2009 you know so but now there are
people out there that have you know
significant experience so you're seeing
a maturation in the in the in in in the
sector in that way and that I believe
and I contend is the most important and
the most sustainable trend that's
outside of technology itself and we'll
get to why in a little while
so we're to look outside the category
very quickly
I was very soon me very pleased to see
that in terms of disclosed revenue with
all the hype around Hadoop the no sequel
category actually has more total revenue
and you know cloud era is twice the
revenue of investment twice the
investment of Mongo or 10gen but still
you know as a category we're sort of
holding their own and then the same goes
for evaluation you know you've got two
billion dollar segments at about the
same time into the into their life
cycles and of course you've got an IDC
and four five one predicting massive you
know 80% compound annual growth rates
and I thought it would be interesting to
to compare that to the last ten years
the ten years of revenue service before
they were bought by Oracle that we have
for my sequel unquestionably a
successful technology
and yet and they've sold for a billion
dollars over part of a billion dollar
acquisition and they did 95 million
dollars worth of Revenue so that's
probably more realistic for the sector
which which sort of raises an
interesting question about what's going
to happen in a couple years when these
investments begin to to to sort of a
aged out and then this is I did this
because I'm a masochist I thought it was
funny that pre-revenue Pinterest has a
greater valuation than both of these
sectors combined and this is something
that just always boggles my mind and
we're working on technologies that
enable hundreds of Pinterest and
hundreds of you know we're working on
core technologies and Pinterest
pre-revenue is worth two point two five
billion dollars I guess that's just fuel
for my misanthrope II and I can't use it
for anything else but uh it I thought it
was interesting so we're done with this
section until we come back and tie it up
but how it's going to impact tech but I
think um it's incontrovertible that we
are going to see the high business
expectations in some ways shape take
president's or exert forces on technical
considerations or even you know in those
technical considerations would be sort
of discontinuing or discontinuing
commercial support or absorption of
companies into much larger companies
with very different agendas so right now
we've got a bunch of companies focus
solely on that technology and their
roadmap it's unlikely this is going to
be the case in in the coming five years
and surprise I thought it was an
interesting observation that we compare
so well to the Hadoop sector which seems
to garner a majority of the press around
new database technologies so let's look
at the technology trends and there's one
trend that's quasi technology it's it
actually supports the point that
commercial decisions will impact
technological technological decisions
and this was again from the 4-5-1 group
this is a survey
data of a likelihood of company so in
real terms adoption of notes of Mike
sequel is going to continue to grow but
it's going to decelerate and it's you
know it's going to it's going to go down
relative to the the total market its
market shares gonna go down because
people don't like the stewardship of
Oracle it's as plain as that you know
Oracle stewardship of this project this
again you have my sequel operating on
its own and generally unmolested by Sun
they bring it into into Oracle and you
begin to see changes to the roadmap
changes the licensing and that drives
people that drives technology decisions
and so we have companies that's that's
directly helping by the way no sequel
because they're going from they're not
going from my sequel to a new sequel
most often they're first off they're
going to Postgres the company that's
unquestionably haven't been helped by
this as Postgres but they're leaving
when they do leave the relational model
obviously they're not going to new
sequel or they're going to us so why are
companies why are companies adopting
this there are so many surveys now that
i'm not going to dwell on this much more
than just to say these are truisms
martin fowler again James Phillips and
Couchbase they've done real surveys
we're talking to these are these are
things that have you know hundreds of
responses in each of these surveys
support these these these assertions the
reasons companies are using no sequel
today aside from Oracle stewardship is
flexibility of schema less systems you
don't know what your data is going to
look like you know what your app is
going to need in six months that
flexibility is really important
especially in agile development and you
know just being able to respond to
changes in the market elastic workloads
which i think is another kind of
flexibility the whole trend here is it's
against lock-in it's against
restrictions to users it's it's about
utility and in an open-source cost law
and vendor lock-in again that's Oracle
that's you know that's that's being
trapped in like licensing agreement I
might get support from a notes
company but I can know I know at any
time that I can step away and and
support myself if I choose to I'm not
locked into a commercial relationship
and then the one outlier here which is
really around that has much more to do
to the with the trends we have we're
headed for in in in apps themselves is
latency and you know latency when I
first started working in this field was
you know back at you know with with lamp
stack hosting for enterprises like
anheuser-busch and it was routine to
have you know 99 reads for every right
and you know basically the web was a
bunch of you know static pages and
that's why Akamai was able to you know
be so effective but you know in the
intervening years you know the readwrite
profile for for these applications it
really we've gone from a world of
websites to to a world of applications
you see a so a massive sort of shift
towards write heavy applications and
that has introduced challenges to
relational models in terms of right
latency and and also real agency and
latency is important because in the user
experience users experience high latency
as an outage so I you know I will
provide you can drill into this as much
as you want but these are sort of
truisms about the the technology the
technology that they shave no sequel so
or that causes no sequel adoption so
again why do we're going to go a little
wider now and get away from the exact
the database the database you store you
pick you leave the databases and open
source is a movement you know cloud
adopt some polyglot and the end of the
stack so open source is a movement this
is a part of black duck black duck
server they do every year and now
they're on like number thirteen I think
this is a really interesting notice the
number one technology project that they
list is palm five years ago and mobile
was sort of the the
open source and 74% of the projects were
on SourceForge little did we little did
we know that by 2012 the biggest driver
was big data not surprisingly there was
a 500 percent growth in the projects
they went over a million and they'll
double again I think in two years and
github has obviously become the place
for this growth so if you go back to
that timeline and you think about what
was happening in 2007-2008 you saw two
forces that came together for the first
time it was rapid acceleration in the
interest and commitment to open source I
mean they've been there for a while but
we see right that we see that it was
being an accelerate and we see at the
same time the release of sort of seminal
research in overcoming the architectural
restrictions for for right heavy
applications from Google with their
BigTable white paper and from Amazon
with the Dynamo white paper and both of
those white papers live on in some form
in the projects that were listed on many
of the projects that were listed on on
the on the on the project slide you see
the same sort of acceleration the same
sort of curve when it comes to open
source adoption investment in the sector
revenue jobs so clearly well clearly I'm
gonna make the assertion that that that
that there was a sort of a the the fuel
was the open source like energy and the
spark was these white papers and that
sort of the idea that you were no longer
restricted and you could go out and and
build yet another kV so a key value
store so the other a trend that affected
an external trend that affected
databases actually in an interesting and
unexpected way
was just the lousy performance databases
get on current cloud platforms it wasn't
until the introduction of bare-metal
provisioning on Amazon and now with
OpenStack with grizzly that you saw
performance that was acceptable for
databases when you're running in a
virtualized environment you see
unpredictable latency so if you go to
the first you know that one of the main
drivers for going to open source are
going to notice no sequel is latency and
at the same time you see you know sort
of a diametrically opposed to this is
the need to get on to cloud environments
for the last several years people
haven't been real happy running running
a lot of database they aren't getting
the same performance they get on bare
metal and there's plenty of sort of
discontents amazon's discontents now
who'll write blogs about their
performance increase and the sort of
value increase when they switch switched
away their answer of course has been to
give us the bare metal provisioning but
I think cloud didn't necessarily help no
sequel adoption as you might expect when
you've got in many of those cases you
know sort of elastic scale out
architectures you think it would be
ideal for cloud and it didn't it really
wasn't the case for for most of this
time again the the source for this what
the survey data was was itself
interesting to read I'm simplifying it
polyglot world polyglot world this is we
we talk about poly BOTS polyglot
programming the same attitude of the
right tool for the job you now see in in
in production you know for different
databases in production for clout and
we're talking about the the real-time of
the other near real-time databases
that's not even counting the the and the
analytics being done by Hadoop so now
you're managing for databases in
production because you can get the
database that's shaped right for the
sort of query that you're performing and
this blog post came out last week I
thought it was awesome
from imager
and they went through their stack and
they actually did a later blog post
where they isolated their their
messaging system and but what is great
about this there's two things that are
great about this one it shows just the
length that they'll go the for a
specific part of the data pipeline or
workflow they'll pick a different
database just to get the the performance
of the optimizations now it comes with a
cost but I think it's really interesting
and the other thing that's interesting
is that you see this would have been a
very different diagram eight years ago
if you look at the if you look at the at
the diagram you've got these independent
clusters performing specific actions and
with specific interdependencies will
drill into the properties but this trend
is I think probably the most significant
outside of open-source adoption and the
and the and the growth and interest in
the projects for you know for the for
the shaping of databases going forward
in the in in the lamp stack you saw you
know tightly coupled there was sort of
very very rigid relationships between
each element of the stack and you saw
you know you you could lose a component
here and it would it would didn't it
variably be an outage on the other hand
with new architectures and this is
actually taken from a really great blog
post that I have it on another slide
why user Lang is Alex here Alex ribbony
is that his name yeah is he here at the
anyways it's a really great it's a
really great broad blog post that talks
about so the characteristics of a new
service-oriented architecture or a new
sort of you know non lamp stack a set of
assumptions and what you see there and
this is for github 'he's a piece of
github is infrastructure with monitoring
and chat is it's increasingly modular so
you have discrete
components it's organized around
workflows as opposed to around sort of
the couplings between the layers and the
stack and its resiliency in the face of
constant failures if you read the
Netflix blog there was a Netflix blog
about their messaging infrastructure
that was like a couple weeks ago they
talk about just blankly put it blankly
we you know we we operate in a state of
constant failure you know as you scale
out you and you add machines and you and
you and you gain elasticity and you gain
your flexibility in your workflows and
you and you create all of these separate
components you also embrace the notion
that failure is constant you don't have
that luxury you sort of ignore it there
hand-wave over it or you you don't do
well in in the sort of in the in the
world of the tightly coupled stack but
what you see here is it's a complex
system and a complex system but a
complex system in which the
interdependencies are configurable one
of the things that I thought was
interesting about the way they built
this is they always use the assumption
that these modules were decoupled that
you could lose any module in in this any
any cluster any piece of functionality
and it wouldn't take down the entire
application however you could create
sort of a supervisory function that if
one went down another would try to
restart it and another would and you
might cause a cascading failure because
that's the right thing to do so the
whole idea of which components take out
which components is now an integral part
of the way people are building these
these these these applications another
great and you know again I have I have a
link to this rather read this is me rich
white paper that was written by Jay
Krabs and a couple other folks at
LinkedIn is there real-time data
distribution service that they have it
LinkedIn they basically they have kafka
clusters that are distributing there so
they've got this again decouple
modular system you've got consumers
they're you know they're asynchronous
real time services you've got you know
batch jobs it's resilient any one of
these services can fail every you know
chunks of the of the Kafka cluster can
fail and only impact the services that
are mapped to it and there's no state
really here you know you you can resend
you can lose packets and rebuild the the
message the message batch it's it's
completely modular stateless uses
asynchronous messaging and this is a
pattern that you'll see over and over
again I know companies that are building
it with reactant companies are building
it with elasticsearch this is a trend
that is there's being to dominate the
the the the architectures out there and
you also see now what you've gone
modular you see pieces of your of your
application of your stack that you used
to have to build yourself or that were
in other ways tightly coupled now being
consumed pager Duty is my favorite
example it's like I remember when we
were to occupy we had to build all sorts
of things like log aggregation billing
you just didn't have services for that
and now
the architectures is such that you can
focus on your core you know user
experience and basically outsource
services what used to be sort of
integral parts of your business
continuity or your authentication or
billing so I think that that that as we
move to that sort of architecture the
opportunity to integrate and this is
well loop back to databases next the the
there's an opportunity to integrate
additional services or third-party
services that may specialize in
something that you'd have to do in an ad
hoc or bespoke basis and this is another
diagram from from Alex's blog post and
and the point that he makes that I think
was really sort of
I wouldn't say inspirational but
definitely it definitely caught my
interest in in preparing for this was
that these big systems in many ways are
like an Erlang application writ large
you know sort of the behaviors between
the behaviors of individual modules and
supervisory functions and and and doing
the right thing in the face of failure
so it doesn't take down the rest of the
application now at this point it's on
you know adoption of Erlang and I'm not
gonna talking about why people use
Erlang and why they don't use Earling
I'm just the the observation is that
there is a kind of behavior that is now
being validated at some of the biggest
web properties and web applications that
that is extremely well-suited to the way
Erlang thinks about the application
itself it takes the I mean it's you've
got the the the technique of building a
robust system and you see the echo in
the in the in the in the in the macro
components and in the micro components
so what else what what into the future
what are we going to see by the way I'm
not gonna make any stronger case for
Erlang because I walked in here I walked
from the train station and I didn't want
to get my shirt sweaty so I threw on a
t-shirt that I that I usually you know
exercise anyone I'm traveling and I
didn't realize until Francesca saw me
that was wearing a node PDX shirt so he
was mildly offended but he he let me
come in anyways you know so you see the
you see people adopting sort of
approximations of what Erlang can do I'm
not gonna make a claim that Erlang is in
some way gonna sweep it up but I've
always felt and I continue to see you
know I have evidence in the in the
market that there's a really strong case
that if you're building these services
many of these modules should in fact it
would lend themselves to being built
with early Erlang but I don't need to
convince you I don't think so let's go
back here
the rise of services go back to the
timeline think about the modularity that
we were we're talking about in these in
these in these applications it's not
surprising that them that the major
there hasn't been a major database
software launched in a couple of years
and what you have seen is the adaptation
of these databases to services so and
you also see things like firebase tempo
DB well temple TVs up there but you see
with Mongo lab object rocket Cloudant
was a like pouch itself was well ahead
of the curve but you now see you see if
you think about SendGrid if you think
about Tulio and we're not just talking
about page of duty we're talking about
core pieces of infrastructure that are
that are in some ways commodity
infrastructure are now being turned into
you know services that can be consumed
as part of this modular and loosely
coupled I mean it can't be any more
loosely coupled than then somebody else
runs it knowns it and you rent it so you
see against we organized it
chronologically you see that the
services are really the trend that
people are that the market is trying out
at least and there's a reason a couple
reasons one of them which I saw a lot at
Bash show is the the user base and
corporations in particular are well
developers are being educated or guided
towards usage-based pricing the
expectation is that you're going to
consume by by by usage and that you know
paying a hundred thousand dollars for
license license is when you don't know
that you're gonna use that much is is
resisted and it's resisted more and more
and you know there were companies that
we're negotiating usage-based pricing on
licensed software which is you know it's
a hard thing to do so this is much
easier to run it as a service and to
give them that metering so you've got
the you know the driver towards services
include just the way people want to
consume they're consuming all other
parts of the stack that or the or their
service or their or their their
technology kit that way and now they
want to see if they can consume database
infrastructure in that
there's another drive towards services
and this is one of the dominant trends
you know this move towards services that
we see and that's with that polyglot
utility you get polygon complexity you
know one of the things the right tool
for the right job
the only problem with this is you've got
four databases with very different
scaling properties you know they're
managed by four different foot by four
different projects and some of those
projects says we've seen when you look
at the the business drivers may not be
around in the same way or may have their
their roadmap taking in a totally
different direction
so with this flexibility there's polygon
flexibility you get the plot the the
polygon you get the cost I see again and
again in fact it's hard to find
companies that are running just one
database with just two databases and
again you look at the any an imager it's
the same thing
there was another trend that it's just
accelerating and in the next five years
will shape it and that's again moving
towards you know it supports the notion
of modularity rapid so there the this is
an interesting survey there's probably
about a thousand zombie api's here and
not all these api's are even sort of
relevant in it as you know enter by
enterprise class api's and a lot of them
are map api's but what you see is again
a trend or a drive towards consuming
services so if you look at taken
together you've got increased complexity
because of the utility but people aren't
going to want to give up the flexibility
of those queries you've got a desire a
business desire or to pay-as-you-go
you've got a modular architecture that
that's that that's amenable to snapping
in third-party services and you've got
you know at least the creation if not
the adoption of api's that again looks
very similar to the to the trend in an
open source and you see taken together
I'll make the assertion that
databases and data storage but by the
way licensed software license software
is not going away but five years from
now and things go much slower than when
you sit and predict things but there
will be a market move towards database
services as opposed to database
technologies and I won't say that I
don't know that we're gonna have another
cycle of 29 databases created it's much
more likely that we're going to see a
cycle of 29 services that provide the
same sorts of queries as those databases
created here's the I talked about the
commercial the commercial issues and
then I talked about jobs and I wanted to
I wanted to to establish that because I
think there's one antidote that didn't
exist before to to the attitude to your
favorite database getting purchased by
Oracle and their rodent and them
changing the licensing and and and and
driving the road map and that's that
this is this is a diagram Malcolm
Gladwell's assertion that you you gain
mastery at 10,000 hours it's as good as
anything I think it's I think it's
actually pretty interesting and it's a
good way to look at this if you think
about it we've had an increasing
interest in the in the in the in the
sector we've had an increasing adoption
rate although unmeasured these are open
source projects so all of the mastery
that's going into this sector all of the
of the learning and all of the
development of skills and and and and
and the understanding of difference
distributed systems is going to survive
any changes in the commercial landscape
you see I think you I think you've seen
you're seeing for the first time in
databases at least a complete decoupling
of the talent of talent from
commercial interests you can't keep the
converter you can't keep the talent
inside the commercial interest anymore
there's this mastery that's out there
it's are the genies out of the bottle
people now are building distributed
systems in lots of different companies
and I just gave you two examples of
companies that are building modular you
know loosely coupled or decoupled
stateless systems and they're doing it
using these sorts and several of these
databases and you know a majority of the
databases that you see in those two
slides from user and and github and
clout are no sequel databases the
mastery is is is out there there there's
a skill set that can't be contained by
any commercial by any commercial changes
and it's proliferating now and obviously
very few of us work you know 40-hour
weeks so mastery you know 10,000 hours
five years probably more like three four
years for somebody to really sort of
grasp the concepts and what is master
you really mean I'm taking a very
personal specific view of mastery things
like recon which Bachelor does which is
a distributed systems conference you
know sort of blog post that Kyle Kings
Barry's writing there's really there's
there's much more so than five years ago
and and and it's the trend just seems to
be accelerating there are they're there
the concepts of distributed systems
you know horizontally scalable
distributed systems fault-tolerant
systems it's out in the marketplace it's
out its out in the in the in the world
and it's not going anywhere
and you've got dozens of engineers
working at places like image your
Netflix Facebook that are gonna take
this knowledge into the next startups so
I think that the enduring legacy of that
of that quarter of billion dollars may
not be that a lot of investors make a
lot of money it may be I think it what
is going to be is it's going to be a
change to the to the way applications
are built and like I said something
happened at that
point and that's what we're sort of
we're sort of living with so I see that
in conclusion I'm gonna wrap this up I
think you're going to see a forking
paths you know the taxonomy that I
presented I deliberately presented it as
people presented where they make no sort
of indication of the scaling properties
or architecture of these of these
applications and I think that as you go
towards these loosely coupled stateless
systems these modular systems it's I we
see a trend in people using multi tenant
elastic fault tolerant data storage to
build a lot of that it's not saying that
there isn't a place for for the sort of
the scale-up sharded single master
models they're all over these things but
if you're talking about substrates you
know sort of the data pipelines they're
being built on the on the sort of
horizontally scalable systems which
include a couple of systems that have
been written in Erlang and I think that
the multi tenant scale out you know
accommodating databases the other trend
is that we'll see is a move away from
virtualization for databases as much as
possible because you're just not going
to get the dollar value of performance
so I guess just to hit the points again
financial considerations are going to if
we want to look five years forward the
financial considerations that shaped it
till now are going to completely they're
going to come home to roost I guess and
we're going to see changes in the
landscape of companies that are out
there supporting this technology and
hence changes to the to this
technology's roadmap that's the
technology that the company owns again
you've got this mastery out there that
that I think gives a level of immunity
to the market forces I see again markets
moving towards metered services and the
desire to consume services again
supported by the by the data including
just the companies that are be being
started and I think that the
you know the move towards these loosely
coupled systems that are really amenable
to to not amenable to but but but very
fault tolerant very resistant to it's a
failure of key components without total
service outages I think that's a that's
a direction that that will just continue
to accelerate and that's it thank you
for your time okay so I included
included in the slide I included you
know Scala node clearly there's an
appetite
it's encounter ly there's an appetite
for things that approximate what Erlang
does if not Earling itself you know I I
don't know exactly what you there's
there's lots of blog posts about you
know why people don't adopt Erlang it's
the funky syntax or whatever all I know
is when you look at the way these
systems are being built and you look at
the way Erlang has been conceived of
there seems to be very strong pattern
matching either the pattern at the small
scale in the pattern at the large scale
seem to be very amenable to one another
and so if you you know it seems like to
me it's a no brainer it's a really well
it's a it's a it's a it's a programming
language it's really well suited to
where this is going
to these sorts of discrete loosely
coupled systems and I mean that might be
the message that that that drives our
language option you know Basho Bachelor
wouldn't have survived as a company if
we hadn't chosen Erlang for a number of
reasons including just the support we
got from the Erlang community and you
know we're using Erlang and orchestrate
because
you know we're believers of course
Dizzy's here with me and and that's
something that we want to do but to me
there's it's a no-brainer to me the the
the the data is out there that this is
the sort of architecture that we're
going for and I think that this might
just be a call to action to focus the
marketing message on our lang towards
these sorts of architectures because the
to the to scale out sort of the the two
databases with the sort of scale out
properties that are needed to build
these applications are both on the JVM
and Scala is rapidly accelerating there
there there's something about them
whether it's just a JVM who knows it's
sort of the you know the you know the
the black hole grip that the JVM has on
on enterprises but for me I don't see
people going to Erlang because they're
gonna make the same observations that I
made I think that if we tell people
about the properties of Erlang has that
are overwhelmingly advantageous compared
to any complaints that they can bring
against it then we can then we could see
natural adoption increase and that's
what I'd like to see I'd like to see I'd
like to see five years from now I'm not
gonna make this prediction because the
data doesn't bear it out yet
but I'd like to see Erlang considered
the not node but Erlang considered the
language of these distributed
architectures because it's the one
that's the far by far the best suited
cool thanks anyone else okay one more
time give up for Antony thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
