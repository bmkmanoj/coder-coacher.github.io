elixir team I'm we're really glad to be
here doing these tools and to do this
same as the OTP team allylic syriza
starting to be a grown up language right
now it's almost three years old it's
very stable so we really version 1.0
almost three years ago we didn't have
any breaking changes things right now we
have we are at version 1.4 so we have
the number of contributors increased a
lot we have a very large community we
have a lot of conferences books going on
around elixir there's a lot of lots of
production elixir going on many
companies that opted it and we're really
happy generally acted with with the
direction lecture is going so right now
we're at version 1.4 and the plan is to
do releases of minor versions every six
months and the next version will be
version 1.5 which will be out as soon as
HP Twenties out and then we'll do six
months religious basically so first
thing I want to talk about this the is
the improvement in Alex 1.5 so the next
version so the first thing it's utf-8
atoms as Kenneth said yesterday we can
do this in OTP 20 said but why and I
said what of course Oh utf-8 atoms so we
actually we actually yeah it's spreading
yes so we actually contributed this back
to OTP so we were really after that we
were able to improve the whole ecosystem
we're really thankful to the OTP team
for all the help and the guidance in
implementing this what this means for
elixir
I mean to now you can do you can write
test cases where the title is utf-8 you
can write utf-8 other atoms and if you
use a subset of utf-8 they can be
without quotes as well
sadly emojis Niq Niq quotes for now and
you can use utf-8 variables as well with
a subset of utf-8 again and if you don't
think this is important you should go
read this very very long Erlang mailing
list thread which like has a lot of talk
about why this is important next
improvement we're really happy to having
1.5 is something called exception blame
so exception blame is a way of reaching
exceptions with so errors with the bug
information and so thanks OTP lightly we
can run now right the bug the bank
information into beam files and we're
writing basically Alex you're a st into
the beam files and what this means it
means that we can retrieve that ast
later and we can provide the user with
some useful debug information and for
now the exception blame only is it only
able to enrich function clothes errors
and the way to riches function code
errors is by basically saying what in
every in each Clause of the function
what failed to match basically so when
you get a function code error we would
say these are the arguments that you
gave to the function and these are the
closes of the function f and each and no
clothes matched and each close didn't
match periods of exactly this so
basically we will have a very clear way
to see why we no clothes match basically
and we have this in the elixir shell we
have this in the elixir testing
framework and elixir compiler and we
were able to do this in plug as well
which is like a web framework very
lightweight framework for lecture so
we're able to have the same thing the
same blame for for functions of this in
the web in the debugger plug debugger
for the web basically another thing we
worked on and it which is now basically
done
it's gen stage and flow
so Jen stage is a way library that make
makes you able to create components that
produce and consume events and where
events flow in a demand-driven way from
component to component with back
pressure and then flow it's a way to do
parallel computations on collections and
it's built on top of Jen stage side uses
translates any YouTube pages to do
perform parallel computation on
collections and we actually won't
include this in 1.5 so the original plan
was to include this both of these in
elixir but we ended up leaving them in
their own repositories because it works
really well with using them just as
dependencies literally cycle is is a bit
faster and I mean they work really well
as dependencies and if you want to read
more about Jen stage there's a lot of
really good blog post and you can read
all the like announcement and all the
features and and additional resources
and then we all have many many small
improvements so if you go to the elixir
wrap repo on github and look at the
change look it's going to list all the
improvements and bug fixes for the
version 1.5 so this is version 1.5
what's going to happen in the future so
the short term plan for the future what
we're going to do we want to do is we
want to duplicate couple calls so
probably most of you know but in Erlang
you can call tuples as if where they
were modules and this basically turns
out into a like a proper function call
and it's we think is pretty confusing
for users and it's pretty pretty
surprising behavior it leads to
convolute code so we want to remove this
difficut Deason elixir and just as told
me that someone from the OTP team may
have mentioned that this will speed up
compiler the compiler for XP but I mean
citation needed so if you have the
citation
give it to me so then the next thing we
want to do short term is dynamic
supervisor so basically in Erlang you
have
to revision strategies and one of them
is simple one-to-one but simple one for
one is very like it's very different
from all the other supervision
strategies and the whole API for when
you use the simple one for one stroke
the whole API first supervisor when you
use the simple one for one it's
different than when you use other
strategies so this is so we have a
pretty confusing and make mixed API
because we're trying to do everything
with the same API with different
strategies the documentation is really
confusing to read it because every
function in supervisor with basically
say if the strategy is not simple one
for one then this happens is the
strategy seen one for one then this
happens so we think it's better to have
like a separate supervisor called
dynamic supervisor that will just
basically be simple one for one and
we'll just have one strategy which is
one-to-one and it will replace the
simple one for one strategies basically
so this is the short-term term
improvement we're doing a lot of
research as well right now so we have a
bunch of research projects going on
first one is we're looking into
basically doing data strains and doing
property testings through on on top of
data streams so the progress is pretty
good in this so the idea is to have a
very lightweight quick Chek style Allah
Haskell quickcheck clicksor style
testing capabilities basically and we
want to build this into a Electress
testing framework and it will only work
with data generators it will not do paid
machine stuff for example like Erlang
squeak checks but we hope it's going to
be first of all very useful for like
data heavy testing and also that is
going to be a gateway to public testing
for many users it will discover
privilege testing through this and be
able to use it and be able to get to
know property testing so in the examples
you can see we're basically asserting a
property with generating strings from
two data streams which are data out
string so we generate two strings and we
have start test the function starts
string that starts with by with the data
generated by the by the testing property
testing framework basically so this is
the first research project and then we
get to google Summer of Code projects
accepted into four through bean
community and we're working on them we
just started working on them so the
first one is X format which will be a
code formatter for elixir so they will
take string of elixir coat and format it
according to legal experience your style
guide to another string of electric code
and we hope this will make contributing
to elixir easier starting out with
elixir easier because you don't have to
think about stuff like style and it will
definitely save time reviewing code so I
think it's going to be a great
improvement then we're the other project
where we got accepted is language server
protocol so language server protocol is
a mark soft standard for basically
intercommunication between editors text
editors and programming languages so if
you have a standard you don't have to
implement custom support for each header
for each language but you can just
implement this protocol and then as an
edger to implement this protocol we'll
be able to work very well with elixir if
we want elixir have something like this
as well and then we have last research
project we have a master student working
on HTTP clients for its master's thesis
so this is going to be a like the idea
to have a functional flexible HTTP
client that is very thin obstruction
over basically you can think of it as a
very thin obstruction origin TCP and
this we hope is going to be pleasant to
use it's going to be a very low level so
you can build on top of it and we have
the student working on it
if you want to get involved on any of
these stuff you can go to the week 3
repo there's issues to contribute to you
can go to elixir line org website so
we're very excited for the direction
that is going and that was all thank you
for the whirlwind introduction to what's
happening in the elixir land and me
being a part of it I've still got a
couple of tidbits and news that I find
most interesting we have a time for a
few more questions
I saw the info about Prada based testing
and I wonder why you want to introduce a
new property based testing framework
instead of leveraging trick proper or
EQC mini so we want this in elixir this
particular so this will be a very small
just data processing basically and we
want this in the elixir we'll probably
want this in electric core that's why
we're not leveraging we're not placing
it off any existing thing we want test
elixir standard library with it so we
don't talk sweetie to it we clear
and we want it to be part of like
integral part of the electorate X units
which elixirs
it's like elixirs testing framework
about I mean this is like it's pretty
small it's a pretty small piece of code
it's not like a huge huge work so I
think it's fine to have just this in
elixir standard library and then if you
need anything more you know you're going
to have to go to quick check or trick or
whatever other processing library
because we want to pour stuff like state
machines what we hope this is going to
be like a gateway to get to that any
more questions
okay then thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
