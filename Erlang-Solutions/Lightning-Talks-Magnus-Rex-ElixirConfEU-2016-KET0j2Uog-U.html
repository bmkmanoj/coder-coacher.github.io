and I want to demo a real-time
collaborative editor I've written in
Phoenix and L and so what you see is the
editors I have my slides there it's the
note itself air and a list of the nodes
to the right so the next slide I want to
do an experiment and I need your help so
I need a few of you to bring up your
computer and connect go to this address
be thought do / unnamed because the
editor is a name do we have a few hands
in the body doing this so I need a few
more yeah and the network is very spotty
so this is a really risky experiment but
we do it anyway so while you are doing
this and you have the address still hit
down here so why am I doing this yeah so
I think I really believe that that
effective communication is the key for
four teams and to be have an effective
team especially when when scaling them
and growing teams and so one of these
things you need to communicate is this
kind of common knowledge you have to
document their that's somewhere and we
have hack pad and we had like act like
that but I think there is still
innovation to be made and as a base for
this product I need a good collaborative
editor where people can in real time
edit the same document and also I mean
be thinking about this for like 10 years
but it's only now I feel I have the
tools that makes me want to do this I
don't want to spend too much time with
low-level things yes so now things are
starting to happening yeah so this is
actually seems to be working and that's
good because I didn't expect this to
work this well so the so this is my
flight I actually made another kind
book for people to and and it was empty
when it started so I am very happy that
it it works you as well and and actually
this is not a trivial problem to solve
because I mean you can you can actually
delete the position where someone else
has to cursor and for this to work with
latency and everything I have a
conflict-free replication data type also
helping me so I just want to say thank
you to to everybody that builds these
great tools for me so I I finally can do
this project and if you if you are
interested just talk to me and I did
have but it's I think it's gone I yeah
so nevermind I so let's do like this
yeah nevermind I i will tweet and yeah I
will yeah i can type yeah true hopefully
i can type yeah it might be a visible
I find a quiet area so yeah so you can
find me at Rick c-can and we can make it
bigger ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
