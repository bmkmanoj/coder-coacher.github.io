you're not too sleepy so because we're
going to look into a very interesting
topic of the release of grades so hope
you're ready so let me introduce myself
first my name is yeah Louise risk ow
it's a hard Portuguese name to pronounce
I've been working at mini clips and the
at the same time doing air wax is 2014
loving every minute of it and don't want
to go back again to all times
so yes mini clips let me introduce you
the company started out as a mostly
flash games company on the on browsers
on the web then pivoted to mobile we
have some pretty big hit single source 8
ball pool being the largest then a
Guardian soccer stars also so I work as
as was mentioned and the tech lead of
the 8 ball pool server and so it
definitely check out these titles I'm
sure you'll enjoy them or your kids will
most likely so 8 ball pool is our
biggest hit we have around it's a pretty
big game it's around 18 million di use
daily active users unique we have had
peaks of 750 K across several versions
and just for the game service room we
have large cluster largest of 26
machines a lot others to support other
infrastructure related social and
whatnot and it's mostly our one so bugs
I like this coat the guys inclined
showed me once I like it so the bugging
is like being the detective in a crime
movie where you are also the murderer so
yes I guess it rings true and we we feel
it bugs a perfective life you can really
escape and miss if you're writing
software you're right bugs that's
inevitable if you don't have bugs it's
because you're not really writing
software so let me tell you this story
on
in amusing story on 8 ball pool your
head once so it opal this is the main
screen where you can scroll across tears
to play in higher tears you have to take
higher amount of coins to to the to
enter and there's that little line
saying the number of online players on
that here so basically when you log in
you get from the server the numbers of
players that are playing and show it to
the client
you get paired with some and let's hear
it demands he would leave the game it
decrements
so we had this on one release we had
this merge gone bad so we had basically
a leak on the number of online players
per tier so it kept increasing and
increasing so we found that quick enough
and fixed it and the leak was gone but
still we had an issue because the the
valleys were still large cell production
talk to me and say hey can you do
something about this so yes I went to
the live servers I evolved more or less
the valleys and I set the new tier
values so that was fine and it was like
in the afternoon all day was running
smoothly until around 10:00 11:00 at
night
pager duty calls saying something's
broken it's your fault so I go around
the life and everybody was getting
kicked out everybody it was the biggest
drop I've ever seen fastest drop as well
so I went on live and quickly found the
issues so what I did when I set those
and made up values on the tiers I set
them slightly lower than what they
should be at the time so as night
progresses and people go to sleep into
other things the the number of
concurrent players starts to drop and
eventually it dropped below zero so what
had happened then was negative valleys
were being sent to the client we're
using proto Bluffs to encodes the death
number which was unfortunately an
unsigned integer so it was crashing all
connections and nobody could get in so
right so even it's unexpected
bugs happening you can't really prevent
them but you can do something about them
what can you do so the easiest approach
that I mean the the simplest one going
stop to serve
first fix the sink starting back up but
down time nobody likes downtime right
and negative gets another choice you
have the blue green deployments are also
quite useful so you have a load balancer
you keep two stacks blue and green
identical so we have an issue direct
traffic to the to the other stack make
sure that everything is running is
expected and that's it so if you have
persistent connections as we have in
pool you have to wait for clients to
eventually end up their games in their
sessions in go go to the to the stack
with the fix and so you probably want a
lot to make this or have someone else do
it for you but OTP gives us this nice
way of updating the running code without
and stopping anything so for simpler
fixes of course it depends on your use
case on this on the fix itself but some
cases might be simpler just to go and
get the servers
so these guys in doing so the dumbest
simplest approach you go make the fix
build the beam file with your fix go on
live or write the one has a bug attached
to the console just to load that's it
you're done but it gets messy if you do
this a lot of times so if if you're
applying a patch that there's it's more
than one module you better be sure of
the order in which you load them by
because it might run in some nastiness
so your app on life says it's running
some version but as you patch individual
modules and you don't do anything else
it's that's going not going to hold
anymore and you get can get up to a
point where you don't really know what
version you're running have to be
disciplined about it also if you do
changes on your system profile you
better do them on the console and update
the file first because machines come and
go you want the changes to be persisting
to not have regressions but it's not all
bad with this approach so you get to
apply your changes one at a time and see
how it works out and make sure that
there's no regressions or
issues so I have to keep in mind that
bug fixes can have bugs themselves and
most of the times they're even worse
than the original ones because you're
doing them in a rush you're cutting
corners try and get things done fast so
on the topic of hot coloring so that the
simplest explanation is and the naive is
my point of view is just per module to
code pointers are being held is the
current pointer and the old one so when
you load a new version of that module
what happens is the current points to
the new codes in the old keeps pointing
to the old code and any qualified
function call you make will go to the to
the current month as you know the gen
server and all of the jumpstart
behaviors have a lot of logic inside the
loops and whatnot and they give you this
for free you have to keep in mind for
example if you if your process is
blocked on plugging on something that is
not going to make a fully qualified
function call you might not see the
changes so you you're blocking on except
for example you do the code loads and
the changes seem to not be taking effect
this is because of this this feature so
the load the load the call if you look
at the typical you'll see the layout of
the call is simply do a code purge of
the module and then load it so code
purge by default is a brutal purge you
also have the soft purge there's some
changes in OTP 23 regarding this I have
to look into them bit deeper but yes so
this is up until nineteen I believe or
eighteen a purging you have the soft in
the brutal purge so the soft checks all
processes running if any of them are
running old codes this it makes this
call that our line check process codes
it will single file the call and not go
through the brutal one it's a brutal as
it as its name implies it checks and
kill there's anything that runs out code
so you might get you might get a killed
process doing second load of the same
module the another something more or
less related is the stickiness of the
directories so you can stick in and
stick and stick directories on the on
the on on any on the search paths and
basically code load file will fail this
is how lists for example the OTP F Sarge
declared a sticky to prevent it from
doing load of other the built in modules
I heard somewhere that this was related
to people that creating their own lists
module so they wanted to prevent this so
there really separates that there's a
structure way of changing codes of doing
the same task but need a bit more of a
structured way so you have the gen star
code change methods you can it allows
you to start new applications it reloads
the sis config file of the new version
informs the applications of what was
changing those config files and also
operating on downgrades of applications
downsides of it's they're really
complicated so in the on Fred's book
learning Samara language there's a
there's a picture in there describing it
as the ninth circle as well and yes so
it does a walk through most people skip
it's it's it's pretty complicated so the
workflow on that it begins by you
writing an app file an application
upgrade file so this application a
pre-trial is then translated to a
release upgrade file which is kind of
the lower level version of the
application upgrade and then with that
with the release of great and new codes
you can apply the the the upgrades on a
running instance and have that running
it new so that the basic structure of an
application operate files so it contains
set of instructions that allow you to
define how it how the application can be
a curated and downgrades you might want
to do down grades or rollbacks
so it's a single term of this form
and basically the VSN keeps a version
the current version more or less and you
if you want to parade from a prom
version that those are the instructions
you apply if you want to downgrade to
that version those are the other
instructions you apply so this is an
example from grades from 1.9 2.0 on the
application upgrade you have a lot of
instructions that you can specify you
have the load module it allows you to
load module into the VM it takes a
module the pre purge in post purse
strategy I mentioned those two types of
pert and purge strategies these are
applied before and after the load and
also a list of dependency modules this
allows you to inform the VM and what
order do you want to load the modules
and then you have add and delete module
that those take dependencies as well and
the adds removing the restart
application the epicyte you have the
update which is a special method that
allows you to synchronously update
processes running the dead module so
it's applied to Gemstar processes so it
basically obtains the supervised
processes that are running this module
and then it writes for them ask them to
suspend themselves and then have them
call the code change called I get a lot
of people don't implement because
they're going don't use it release
grades so the code change
Kovach takes the old version the state
of the current really running version
and next argument which is custom data
they want to pass through your callback
and then the results you return a new
state which is the migrated state so the
extra argument is beta test comes
directly from the application upgrade
file so the update here is the the
module the timeout
a change at soft advanced extra so you
see here the advanced texture on the on
the change the extra term is where you
pass the custom arguments you want to
see being in called on the code change
and then as well pre-purchase version
typical the pendency modules also the
configuration changes it gives you so
after the upgrade the application
controller will compare the new
configurations the old in the new
parameters and it will invoke your call
back on the on the Panda on supposedly
the topmost application file invoke the
config change
Kovach it gives you the change entries
the new ones and the ones that were
removed so we can tailor specific
behavior to act on these so if you want
to do by hand this is the short version
very short version you write the Apple
file you give it to sis tools and
systems gives you the make rail up and
makes our commands and then you take
this result you go to the to the note
and then you can call release handle
methods to and back to release check
which releases are running install the
release and make it permanent you can
you can choose not to make it permanent
which means if you stop start the note
it will still run the old version before
it's that permanent the so on the terms
on the subject of automation there are
some efforts to try to ease the burden
of the developer on this on these issues
so there are already some plugins that
take away some of this manual labor that
they have to go through so there's a
roll up rail flow and this other one
which is when I wrote which is rebar
free up a plugin so I'll be telling you
about a bit of the features that it
gives you so at a glance it gives you a
generation it generates the application
upgrade for you he takes care of the
module dependencies of the the release
you want to upgrade it validates and
compiles an app apps or
file an optional file that you can
specify and it does the Alpha migration
of the state records automatically or it
tends to show in terms of epic
generation you simply have to generate
to release versions which is the one
you're on lives supposedly right now and
the one you want to go to the one you
want to upgrade to so you tell the
plug-in to generate the application that
great file so it does this it checks out
the two releases find out what was
changed and generates the instructions
necessary to bring one version to the
other so it takes care of all the adding
loading upgrading modules it also checks
for changes in the in supervisor specs
and generates the what the instructions
needed to start/stop the children of
that supervisor the module dependencies
are part of it are determined using
crossref so it it basically knows which
modules are changed so it uses crossref
to find the invocations of each of those
modules intersection with what was
changed and just give this list to the
to them in the in the application
upgrades for the vm stickers so
basically just need to tell which
dependencies exist for each module so if
you can't really support enemy calls if
you make if you build items with module
in em evoke them manually
there's no way the plugin for this
vertices info to see this so it's just
static calls it's also validates an
epoch source file so you can always
generate your wrap-up file and go with
that
but sometimes you want to put some finer
range instruction on your app file so if
you want to put it in source control so
that you do it the same way as you do
your app source file you create an app
dot source file you put it along your
your source code so when you say compile
it will check it validate it templates
and evaluate it so the templating you
have some building variables mustache
variables that you can put in your app
of source file and right now it's just
the VSN which is the current version of
the release it's evaluated also so it's
run as if it were an excrete file and it
has one state variable once they
building variables that you can use
which is the rebar free state and then
you can call from methods from your both
your release add rebar freeze to obtain
information from this state if you so
issue entity ended validating ensure
that there's an ax valid ePub format
that it produces so this is a simple
example so it uses it goes it uses the
state variable and it fetches
information regarding the red lab
application and then it extracts the
version which ensures that it matches
the the current version being employed
it and then generates the final term
which is a pub the apart term so you can
see you you can actually specify regular
expressions on on the matching of the
versions so here no matter where I
operate to or downgrades and upgrade
from or downgrade to I always restart
this application so state migration this
is a tricky one so most of the gen
servers the ones I use and why do people
use keep sites and usually do the do
that through a record so there are
changes where you your fix needs to
change the record structure but it's
going to be tricky doing that because as
you know tuples are records or stop just
tuples in the inner leg so if you for
example do it add another field to the
middle of the record or yeah that's
that's the trickiest one you have some
choices for it you can do it manually
you can on the code change you get the
previous state extract all the values
and then by hand set all the elements of
the new record you can use this nice
project of
embedded in the parse transplant the
project there's SPX it's a person funded
you can declare on your file this will
basically generate a bunch of methods
for every record defining their gather
set or whatnot and there's this
interesting one which is convert which
lets you convert from one record to
another you have to define the tool it
just converts the the tool and the the
final choice is using the plug-in code
ejection facility so how does it do it
so upon your request so you need to
specify tell the plug-in which record
holds your state so it will inject code
directly into the code change method so
to do this manual thing you would
normally do but it does this
automatically so it converts between two
records so upon this request the plugin
will get the old abstract code is the
new version bin get the record
definition as well and the current and
previous versions it will inject a call
directly into your code change
invocation
they're just converts from one record to
the other there are some caveats to this
of course if you if you remove records
if you rename records it's as if they
were removed but it essentially tries
just to map out the previous in the
current values and just and then just
overwrite the final being file so when
they release a great occurs in the code
change gets called what you get from the
argument is no longer the old state it's
not the new state because the injection
call did that migration for you so you
can still access the old state it's kept
in the extra arguments it's as it has a
double so it assumes there is a list
so yeah let's let's see a bit of this
working hope so right now I use this
relic one project it's a very simple one
and it's running 1-0 11 version so you
see 1 0 11 and it's a very simple
project it has one supervisor and right
now it has two children and we'll
looking at rel observe to get it States
so it has just a state record with an ID
element which is 0 right now so let's
change it why not so let's change it to
42
okay so let's our system it's running so
I'll go just through the workflow
generating the actual relat so right now
we are on 1 0 11 which is the same
version their lives and we'll just build
our release in which is the source
release so we build that we go now to
our target release which is this the
next one might be some other and let's
look what I did in that one so what I
did simply was on the ID added two new
two new fields to our state record which
is name and description there are
binaries initialized to empty binaries
and here on the cottage methods what is
simply being done is getting extracting
attributes and just printing them out in
this Maya foreign exchange go change
so we're now on one zero twelve I'll
generate that release so now we have two
releases so there's no ambiguity and
which one I want to generate the
application up right so I'll just ask to
generate it so you see it generated one
application upgrade from one zero 11
2002 12 let's take a look at that so the
application to upgrade from 1 0 11 to 1
0 to 12 I need to update the this module
this is the advanced instruction telling
it it's a gen star process that needs to
be Co changed and this is the strategies
that are default which is purge pre and
post if I want to put down grades from 1
0 11 from 1 0 12 I would run the exact
same instructions because nothing has
changed this article so I'll just
generate developed generate the tar file
so you see here hitting this line here
as you can see this injected code for
state record migration of process real
app server 2 from 1 0 11 0 12 this is
the code change injection thing so I'll
just deploy that so I'll move that a / a
tarball to my live installation so to
speak and I'll apply it so right now the
versions that are running I can just
call this and I see 1 0 11 is running
and it's per minute so what I want to do
is up rate 1 through 12
and now I'll check that so we have one
zero twelve which is set a Thurmond
which is the default and when they were
11 which is Mark is old
I could still roll back to it if I
wanted so the code change I got so you
see the code change from these numbers
in the hash of the the beam file the
previous one it's changed from this one
to the next and as you can see it should
be printing out the old version an old
state record but it's not really because
it's been changed already so it was the
the old record was extracted of all its
values the new record is instantiated
and then set with the old values so from
now you have the new states and then you
can check the version so it's running on
0 12 there's really no ambiguity here
and the state is not this so let me show
you this other use case so go to 1 0 19
once the writing 19 is or less the same
structure yes sorry we have two children
of this supervisor as rv2 in SRV and now
let's go through the epic workflows
we'll just check out from 0 19 and I
have to do something first because on
this route on this one version behind so
two versions behind I create an app up
source file so so for the purpose of the
demo don't really want to use that so
I'll delete it so it's not it doesn't
get picked up I want to use the one
let's get in right in here so I'll just
generate this release go to one zero 20
which is one I want to end up in and let
me show you what it does so 1 0 20 at
New Relic I serve it freed supervised
gen servers so what this needs basically
is just adding a new gen server to the
supervisor and this new gen server
it's basically simple doesn't do
anything else just adds so let's go
through the release so we generate 1 0
20 generate the app app file ass ship
sorry
I have more than I have four versions
now I'll see if I can get out of this
one so I have to tell it which one does
it need to operate from and - I think
it's from one 0:19 from version maybe -
is yes sir so then was right okay it's
always easy way starting from zero okay
- writ10 19 right 1 0 20
ok so 1 0 19 1 0 and 20 so this is the
application upgrade it needs so to
upgrade from 1 0 90210 20 need to add
the roll-up SRV free module you need to
update a supervisor because the spec is
change of course and then you need to
apply this method which is just
restarting the child of the supervisor
to downgrade you need to do the inverse
calls so you need to terminate the the
child you need to delete it from the
supervisor then you update the spec and
then you delete the module so it's the
universe calls so you generate this
relat on 0 20 so I have 1 0 19 running
yes I see someone's playing it out
already nice you can mistake that sound
I'm sorry forgot star generate the tar
let's deploy it to 1 0 19 yes
you move to it send drill versions okay
let's upgrade it 1-0 20 okay so it's
pretty - 1 0 20 let's see so something
happened here the roulette supervisor
said it started the rally pass every
free gem server so we'll get it and
actually running so yeah get some more
other interesting commands that you can
run in here sites checking versions so
you you're done we're done checking this
version is ok it's running as expected
so you can just uninstall it from the
system so you say install of the old
version
and it's gone so so yeah this is
basically what I have Thanks
all right so we have a few minutes for
one or two questions really close
hi I have a question about the dependent
application upgrade where we're find the
dependent modules great I mean the
module dependencies are are they
generated specifically your application
I mean my main application depends on
some atom applications and I want to
upgrade depending on dependent ik
applications okay so I guess this would
be the order upon which the application
of create files are applied to your
system we you generate one application
of grid file per application so when you
say the developed file the release
handler this is actually a nor the way
the thing is ordering the release of
grades final results I have a really
good answer for that because I never
encountered that the need to upgrade a
lot of applications which are
interdependent I've done braids which
are not dependent I've never really had
a need to enforce one order before the
other so yes I can really answer that
that it's something I'll look for for
sure
anyone else yep I hope so it's regarding
the module dependencies you did cover
with access what rules do you derive
from the core graph so it's a very
simple approach actually it just takes
for a module it just gets
xref to spit out all the dependencies
there all the modules that it uses and
then it simply intersects that with what
you have to upgrade so if you have three
modules who are great and then it just
uses that for intersection with what
each module has to say the modules it
uses and then it simply gives this to
the declare this list as as dependencies
so actually the the release handle is
really doing the hard work here which is
connecting all doing the graphing and
ensuring what gets applied in which
order so this list is just what is being
used and then release handler does the
rest
so if module a call the function module
build them module is dependent on B or
beginning so yes if you yes so the on
the application load module you will see
on the list of the module a you would
see module B there so we just keep that
way you're informing really central that
it needs to load module B first but
you're just stating the list of
dependencies you're not the really
central ensures that the the order in
which they are applied okay I think it's
a very simplistic approach this I spent
some time trying to figure out how to
load modules in a safe order and
actually I had to put on a lot more
rules than simply okay let's let's talk
mister
all right we are out of time so please
