I'm basing some paulo brazil be working
with elixir since 2015 when i joined a
local startup they're called Sherpa been
a proud member of the san paulo elixir
meetups we have one every month when
site meetups for non represented groups
this is really good we've been growing
the community before that also like
between I've done lots of Java work
house mostly with search and analytics
with solar and Kafka spark and stuff
like that since November last year I've
been working full-time for tellings it's
a company from Chicago and worked
remotely for them and a curiosity for
the local people i have polish friend
that introduced me to this musician that
i really really like and sorry for the
pronunciation but it's Monica Koopa and
every lacking so telex is telecom
company it started by building a trifle
infrastructure for customers with large
volume of calls to has her own network
with points of presence all over North
America Europe and Asia and being trying
to offer more high-level developers
targets of services so project I work
there is about controlling calls via
api's what it have is and someone calls
one of our customers numbers we pause
the call with sending us notification
via web hook saying well there's a call
from this number to this number a bunch
of metadata they can look at it and
decide which actions today and while I
was building these search those men the
idea for it all came because I used
protocols to solve these and I thought I
felt nice and made sense
don't well let's get to the meat of it
so data in behavior of Houston because I
want to start with two than different
quotes the first one is
Michael Fowler and says that combining
data and behavior is the fundamental
principles of all design and it says
that in in a good light like the
guillotine and in the other hand from
the book joy of closure says that a
coupling function and data is one of the
downsides of object-oriented programming
so you have one hand one perhaps one of
the most influential persons of the Java
whole world saying that coupling data
and behavior is one of the core things
there and it's a good um the other one
from the function word saying that well
there is a downside so well I wanted to
explore that right is it really a
downside is good and how does it work
and going back to that call control
thing what we needed was something like
that
we had several commands that we need to
send via socket as binary strings each
command can take a different set of
parameters and we would like to that
adding new commands should be easy once
you get the basis and working adding new
stuff should be just small iterations
sending commands should look the same
and work the same for all then and we
also like to tackle some cross concerns
with logging authorization and so on
well so start thinking of how would I
design that using objects of Atomics for
this project sonic sir but I thought
well let me try using objects and said
I've used Gavin before but in some years
so dissolves IDO called it's not valid
in any language that I know but well for
once a command to have like an interface
for a command has a method render it's
going to return a string
and for sending commands to travel a
commander class and has a send command a
method that takes the command used the
render function to get the binary string
and send that that via socket in tomato
commands to have classes like play that
implements the command interface has
three attributes like you IDE audio
that's going to play to each channels
and implements the render method which
generates the string for playback and to
have a new command like record the
different set of attributes are going to
have a different constructor still
implements command has a render method
and can generate the string so with that
adding new commands it's easy which is
create a new one
whatever I've implemented command you
implement the render function and it's
good so with that we have our commander
class and it is extensible and I can
just add a new command that implements
the interface and works and like Eugene
said it it's open closed I don't I don't
need to touch the commander code to add
and your command so looks fine so far
but well what if you need more methods
one thing what we could for example add
a new log method to the command
interface but that will mean adding the
log to all of the classes that are
implementing this interface another
option perhaps will be to add a new
interface a log of a one with login you
can implement both interfaces but then
again if you want to use the new log
functionality you have to change the
commander so in order to add new objects
new commands it's easy we just add a new
one that implements the interface and we
can pass that but to add more methods
then you have there's just no easy way
to add that without touching the
existing code
but well it it works five checks all the
points that we wanted for Co control
soon of not bad then we see downside so
far well then for functional claims if
you want to start with a simple version
you can have for example at commander
model have a sin function that takes the
command renders that string and sends it
to you Sokka
and instead of objects would have a
straps over place track record strap
from elixir and the simple sting would
be like in commander I have the render
function and I can have multiple pattern
match clauses for each of those and
generate the string but that how to add
a new command well you have to add a new
clause for the render with a different
pattern match clause so you have to talk
to Commander class and the same thing
for a new function you have to add a new
one log with better matching for all so
not very good and the thing is that this
is the way of dealing with our language
because a pattern matching it allows you
to dispatch first threat but it's not
possible to do that with following the
open/close thing you have to change the
model that's the has that the function
and my opinion this is one of the things
the main for the reason for least
existing and forget I also have a quote
but you know it's here but it's full of
blog post with sauce on URI from call a
why elixir and that poses that after
working with Erlang for quite a while we
thought that the language was yeah so
simple
that it made it hard to avoid
boilerplate and structural duplication
so after working with that for a while
he thought that functional programming
was inferior to
object-oriented at least when it came to
code organization
in my view protocols one thing that can
change that some in that example of call
control one have a protocol for a
command the hands of render function and
then using the same street like before
play and record we can implement that
that command protocol for play and then
have the implementation for the render
function for play and vote for record
and we go back to the commander now the
function takes a command and instead of
using a function with a bunch of pattern
matching clauses use the protocol to
dispatch based on the type of that
struct
so we get the string and send it via
socket so checks all the marks and it
looks much much nicer so oh it looks
great and when I see that well my string
stick your life okay
what is it what is purko widely exists
how do they work I mean and well that's
take years for well what what is the
protocol and protocols elixir door
heavily inspired by closure and this
sort of phrases I took directly from the
closure manual since the protocols were
created to provide high performance and
dynamic polymorph ins as an alternative
to interfaces and to have the best part
of interfaces while avoiding the
drawbacks the way I read this is that is
about providing contract for your data
types to be able to dispatch some types
and to have the implementation of that
contract not be tightly coupled with the
implementation of your type enclosure it
looks a bit like this
each print is for producing no closure
experiences opens a list the first thing
in the list is the function the rest
our argument so whilst in here is
defining a protocol P it has two
functions foo that takes one argument
and bar the Thank You arguments X and Y
and the dispatch is always on the first
argument that sax and then can define a
new type foo with a B and C as
attributes that implement a protocol P
and the implementation for foo is
returning a an implementation for bar X
Y is returning y plus scenes so then
when we apply foo to the Foo one two
three we got a so it's 1 + r/n rot by
bar that's the same type food and 43 we
get for it you plus see that speed so
for a 5 and if you look at how that is
implemented in lecture it's almost the
same you have that protocol P with two
functions full takes one argument the
bar - Q then you define your structure
model and you're defining plantation for
tea
so things have turns a and at c plus y
so that's where they came from and from
closure the idea was to be like a better
version of interfaces so what can you do
with it well first you can and this this
is examples from elixir getting started
because I was thinking well maybe if you
use something different but this is very
straightforward some white changes so
death protocol size so just a function
size and what can you do you can
implement that for native types for
example size broker compliment for bit
string and the implementation should go
to bite side of the string and format
the map size so when you run that and
you get the size of the avocado string
there's avocado in Porky's and my go-to
string for debugging stuff so when I
have a bug it's avocados all the way
that several artists and getting the
size of the maps just two keys
turn you can also and that is DT no
protocols implementing that for strats
so to define bagged struck with a list
of items and then implements in size of
it you can encounter lists of items so
it is the size of the bag three items
it's there and the thing is that here
the implementation is being defined
inside the model that's defined this
truck but it doesn't have to be like
that you can have the definition of a
model in one place and the definition of
the implementation of the protocol in
another place so it's decoupled from the
implementation of your strap beside that
protocols also can have defaults so you
can implement size for the any type so
that's kind of fall back and when using
instruct you can derive the protocol
that's going to use the any
implementation to define protocol for
your strap so if you as the size of this
size less strap it returns zero because
that's 10.8 you for any any class um you
can do pattern match on implementation
for any so if you take a strap that has
a size key you can return the value of
the key otherwise return 0 so then if
you have a struggling sizable with size
field it's going to return that so it
seems very very useful and simple to use
well looking at that second question was
well how it looks simple but why elixir
has per calls and Erland doesn't if it
looks that simple then I try to recreate
protocols
you know elixir out using the feature
implementation
and well first we need to find instruct
in elixir a structure is a map with a
magic key so distracted data is a map
with underlined line struct underlie
that the value is the model that's
defining that strat and then have the
other attributes and with that we can be
a bit clever you could have a protocol
model that can dispatch based on the
type of a struct
so using that magic key we can get the
model that implements the struct and
then we can use apply to use that
function name of that model passing the
destruct itself as an argument and that
would look a bit like this have in our
case we was playing record straps pulled
in with a render function and we use a
protocol to dispatch you can call
protocols dispatch with the function in
play well that it's a first
implementation but it's not really there
because for once the implementation is
defined inside the model just define a
structure is not decoupled and well
there's no guarantee that functions are
going to be there and then it starts to
be a bit more clear why elixir has this
sort of stuff and a link doesn't because
we can use macros so if you define the
protocol and you have a macro to define
implementation and this is a clever
thing that it does but you can define
values of a protocol for a struct you
didn't do block and what it does is that
you
define a new model there is a
concatenation of the protocol name with
district name so if you're implementing
command for play it generating the
command dot play model and the what you
pass in the do block is what's going to
be the implementation of death and then
when you going to dispatch on the for
that protocol you get instruct the model
implements that struck you can catenate
that with the protocol based name and
you use apply to dispatch on the
implementation model the function naming
data so when we go to the plain record
common what you have now is the
definition macro that can implement
command for playing record and now we
have decoupled things because the
implementation for the render function
is outside of the model of the struct so
we get that benefit but when we go to do
that this dispatch thing well it it's
almost Erika's you had to use the
protocols dispatch and then you pass the
protocol name the function and run rooms
so the only thing missing would be to
call directly the protocol like we did
before so command dot render and passing
in destruct and well these ones it's
hard and I was looking at electrical and
it's a bit intense but what happens is a
bit like this when when you have def
protocol there is a macro so you're
defining the protocol that is the name
and passing a block what it's doing is
defining that model but inside that
block it it overrides the definition of
death so there's a funny
you have the head of a function for the
footbath render that's a new macro and
after it redefines the DEF macro it
unquote your block the way it does and
this is a very very simplified version
because the electrical is much more
clever this well you're defining a
function so we have the function name
and the arguments and what it does it's
then use a kernel that that's original
one to define the function with the name
and the implementation is to get
implementation of that protocol for the
data structure they just pass then call
that name on that implementation model
passing the same arguments so not very
easy to understand but it looks a bit
like this so when you created that
protocol command and have that render
this simplified version was what's going
to be generated is like this you have a
render function that's going to look up
the implementation for command of
command 4x and then call render on that
model and to get that it's that clever
thing of concatenating the protocol name
with the start until name then ensuring
its compile and if it's there you've
returned that stroke
if not you return nil so yeah very easy
to understand not or not and but one of
the things that when you look at that it
doesn't seem really good because you
have to imagine for all of the calls
redo to a protocol you have to
concatenate protocols and then you have
to ensure the cold slowed and then do
dynamic dispatch on that model so
doesn't seem very efficient
and that's when one of the things come
that's consolidation and I'm I don't
even dare to try to show the code
because during consolidation what it
happens is that after if you have all of
the protocol implementations for your
structs and need that data types it goes
back to the protocol model get through a
track called and rewrites that in for
functions so instead of these that's the
non optimized version it generates a new
one with a bunch of pattern match
clauses so it doesn't have to do the
check all the time and that's why it is
good to use protocols okay so that is
how protocols work and find the final
question why I mean I think hasn't even
been working for years so why add it and
I think the most important thing is
about extensibility so you want to be
able to extend what your code can
achieve without modifying what it is so
one of the protocols that are native to
the language is string that chars and
that's the one that has the two string
function now when you do string
interpolation and you pass its track
this is the protocol that's being used
so for example you have a product with
Tyron price and you want to print that
with title and comment and price that's
how you do it you can extend the
functionality when implementing that
protocol
and there's all sorts of static leverage
the power of protocols do so like poison
poison
it was library for encoding the
J'son and decoding agent that was like
the most used one until it was use it
chasm the new one came but it's still
the main difference in poison in chasm
is that poisoning implemented for straps
and then you can extend the way it works
so you can define encoding and decoding
functions for your struts and since the
implementation is decoupled from the
implementation of the strategy can
define that for starts defined by
libraries you use also another thing
that is very useful for protocols and do
something before it's for well up
serious stuff like searching if have a
data structure you need to index in the
last assert this is a really good
library and it uses protocols for that
so you can implement to a document
protocol for your struct and with that
it's really well it's an uniform way of
indexing stuff because then as long as
you implement that protocol for your
strat it's well you can just pass the
strap to any code is going to interface
with elasticsearch so this is the sort
of stuff to the protocol were created
for its main creating abstract and
extensibility that I think that is the
key word well
I guess what about behaviors because I
didn't just gave a talk about solid
elixir and in all the cases that used to
use interfaces for all code for examples
where we behaviors and when you go to
the behaviors documentation it it's it's
their life behaviors can be thought of
as interfaces for Java but at the same
time you go to protocols they're
supposed to be like interfaces well
what's the difference and from the well
it's better building example so for a
command can be a protocol so what you do
is you dispatching on the type so you
saying in order for a struct to be a
command
it has to adhere to this protocol and
then the commander could be a behavior
so in order for a model to behave like a
commander it has to implement that this
convert this behavior you can have a
callback for I'll not render its and
sorry so a sin function that takes the
command and returns an OK or ever and
with that you could you could have like
a fake commander always returns ok or
your actual implementation socket for in
our example so my view is that protocols
the working types of the dispatches on
type and it's a contract for your data
so in order for each district is
something it it is this protocol so then
it has to do to that
and protocols are elixir only and for
example like poisons encoding
serializing struts so in order for this
track to be serializable has to adhere
to that protocol and behaviors they work
more model so you did the dispatcher
model and it's a contract for someone to
perform an operation or some other to
perform an operation
another example be like sending emails
you can have sending emails by a SMTP or
IMAP or go to an API or go to mocks and
behaviors you haven't Erlang cue well
and I guess bottom line of all this and
one who says that when you go back to
those cubes have poles in beginning like
saying that coupling data and behavior
is one of the fundamental principles of
all and that that's also downside well
coupling data and behavior can be good
lecture protocols are awesome I think
when people complain about coupling data
and behavior on all languages it's not
that it's bad to do it just they're
comparable being forced to do it all the
time
because we don't have to use protocols
all the time and well it's peculiar fast
but that was what I had to say so thank
you and questions
so I estimate we have about time for 15
questions hi thanks for the talk
I'd like to add one more thing perhaps
to make the distinction between
protocols and behaviors isolating
features within directories makes a lot
of sense and this is a you can do this
with protocols because you can really
extract the feature and put it away from
the data that you're operating on so you
can isolate the domain models and
feature and the behaviors feature wise
in separate models with behaviors you
can't do that because it's everything in
one module that means sense
I was talking about digital protocols
versus behavior yesterday and I had a
problem while receiving binary data from
TCP socket and having to choose each
struct represented that particular one
so have a header which I didn't fire and
had to choose one and well when I had to
do that also and for that I use even
though it's Stratton's like this is the
package I used behavior because then and
this function just checking if it
matches that kind of struck so you you
pass the binary block to the match
function if it returns then you use that
model to create the struct so I guess
the thing is that protocol and behavior
it seems more of a general guideline of
being a team or performing things
depending or use case it's not going to
fit that it's not a strict definition my
opinion
yeah I just wondering if you had like a
feel for like the performance hit for a
protocol dispatch versus like a straight
dispatch sorted the less pardoning like
standard method dispatch versus like a
protocol dispatch like you said it gets
compiled down into like a pattern match
but like if you have lots of protocols
is it a certain amount slower like I
said a few percent like yeah after it's
compiled it's just a pattern match so to
be kind of like that first version there
should command the commander having
several render clauses so it's exactly
the same so if you just one hop you just
go to a function pattern match and then
you call the action point again so if
you're gonna resort to that anyway then
this is a good way to Isaac no perhaps
Devon has something because def amassed
is has a repository on github that
benchmark benchmarking a lot of
literature stuff so maybe connect there
and if it's not that would be a good
addition thanks I'm gonna try this out
at school any more questions
okay so let's give our speaker final
round of applause
