recent work I did on a ranch which is
circuit acceptable for cowboy in details
but first I will start by introducing
OTP so I wonder if anyone here doesn't
yet use OTP mechanism like supervisor
applications nobody so I'll go over it
quick it's it will be up to be borrowing
first 10 minutes but it's important
because there's a good point to this so
let's go if it wants to work okay so OTP
is what it why do I need it how long is
already concurrent for further I want it
does distribution and so on it can
upgrade your code life so why do I need
OTP okay so I'm not going to use this
why would you need it because for tesco
tells you that you do okay that's a good
reason Francisco can be scary what I pay
give you things that you can use to
build systems so you don't write code
anymore right systems and you can use
this to quickly create applications so
it's very useful and you should use it
as much as possible but you could do
without you could remove OTP former long
you could but it's not of course a good
idea because then you have to provide
most of it because you will need it so
let's take a look to prove that we can
remove a TV this is what the vm does
when it starts it loads a few very
important modules of course because it
needs them to load the rest of the
vm and then it starts loading the main
modules can island st deli which has are
which are always loaded and then it
starts a few processes and then the
application controller and then you are
inside OTP itself so you could replace
this by anything else and i'm going
actually to replace a little part of
this well not on the boot sequence but
i'm going to replace a little part of OT
p with my own stuff but it's the ruins
inside OTP so we will see we have to
sync up to two different applications in
OTP Webley library applications which
are just modules and they don't have any
processes so these are desire z they
they are not interesting we have normal
OTP applications which are both modules
and processes these are more interesting
because these applications always have
one top level supervisor and this repair
supervisor knows about all the processes
in the OTP application and this is what
we are going to look at so yeah the
application gave you isn't it
interesting it just starts and stops the
application the supervisor is
interesting because this is what starts
your processes you shouldn't start any
process without going to a supervisor
simply because then it's very help to
debug it's impossible almost impossible
to upgrade and so on so the supervisor
is very important and probably the main
component to full torrents so so far we
don't have anything actually useful we
don't have anything that I can actually
hung curd so this is where the gen
server comes in and I'm pretty sure when
you write
when you write the process it's most of
the time of gin server and that's normal
most most of the code should be a gentle
but we are also going to look at how to
not use gin server while still keeping
the OTP concepts and we have a few their
behaviors but we're not going to look at
this today so should you use behaviors
for everything no why do you know why
journals so sometimes you want to
supervisor but you have you need to also
have some code that is going to keep
track of which processes our life and
this can't be done inside the supervisor
you can turn your own code inside the
supervisor so you need to have a
separate process and this separate
process kind of does the same job as the
supervisor so it's a waste and another
case is when you want something like a
gene server but much faster because
there's some overhead with Gonzaga
because it has to be generic enough to
be able to handle all possible cases so
when you have a case like this I'm sure
under da case similar you follow jobs
advice you simply roll you on and when
you do you should use a special process
so does anyone here knows what a special
process heat a few very few so let's
look special processes are implemented
are started with poor clip and must
follow the seas protocol specifications
so they are pretty much the same
processes except they have some extra
information attached to them and they
apply to some specific messages
otherwise that they are just normal
processes and when you actually
implement a process as a special process
people will may not notice the
difference with the gen server they can
very well use it just like they would
agenda where they can still use for
example sis get status to get the state
of the process so this is what we are
going to look at poor clip as a few
functionalities of course it doesn't
just start processes is make sure that
the process started properly so when you
create a process with poor clip you have
to in the initialization of your process
you have to use in it are to tell
proclip that the process started
properly so that that's not much and
then proclip also said some information
in the Pacific tionally about the
process who called who created the
process what are the ancestors and
what's the initial call and when your
process fails poor clip will also print
an error message if ssl is available
this is mostly used for debugging and
trusting anyone here has used this
before okay a few more hands that's
going to be difficult so you should use
this if you have any gin server troubles
look at this module because it is made
for the beginning these processes you
can access the state modify it you can
trace the genes are better than with
Erin factions you have a fuel so a few
debugging functions but these are less
powerful than the dbg module and it's
also sees that is responsible for a
bleeding the state of your gentle
so you can have a normal process that is
able to work properly with OTP upgrades
so here are the steps it's pretty simple
we start laying of course then curl init
hack like I said we have a put receive
loop of course we need to have a receive
loop we can do this with other kinds of
processes we have to make sure that if
the bound process dies we also quit so
this step is only useful if you actually
topics it otherwise it's automatic we
have to under system messages and
implement these three call box which are
called basis so I'll show a little bit
of code for it so the first few lines
are not very interesting but here system
years the system message that we need to
handle this message will only be sent if
you have started your process with
problem and when you receive it you need
to call the function below so there's a
little bit of magic you don't have to
understand what is going to Hong beyond
the same but when you call this function
then the Seas will call one of the three
callbacks here one or more of the three
callbacks and one of them is to make
your process continue its work one of
them is to exit everything and one of
them is to update the state so when for
example you perform and no tip you're
glad it will as your process will
receive a system message and then this
will call code change and then continue
that's pretty much how it works so we
don't have to actually do anything in
these functions if we don't want to
because for example if you called sis
get status it will print the status and
then correct system continue and we
still can have very useful functionality
out of it okay so we have a special
process but we don't have much going on
we can not currents in our process curls
are more complicated but actually what
we have so far here is what will be in
cover in the next few months all
processes all connection processes will
be special possesses and will be able to
be debated like any other OTP process so
this is already interesting but we want
sometimes to suffer from soils perform
some curls so let's look at the ADIZ I
know how it works you probably know
because most books teach you by practice
how to write a call for example in
drawers book that that's the FPC module
so I'm sure you know what it's about so
but we're going to look at what jen
selter actually does because it does a
lot more than you learned so this is jen
sava this is gen er gender theory Lisa
some sort of standard module on which
gen server and other behaviors are built
on so Jen when you call it first finds
the PID if it's a name of course then it
tries to monitor the process but this
can actually fail because not all nerds
implement monitors for example you can
have a c-note that doesn't handle
monitors so when you have this we have
to monitor the nerd instead and hope
that everything will go as planned so
this is the most boring part the if the
monitor succeeds
we send the message that we want to
sound and we don't try to connect
because the monitor girl did it before
and this sending this message can also
fail because the PID might be incorrect
or it can be a thought process that can
cause a few issues also so Jen's have
our catch exceptions here of course
catching exceptions take some time
because the stacked house is generated
and so on then we wait for a reply we
can receive a reply we can receive a
Down message for example to the node or
is done or the process itself and
depending on what we get we perform the
appropriate operation so this is what it
looks like engendered a I'll with with
an X about here so yeah this is the
first slide this is what happens when
you can't monitor of the process this
isn't very interesting because we don't
use most people don't use java nerds or
synod's so this is something that we are
going to look at removing first then we
have this part where we actually could
monitor and then we perform the sand
here and then we have our received he
with the timeout and so on and so on so
do we need everything in here actually
you don't you can if you don't work with
C or Java nodes you can remove this
whole page to get all together so you
get rid of a try-catch that means you
don't have to generate a stack trace
here so that's already little game then
perhaps you know that your process will
not go down because the cooling process
is tied to this other process and if one
cash is both caches so you don't have to
always monitor if you know you have the
grantees to be sure that no process will
be stuck you can remove a monitor you
can remove the timeout and so on so
that's a lot of code that we can remove
simply by making sure we know what we
are doing so we can choose what we need
of course you can choose what you need
but you probably shouldn't do this
unless you actually really need it you
should make sure the application work
first and then if you have performance
problems you can then look at removing a
few things so let's look at the work
that has been done in the ranch ranch
except processes accepts connections and
we have a few processes which accepts we
have a supervisor for the connection
processes which simply create
connections we want to make sure that we
don't accept too many processes at the
same time so we must limit and to limit
we confuse the supervisor the OTP
supervisor because we can write code in
it so we have a second process and this
second process must monitor at the same
time that the supervisor links this
disorder process actually performs the
same work as a supervisor except it
doesn't start processes but it still
keeps track of them because it needs to
know about them so it's a lot of waste
and it can be most problematic when you
are going to have an application that
not an application that when you are
going to have many connections going
down because then you have two times the
work to clean up everything
if we have one custom supervisor we can
simply have the supervisor be used for
rate-limiting we don't have to duplicate
the work so this is what has been going
on and then we can also make a few more
optimizations there because we know that
in ranch at least the start protocol
which is used to create the connection
process is always on the local node so
we don't need to have everything in the
gentle alcohol where we don't know well
we don't have we don't need to have the
Dominator no I'm sorry now this is about
the docket look at because we have a PID
that is known to be local so we don't
need to catch here and then we can we
don't need a monitor or timeout because
of how the supervision is done if an
acceptor dies or acceptance are we
started if the supervisor dies or
acceptor are we sorted so when the
acceptor calls the supervisor it doesn't
need to care whether whether of the
supervisor dies in the middle of it
because if we or everything will be
restarted then so we can simply remove
this and this and most of this this this
this this this we can remove everything
and we get this yes
yeah and we just send a message to the
supervisor we give it the circuit give
it of course which process called the
supervisor and we wait for a response it
can be anything because the acceptor
doesn't care what is returned and we
have a simple receive because when the
supervisor sees that there is a lower
amount of connections on going it will
decide to wake up and accept a lock to
accept more connections so that's all
you need and that is safe because we
actually know what can happen we
actually made sure that everything that
can go wrong is home blood and we don't
have to actually care about many things
because of how the supervision 3 is done
and there's actually more things that we
save here because we before the the
except rose called the supervisor with
all the parameters that we'd send them
to the connection process and we don't
need this anymore we can simply have
them in the supervisor and the
supervisor adds them when it starts the
process so we save a little message
passing here and also the supervisor can
send the message shoot which is used to
make sure the connection process can
start because it received ownership of
the circuit instead of before it was the
acceptor so we had to control supervisor
supervisor creates the process the
supervisor then returns a message to the
acceptor which then sends a message to
the process I know we can just call the
supervisor on just a visa does
everything directly
so i'll be showing a little bit of cod
in a few slides but we only need to
implement these two functions which
children and current children these are
used by OTP when you do upgrade so you
don't need to implement for example
start child because in this case it will
never be killed it would be enough to
call it you don't need to care much
about shield specs because in this case
we simply have connection processes
which are temporary we don't need
strategies either because ya tomorrow we
only stop the process and it dies when
it does and we only need to keep the PID
for later for when we for the witch
silly uncle and with this we had as much
as ten percent better performance in
Kabul that's in request second so it's
not too bad I'm quite happy about it and
we also have a lot lower latency we went
from like 12 milliseconds to nine and
then we also can handle big issues much
better sometimes I think that so as we
you were testing web sockets and
creating like 500,000 connections and it
was very slow when you cut everything
and then khabar couldn't handle anything
because it was actually removing all the
process from the supervision three so we
should be able to endure this a lot
better so let me show you a little code
I'm going to work you through yeah yeah
is that good okay oops sorry so this
isn't very interesting well we not this
one here we have the three callbacks
that we need to implement forces and the
u.s. is pretty much like a normal
process we have a state of course in
this case I actually I broke one of my
hole which is to never use the process
dictionary and I did because that was
simply the most performant solution for
storing a single p IE so I'm sorry it
won't happen again so we here we start
with poor clip of course and then in it
we make sure everything is ready it's of
supervisor so we need to traffic sit
here and then we in it hack when
everything is correct the function that
starts the process is this one with a
Victoria and this is another example of
a sort of gentle curl which actually
this one can be used from other nerds
it's simply some statistics about the
supervisor the number of active
connections this supervisor has to keep
track of both the number of processes
running and the number of processes
active because in once you can remove a
process from the view of ranch because
for example you are creating a lot of
web socket connections and you don't
want these two cont in the rate limiting
because they will be spending most of
that time waiting for message so we have
these two current two counts and the
rest is putting
it's easy to understand i think i let
you look at it this part here this is
where we are promote with children so
you can see a gentle gentle I item here
this is because the supervisor in her TP
is implemented as a gentle also it
receives the same messages as the gentle
we need to catch them and to send the
list of children here or the current of
children here and that's about it we
don't do anything special about these
messages because at this point ranch
isn't as I'm being tested for upgrades
at least so that's all okay where was I
so this probably feels a lot like magic
magic can burn only use it if you are
sure this is what you need to do you're
not going to get a huge improvement in
your application unless you receive a
lot of connection but in this case a lot
of connections per second or in your
case perhaps a lot of processes created
per second so start with the standard
OTP behaviors and then if something is
not enough you can look further and like
I'm not sure who said this but to make
it work make it pretty make it fast
always and this part what we talked
about here is in the make it fast
category so you can find me on Twitter
you have my website site here this link
isn't yeah that doesn't work and if you
have any questions
please do ask joe a comment okay whoever
Mike perhaps I mean no TP wasn't
designed to start quickly or for these
things to be particularly quicker in
fact when it loads it loads 53 modules
and it takes about four or five hundred
milliseconds to start just as a plug if
you want to make it really fast you
should throw away OTP completely and you
only need to write four modules to make
it work but you won't get all that you
won't get the error logs you won't get
all these things you like but you can
actually make it go quite a lot faster
so this is just a plug in the latest
edition of my book there's an appendix
called SOS SOS stands for simple
operating system and it's a complete
system for modules and it boots in four
milliseconds about and it's got
everything you need to do you could
actually make it even go faster than
that because there are three or four
modules that are written in early
another cross-compile to see in the
critical one is OTP ring 0 if you read
the code for that and change it you can
change how it loads and how it boots you
could probably get a booting in a
millisecond or two milliseconds and you
can get all these I mean if the key
thing to notice you shouldn't be doing
as you noticed you shouldn't be doing
monitoring send and you know you should
do your your error handing out of band
and design your own error handling I
think the relationship between ailing
and OTP is like UNIX and see see is a
programming language na lang as a
programmer engine and unix as an
operating system written in C but you
can write lots of different operating
systems in C and you can do exactly the
same an ailing can start with airline
and you one of those middleware
operating systems OTP but it's perfectly
possible to write one that's turnkey and
the food extremely quickly will do all
this kind of thing quicker and you can
do this kind of stuff even quicker if
you if you don't acknowledge things but
then you'll have to look at the sort of
synchronization problems so one way you
can do that is to allow processes to say
except 10 messages before they act the
reason you act
it's actually to solve a producer
consumer problem if if you send messages
faster than you can consume them to fill
up the message buffers but there are
other ways of doing that you could
actually send 10 messages in their knack
then send the next 10 yeah and you can
actually make it go even faster if you
want to but you lose all the goodies
yeah this specific arc is because we
don't have the ownership of the circuit
when he started the the connection
process so we need to wait before we can
receive data from the second so they
actually encourage people not to use OTP
and write their own boot scripts and
just do it all from scratch because it's
very instructive it's pretty easy really
so right in your door question ah c'mon
yeah yeah I can give you a little tip
well so if if you want to have a gin
server but you want to do in it that
takes longer and you don't want your
next process to be waiting for this in
it you can start your process with
properly and then you can do gen server
antelope and make your process become a
hint server after they lit face yep it's
kind of useful
any other question okay oh yeah Mahesh
yeah i'll probably i'll repeat them oh
not that much factory but mostly because
this wasn't my first time doing it the
first time well do TP documentation
about this is actually pretty good does
this world chapter about special
processes so it explains everything you
need perhaps even a little more because
what there's one thing I did not
actually implement is the debugging
mechanism insists I did I didn't because
no ideas dbg is much better but if you
followed the page on I should have
pattering here if you followed the
documentation it's actually pretty easy
any other question okay thank you ah
nope not
yeah it's simply for speed you know
speed on it also it also improve the
reliability of your application because
when things go wrong they don't have as
much impact as before okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
