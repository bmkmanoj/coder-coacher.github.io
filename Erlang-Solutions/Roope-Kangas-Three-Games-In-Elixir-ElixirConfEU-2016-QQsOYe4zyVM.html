talk to you for 45 minutes or so bit
about me above a solid server developer
in this gaming startup in Finland we
founded the company five years ago to
build our first game super nodes with
launch launch on iOS and form some wild
success Apple featured it and then it
kind of died after that couldn't be
working on for for smaller projects and
all of them do have a back end and the
back end has asked me in a lecture or
one of them I'm kind of porting to a
lecture now and so what I'll try to talk
about is a few words about my life
before Alex here because I think it's it
might be interesting in Adana
it kind of like shaped how I how I look
at look at the lecture and then they all
try to scratch the surface on how we
build ourselves services for the games
now and while doing that I'll try to
share my experiences or our experiences
and what we learned on the way I hope I
can get that cross at least some of it
and so this super nuts game even though
it has nothing to do with Alex Seaver
well I'm gonna talk about it a bit it
was dislike MMO game where everybody
could go and built our place in space
and it was written in c-sharp the client
and the server was such actually the C
soft rubber this really big monolithic
thing that was running this voxel world
where there is actually simple physics
simulation going on NPCs walking around
and addition to that being heavy we also
decided to build everything on the sea
she's of VM so it was doing everything
possible under the sky like running the
simulation doing in up validation
running a French system running high
scores and a lot of different containers
running stuff concurrently taking
messages in and my life looked like this
for a while I was looking at
dumps or logs from the server when when
we increase the concurrency on the
servers and a load test would basically
be able to crash the whole VM it was the
best case was that I would get an
exception that would tell maybe where
the problem is but comparing the Erlang
where you actually when you get an
exception you actually know what came in
what was the message that came to the
process what was the state of the
process and why it crashed in this world
is it was more like you have exceptions
maybe you can try to figure out debug
what's going wrong in the code and in
the worst case I only know that well the
whole VM trust and everything it was
doing is now gone and another thing in
this this world is that we have the
carbage collector that will actually
stop the whole VM when it decides to do
some heavy work so if somebody is
building in their world and I have a
message coming in and the Corbett's
collector decides I'm gonna kick him now
everything is going to stop and that
that gets you into like really hairy
tricky stuff pretty fast because you
have to think about how you're managing
the memory and the tools that I had at
my disposal about basically just taking
snapshots of all of the memory that it's
in the VM and I could see things like
hmm there's a lot of blocks in the
memory well well that's probably okay
but there might be something else and
just like they taste nap shots and try
to figure out what's going on and that's
yeah just explosions and really not not
so much fun stuff but there was a beacon
of like light and hope that we built
this the load testing blind or on
overland I don't know why we ended up
doing only that one other one but we had
this load testing cluster that we could
use to hammer our servers and for I
think maybe two months we did this that
we'd ramped up the connection of
concurrent connection amount and we'd
see the server's crash or we'd see our
MongoDB which were which was another
another thing that would burn and
without the Erlang thing I don't think
we could have actually launched a game
we
and have a successful launch and and
yeah that picture of us one more from
the output that load the tester cluster
would produce that we could map out like
how how much concurrent users we have
and how the latencies to the engine Oran
and try to figure out what just what's
going on we'd have a lot of more lot
more crowds and well one of the things I
learned while doing this that I or one
of the things I ended up doing was like
a lot of this plumbing godlike that I
call it plumbing this low-level stuff
like building the server connectionless
turner that's taking in the TCP
connections but because what the SDK and
the standard light up libraries are
providing aren't really giving me enough
or actually I'd have to try to
circumvent some Prosser combined some
problems that would actually crash the
whole VM so I tried to figure out a way
to build the connection listener so it
actually works so a lot of low-level
work that doesn't in any way contribute
to making the game yeah that technology
it just didn't didn't really feel like
natural I picked for the backend we
obviously run in the simulation and that
heavy stuff went pretty well but a lot
of the other stuff that server actually
did was taking taking in measures that
messages into a mailbox and then we'd
have our own thread pool where we'd run
this little process that would take the
messages in from the mailbox and then do
some processing call a function and then
return the state which sounds like a
really really crappy homemade version of
long that it isn't scalable and you know
crashes and stuff like that but we did
end up launching it and this is one of
our like trash from the monitoring like
it did scale though yeah 7000 concurrent
users in the lawns and that would not
happen without the Erlang stuff so after
that in 2014
we found a lecture and so the first
first project well well we found Alexia
and we had this some knowledge software
along and one of the programmers
actually had a longer a long bracket
background so when we started doing this
game war field that we killed last year
we we wanted to look into Alex here
because it's it's a player to play with
player game the clients are always
connected there's quite a lot happening
you have your troops on your side of the
screen on the mobile phone and your
opponent has their troops on their side
of the screen and there's this real-time
battle going on you're trying to destroy
the other guy's towers and there's also
a lot of things happen in this league
system where you come in the high score
so you're in different different levels
of the league and you get rewarded as
weekly round score boy and yeah it was a
free-to-play game so there was also
doing up validations to do and we really
thought that Alex it would be along with
we which would be this gay pride it onto
the Earl and VM and an easy way to get
get people in the company to learn they
learned a language and what what the
server setup for this game look like
it's really simple stuff it's like we
have everything in Amazon's on Amazon
and we basically just have their load
balancer sitting in front of the clients
and then we're spreading WebSocket
connections today's easy two instances
and we run code space for this project
because it's a key/value stuff we're
storing there and well I wasn't on the
team then they'd pick the coach page and
then we'd use red readies ready for the
high score tables and a few other things
but really yeah it was really really
simple stuff and I'm really glad that
you can do this kind of simple stuff and
take it pretty far and what it looked
like inside the
we and what we are doing is we have a
connection listener which is cowboy and
cowboy WebSockets which I believe yeah
it is what Phoenix is doing also and
then we have our hand rolled homemade
process records registry since chain
server does support that and what what
the how we actually want the players are
the games is that we have Jen server
seeds of these players or teams or Jen
server that's that's loading their state
on the database when we start it we look
up from the process registry if the if
the players game is already running when
the connection comes in and you and you
out indicate and if it's not running
we'll start it for you and we then we
load that data from the database and
then we keep it in the memory as long as
needed at and at some point the player
or the team will decide that it's been
like an hour of inactivity or five
minutes of inactivity I'm going to
terminate and save so we save a lot of
bandwidth towards the database that way
of course if somebody pulls the blog
which actually does happen in Amazon or
whatever happens the machine goes away
then we've lost some state but it Mia
it's a game we can give free gems to the
player so it sounds really assuring I'm
sure and
in this case we'd actually just run one
matchmaker process it didn't turn out to
be a problem to have this one problem
process that is that is doing this
really simple task of taking in
requested I'm a player I want to I want
to be much made and then we'd spawn the
paddle battle the battle process which
would report the result of the battle to
the players &amp;amp; player process also and to
the league process so it's just a bunch
of gen servers doing asynchronous calls
and sometimes synchronous calls between
each other so really you can get really
far by just just taking the stuff you'll
find in the Alex here and along ODP and
yeah I think I thought the policy
so the Jennifer supports the boy a boy
at Apple that was told such sasha was
talking about it and we basically take
advantage of that that we have our own
own library that is currently just
keeping keeping blocks in readies so we
are using the scalable system and we are
introducing this one point of failure
with which is also a aerelon which might
be an interesting choice but yeah well
we're pinging that and keeping keeping a
lot there that this player is still
running and so on and that that enables
us to start a game on one node and then
maybe later on or not not a note to send
a message to it like or way or something
else and just adding this little bit of
homemade stuff in front of the gingival
they actually has gotten us pretty far
at this point and one of the things in
this game Wow which I was working on was
this league system which kind of job for
me drove home a few points about what
you can do with functional programming
and with LX is the X unit excellent unit
testing tools that they first of all
what the league system does it doesn't
yeah I'll explain the plain what it does
first it doesn't it doesn't try to keep
a synchronized view for everybody what
it does is it when you ask a high a high
score list it will the player process
will ask for the list from the league
system the league system will actually
taking that works request then it will
look into conflicts with weights around
is now active if there's a weekly round
maybe a round has ended and you should
be rewarded or you we need to address
your score because yeah we did that that
we lowered your score when the round
ended and all of that processing would
happen and maybe after that we place you
on to the next round and in the next
round we'd actually put you in a pocket
with 99 other players so that when you
fetch the high score list next time you
see see
you and the 99 other players and if you
do it a lot you wouldn't see a list of
random players but you'd see this kind
of about the same players as they move
up and down and maybe they change the
tiers and I building this system that
has time and it has configurations it
has this back pocketing thing going on
while implementing it I really wanted to
think about how like since I'm using a
functional programming language so I and
I have this awesome test test tool that
maybe I can try to build it first
without any side effects so when I'm
doing something like asking which round
is now active it's actually well just a
function that takes takes in the lead
configuration and I'll give it a time
and every time on I'm actually getting a
high score list or asking for or posting
a score I'm also giving in the time that
this happened so I can write the test so
that the time is always in the tests so
it's pretty easy to write out tests that
you tested what happens when the weekly
round ends you walk out a bunch of
players and you see that one of them
gets rewarded one of the diplom doesn't
get rewarded and and at the point when I
actually needed some kind of storage
like doing the pocketing I first
introduced just an in-memory version by
using electives agents this is actually
something we use a lot that we we build
a cache or something we might use use
the Alexus behavior
thing to define an interface and write
the EPS based cache and then may be
ready spaced cache or something else
that talk talks to other database but
I'd use this as a way to finish the
library that handles the leads first as
an in-memory thing and then I'd end up
in a place where I have a bunch of unit
tests and I have to log log it logic
written out and I'm pretty sure it does
what it should do and then I'll go and
actually pulled it on
and at this point I'm actually not
talking to any database but I can
already play around with it and I can
start doing the client-side and I can
hone in what I need to fix from the
logic and after that I start to think
about the hard things about the database
Hong Kong to store this and how I'm
going to make sure that the database
doesn't go out of hand if there's a lot
of entries because I really think that
it's just well basically we'll just
doing divide and conquer like making
your problem small and I've noticed that
many times you can make a lot of things
starts the function and a simple thing
you don't need any kind of server or
agent and what's different with java or
c s-- object if you want to have a
function you can call from some class
you probably have to make it something
like a public static thing that there's
a different syntax for that and you
can't just go and call it randomly and
then use it as a part of something that
is an entity like a gen server like here
when you're writing the its tests you
don't have to instant date some class or
instant a it's some kind of actor system
or something to test it you can just
have a function and call it and see it
does the right thing and I think that is
it may sound like a really trivial and
simple thing it is simple but it's also
very very powerful that you don't have
to instantly add a lot of things just to
test test the one thing and then another
game that I was working on during this
and after this was this dungeon crawler
rope light that we did for iOS and
Android and while I proposed for this
talked talk are really hoping that this
would be a talk about running this in
production but us as a team about a few
weeks ago decided to kill the dead one
too but it's a yeah so I'm just gonna
you know invent something
so even though the client is very
different it's a rope like and actually
the come on what the client is doing is
most of it is a request reply stuff for
the backend is basically the same we're
just copying the same back end from game
from a logic from one game to another
the only big change is that some games
specific stuff going on we're generating
the done since the client is running
actually in the Alexa code we have some
social features what like when you die
we store your state and maybe spawn a
ghost from you into somebody else's
dungeon so your ghost can pester
somebody else while they're trying to go
through the dungeon and maybe you'll get
notified when your ghost is killed and
and since I was working on this I
dropped the couch paste and and went for
the Dynamo DP service so I'd have less
less stuff to monitor and one of the
things we did differently here the work
field is JSON and some binary made
messages but here we went back to things
that are pretty old stuff in a way that
this is not forever but we're using the
school's protocol protocol buffers thing
to specify the the game state and all of
the messages that are passing on the
wire we are compressing and doing
something else also doing a messages but
they it's basically it so that we have a
bunch of protocol buffer specifications
yeah they're no they're that this would
be the authentication message that the
client is actually sending this habit of
prepending them so that this is client
the server and server the client would
be yes to see but this way that I'm
writing a lot a lot of the stuff like
the data model there might be a hero
progression thing message somewhere in
the in the protocol buffers and then I
use that to generate all of the wire
protocol code that I need for
transforming a bunch of bytes into our
Alexis struct or into a sea
or class so that yeah so that in the in
the unity code we'd have this thing that
you could call this game game API send
it done
construct a class which kind of feels
natural in the co-op world and then this
yield Breton thing in unity it's this
call written thing that I can I can stop
the execution of the code here and wait
for the request to be complete and then
I'll check if it went okay and I'll do
something with the authentication and if
it didn't didn't go well no too bad
that kind of enables us to only work
with the with the message classes and
what we get back from the server is
instantly usable data there is like a
player state that it's a class that
contains everything about the player we
need to know and we can instantly feed
that into the game engine and start
working and since it's it is protocol
buffer stuff we could also catch it on
the disk if we need to store our dungeon
State or something we want to retry it
or continue it if the application
crashes and so on and what you see in
the elixir code would be in the game
process it's not seen that a binary
frame game in it's in actually this box
that that got map map to the stuff we
have in the protocol specification and
well I've simplified five things like
those things here are quite a bit but
having this it's pretty in my opinion
it's it makes it pretty readable the
code that you can write this like a
handle this message structure and maybe
try to use the pattern matching to pick
out some variables from there and maybe
add some gore god closes there the
handle the handle the message in when
you are in a specific state and well it
kind of boils down to it it's most of it
is really really simple stuff just once
you have this thing that you can you can
generate all of that
all you see on the elixir side on and on
the sit-up cord are just the structures
and one of the things we were doing with
this project is that we have this thing
on github that we're using the pull
updates from Google sheets we have our
development convicts there and we're
just pulling them onto the game server
or we're actually triggering the game
server to pull and pull them over and
well just one thing something I wanted
to mention if you want to take a look at
it it's something that's helped us quite
a bit and one thing with Alexia that's
been pretty pretty easy to do is pausing
those configurations and transforming
and then them into usable starts and so
one of the things we're doing with in
the hero hack game is that we have these
sheets that contain the content
definitions about how we're going to
generate the dungeons so the designer
can go in and write like if you go into
area one in a dungeon one how many
floors is the dungeon going to consist
and how many monsters there are how
difficult monsters they are and so on
and how well it's lit and then there's a
bunch of Aleksey code that they will
take our game configuration and generate
the generator rooms and the connections
between the rooms and we found it
actually surprisingly extended
extendable to do it in a lecture and we
I was always waiting for the time that
we actually get into some like real bad
performance problem problem with this
doing this kind of computation in LXE
but they somehow it never came up there
was other stuff and so so in the client
you you'd see lanterns on the walls and
things like that and that was all done
in LX 0 like we're picking picking
places in the rooms which are matching
to some criteria which is somewhat
natural even the bride fighting a
functional language and even though this
didn't go really far I wanted to do some
load testing we
with a custom client application since
we liked it liked writing stuff
ourselves so it's application that just
opens WebSocket connections with Cowboys
Khan library and it's it's there idling
and sending some messages which are
pretty easy to do but since we can
generate most of the wire protocol and I
could just fill out this elixir stocks
that I want to send and I didn't pick
any like 36 core machines or some
anything like that I pick a machine with
with a reasonable amount of RAM and just
run two of them and see where I could
get with this setup that that would cost
me like maybe thousand dollars a month
and yeah the first thing first thing I
did I noticed that I hadn't configured
up start properly which is not in our
elixir really or X X Orem release and I
an at 1,000 congruent devices it crashed
well I couldn't get anybody in but after
that I could run one 32,000 concurrent
games on the two machines which is not
like to like millions or hundreds of
thousands but I wanted to mention this
because this is like zero effort from my
side I'm not actually trying to do
anything fancy which is which is
something like quite used to in other
environments that I have to try to do
some fancy stuff to get the JVM or the
MonaVie shop VM to actually work and
this is like me spending few hours and
not even investigating possible problems
it just you know it kind of works so
good and I could get and log into the
game and go play it and nice so you know
I'm pretty confident that that would
probably work and so after that I'm
working on this what we've been working
on this kind of puzzle and Dragons meets
blackjack mobile game yeah these are
like horrible free-to-play games if you
think think that way about free-to-play
games but yeah it is what it is and we
like with what we do
so it has a lot of going on you're
playing the dungeons and you're
collecting cards and you're evolving
your heroes and whatnot and whatnot and
very different game from these two and
yeah it's it's the same back end so it's
no point showing the slides it's
actually doing everything else kind of
summarized and just tweaked it a bit
that it's it's the same thing we still
have the glorious two tables in dynamo
DP which is how we use database that we
have a depth table that for devices that
contain a random ID beam up to a device
and a player ID it that device map to
and then we have a table where there is
a player ID and then a compressed
protocol buffer binary which is like 512
bytes or 2 kilobytes or something and
that is our data base and because
because we can resolve if somebody is
already running we can talk to that
process or if they're not running we can
load that state back back into a
changeover and start running that so
that is the level of complexity we are
talking about here so but with this game
it started out as a project test was
working on Google App Engine because
there wasn't a server programmer and
well that's where the way it went so
let's say so server driven but anyway
it's a it's a client that is really
controlling that game and we're trying
to build more things that we want to
server to control in the game going
forward because it looks like we're
going to take it forward the game and
there you really need to think about
things like having something randomly
generated you might have all I got chest
in some game where you get to get some
gifts or get some stuff out of it you
really don't want to have that random
generator seed in the client because
then you can just put your game offline
and try to massage the random generator
into a nice state and then continue your
gaming and get the nice rewards or if if
the client is generating their well
doing there are all kinds of nasty
things you can start doing
so so here my kind of current big
problem or thing I'm trying to do is
trying to figure out the path from this
really client treatment thing to a
server treatment thing and I think even
here the kind of the way where you can
really easily extend stuff and have have
like simple message handlers and simple
functions first and then try to extend
stuff later on even though you can do it
in every language but here it's felt
really natural so what we're now doing
is while it's in development it's out
and Google app play but we are kind of
doing a new update on while it's in
development I'm saying absolutely
sending these events from the client
with where I'm telling like I evolve my
hero or I did this and they did this and
they're not there which is the state
where the client actually ended up in so
there's a lot of traffic going on
currently
but luckily since these are the state is
a map and I can also parse the client
state into a map in Aleks it's also
possible two different maps and you can
start writing the server logic and you
can have your client going forward and
maybe you can report somewhere in your
group chat or chat or where you're using
that there's a client playing the game
who has a lot of cold and it's like
doing stuff the server isn't doing and
you can kind of iteratively fix the
stuff and still move forward because a
lot of times yeah it might take a lot of
time to implement full features right
away in the deserver a lot of times
currently are now a bit with cheating on
the validation site that there might be
stuff that is validated you don't know
which ones and some some things aren't
so much validated we get the stayed in
and we just store it and if it's a kind
of you know a state that we don't really
trust it looks like somebody's doing
something dirty we can report it and
maybe fix it later so a bit about the
other stuff that is not so much Aleksei
things
what we're doing is that everything is
it running on Amazon Web Services and no
it's just the most simple things we are
not using any any of the fancy services
we're not even using auto scaling we
used to use auto scaling to set so that
there's auto scaling group that that has
size one so if the instance goes away
another instance will appear and really
really lean mostly do the thing that you
can get really far with the OTP and they
Alex here like how well you can
configure stuff from mix conflict and
how easy it is to run all of these
services inside along and we haven't had
like well at this moment we haven't had
any problems I guess there will be but
we haven't had any problems so it's kept
the things really really lean there's no
message schools there's no that that
kind of stuff going on it's just
processes inside a node or crossing the
node boundary talking to each other and
currently we are using X Orem to build
the releases and we have a jenkins box
in the cloud that is building them i've
also experimented building them inside a
vagrant box which i used for local
development love them because there i
have the ability Ubuntu Linux 64-bit and
I could build a release but it's it's so
slow that it's easier to keep to keep
the CI box going on and it's pretty easy
for everybody good to go and click and
build the release and the releases are
really nice because you get this one
tour file that you can unzip on the
machine and then just configure and
start or just start we're actually using
ansible for the deployment and actually
for creating all of the aw stop and the
ansible is responsible for writing the
upstart configuration for running the
release and there is like zero manual
setup at this point we are creating all
the SSH keys and all the security groups
the firewalls you use in Amazon and
balances everything s3 buckets we use
this tree in one case and things like
that everything is done done from the
scripts so which is really nice because
I get to work on the console it sorry
what like the most I'm in the terminal
and then some of the monitoring tools we
are currently using is this data talk
tool which is where from the crafts war
and then I be using Pingdom for just
pinging the client service from around
the world and see what the latency is
and if they're reachable and then
Amazon's internal cloud watch thing yeah
so kind of do wrap up some of the things
that how do you feel about Alexa door I
feel it's mostly my opinions not my
colleagues it's it's very easy to get
started and I noticed that when we
started using a lecture in the company
there was like I don't know there's some
kind of excitement and enthusiasm that
sparked that I haven't seen in a while
like people got so excited about
programming and in Elex it that order
the books on their own expense and start
reading those and you have this all
these lunchtime conversation which are
just about Alexi and have you have you
read about this and have you come across
this and it's just it's really easy to
get excited and that's why it's also
well it's really easy to get started the
documentation is really so great and
well the tooling is great and all of you
the community is great and so I guess
we're in place of course this means
we're a small company so
so you can say things like this but it's
still fondant there's something that a
guy who has literally like a really
graphics programming background one of
the coders in the company and really
liked client background and he can go
into the Alexia code and look at it and
kind of get what's happening and start
getting into doing changes pretty early
on you you're very poor productive from
from the start so that's I liked it very
much and well we are not building
software currently for any kind of
really huge audiences but it's it's been
so reliable from like 2014 everything
we've run that there's like cases we
like forgot that something's running
which is might not have anything to do
with Alexei but or like forgot that you
haven't deployed to some system for like
a month and it's still there and it just
you know checking along and it's I don't
know the I guess this is how the
software actually should work
we all grew up on like we've all been
taught very different kind of
experiences taught us that it isn't so
interesting and one of the thing that
maybe it's not only a zero it might be
the OTP design principles and how its
build its it it really promotes writing
quote that you can recycle and for us
running like multiple projects at once
it's been really really helpful that you
can go into another project and looking
like a host in Upper validation done
here or how the communication with the
shop that is in their application how
it's working on the back end or how some
French system is filled also and there's
quite a lot of code that we are
borrowing and then tweaking and then
borrowing again so no no there's
something that things are simple
sometimes really simple functions
sometimes really simple change servers
that do one thing and they only do that
one thing well and then it's pretty easy
to compose so yeah yeah surprise
I have such bad memory or is it explode
above there's quite a few interesting
error cases you can get from the Erlang
library it's using with or mining</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
