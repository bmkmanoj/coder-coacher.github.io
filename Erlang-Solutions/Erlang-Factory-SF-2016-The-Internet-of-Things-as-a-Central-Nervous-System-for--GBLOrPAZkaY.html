director for the Center for wheelchair
technology at n AR and this talk is
really about stuff that we're doing and
we're asking for help we're very
interested in finding out more about
projects in the airline community that
are focused on IOT the way I see it it
seems to be the perfect language come on
in you don't have to it seems to be the
perfect language for for this type of
work here's how you get a hold of us we
have a new twitter handle CRT labs i'll
talk a little bit about that and what
that means see our tweet is our standard
handle and we have a blog where we post
a lot about technology it's happening
all over the world not just focused on
real estate but stuff that's happening
all over the place we also have another
blog where we're putting a lot about our
work and what we're finding in the iot
space not only in the home but community
and citywide we have a github and it is
github com / national association of
realtors we made it really simple very
simple to type so if you misspell you
know but we have all of the code i'll
talk about today is going to be posted
up here chris cote who's our lead lab
engineers right in the back right there
you can is waving and Chris Chris
maintains this for us and keeps the code
post to come on in so why is the
national association of realtors here
right and some people when they think
about real estate agents they think
about that right that's not us we're not
of those we actually adhere to a very
strict code of ethics we have 1.1
million members they adhere to a strict
code of ethics and what's really driving
our work in a lab and this whole IOT
space is the the preamble right here to
the code of ethics it starts with the
line under all is the land all right
that sounds like a base for some sort of
stewardship manifesto right and we say
in here this yellow line they require
the creation of adequate housing that be
our members the building of functioning
cities the development of reproductive
industries and farms and the
preservation of a healthful environment
such interests impose obligations beyond
those of ordinary Commerce it's pretty
lofty right
we've been around for 108 years this has
changed very little it's actually the
preamble was added about 60 years ago
and it's changed very little since then
so as I said there are two million real
estate agents 1.1 million of them are
members of our association and they're
all over the place we have about 5
million transactions a year are done by
our members right there in more homes
than anybody else they're organized
because we have a National Association
and we also have 1400 state and local
associations so when we talked about the
lab I'll talk a little bit more about
what that means for us we focus on
residential and commercial so yesterday
Chris and I were over at the center for
the built environment which is a UC
Berkeley they're looking at how to do
effective heating and cooling in
buildings to save energy and what
they're coming to is it's actually a
personalized thing it's about behavior
and so that was a really interesting
week for us and the reason we went to
them is because we want to help
introduce them to other groups out there
and we're global you might if you live
in Canada and there's Korea up in Canada
there are people up there calling
themselves Realtors it's because they're
affiliated with us through our global
program this is our building in Chicago
this is a 1961 Gold LEED retrofit
building and this is our Washington DC
office it was the first leed-certified
building in DC in the year two thousand
five we work right about here that's
where we're at a little bit back so what
is the center for realtor technology we
are a multidisciplinary research and
development group at any are and we look
at what emerging technology is coming on
the market and what they mean for our
members and we try to inform the
Association as to the value or the the
pitfalls in that space so as of last
year about a year ago I worked with my
CTO to rework our budget to form a
laboratory because I saw renewable
energy and IOT coming onto the market as
things that are starting to gain some
serious traction and so we set up a
laboratory this is actually our work
bench here we have a soldering hood here
and an area to do soldering and also
work with other types of hardware we
have some bread bowl
words there that we we've worked with
and then right here there's a little
device that we we got from Bosch that is
it's called an ex DK as a development
kit they gave it to us before it went on
market so we could actually see some of
the sensing technology they have they
they actually make a lot of the MEMS
that are on the market there were there
one of the the bigger manufacturers so
it's it's a part of a partnership that
we get to test stuff like this for them
so it's very exciting we have a 3d
printer now we are using it because as
we build hardware we actually are very
interested in environmental sensing and
I'll tell you why in a bit um but as we
build hardware we also need to think
about case design and putting that into
a case so we got we got a 3d printer
we've also printed a house on with this
as well to show people what that might
look like and this is an area we have
meetings and I want to tell anybody
that's here that's interested in working
with us if you ever come to Chicago we
have open space we actually like to have
people stop by well I like to have
people stop by i'm not sure about Chris
and Dave and Joe but I like it makes me
feel good but we have space where you
can work and actually work alongside us
this is Dave right here and Chris sits
here I sit here and Joe sits here and we
have a number of devices up here that
we've purchased we're also getting a
number of devices sent to us by IOT
manufacturers in the commercial and
residential space and so we all sit here
and this is where we do our desk type
work programming and what have you um
now if you can't make it to Chicago but
are interested in meeting with us and
talking to us we have one of these as
well so you can actually log in to our
double robot and take a tour of our lab
and we would we would work with you on
that so if you have interest in that
come talk to me after I can set one up
for you what's cool about this is we
think about this for real estate being a
way to do tours of a home but also when
I go and speak like here and I'm this is
me teasing you because I'm not doing it
I could fire up the robot and we could
actually tour the lab nobody's in there
right now so it's dark because
everybody's out but I could fire up the
robot and do a tour of the lab and have
you know a number of people see what
we're up to and a pretty quick way I'm
on the board for the Internet of Things
Council in Chicago it's about
teen different groups represented we're
the only trade association to be a part
of that it's Accenture AT&amp;amp;T Cisco city
of Chicago University Illinois and what
we're doing there is driving the
adoption of IOT but in a safe fashion
like security and privacy are big
concerns and I'll talk about some
partnerships we have in that but we
think that's we're bringing IOT to the
Midwest and documenting all the
companies that are working in IOT in the
Midwest so these are some of the
partners we have the US Green Building
Council I presented to them last last
week and they said anything you do we're
a partner in whatever you do because the
type of thing we're talking about doing
is is in line with the type of LEED
certification that they're doing we're
working on a challenge for the
Department of Energy to take some
software and build a hub that does
energy monitoring but also does IOT
smart home device control so you have
one place to go to work with devices and
understand energy usage and this cup
right here did anybody hear about that
Jeep that was hacked last year yeah that
was a group called I am the cavalry
right and those are information security
researchers who look for bugs and code
and work with companies to fix those we
we work with a group called build it
securely so when we meet with companies
we try to encourage them to have their
code independently audited by build it
securely to look for any glaring bugs or
outstanding bugs and that group can then
fix it or they can pay a small bounty to
build a securely to have a fixed it's a
way to have independently verified at a
very low cost we also have a lot of
universities we're working with this is
the University of Michigan their
manufacturing amote the size of a grain
of sand that's called smart dust and it
has a sensor in it but it also has
energy harvesting so it powers itself
and it can mesh and you know I see
implications in drywall for room sensing
here we could tell what the temperature
and humidity are all throughout this
space by having these inner walls not
tracking people I have no interest in
knowing who anybody in this room is if I
knew there were you know 30 people in
this room I wouldn't care who you were
just that there were 30 people because
it would help me make choices about this
how this room is heating heating
right urban center for computation and
data I'm going to talk about a project
we're working on with them and a little
bit but these companies right here are
all very interested in working with us
because they see our membership those
1.1 million members as a path to a
community right we've talked to them
about our members helping them get these
devices into homes for testing purposes
some of these companies have stuff that
is available in europe but not available
here and they want to test it here
before they bring it to market all right
so wire lang why am I here right this
language now i'm not i'm a front-end web
developer right but i've had two years
of experience at Erlang conferences
erling factoring or we hosted an erlang
workshop last fall in Chicago but I got
to tell you what's really intriguing
about this language to me is it it seems
custom-built for what the Internet of
Things is messaging and queueing a
message queues right and the fault
tolerance and concurrency all those
things right there's so much there's so
much interaction happening with these
devices as they come online this seems
to be needed to be the perfect language
and also a elixir I found a project that
was in a lick sir that was focused on
IOT I think early thing is another one
that's focused on IOT there's two
companies that i know of right now that
are doing I using using Erlang for IOT
one is called helium and they do edge
network processing they put sensors up
in hospitals and and they need a very
very dedicated system for that so
they're using her lying and for some of
their messaging in that and volt DD b
which is doing a database for smart
metering and smart energy anybody
familiar with volt DB cool I'd like to
talk to you about that and then also
anybody familiar with helium in this
room great excellent back there too good
excellent yeah so um so those are two
examples so as I want to find more
because this to me like I said I feel
like this is the language that is built
for the Internet of Things I mean if you
think about numbers of lines of code to
write I was talking to Perry who's in
the DDoS over there and he was talking
about the number of lines of code they
had they went from 40,000 to 4,000 now
imagine that for security right being
able
debug much faster because you have less
code review and as these things get
online they're supposed to be between 26
billion to 250 billion by 2020 so you
want to be able to determine where the
problem is pretty quickly all right so
what is the value of a home and this
will get me to where I'm where I'm going
it's much more than money it's actually
about quality of life right and it's
about the experience of having at home
that's where your value comes in I want
to talk about the concept of homeostasis
and what that means for the value of
home so this is the deaf in one of the
definitions of homeostasis its tendency
of an organism or a cell to regulate its
internal conditions usually by a system
of feedback controls so as to stabilize
health and functioning regardless of the
outside changing conditions it's also
the ability of a body or a cell to seek
and maintain a condition of equilibrium
or stability within its internal
environment when dealing with external
changes these are all things we see in a
home right and I'll talk about it in a
second so as a normal cell it has a
nucleus it can regulate functionality
and it's its functions and it's and it's
is totally independent as these cells
come together they start to build parts
and they can work together to build
tissue and all the organs and everything
else that makes us up skin and those
parts come together as I said to make a
hole so what I want you to think about
then is take that cell right and think
of that cell is the home what's missing
in the home now is a way for us to
regulate the function to get feedback to
know how it's working so what if is a
closing gift a member of our association
were to give you a hub that did energy
monitoring and environmental quality
monitoring its sensors you could put up
around the home so you could then
understand what the air quality isn't
who has a Fitbit I'm sure almost
everybody has a Fitbit or some type of
device right did you care about 10,000
steps before you got one of those things
right yeah you don't know what you're
breathing right I don't to scare anybody
you don't know what you're breathing
right now right you don't simply so what
if you could learn what your breathing
what the co2 levels are what the
particular
matter levels are the humidity the
temperature would there be value in that
for you here's the value right humidity
levels they're too high you're going to
get mold or bacteria growth which leads
to illness if the co2 levels are too
high anybody even in meeting before
where you start falling asleep around
two-thirty because the airflow in the
building isn't so good right you co2
levels are elevated that's why you're
sleeping respiratory issues a
particulate matter so I mean all these
things go into effect it's you imagine
the cell the home is a cell right then
you start taking data on aggregate and B
and start to look at it you can start to
understand what's happening in a
neighborhood certain housing stock types
may be a better airflow so you can help
that homeowner make better decisions
about the home based on their housing
type and other data models you've
created from this data and then
connected city so that these become the
tissue these this becomes the body
anybody heard of the array of things
program the project in Chicago excellent
that gives me something fun to talk
about that's great so as I said between
26 to 250 billion of these devices will
be connected by the year twenty twenty
and one of the reasons for that is that
hardware has gotten smaller right this
is a five megabyte hard drive in 1956
let's see how the Raspberry Pi Raspberry
Pi tweeted that I thought that was fun
but that was five megabytes right and
we've gone smaller faster cheaper with
our data storage we've gone from 79
kilobytes in 1971 on an eight inch
floppy disk down here to 2000 64
gigabytes so if I took these and laid
them over here we've got about ten
thousand eight inch floppy disks worth
of information in that same space and
that same footprint and that happened
over a 30 35 years time happened very
quickly hardware you know Raspberry Pi
zero five dollar device we actually put
some open source home control software
on it and we're able to monitor to
control our entire lab through that that
one Raspberry Pi the five dollar
Raspberry Pi the chip a nine dollar
computer raspberry pi 3 is thirty-five
dollars and now it has bluetooth
connectivity you've got the particle
of photon $19 bluetooth-enabled as well
so what does the home of the future look
like right when you look at this this
stuff's getting smaller what is our home
in the future look like well buckminster
fuller somebody I really admired some
great things to say about space and
about how we're living but that's not
the home of the future right this guy
talked about the home of the future the
little pink house we have so many
existing homes that go on the mark over
ninety percent of the home sold or
existing so we've got to figure out how
to get these devices in there now the
reason I'm telling you all this is as
these newer devices come on market there
are a lot of opportunities for them to
run on honor lining um and they'll be
extremely low cost these devices to that
are coming up um this is just a little
background so the reason I'm interested
in this data is where a member of the
Better Buildings initiative which is
part of the Department of Energy's
program this is a standards body for
real estate but we're a member of this
to include information from the
utilities in a listing so homeowners can
actually disclosed what the energy usage
is because a lot of new buyers are very
interested in that we signed with the
night of the future because we think the
device is that we're putting in the home
is the energy monitoring can be a part
of that same initiative so what if you
could auto pop the data if that
homeowner decided to auto pop that data
they check a box they can send that data
right to the listing and you can see in
real time with their energy usage is now
I won't say real time because you could
tell patterns when people are at home
and stuff but give you an aggregate
sense of what that what the actual time
in the home is and this is where I'm
coming currently the data that we have
in real estate is static right it's the
same as the books that used to print 20
years ago but what if we could actually
make it dynamic and that's what I OT is
going to do so quickly i'll go back to
this one hold on one second here I'm
caught in a kerfuffle let me come back
all right so we worked on a platform of
Python and it's actually on our github
it's called lab log there Chris right
that's what we're calling lab log
but we're calling it rosetta home as a
holistic umbrella because we wanted to
talk to as many devices as possible now
for messaging we're using RabbitMQ which
is you know or like but we'd like to
think about what options there are in
erlang itself actually we Chris did a
great job putting this all together but
so we're also curious to hear other
people's thoughts on that we have each
one of us have these in our home these
environmental sensors are called net
atmos and they tell us about the carbon
dioxide level the temperature the
humidity the noise and the pressure this
is a $99 device that connects to a smart
meter and will tell you in real time
which are energy usages and give you
feedback on that this is a one hundred
and eighty dollar device that you can
connect to your electric panel of your
brave and it will tell you also what
your energy usage is so as we take those
we have these listings here and what if
we could take the listings and add that
data to this listing details what if we
could actually show what what's
happening with the home co2 levels on an
aggregate basis what if we could show
the indoor outdoor temperature and the
power usage at the same time right and
talk to the homeowner about how to
improve upon these metrics we recently
were watching this and it was
interesting because we saw in Chris's
house power was going down as a
temperature went up it was very it was
very clear and then you also have power
in costs and indoor and outdoor humidity
so what if conversations could happen
about the quality of life that person's
leading and you could help them improve
upon those metrics you're going to
improve their satisfaction and when that
home comes back on the market problems
that we tend to run into with those with
humidity and co2 levels and air flow
those tend to be mitigated in a much
faster basis this right here is a Sankey
diagram we put together green just to
tell you really quickly green indicates
environment yellow is energy and what
we're showing is you know the message
the messaging working in real time now
these are our address these are not our
addresses but these are our homes and
when they light up that's actually data
coming from our homes so
so what we're able to show here is as
this data is coming in it's hitting this
device right here the netatmo and these
are the fields so now co2 is hitting
right now right and then we can have
triggers set up so we can actually have
something set up to turn our thermostat
on to get the air flowing in the home
because what if you live in a very
highly enveloped area sealed home one of
the newer condos that the windows don't
open you need to have that air flow
going so you could start doing things
automatically and have that homeostasis
effect happening in the home right Chris
do you want to add anything about this
yeah yeah so the the bigger point and
I'm just gonna repeat a little bit what
Chris said for the for the audio but the
bigger point is this is real-time
messaging happening so we can have it
automate it's where the name Rosetta
home came from just a quick summary but
the great thing about this too is you
know the DOA is very interested in an
automated demand response and and saving
energy through automated demand response
and something like this could then be
applied to that as well to help with
that type of functionality so as
Buckminster Fuller said automation
replaces the automaton in this case
right now what I mean by that is our
members are entering data into these
listings right so our industry is and
I'm not the only one I'll say this we're
a little bit behind in in distribution
this distributed systems right and
scalable systems and I'm talking about
we have seven hundred and seventy
different MLS's multiple listing
services none of them share data right
they don't share data for me to get
access to all that data I would have to
have a license with each one right and
that license may exclude me from doing
certain things right so if I'm a member
and I join if I have 30 Miles's in my
area I'm going to tri-state area i'm in
3 or 3 ml says i want to put one listing
up i have to enter into each mls all
three of those MLS's right we talked
about AP is at an event and it was it
was like a revelation one time so that
was that was kind of exciting but you
know sue
it's something that we're trying to help
our members actually focus on the work
they need to do and make these listings
more informative for the person who's
interested in buying the property so i
would love you know after the talks this
morning i would love to bring some of
the executives from the mls different at
Miles's and just to show them some of
the stuff we've talked about
theoretically how it actually works here
it's pretty great so I mean this is a
real estate news source a good practice
as always to know as much as you can
about a property before you buy or sell
and that's exactly what we're trying to
do is to give power to give power to
that that homeowner but also improve
their quality of life that's a big big
thing for us so I'll talk a little bit
about the connected home and home
performance one of the big things
anybody here have a nest thermostat or
equivalent you know I don't want to be
brand specific here yeah one of the
great things about it is they're saving
energy they're actually saving energy
for the utilities and utilities are very
hip on them they did they like them
because they help them do things like
avoid brownouts or having to roll over
to more expensive peak level sources so
Austin is a great example of this where
nest went to them and said hey we know
we have these many nest thermostat
owners in your area and if you have them
if you have them enroll in a program we
can actually save you from rolling over
to other energy on the hottest day of
the year and sure enough they were able
to do it for 30 came around they were
able to kick the thermostats down by one
or two degrees are up by one or two
degrees in there there were no issues
ambient light quality is a big thing and
we think that's also being improved in
this space and one of the problems here
is these devices for the most part talk
cloud to cloud right so we have a we
have a lock in our lab and it's by it's
my leg and Dave can stand ten feet away
from it and hit unlock on his is app and
it'll take three or four seconds for it
to unlock which by the time he could
have gotten the keys out of his pocket
and unlock the door right so this
convenience is cutting coming at a bit
of a cost right so how do we speed that
up and that's where that's what I think
the messaging can be really really
helped out but also not having a be
cloud to cloud is another thing I think
to be really helpful for this um I think
this right here is going to be huge and
I think this is where a lot of the data
is going to come from now i should say
two about the data that we showed you
the real time data we can slice that how
everyone as you know but i think that
this type of data right here will be
huge for the homeowners in the very near
term and I think comfort and health are
going to be the two big things that
drive adoption of these devices so as we
build Environmental Quality sensors I'd
love to actually there's a talk at
Kenji's talking at five o'clock today
about sensor nodes on Arduino I would
HIGHLY encourage you to attend that talk
as well I'm very interested in what he
has to say about that but all this stuff
impacts the health now this right here I
went to visit the University of Michigan
and this was a curtain in my hotel room
i'm lucky i looked up because that's not
good at all right so what if the hotel
actually had these sensors in there
you'd be able to know that you had this
humidity level that was causing this
mold right i mean these are just an
example after example in in people's
lives with this stuff i'm going to talk
about connected cities and then I also
want I want to do some questions to you
because I'd like to talk more about what
we're doing in what it means but also
get a sense of what your thoughts are
about how our line could be a part of
what we're doing but there's a project
in Chicago called the array of things
now we're talking about the
home-and-home level data but we also if
we could know the city level data it
would be extremely helpful this is a
project by the University of Chicago the
city of Chicago Argonne National Labs
and a group called the urban center for
computation and data and in this project
they're building an extensible system
it's called waggle now these pieces
there in about 60 different sense 60
different sensors they have an anode and
the great thing about that being
extensible is if they deploy these in
Tucson they're not going to care about
precipitation as much or humidity levels
as they will about particular matter
right so they can add more particular
matter sensors
um in Portland they want to know about
humidity levels so they'll add more
humidity sensors in there and they have
about there's eight different air
quality sensors happening right there as
well they're deploying these they got a
grant from the National Science
Foundation to deploy 500 of these around
the city of Chicago and they're going to
start in april of this year now they've
asked us to do some testing of the
hardware and and the software some
debugging of the software Chris they're
using other using Python for this
they're using they have a thing called
beehive right yeah they were project
called beehive and its history we keep
hitting these Python projects right so
I'm very curious I'd like to see some
analog so I'd love for you all to look
at what we're doing and talk to us about
what you see there and what you think
what changes or what things you would
you would add from the erlang community
but beehive is something we're going to
help debug and they want to put three of
these on our building and this is the
first iteration right here second
generation and third generation now
types of data they're capturing here are
about air quality temperature humidity
noise levels particular matter and they
actually have an HD camera now here's
what's happening with the HD camera it
is not recording who I am it's more like
a clicker right and we know we've
actually talked to the the staff there
because we want to be involved in
anything that's going to violate
someone's privacy that's not where we're
at we we we take that pretty seriously
all four of us actually we're very very
keen on that but essentially it's
working as a clicker it's also working
to help find heat islands in the city so
you can start seeing these micro
climates right you can start seeing
where reflections from that skyscraper
in Chicago are causing it to warm up in
the city and cause other other issues in
the city itself and it also has they
want to count foot traffic bicycle
traffic and in car traffic through those
through those spaces as well so then get
a sense of how it's flowing through
through the community this is what
they're going to look like this data
when it's captured will be open so a
great project could be to build
something off of this data once it's out
there it's going to be part of the
Chicago
open data portal and part of their
agreement with with the other cities in
the NSF is that all the data that comes
off of these will be open and this
project indigo global next year it'll be
Mexico City Antwerp i think is another
city partnering with them in new york
city's going to have these up in austin
texas as well as Portland and a few
others but we're thinking this could be
really interesting we're talking about
larger cities there right but what if we
could bring this to smaller communities
like my hometown of 20,000 people in
Iowa where you could help people see
what they need for co2 mitigation on a
larger scale maybe then you plant more
trees maybe there's a there's a high
concentration of carbon monoxide by an
elementary school in fact a friend of
mine their son was going to a school
that had a co2 leak from the boiler at
co2 is our sorry co leak and the kids
got sick right because there was no
sensor in the building or anywhere near
the building so what if we could help
mitigate that by having these types of
sensors up there now what this is going
to do for us our members is it's going
to give them information about that
community which will help them in turn
work in that community because our
members like to see themselves as
community experts being local experts
and if they can help get systems in like
this that help improve a community that
goes a long way to raise them up right
to have them and I think that's the new
way our membership is heading in a way
that helps them become an advocate for
that that community so these are the
partner cities as I mentioned and I i
put a little this is actually something
so Chris and I in our teammates we were
on a hackathon I was the coatings IBM
coding virtual hackathon and we we did
this visualization we'd have the number
of visualizations but what I'm
demonstrating here is is it can be
really cool to take the data from
something like the array of things and
then you know and this is a 15-minute
minute increments here Chris yeah
there's actually people moving around a
city but what if we could actually show
and I don't know who the people are I
just know that there's movement in the
city what if we could actually show
how this how these devices or how the
the movement of those folks is impacting
temperature and in the commercial spaces
so that's a that's that's going to be
really interesting i think next year or
maybe a year after when we have some
data from these devices will be able to
show things like this so um we're going
to put so they want us to put one right
here one right here and one right here
on our building so they can get a sense
of air quality all up and down the front
of our building our buildings on
Michigan Avenue right next to the
Wrigley building and what that'll allow
them to do is start pinning a really
interesting picture about things like
where they could place vertical axis
wind turbines to harvest some energy for
the city right what where they could get
some solar solar reflection for some
ancillary solar panels or or what they
could do to improve air quality and a
specific part of the city so this is a
this is coming in the next year and what
I want to say to about what we're doing
is that we we are very open in what we
do so anything we build is going to be
available to you so outside of this if
you want to see some of the stuff that
we're doing always feel free to reach
out to us that's it's a big thing for us
is to keep it open and to keep it
available to folks so really what we're
trying to do is build a system of
systems and we want your help with that
right I think this language is perfect
for it and I think that we could we
could do some really interesting things
with that and so I'm going to stop there
because i want to ask some question i
want some questions i want to i want to
see what questions you might have any
questions about programs yeah
the airline and have you tried
developing any software with it we
haven't we haven't yet Chris go ahead
I mean I've been so it's just it's just
crystal why did you choose rabbitmq for
the
data with we mentioned you know all the
city is really interesting ideas around
Federation interesting and I think
Berlin's or four
language
and talked a bit about privacy and it
looked like the prototypes you had work
work centralized systems yeah and so
where does that glad to see happen like
so okay so what I'll talk about his
privacy right so this is an example of
what could happen we don't want we don't
think everybody is going to choose to
have that data initially to have it
listed somewhere they're just not going
to because they you know they may not
trust the system which is fine we think
as people see the value of it that's
where it then becomes the thing that
they would have it incorporated to what
they to into what they what their
listing right so the system that we're
talking about would be one where they
could check a box to share only certain
types of data one of the companies we're
talking to is canary they make a video
camera that also does an environmental
sensing right it does temperature
humidity in particular matter and I
don't want anything to do with video or
audio from that device right so we have
two segments those pieces out but as far
as normalizing and all that Chris if you
want you want to talk about some of that
or not amaizing it
edge device as against federated up or
plus or we're going different guess is
that it oh well like so in our example
just saw co2 that's way too granular
action right you can know somebody's
home you can get really good so you do
it again the Federation that the
aggregation levels sparse like specifics
around
yeah and there's also it comes down to
education is like so there are different
ways of displaying it for educational
purposes so like Chris said you
aggregate in a way that doesn't give you
any identifying information as far as
when someone's home that we're not
interested in people being broken into
it's not what we do so we actually you
know you could use even more granular to
talk to that homeowner kind of do a
fitness check in almost like a doctor
for the home I don't want to say that as
what we do but that's a way for you to
have a conversation yeah Brian
well so we're partnering with netatmo we
actually reached out to them and they've
partnered with us to have those devices
report but you know chris i think you
have stuff that we haven't yeah
and I didn't repeat Brian's question
yeah and Brian's question was can you
use this locally as with whatever
devices you have yes sir great yeah if
you rent a car to somebody you can send
them virtual keys so that they have
access system
so inside now our people to do that
securely revocable gift various various
things coming to you it's a very old
appeal but thinking that it would be
probably the extremely cruisers did
these technologies
so the none of what you talked about a
standardization right that's the big
problem with this whole thing that's why
this is called Rosetta home right we
want to have one thing that works its
lord of the rings all over right one
ring to rule them all it's what we want
and we don't want it we don't
necessarily be the people that do that
we're just saying it's there let's we
need to do that right so things like
thread happening you know I Oh tivity
from linux foundation that needs to
happen right and so the interesting to
have a cross-industry one that beat
that's that's intriguing to me yeah yeah
we should definitely talk okay great I'm
not that's what I'm I don't know
a huge problem in the sensor industry is
that people don't got no way of figuring
out the device is actually physically
tellin ya the larger or as well there's
a larger bush or completely separate
problem no miss Stoker it without the
security role
how big carbon atom buddy is separate
blessing and point to describe all those
two what's horrible person so I think
we're gratified here but you know last
time Lauren gesture thank you thanks
thanks again chat for giving this this
wonderful talk thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
