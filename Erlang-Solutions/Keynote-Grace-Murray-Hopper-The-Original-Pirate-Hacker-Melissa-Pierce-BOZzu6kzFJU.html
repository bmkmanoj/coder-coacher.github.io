computer programmer a filmmaker and
activist and your morning speaker thanks
for showing up I'm gonna tell you a
story about grace Murray hopper she was
one of the very first computer
programmers ever in the world and to
tell you the truth I didn't really give
they told me not to swear sorry I said I
don't really care much about who Grace
Hopper was two years ago until just
recently but two years ago a luminary in
the American startup community Paul
Graham of Y Combinator said something a
little bit stupid he said he said if you
want to find a really good programmer
you have to find someone who has been
coding since they were a teenage boy I
know right so you know this as you would
imagine didn't go down well with the
people looking for diversity and with me
either because I run a not-for-profit in
Chicago called Chicago women developers
women who are mid-career who decide they
want to learn to program come to Chicago
and developers and we mentor them and
teach them the program and find them
jobs and they are damn good programmers
but as you might have guessed a lot of
them didn't grow up and become teenage
boys but they are really great
programmers so we had a problem with
this and then my good oh look I forgot
that this thing
this thing does a thing look how about
that Marion my co-producer made that
happen she was really excited about it
so we left it there she's like hey looks
like so this happened and then my good
friend Dave Hoover from Chicago who runs
dev bootcamp sent out this tweet just in
time
you know in case you missed it Grace
Hopper
maybe when she was 37 then she became
one of the greatest computer scientists
of all time well she didn't start
programming until she was 37 either
because it just didn't exist of course
at the time I was 37 Grace Hopper was 37
and I was like holy sorry I've got
to know more about this woman so I went
to find out more about her look it went
the wrong way
so I went to find out more about her and
it turns out that there is not one
documentary about her juxtaposed that to
Steve Jobs who has nine films about him
I think the tenth one just came out that
Jude was a product guy he didn't code
right everything that he built was built
on what Grace Hopper had written and the
people that came after her so of course
as I wanted to do there was a gap and I
filled it you know Dave sent another
tweet he's kind of the catalyst here you
know he says like I doubt there's an
appetite for it but I think a Grace
Hopper movie would be great hey let's do
a Kickstarter I was like I'm gonna write
that movie I'm good
I'm gonna do this thing you know because
why wouldn't I but I'm gonna include all
the ladies that I know of that made a
difference so we started a Kickstarter
maybe I think it was an IndieGoGo you
know four months later and since then
I've been busily traveling the u.s.
interviewing a bunch of octogenarians
before they died so it really is kind of
this race against time before all of
these computer pioneers kick the bucket
and after this talk actually I'll be
traveling to Stockholm where you know
one of her compatriots graciously
retired in a country I've never been to
so I'm pretty excited about that but it
has been kind of incredible to travel
all around the u.s. to homes and nursing
homes and talk to men and women who
built all the stuff we're doing it's
been a really nice experience so this is
the early trailer and you should watch
it if it will play in presenter mode
that's great pathway how did you know so
much about computers then I didn't how
did your first one so what's the ring
thrilling is I get to tell her whole
story not just the highlights which is
what every book or every TV special
seems to do I get to tell more than her
real of greatest accomplishments before
she was a known entity so I want born
with curiosity to do something that a
lot of these films and stories about our
heroes don't do which is to tell the
story of someone who's completely
relatable who is not this anomaly genius
who no one can hold a candle to but
someone that anyone can relate to what
makes her human in a way that you could
relate to you which is why I'm super
glad that this is not the film I'm
giving a talk about Grace Hopper about
how she was a badass genius pirate
hacker badass is not a swear word right
so I hope you can relate one of my
friends photoshopped this on to Grace's
eye which was really lovely of them
Grace Hopper copper is known as a pirate
in a Navy uniform when she retired for
the third time she was a Rear Admiral in
the Navy which is a pretty high up I
think she was the oldest highest-ranking
woman woman in the Navy when she retired
it's quite fetching on grace that
eyepatch and it's good you know because
she invented the patch
if you remember those reels of paper
from the trailer this is the section of
those reels from the 1944 Harvard mark 1
the very first digital computer there's
a lot of argument about this by the way
about which computer was a first digital
which was the first this and there
they're all lovely but this was the
first digital computer it's the one
grace worked on note the physical
patches used to crutch correct the punch
holes covering them grace did this not
only when they were mistakes though she
also did this when she was too lazy to
write another program right so we can
say she was the first hacker we can say
that she is where the the trope of lazy
programmer began right here with some
tape over some stuff so if you're
keeping track grace Murray hopper pirate
invented the patch and will argue that
she was the very first lazy programmer
grace though was culture jamming long
before 1944 she refused to take no for
an answer this is a picture of her when
she was 16 this is years she failed to
get into Vassar she failed the entrance
exam I think it was Latin don't worry
she got in the next year and she
completely blew them away of course
she graduated a mathematician and then
went on to Yale which she had to
petition to get into because Yale of
course at that time in the 1920s didn't
accept women so she petitioned to get
into Yale she was a hand one of a
handful of women to get into Yale and
she graduated Yale with a PhD in
mathematics one of three women to
graduate with a mathematics PhD before
1934 so that's kind of hardcore let me
make sure I'm not leaving anything out
with that
oh did she come up in her uniform all
right I'm slower than my slides sorry
guys so grace was a mathematics
professor at Becker that their baths
served for a long time 12 years and then
you know she she kind of she kind of
culture damn that too so she believed in
the interdisciplinary mathematics she
believed that you can learn math through
anything this was in the 20s and 30s a
little unconventional and she ruffled a
lot of feathers with the older staff
there but of course the students loved
her
and this really greased a lot of wheels
so she was an excellent social engineer
in that way but in 1941 there was the
attack on Pearl Harbor and as you know
in America that's when we join the war
effort and everybody who was anybody
tried to join the military men women
everybody Grace was no different but it
would take her three years to be
accepted into the Navy the first time
she tried the Navy said you know what
your job as a mathematics professor is
too important to national security I'm
sorry no you can't go imagine that
having a brain so lovely that no one
will let you do anything else she of
course petitioned because she really
really wanted to join the Navy and be
part of something bigger than teaching
math at Vassar this was her ambition she
always wanted something bigger the
second time she petitioned they told her
she was too small she's five to seven
stones you're just too small too small
of a person you can't get in so she went
through all of this rigmarole to you
know get that taken care of the third
time she tries to join they say you're
too old because she's 37 you're too old
you should be out to pasture you can't
possibly do anything else but grace you
know
she is crafting she found a way through
all of this I was about to tell you og
was crafty og is a original gangster
you know this oh gee alright original
game but I you know og is also old grace
ol grace
she was crafty so she fought away into
the Navy and she would become invaluable
to them like I said she was recalled to
the Navy twice more after this stent and
retired as Rear Admiral and this is her
in December of 1944 at midshipman school
which she graduated first in her class
you know that sounds super impressive
but then you remember that everyone else
was about 10 years younger than her and
she was already a mathematics PhD so
what she appreciated about this was that
she didn't have to think about what to
wear all she had to do was memorize
things I mean this was the best thing
for her she was like I I was liberated
from having to think about pantyhose and
fashion and any of that she wore the
same thing every day had the same
routine and freed up her mind to think
about bigger things so this was perfect
for grace so grace graduated the top of
her class and she thought she was going
to go work with her old PhD advisor in
cryptography this was her plan she just
wanted to figure out secret stuff but
this is not what happened grace was sent
instead to a classified like a
top-secret mission which turned out to
be in the basement of an old crusty
building at Harvard so here's this
mathematics PhD who fought her way
through the Goblin City through
hardships untold and she ended up
walking to cross laboratory into the
basement
now I visited Crufts laboratory not too
long ago and now it's a now it's physics
which is phenomenal if you walk into the
basement there are pipes and lasers and
you know co2 everywhere it's a fun time
but I try to imagine myself you know
walking down those
narrow stairs into the basement try to
imagine all of those huge machine sounds
that that the Marquand must have made
and all the heat that might have come up
the stairs from that not knowing what
was at the bottom of that because of
course it wasn't called a computer it
wasn't really called anything she didn't
know what was at the bottom of those
stairs she could've been working in a
you know at the machine room of a ship
for all she knew
so just imagining the like the fear and
excitement of walking into that probably
thinking something like you know what I
had a really cush job as a PhD math
professor and I'm about to walk into the
basement of this really hot place so she
opens the door and as she describes it
she opens the door and she saw the most
beautiful thing she had ever seen in her
life I can relate to this of course I'm
sure a lot of you can so she saw the
mark one computer and here we have next
to her Charles
Aiken he designed the machine and who
was this guy actually wrote it down so I
wouldn't forget
Oh ensign Campbell you know the thing is
these guys actually placed bets before
her first day to see who was going to
sit next to the old lady that was coming
in she was 37 just you know that's not
that's not old they were not excited
about having a woman's second in command
but boy would they come to rely on her
in the in conventional unconventional
ways she got things done as you can see
here they're holding on to what is a
program they were running through the
machine so one of Graces very first
tasks as second-in-command in command
was to write the instruction manual on
how to use the mark 1 computer when
grace protested that she'd never written
an instruction manual and didn't even
know the first thing because this is her
first day about the computer charles
aiken her boss said you know what you're
in the Navy now so if you want to know
how the
first computer manual was written it was
just like that she had to figure it out
she took two months figuring it out now
you'll notice this is a picture of the
difference engine a good thing to note
is that this one there's there's one of
the Science Museum here in London which
I'll go see I tried to see it yesterday
about my flight was delayed by very many
hours but the mark 1 is actually based
on this machine when it can design the
mark 1 in 1941 he was having a bunch of
problems figuring out how to get it to
work he went up into the Attic of a
building in Harvard where they had a
model not a full-scale model just a
little model of the difference engine
and this is what he based the mark one
on and then later IBM's designers took
three years if you're a how to actually
bring this to life so from its
conception in 1940 to 1944 is when when
it was finally the mark 1 was finally
made but it's good to think about that
when you think about legacy that it came
from
Babbage it came from Ada in fact when
when grace was assigned to write the
very first computer manual Aiken handed
her a copy of ADA Lovelace's notes on
the differents engine a lot of people
assume or agree that this was actually
the very first computer program I would
probably say that comrade comrade Zeus
wrote the very first computer program
which played chess but still it was a
first idea of computer programming so
when when grace mentions Ada she
affectionately refers to her her as the
woman who invented the loop which is
kind of sweet I think so grace invented
the patch bless you Ada Lovelace
invented the loop and for a little more
you know stem lady trivia ADA's tutor
Mary Somerville who may or may not have
murdered her husband so she could get an
education because he was a jerk
invented the term scientist though
science and competing wouldn't come in
much later I just love that little bit
of trivia and
I think Mary Somerville is a pretty
badass and you guys should all get to
know her legend would have it that
Greece invented the term computer bug
too but this isn't untrue what she did
was popularize the term computer bug in
debugging but she loved to talk and she
loved to tell stories and she always
embellished them so when you hear any
speeches that Grace Hopper gave just
remember that she is she has been
embellishing them for a long time she
was quite the performer but she always
tells the story about finding the moth
on the mark one on relay number 70 panel
F you can see this first actual case of
a bug being found in a computer this
moth was beaten to death between a relay
not only was a moth beaten to death
though you can see it was made example
of right here
you know she taped it taped it to the
log book the mark 1 Ram 24 hours a day
Grace's team worked in shifts around the
clock the the mark 1 is actually called
they affectionately called it Bessie
because I did bessel functions
so and and it did ballistics for Navy
Navy missiles it also did they also
figured out some lovely not-so-lovely I
guess and grace never talked about this
this wasn't something that she talked
about but she did help the Marquand
actually figured out some very sticky
things about the nuclear bombs we later
dropped on Japan there's no record of
gracing anything about this so I don't
know how she felt about it but she did
help figure out those problems using the
mark 1 but running these machines 24
hours a day I always think about this I
think about Grace and her team running
these machines 24 hours a day through
hurricanes and
storms and then I laugh when I see I'm
sorry guys bro coders with your energy
drinks thinking that they're really
kicking butt staying up for one or two
nights hacking on some because you
know that's grace grace did that for a
year she just stayed up all night you
know when in the war so grace didn't
invent the term bug but she made an
example of it and if you'll permit me a
pirate joke I'd venture to guess that
being taped to a logbook for a month is
the equivalent of walking the plank
bullying moths wasn't Grace's only
pirate behavior she flew a Jolly Roger
in her office this is not a lie I assume
that in the Navy this is probably a
terrible thing to do but grace didn't
care she knew her Worth and she knew
what she can get away with she was
pretty subversive about things like that
she also believed that anything you
needed could be liberated from someone
else thus every stick of furniture in
Grace's office was stolen from someone
else's office she also stole computer
time although nobody she worked with
would call it that dare call it that to
her face she is in fact famous for the
phrase it's easier to ask forgiveness
than permission
so if you've ever heard that phrase that
was Grace Hopper this actually is easier
asked for forgiveness than permission is
about trying new things new ideas she
was really in that so and not quite
about doing bad things but trying new
things and not giving a crap about what
anyone else says about them she also
believed that software should be free
and every computer program should work
no matter the hardware she would be
mortified at the Internet of Things
right now what show one gentleman
she worked with in the 1960s recalled
the story to me Howard Bromberg recalled
this story to me where grace was making
and giving away COBOL for free to
anybody who wanted it which was pretty
awesome and her reasoning was that
everyone should know how to program
and if the information was out there
free they would know how to do it
of course this gentleman didn't like
that because he was trying to make a
living selling COBOL and she reasoned
that you know he should just sell the
service of servicing people who had
COBOL who didn't want to take the time
to learn the information so this was
long before Bill Gates's memo about who
should be paying for Windows it was long
before Steve brands exclamation that
information wants to be free at the
first hacker conference in 1984
so just remember who did this first it
was grace grace thought information
wanted to be free it's not to say that
grace was super village intarsia cebause
things she had a clock that ran
backwards in her office she says was to
remind people to think differently that
they could could you know rewire their
brains to think about a clock backwards
but really I just think that she liked
to with people she she was sorry
for this ways she was she was especially
rowdy so in this speech she gave in the
Computer History Museum in the 1980s she
recalled a specific practical joke where
someone filled the mark one computer
with these fake bedbugs the whole thing
I think it was a mark two actually and
of course it shut down the machine now
this was after the war they're still
using the machine and the team wanted a
break because Charles Charles Aiken
still ran it as if America depended on
his baby the mark one um but it did shut
down the entire machine and because
nobody know knew who did this no one
really got in trouble
but Charles Aiken did go around the
entire campus of Harvard and find every
industrial vacuum that he could to get
these bedbugs out of the machine what he
effectively did was vacuum so well that
he removed all of the dust from the mark
one and because it ran on relays there
was not enough dust to make the
electrical connection between the relays
in the machine so the machine was
actually shut down for a week while they
waited for more dust to collect so this
particular act of mutiny did
only give the team a break for the day
it gave him a break for a week which
which is fantastic good job grace what
score grace won't actually tell you that
she did this but I got it out of one of
the older gentlemen that I interviewed
that this was indeed grace which is
great so grace wasn't above mutiny and
she wasn't above and introducing several
bugs at once to bring the man down and
quite possibly with a whole Jolly Roger
flag thing she might have been the first
member of anonymous you know possibly
the first person involved in founding
Pirate Bay we don't know you know
she's crafty she's crafty a fun bit of
int trivial which I found really telling
and interesting about Grace's
personality is that grace like Einstein
refused to follow company rules about
not smoking and buildings etc I don't
know if you know this about Einstein but
he made people change the entire rules
of their building codes so that he could
have a smoking office because he refused
to go outside and smoke that was for
kids grace was the same way so she also
had a smoking office in every single
building that she worked in she forced
them that changed the rules for her
because she was not having it this is
how she worked and if they wanted her
they wanted everything about her so she
did not Bend her office was a
designating smoking office so you know
for ten minutes a day people got super
interested in whatever grace was doing
and came to visit her I just think
that's pretty pretty cool about her so
but here's where it gets real remember
how I told you that grace believed that
you shouldn't ask permission to do
anything well no one believed her that
computers could do more than math you
know but she decided to build the first
compiler anyway the very first compiler
so after her stint in the Navy grace
worked as a senior mathematician at
Universe
that was like 1949 and in 1952 she'd
written the first operational compiler
this is the she wrote the 800 this is
actually a picture the 801 it was just a
like a better photograph nobody believed
her
she said I had a running compiler and
nobody would touch it they told me
computers could only do arithmetic you
guys all know how that went down
right it's it's quite possible that
without Grace Hopper y'all wouldn't be
programming you in it Erlang or anything
you'd still be programming in machine
code if anything because grace also
popularized the idea that you know
computer programming and computers were
a thing so without grace we might not we
might all be doing something else I
don't know skip an ice-cream or
something in 1954 Hopper was named
Remington rands first director of
automatic programming something about
automatic programming is every
programmer thought they were going to
lose their jobs automatic programming
was going to make them obsolete
that's very funny right now her debar
Department released some of the first
compiler based programs including
mathematic and flow-matic so a little
known fact flow-matic was also the name
of Graces first hip-hop album
she's totally ahead of her time COBOL
was Grace's idea she did not write COBOL
but she was smart enough to know that if
you developed a program for business
professionals they would buy computers
that was kind of her drive for it she's
like you know how do we get them to buy
this hardware that we're selling we'll
develop this program that is in you know
natural language so she didn't develop
it she wasn't even on the committee for
COBOL oh I spoil the surprise I'm so
sorry she wasn't even on the committee
for COBOL she just thought of it first
she did develop flow-matic which COBOL
was based on which the people that made
COBOL said they would never be able to
make without flow-matic that's why grace
is all often referred to as the
grandmother COBOL a lot of people get
this confused they think that she
developed it that she was
the team this is not true she paved the
way for cobalt to be made one funny
thing about cobalt is that it was
actually this is actually a task of the
short-range committee cobalt was
supposed to be a stopgap like it was
supposed to only exist for about two
years before they found a better program
we're like something on 60 years now
they'd they had a short-range committee
a middle-range committee and a
long-range committee and after COBOL was
made the middle range the long-range
committee would just dismissed they were
like this is the thing and as you know
still a lot of our infrastructure runs
on COBOL which is I don't know how you
feel about that but so when people say
she developed COBOL I get a little upset
because it's not it's not just because
grace didn't invent COBOL I'm not I'm
not upset about that I mean people get
cool things was attributed to them all
the time
it said grace invented something more
than that you know she opened the door
to automatic programming and was ahead
of Donald Knuth in developing program
languages into national natural language
which you know is pretty revolutionary
so to recap grace Murray hopper pirate
Hackett hacker pioneer rumored member of
anonymous founder of Pirate Bay bad mofo
programmer who started not as a teenage
boy mind you but as the 37 year old
woman look looking to do more in the
world that she had already done this is
where I tell you that grace was an
anomaly you know she actually could see
herself as something more than she was
which was phenomenal for a young woman
in the 1910s she could see things that
others could not you could put herself
in that place so she wasn't anomaly in
that way
but what's what's so phenomenal to me as
most people don't remember grace for
these things they don't remember her for
revolutionizing the way we think about
computer programming even think about
the fact that compilers are kind of
where it all started I mean COBOL was
one of the very first high-level
programming languages and you know she
started that so does anyone know
what these are
nanoseconds right these are actually
nanoseconds that have been liberated
Grace Hopper liberated from the basement
of several buildings some of them that
people receive were actually liberated
from the Pentagon she just stole
telephone wire and cut that up but
nanoseconds are about eleven point eight
inches long and she used these as
mnemonic devices is it pneumonic just
what is it when it's just visual anyway
she used these as examples of how fast
elect electricity could travel in a
nanosecond and she got really famous for
these talks that she went around and
gave about computer programming about
why it was important
she gave these while she worked at
digital equipment company so she was
still selling computers I mean that was
really the name of the game but she
would she would give these speeches to
schoolchildren she would give these
speeches to Admirals in the Navy just to
get them to understand why it took so
long for information to travel from the
ground to a satellite and back I thought
for a long time that the Navy asked
grace back for the third time when she
was already a senior citizen I thought
for a long time that they asked her back
just to kind of do this whole computer
literacy thing like she's a really good
spokesperson she's lovely but you know
they actually Acts asked her back
because she had a big brain and she had
good ideas and they needed someone who
could validate compilers so they they
needed someone who actually could
understand how to validate not the stuff
that came out of the compilers but the
actual compiler so they brought her back
ant on to validate compile compilers and
adopt design standards for the
military's use of COBOL and who better
to do that than the person who invented
compilers and started the whole thing
so she was supposed to come back for
about six months and they had her
indefinite and until she was too ill to
be in the Navy she stayed in the Navy
so grace was a pirate to the core if you
don't believe me here's a picture of her
ship this is the USS hopper it was
commissioned in 1997 it's the only u.s.
warship named after a commuter computer
pioneer it's one of only two named after
women it's currently doing a tour in the
Middle East so it is still operational
after this ship was made so many women
soldiers volunteered to be on it that
the Navy actually had to in storm
install more women's bathrooms so they
spent an extra of fifty thousand dollars
to put more women's rooms on this
particular ship because so many women
were proud to serve on that particular
ship the this particular like these
bathrooms are I think they are called
the the golden toilets because they cost
so much money to refurbish a warship
that's some interesting trivia
so it's been quite a journey learning
about grace and knowing about her I
think my favorite part of all of this
really is interviewing the computer
pioneers about how this is going one
woman that I interviewed just a few
weeks ago talked about how she ran a
computer Club in her nursing home she
talked about how all of these old
executives from IBM etc would come to
the computer Club absolutely terrified
to touch a keyboard because in their
time when they were running these huge
companies men touching a keyboard was
not okay you had a girl for that and you
think about how things have kind of
flipped and how this this lady was just
like she had to teach them that it was
okay to touch a keyboard and to learn to
program and to kind of you know hang out
with the rest of the guys this is a
graphic that we had made for our film
which comes out at the end of 2016 it's
got the backwards clock it has grace is
a young ambition ambitious woman with
that you know defiance in her eyes and
grace as a older woman
I think she's 37 in that picture and of
course that mythical moth that was not
the first computer bug just you know the
one that was made example of because how
dare you put a bug in the machine
I don't know what else I can tell you
about pirate Grace Hopper this is my
last slide and I think it's going to do
that thing that Marian had to do yeah
this is my co-producers contribution to
this so the film is called born with
curiosity comes out in 2016 the Twitter
handle for born with curiosity is right
here born W curiosity my twitter handle
is Melissa Pierce if you follow me on
Twitter though it's just a bunch of like
kitchen-sink poetry stuff you're not
gonna learn a lot about Grace Hopper so
probably just follow born with curiosity
it is now a good time for questions I
think are we doing questions this
conference alright thank you for
chilling out with me this morning it's
hard Garrett is going to get a
microphone so that questions were from
Melissa just give me a second to come
over to you so we can get a miked
questions
Thanks
so you didn't come on time what the
stories I've always heard which is that
all the early computer programmers were
women and it was because nobody had
figured out that this was interesting at
and after they decided oh this is
actually important then they took it
away from the women and wouldn't let
women program anymore but all the early
ones were women but you can touch on
that no I didn't touch on that because
it was about grace but it is true most
of all of the early computer programmers
with women is not that men didn't find
it important it's that at the time it
was wartime and there were no men to do
it also you know computer programming
was thought of as secretarial I mean it
was just adding machines grace hoppers
father was in insurance so he probably
had one of those fancy adding machines
that was based on the jacquard loom just
so you guys know that your card loom
started the French Revolution you should
know this it's the same thing that all
of your smart phones are kind of based
on the idea that your hard loom anyway
it's kind of interesting to think about
the fact that but another computer the
ENIAC was run by all women you know that
the ones here we were programmed all by
women and you are right at some point in
the early 60s when automatic programming
became a thing and all of these
programmers realized they would lose
their job because now the computers were
doing it themselves they started to do
something called the professionalization
of computer programming so they made it
a lot more important of a job and try to
professionalize it make it more like
your wiring and when you do this and
this happen with mathematics as well and
engineering has always been that way in
fact I don't think the first woman got a
degree in engineering until like 1952
grace wanted to be an engineer and
couldn't because it was just unheard of
it was too far-fetched
she thought of literate programming but
she couldn't think of herself as an
engineer that's interesting to think
about but the professionalization also
like any of the things that the women
did became you know feminized and
unimportant and really when you see the
big switch happen in many
women programming because still up until
the mid-1970s computer programming was
the most money a woman could make at
least the United States when the
personal computer came about and it
became much less expensive to have a
computer you'll notice the switch even
in advertising where now they have a lot
of young men in the advertising as
opposed to women because now they can
say you can now afford a much more
expensive programmer because we have
these smaller computers that cost less
and then you start seeing the the coming
out of the nerd culture and the the
entire culture of that so it wasn't that
nobody wanted to do it it was that all
the men were gone and then you know when
they came back they didn't know how to
do it the women knew how and then it had
already become effeminate you know
feminized because only the women were
doing it so why would they want to it
was just secretaries in fact you could
go to secretary school and learn how to
program computers it wasn't considered a
science in any way in fact we we could
go into this most of my talks are about
the history of the culture of
engineering and not just about grace but
but nobody actually wanted computer
programming the mathematics department
didn't want it engineering sure as
didn't want it engineers didn't let
computer programmers actually touch the
computers just like just the keyboards
and there it was really a struggle to
professionalize computing it so good all
right
so do you think that this nut culture
from the hobbyist computer clubs of the
early 80s late 70s then led to some sort
of self selection in who starts out to
program our study this new area that
then was available at the universities
and as such the women did not enter
because they did not identify with this
subculture some of that yes also a lot
of women a lot of women were in
mathematics mathematics department did
not want computer programming in most
colleges it turned out to go into
engineering which already had a very low
enrollment of women because it already
been self selected so something else
that happened with personal computers is
oh there's a book just came out about it
I haven't read it I mean there are ton
of books about this you know there's the
computer boys take over and there's oh
there's just a ton of them but there's
one that just came out about gaming
about early games and how because
computers did not have enough memory you
could only do games like you know
shooting games and things like that
things that didn't really appeal to
girls until like that the Apple came out
and you had what it's Oregon Trail or
whatever but there there was a there's a
whole thing about how just the the
programs available
we were not appealing to girls and then
that was enforced through cultural
stereotypes you know there are boy games
on this computer so it's yours
so my first computer program for
instance was basic we were just talking
about this last night where you know my
dad had at Andy and I programmed a bunch
of stuff and basic for a week and then
my parents said you know what this is
your dad and your brother's computer you
need to go outside and play and I didn't
I didn't program again until my 30s
because hey that wasn't for me and
that's what I was told as a little kid
and that was just enforced so yeah
any other questions yep one second let
me get to me
so following on from that then what what
do you think that those of us who are
recruiting should do to attract more
women to the profession I think you
should go to nCWIT org they have a
resource section which is great that's
the National Council for women in IT I
am on the board for one of their chairs
there I think they have a lot of really
good resources on recruiting on taking
bias out of your out of your recruiting
language I know that some places now are
doing a double-blind interview much like
you know I'm sure you've heard about
these interviews that the symphony gave
when they realized they were hiring more
men to play they actually put a screen
up so you couldn't see who was playing
and could just hear the music and then
suddenly more women were playing it
wasn't that they were terrible musicians
that there was a bias from the
interviewer and not necessarily
something that of course they would
recognize in themselves you know it was
it was you know subconscious bias so we
have those but nCWIT actually has
incredible resources on hiring and I
would go there before you know I would
spout a bunch of stuff from stage one
question you're talking about you know
the early early in the early days women
were computer programmers but one thing
that put me to mind was was happening
Harvard and even earlier generation of
people at though of the women who were
running the Harvard College Observatory
as human computers in 1920s and produced
many of the early advance of what laid
the groundwork for the modern science of
astrophysics with people likes yeah
Henrietta Swan Leavitt sustained Kapaa
chicken and Annie jump cannon and a
bunch of others whose names I'm not
remembering right actually I have I have
like a six-volume set of encyclopedias
about women in the sciences so a lot of
everything we know about astronomy the
groundwork for a lot of physics after
calculus was women and then you have
HIPPA Thea who was one of the very first
mathematicians yeah their women are
everywhere we just kind of write them
out of
history and grace kind of got written
out of history when the computer boys
came and took over and you know everyone
got excited about personal computers we
forgot about all of this we kind of
forgot about who laid that groundwork it
was not as exciting so it's nice to be
able to kind of bring that back and
bring back the fact that Grace Hopper
did something she did something big she
she changed what we all do I mean she
she believed that computers could do
more than math I mean that's why we're
all here
she made a compiler he's pretty badass
so the question what in your travels and
interviews what's something that's
really surprised you something that okay
you go into something with a mindset and
expectation what what took you by
surprise in your conversations with
people what surprised me most about my
conversations with people who knew and
loved grace was how much they protected
her privacy this is something that we
wouldn't really find in the stay and age
I mean the things they protected were so
interesting you know that that grace was
a smoker they did not want to talk about
the fact that she smoked like several
packs of cigarettes a day they did not
want to talk about the fact that when
she was in the hospital she was she
would sneak cigarette packs she would
like hide them behind the toilets and
under shed you know between her
mattresses and in her pillowcases and on
window sills and she would smoke in her
hospital rooms they didn't want to talk
about this kind of stuff they didn't
want to talk about who she was as a
person something that maybe surprised me
a lot was was how much emotion was still
there for people who worked with her how
much they revered her and at the same
time hated her this was apparent in my
talk with Howard Bromberg who was of
course really upset that she was you
know writing these COBOL programs and
giving them away for free you know
because information wants to be free and
everyone should learn this and in grace
had made it so easy
anyone to learn it but how how much
anger he still had that she did that he
you know ruined his business idea or
whatever so that was that was
interesting but maybe the most
interesting thing is that all of those
people knew like that grace was a pivot
point and this is obvious in the way
that we she we talked about her that she
was really the pivot point on where
program programming is gone but no one
who I talked to that is a historian or
any of that they didn't really really
believe that they don't believe that she
was the pivot point that she really is
the axis that all of this turned on
machine any other questions last one I
have been confused about grace giving
away COBOL you said she was not involved
with the team developing COBOL but
rather did flow-matic before that
eventually led to COBOL so so she she
got hold of implementation okay so the
timeline of flow-matic she developed fly
Matic with her team at Remington Rand
COBOL was based on Flo Matic that was
written by committee this committee was
made up of several people from several
different companies and universities
they all came together to make it later
on you know because they made it and it
was Grace's idea she's like we need to
invent this so that you know executives
aren't afraid to touch a computer later
on of course grace was a big advocate
for COBOL which she needed to be because
that's old computers which was her job
when she wasn't in the Navy so she
became a giant advocate for for COBOL
and later in her third stent
in the Navy when she was validating
compilers like how do you do that
like from the machine code to the anyway
she was validating compilers she also
was writing the standards for how to use
COBOL in the military so she was very
involved in COBOL she just didn't write
it and a lot of people assume that she
wrote it which is erroneous what did she
give away she gave away programs I mean
at some point in while she was in the
Navy the second time because it was the
60s so while she was in the Navy she
would have the people that worked with
her write program specific to the
machines that people were using and if
they asked for it she would she would
write the program and then use it on her
machines which was pretty cool but that
was that's what she did I just
remembered I interviewed someone who
wrote there like the first COBOL program
for micro computers everyone said it
couldn't be done it was just this you
know woman loving living in Bend Oregon
really really super chill and on
assuming and she also like wrote the
program that detects all the space junk
she's like yeah I did that in a big deal
awesome anyway it's been it's been great
ladies and gentlemen
