solutions monthly webinar
my name is Guatemala Christian I'm the
VP for the AMIA region here at align
solutions today's webinar that presents
a continuation of a series of webinars
we have been running across topics of
interest in the world of Erlang and
dealing with solutions based on the
Erlang programming language specifically
today we will be hearing a bit about the
work in akka erlang solutions is mobile
development arm undertook with score
sports a social network focused on sport
and connecting over 2000 athletes with
their fan base by nature of its user
base and the way this application is
predominantly used score sports have
realized very early on just how critical
mobile platforms are for the experience
and the content that they wish to convey
to their user base erlang solutions and
Anaka consequently engaged with score on
application peach developments as well
as furthering the scalability of its
platform now as with any live event do
excuse any technical issues that we may
face today but to start by telling you a
bit about erlang solutions we are a
products and services orientated company
completely devoted to the airline
programming language we work with
organizations and individuals using our
line helping evolve the language and
supporting people and businesses using
it our office offices across the world
are firstly in London where we are
headquartered than in Stockholm Krakow
Budapest San Francisco and where no
Cerys we work on projects spanning
industries and the globe we also develop
airline based products and some of those
include our Mongoose I am messaging
platform the react distributed database
and wombat OEM our monitoring and
management technology now I'm very
pleased to say our speakers today are
score sports project lead Chuck Pinkett
and the Anaka senior project manager
Tatiana
Dean please allow me to finish by saying
you are most welcome to close questions
throughout the duration of the webinar
by using the chat facility on the
webinars interface our speakers Chuck
and Tatiana will answer as many
questions as time allows at the end the
end of the webinar but should any
questions go unanswered you are most
welcome to raise them by email using the
following address webinar at Erlang
- solutions comm if you are interested
beyond the webinar in learning a bit
more about Erlang or wish to establish
whether it could be a solution for the
challenges your own business may be
facing then please feel free to contact
me directly my email address will be
displayed in one of the final slides is
presentation I would now like to hand
over to tatyana and chuck who will be
glad to start us off hi i'm tatiana dean
i'm a project manager
Anaka and i've been with the company for
three years so to give some context to
those who aren't familiar with us we
were founded in 2011 and we merged with
Erlang solutions in 2014 we're based in
Buenos Aires and we work with developers
across South America and we specialize
in end-to-end solutions across different
platforms
yeah and hi I'm Chuck Pinkert I'm the
lead mobile developer here at score
sports you may or may not have heard of
score sports it's a startup based here
in San Francisco we're a Bay Area
company let's see
good advance to the next slide we have a
development team of about 30 people the
company has grown to around 75 to 80
people
our main presences are on iOS Android
and web we
of millions of users and what expanding
in Europe the the quick spiel on what's
core sports is is that it's bringing
together athletes and fans so the idea
is that we have things like private
chats which we'll talk about today where
users can meet their favorite athletes
and talk in the semi-private room and we
really just want to lower the bar of
entry to having people be able to talk
to their athletes and anyone in sports
really so far has been a lot of fun to
do we're going to get started on the
rest of the presentation
so we we've broken down this talk into
four parts starting with the project
itself where we'll go through sometimes
some of the technical details and
logistics of building a chat feature
then we'll go through the tools we use
to stay organized followed by how we
created a team environment and finally
some of the challenges we encountered
along the way some technical
difficulties apologies yes while we wait
for the next slide to advance the
project that we were given in the middle
of last year I believe it was was to
bring a chat application or chat feature
to our application we wanted to make
sure that it was scale to millions of
users here's the great side yeah thanks
so we were brought in to help score
fortify their iOS app and build their
Android app basically giving them the
resources they needed to take their
product to the next level and one of the
most important features they wanted to
add was a unique chat feature that would
set them apart from any of their
competitors
yeah exactly now kind of go into the
technical details of what that all means
now this is kind of a preview of what's
to come in the talk I'm going to talk
about some of the technical issues that
went on with each one of these one of
these tasks including having an iOS
client obviously that can talk to our
chat server and do all the fun chat
things we wanted to do an android client
as well and you'll see a few times XMPP
mentions that is the protocol that we
use for chat is also a protocol that
some of you may be familiar with
Facebook Messenger slack so many of the
big chat apps whatsapp all use the same
protocol so there are some kind of
pre-built libraries we started from for
Android and iOS but then we also had a
kind of a very specialized UI we wanted
to do that was specific to sports so
we'll go into that more in a little bit
finally we also implemented a version of
XMPP that is a little different than the
standard flavor so that it would work
better on mobile sleep so we're going to
go the next slide which is the beautiful
map that Tatiana just showed one of our
biggest challenges and one of our
biggest benefits and it's something
we'll harp on a lot today is that we had
teams all over the world in different
time zones we had at score we had
partial mobile team which was me and
another Dever to a the project lead
myself as well and the back-end team and
argentina they're in Buenos Aires you
see a naka on the map that was the
majority of our iOS and Android at the
time we needed a feature soon and we
didn't have the mobile power to do it so
we enlisted Anaka and as you'll see it
was a great deal we then went to also
have a single XMPP resource who's you
could pretty much see as the chat server
professional in Stockholm in advance the
next slide
so this is just showing the difference
in times it's a four hour difference to
Buenos Aires from my time here in San
Francisco and almost a complete 24 hours
to Stockholm so we had plenty of
meetings with people who were about to
eat dinner or who were just waking up
so to give some context we were getting
into the office Argentina was finishing
up lunch and guys in Europe were having
dinner so there was a little bit of a
little bit of compromise that had to be
made on both sides for instance I had to
wake up early and do some question
answering and unblocking debts early and
some of the guys in Stockholm would have
to step out of their dinner arrangements
to get on calls occasionally but
everybody was actually very good work
with it was such a team effort that
people were excited to to jump in and
they've been waiting to talk to people
for people to wake up to figure things
out so that's good one of the biggest
things about the whole timezone thing
and I'll go into the pros and cons of it
a lot but I can't explain how great of a
feeling it is to show up at work at 8:00
or 9:00 a.m. and have the Anaka team and
they enjoyed a mobile team that is
completely done half the day and pushed
great features in code so I remember the
first day I showed up I thought yes I
can handle this this will show well so
let's go and slide onto the next slide
okay so this is talking about some of
the technologies we actually used and
this is going to get a little more
technical so bear with me if you're not
technical I am a Android and iOS
developer at heart so if I talk like an
engineer there you go you know you know
why our iOS app is completely written
and swift and we use the XMPP framework
library to talk with the chat server so
basically what that means is we had a
good chunk of work already done for us
to start with
unfortunately this framework anytime you
use a third-party library you never know
what you're going to get
they will take care of a lot of features
but you'll find plenty of things that
wish you would do a different way it
turns out it worked out really well we
ended up having to write a lot of custom
code to handle our special type of group
chat called muck light finally maybe
this is more detail than you need but
all of our async operations were map
modeled and NS operations so basically
what that means is that we can we can
fire off requests to our server and
prioritize them so if you're entering a
chatroom that should get first priority
all of the network calls should come in
from that you can cancel them you can
queue them up all kinds of fun stuff
that everyday users need to know for or
need to have for their apps and what's
really great about this is that that is
not a standard iOS developer feature
that most developers know one second but
wait for it's come but an akka did such
a wonderful job of learning that and
then helping train us up in it
they seem to have a lot of expertise in
this area due to their close
relationship with Erlang
so that was tremendously helpful and
then let's go ahead and jump to Android
Android was a little bit different it
was not only chat feature but rewriting
the entire app so that was really
important to us that we got a really
good structure started on that a very
good foundation I'm very proud of what
we've accomplished there and one of the
reasons it did as well as it did is we
used a library called rx Java which is a
library that uses a something called
functional reactive programming so what
this does is it helps us do the same
thing that NS Operations was doing on
iOS it helps us handle all of these chat
requests from thousands of users on the
client and show them at the right time
it once again that is a high learning
curve it is something that only advanced
or senior developers normally have any
experience with and the lead Android
developer and
actually trained our two junior
developers to understand and know that
it's actually the biggest success of our
story from a development perspective in
my opinion is the great mentorship and
teamwork that was shown on the Android
application to teach a very difficult
topic remotely and we also did some
in-person training so that was extremely
helpful and then they also use a library
called smack XMPP which is similar to
XMPP framework but a little more mature
of a library finally we used Erlang on
our end to do game event parsing so I
haven't yet explained what the app does
so I'll kind of follow back or what that
means
I'll follow back up with that here on
the next slide because it has a nice
screenshot and we'll be able to explain
that and then finally the XMPP feature
was Mongoose I am with some custom
modules once again I'll explain that on
the next screen yeah I'll explain those
as much as I can here as we jump on so
if you could this is a good way to
explain exactly what we did just looking
at a screenshot of what a chat room
looks like of course it looks like a
normal chat room I think most people
would understand what's happening as far
as the conversation goes but the key
feature for us was being able to add
teams to a chat room and so what that
means is you add your favorite team and
whatever the game is going on you get
notifications inside of the app that
says you know somebody scored a goal
although there's a touchdown the idea is
that we bring all of the things that you
need to have for a sports conversation
into the chat room so as you can see on
the right some people are talking and a
touchdown happened somebody is
celebrating and then another item
happens and now as all this is happening
a score at the top and a time indicator
are showing how much time is left in the
game and what scores so this was a key
feature we wanted to do and there was
the the thrust of a good
three or four months of effort so I'll
go ahead and explain the server parts
that led to that we actually receive
real-time updates as the game is
happening within a second or two of it
happening we get that touchdown event
and then we have to take all that XML
and parse it and turn it into something
we can handle
which was not a small task that was all
done in Erlang once we get that done we
convert that into something that's
consumable for our client a sentence
like so Carlos Hyde runs for a 10-yard
touchdown in the example we do
everything we need to do to present it
for the client and then we send it to
chatrooms and the way we send it to
chatrooms
is a really neat little custom feature
that we wrote that is based on pub/sub
which is publish your subscriber
architecture which means each one of
these chat rooms that are just listening
to the 49ers publisher that's sending
out information so you'll see here
that's what happens so we basically put
up a package main throat so the XMPP
server for everybody that's following
the 49ers and they get a chat in their
room which is just a lot of fun some of
the things that goes in to the chat
currently are real-time events like game
events half a started half as any of the
game is about to begin
scoring events penalties really the
opportunities are endless
we could put substitutions we could put
highlight videos it's a really exciting
thing to do
finally it is chat so push notifications
and handling the disconnected state
aren't extremely important and mangu
Shyam has that all built in and so we
did some push notifications with a
little bit of filtering to make sure
that somebody doesn't get a duplicate
push notification so I just want to give
you an idea of what our daily schedule
looks like
at 5:00 a.m. Anaka is starting and
writing in Android and iOS
and this is fabulous for us because it
means like I said you wake up and
everything's going one of the things
that we had to adjust to to make this
work was at the end of my day the day
before I needed to make sure that Anaka
the mobile teams and our XMPP resource
in Stockholm had their next day ready to
go before I left so one of the main
themes of our success I think was being
able to it was being able to plan ahead
I guess it's a it magnifies the time
difference magnifies any kind of
inefficiencies you have being able to
just answer questions and not have it in
a ticket system for example it's not
always possible since half the team is
sleeping while the other half is working
and whenever somebody says drop
everything you're doing I need you to do
this you really can't you need to spend
five minutes to make sure that everybody
who's going to be queued up and starting
soon is ready to go so that's one thing
that we learned that I think we're doing
a lot better at today so 5:00 a.m. they
start 10:00 a.m. we have a daily
stand-up which is extremely important
the daily communication for remote
workers even if you don't have anything
to say it feels like you just need open
it send a message and and make make it
easy for everybody so the daily stand-up
is wherever the team kind of has our
bonding time it's a little less like a
usual stand-up where everyone's trying
to get in and get out because it's the
only time that we have together to talk
so we really see it as a teamwork and
team-building exercise as well
finally at 3:00 p.m. the naka does leave
for the day and we're planning what to
do the next day Tatiana's going to go
ahead and talk about all the tools we
use to try to keep this together it's
really nothing fancy it's pretty much
the stuff you'd expect I think or maybe
not maybe it'll be insightful I'll take
over from here
all right yeah so there's nothing
particularly earth-shattering about the
tools to use or how we state
organized but I know it's a question
that's often asked so I thought we'd
break it down and demystify remote
teamwork so as Chuck mentioned the daily
stand-up we have a daily stand-up with
the entire mobile team and that's where
everyone gets out onto a Google hangout
and discusses what they've been working
on there are four points that every dev
should mention which is what are you
working on how long is it going to take
to finish what are you planning on
taking next and what key files are you
working on do you have any blockers any
questions and this is a really important
time for the project lead to hear about
everyone's progress make sure that
everyone has enough tasks to keep them
busy for the day and to see if the
sprint needs to be adjusted but it's
also important for everyone on the team
to hear what the other guys are working
on it creates a certain amount of
cohesiveness in the work that's being
done since the stand-up happens in the
morning fourscore and during our
afternoon we also have an internal Anaka
diary where we basically do the same
status update when we get into the
office so the guys can touch base
there's no point in having waiting for
hours to talk about outstanding issues
or blockers if you have the option get
everyone to get everyone on a call
written statuses work every once in a
while but especially when you're working
with our little team it's important to
directly connect and we try to keep it
short most of our stand-ups are around
10 to 15 minutes and then we use slack
which is a popular chat tool score was
actually already using this when we
started one of the key differences that
we made was what we joined the team was
making sure the guys discuss things in
the slack channel even if they're in the
same room and that ensures that you're
including the remote people but also to
make sure that you have a record of what
was discussed often everyone agrees on a
certain decision than them five minutes
later they're trying to recall the
specifics and things can get hairy
something that our devs also found
useful with being able to ping score
server devs immediately when they had an
issue and sometimes that would mean
they'd wake up to that but there's
there's no lag he didn't have to wait
make sure to take advantage of the time
that everyone's online during the day
the mobile team was in constant
communication as Chuck mentioned so well
after that daily and in a lot of times
before you get everyone on board and
chatting so gears of project management
tool that we use to assign and organize
tasks score was already using it before
we started working with them but when we
joined it caused them to get a lot more
organized making sure that there were
descriptions and details added to tasks
so they were specific enough for guys to
work on without asking questions every
five minutes so if you can't define a
list of requirements or add details
about a task it's not ready to be
assigned to anyone and that's something
that's something that should be a rule
for any team anywhere I know it's really
tempting when you have a new feature or
a tight deadline to just get started but
in my experience you end up running into
a lot more problems if you don't invest
the time in outlining the requirements
of the feature creating thoughtful tasks
and thinking about all the parts
involved you set yourself up to run into
a lot of blockers and bigger e factors
or even just throwing out code because
you rush to get something started now
this of course isn't particular to
working with a remote team but the
consequences are compounded when half
your team's across the world and has a
four-hour head start on you and the
added benefit is the more thorough a
task is the better estimates your deaths
can make and the more accurate your
sprints will be and we've also asked the
guys in their stand-ups
to include the JIRA ticket in their
status so that you can see if the JIRA
board corresponds
so um another thing we do is pull
requests this is something that is
standard practice at a NACA that we kind
of brought with us the score and Chuck
has specific comments regarding that
yeah
one of the great things that we've
started to do on on the mobile team I
think and I refer to us as the mobile
team because I really feel like my my
Anaka devs are the same as my my team
dense I think that's been something that
we all enjoy but something that we've
started to do is really get a
conversation going in our poll requests
it's important since we're all remote
that every pull request that's reviewed
has comments on it it's also a way of
sharing knowledge between two different
developers and for those of you that are
unfamiliar with pull requests basically
it is a developer has written an entire
chunk of code and they're sending it to
another to say is this good enough to go
and so they can discuss what they went
well what didn't went well what they
should maybe change or a lot of times
it's just the other developers even
learning about how that feature works so
that more than one person knows about it
so this is extremely important probably
the most important piece on the
engineering side for us to just stay on
the same page because as engineers we
could talk about how a feature works
forever but you actually see the code
then the communication really is a lot
easier finally we also set up a new
workflow for pour requests and how we're
going to do code changes in the same
place at the same time so avoiding
merges use is a big deal because it's
harder to resolve merges when one of the
devs is not there or one of the
engineers is not there
so at our stand-up a lot of times my
role is to make sure that anyone who's
working on the same part of the
application I know that the code is
going to touch or they're going to
impact each other to call that out and
make sure that they work together
throughout the day and there's no
surprises when it comes to merge time
and then we did
more thing we if for special details are
for extra detail we vodka has their own
fork so they can actually make any
changes they want and known that and
make poor requests into our main
repository which is really helpful to
keep keep being separated permissions
wise but we're going to jump to Google
Calendar I'll let Tatyana talk about
that so Google Calendar there's nothing
particularly innovative here but like a
soccer mom with a van full of kids
remembering everyone's schedule can be a
challenge and Chuck and I share a
calendar called score nanaka scheduling
where I update the schedules for dads
whether that be for vacation a doctor's
appointment etc since we're operating in
different countries it's also important
to add things like federal holidays and
office schedules and those are things
that most people tend to forget this is
also the place where I put if a dove is
sick or unavailable the day of so and
Chuck gets into the office he has an
idea of what's going on with his team so
our mobile team has a pretty tight-knit
group and over the duration of this
project there's certain factors that we
think have contributed to that something
I've noticed that Chuck has done really
well is giving the guys feedback on a
daily basis letting them know
collectively and individually that he
appreciates the work they're doing when
they deliver a task for come up with a
solution to a problem or finish a sprint
Chuck will commend them for a job well
done and I can tell the guys really
appreciate it and it makes a difference
I think sometimes making a client happy
can feel impersonal but I've seen how
the guys has become invested in the
project and in the team and they want to
impress Chuck and they don't want to let
him down and I think he's done a great
job to foster that
camaraderie I don't know if you have
anything else to add about your
mentality and giving people shout outs
yeah absolutely
just as my time as developer I know that
you had a long time on the future and as
soon as you finished the next feature is
ready to go so we like to take pause at
least for a second and say thank you and
and continue on to the next things
there's plenty of things to do another
thing we did was kind of face-to-face
introduction so one of our iOS let me
not go away I am I kiddin see if I can
thank you you sound good to me okay
okay so sorry about that
one of our iOS stuffs from Mecca
Hanako went to San Francisco for a month
early and on in the project and then
through your deaths from score came to
be a fair few months and bitter devs
were able to learn a lot after working
alongside our guys and I think that
exchange was also really important to
create a connection among the developers
you know you're online every day and
you're checking each other's cars
but it's great to know that there's a
person behind that get handle having
that face-to-face interaction really
does have an impact especially in
long-term projects it's a great
investment to have team members meet and
we're going side one another yeah and
I'd like to add to this one on the face
to face we really got a lot of a lot of
value we send some very junior Android
developers to Argentina and they came
back trained up very well so as long as
it helped tremendously with teamwork but
it really added value to our
organization to be able to lean on those
people more as they came back a lot
stronger
and finally another thing that I think
contributed to our kind of team
atmosphere is that right off the bat I
reached out to chuck to let him know
that I needed his honest feedback in
order to make sure that we were living
up to his expectations so unlike a lot
of projects I work on I very little to
go on in terms of the quality of code
our guys are delivering since we're
embedded in scores workflow we aren't
part of the QA process and many
components and features are a
collaborative effort I think you have to
facilitate a certain level of trust and
layer cards out on the table in order to
get the kind of feedback and
transparency and confidence you need to
keep the project going so I check in
every now and again but at this point
I'm confident that if they're if Chuck
sees an issue or if something's off he
won't hesitate to share and I think that
has proved it handy when there were
tense times in the project yeah that's
right now I'll just add one more thing
and that is that I actually have a
schedule in my calendar to remind myself
to send feedback to talk down because
it's easy to get wrapped up in a project
and forget
so actually scheduling time to have
honest feedback in and collaboration is
really helpful for me yeah and so going
on to the last point so this all sounds
great but it's an ongoing process we've
had to improve on all of these points
and no project is perfect and things go
wrong so we thought we'd go over some
missteps we encountered and how we tried
to resolve them one of the issues that
came up to mind was there was an issue
of some end points so the server guys at
San Francisco made some changes and then
went home for the day and our mobile
guys got into work and what do you know
nothing worked basically everyone was
blocked until the server guys from San
Francisco got back up to the office and
were able to figure out what was going
on and this kind of lack of
communication creates delays when
everyone's in the same office but it's
really compounded when there's a
four-hour head start
so we try to do two things to resolve
this one is if you're going to work on
an existing end point or change anything
you have to reach out and the goal is
getting the guys to communicate before
even you know anyone touches anything so
that we can maybe plan accordingly if
someone someone's in the middle of
trying to make a change and then the
second is to try to get the guys to
stick to a workflow and create a merge
schedule it can be really tempting for a
death to merge everything before they
need the office but you can see that it
can totally stall a project another
thing that we found was finding the
right fit so not every dev shines in
certain situations or environments and
we had a dev that didn't do well with
being embedded in a high-stress
environment with last-minute requirement
changes which was basically what we were
developing the chat feature we're under
an extremely tight deadline and product
was changing things and it it wasn't
ideal obviously the situation was an
ideal but he had often protests instead
of trying to find solutions and his
attitude began to rub off on the rest of
the team and this of course isn't
exclusive to working with people
remotely but it can sour a dynamic
especially one you have to foster very
carefully when you're working with on
the team and one of the ways that we
resolved this was being honest with each
other and identifying what was going on
we ended up reassigning that from the
project and I think it benefited
everyone involved making sure that
there's a positive team environment
allow us for problem solving to take
center stage during those tense moments
rather than a doomsday mentality they
can honestly be really infectious
yeah and I'll just add that I think
something that shows our great the
communication that we built up is that
it was not a surprise to either of us or
anyone on the team when we did when we
talked about this kind of stuff so it's
I think it's a good sign when you know
what the other person is going to say
before they say it so that's good
and then finally uh being team morale
like I mentioned before we had a really
aggressive timeline with shifting
requirements and a back-end that was
always behind and that left our mobile
does block frustrated annoyed and they
didn't really see an end in sight and
one of the ways we neutralized tensions
was meeting with the guys hearing them
out and explaining what was going on
with the other teams to put their issues
into perspective I think it's easy to
have blinders on when you don't have
what you need to do your work and it's
easy to forget that there are teams that
have challenges of their own especially
when those issues aren't communicated to
you so it's important that the PM is not
only aware of the issues but also they
communicate what's going on so the team
has some perspective even if there's
nothing you can do about it telling the
team for example hey you know they had
to redesign that screen because product
didn't like it they want to avoid
changing it later they'll have it too as
soon as it's done or you know the back
end guys they don't want to break the
admin so they're they're gonna make that
change but it might take a while that
really makes a difference you don't want
to get into a situation where sentiments
have been brewing unchecked and
unanswered it kind of leads to this
desperation so if you feel like you're
in control and and if things aren't
going your way but there's a reason it's
a lot easier to you know to stay calm
and I hope I hope this all brings to
light that it's like any real project
there are people involved and it's it's
as much a people management thing as is
a technical management thing so I like
to think that it's a it's a really
honest and real explanation of how I
don't like that so that's pretty much
what we've prepared I know that you guys
apply them but then some questions so
what you guys take the lead on that
so first
thank you very much for a most inspiring
talk - chuckling - Jana and I'm sure the
audience is joining me in that I also
like to thank the audience for a bit of
an avalanche of questions that they've
been asking o'clock webinar I'm going to
have to disappoint it - some of you and
say that we can only answer so many in
the remaining time but we'll certainly
do our best to answer as many as we can
now any unanswered questions we will
answer in writing sending the responses
to people who ask them after the webinar
so thank you again I would suggest we
just login straight into the questions
so Tatiana and Chuck we have one of our
members of the audience
David asking how did you to begin with
and you partially answered this but how
do you choose and why did you choose an
airline based platform to begin with yes
so I'll go ahead and answer that one
Erlang was important to us because the
scalability you're expecting to have a
lot of users very soon and we don't have
any issues of scaling we also have had a
lot of experience with their links we're
familiar with it and finally it just
seemed like the best chat product for us
so as it get fit so thank you for that
we'll just go straight onto the next
question
to try and honor as many of them as we
can this is a very concrete question
coming from Norman
so Norman is asking could you in effect
tell us a bit about your your messages
per second at peak times your concurrent
users numbers at peak times as well as
your uniquely active users do you have
any stats that you could share with us
there's a very good question we see our
peak usage whenever we have a very large
post go out so a lot of times we'll have
a professional athlete post something
that is just really
rallying up the internet and that seems
to be when we see our most load I do not
have any specific numbers to share right
now yeah so I'll just have to leave
hat oh that's that's absolutely fine
Chuck thank you for that and we'll just
go straight into the next question and
again apologies especially to people who
are now sending an even larger number of
questions we'll try and answer again as
many as we can right now so one of our
members of the audience is asking are
you planning to support Windows platform
at all in your work and you know in the
project going forward we do not
currently have plans for the Windows
platform we do have a pretty hefty web
presence we do have a large group of
windows capable developers here but as
i've heard there's not currently any any
plans for a windows presence as it now
thank you for that and we'll just move
straight on to the next question again
to try and answer as many as many as you
can this might be a question for the
channel but also for you chuck obviously
as well more on the project management
side so Marvin is asking how many
projects can a p.m. realistically be
working on simultaneously and
effectively so I think that depends on
the type of project and what it lends
itself to for example with score I have
a very interesting role because unlike
my other projects where I create tasks
and dictate priorities and we internally
take care of a project and present
builds to the client this presents kind
of a monitoring passive role where I'm
basically making sure that there aren't
a lot of problems you know we don't
confront any issues like I said before
where when things are tense or
scheduling or making sure that everyone
has tasks and basically being the extra
buffer and I think in a lot of ways
aren't necessarily
best communicator so sometimes getting
on an email and just expressing what's
going on is really helpful I don't know
if cha feels similarly but yeah I think
it's really dependent on the type of
project you don't want to stretch
yourself too thin I'll go back to check
but just to answer that question I
realized I think at the highest point in
my NACA career I was managing four
projects
you were kind of intensive and then for
example one project if there's one
developer it's pretty easy to manage so
it depends on the type of projects the
type of feature the different types of
technology involved is it just front-end
is it just server in Ian a lot of
factors going into communication that's
for yeah and I would just say that it
really depends on the expectations of
the project manager how many what they
need to do if in my opinion as a kind of
an engineering lead and a project
management one large project helps me
focus I think it helps everybody succeed
just to do one thing well so I will take
on-site projects occasionally but I have
to remain focused on our one goal of in
Android iOS app that engages in people
love to use so it's hard for me to say
from a project manager spective but from
a team lead it's definitely good to have
that focus at a single a single
accomplished accomplishable goal Thank
You Tatiana and Thank You Chuck that
really sort of illustrates both the
project management side and as Chuck
said the team lead perspective so just
to quickly answer one question that has
come in the recording of the webinar and
the slides that we've shared with you
today will be available for you to
collect by the erlang solutions is
corporate website but again a big
apology to everyone it's obvious now
that we are getting more questions as I
speak then we can possibly answer in the
remaining time but we'll just crack on
and try and answer as many
as we can in very many few minutes so
the next question the time ties in
nicely with the previous one
perhaps for Tatiana Tatiana what percent
of percentage of PMI do you see the
typical project so like I mentioned
before every projects different and
after okay so every projects different
as far as the amount of effort but I
think what is this in relation to the
amount of effort put in in in terms of
hours or is there any other context in
that question or please it's basically
trying to illustrate that kind of
problem especially when you're you know
planning and putting in estimates
together and then considering you know
what proportion of PMI will you have in
relation to all the other tasks such as
development and you know everything else
that's involved with delivering a
project and and trying to sort of
estimate this you know well in advance
and basically make you know organize
towards that sorry
oh the standard that I know is 15% so I
know that that might be more intensive
for certain projects but that's like the
standard thank you for that I guess as
you said it does depend on each project
and you can sort of generalize but I
guess we can set that as a value to sort
of perhaps live by at least at least in
approaching a project now the next
question perhaps will Chuck Chuck one of
our audience is asking what DevOps tools
that you use in your project all of them
now you really do lots of we have a lot
of we have continuous build integration
so as soon as a developer commits
something it goes through we have static
analysis to make sure that code that's
checked in has meets our standards we
have unit tests and functional UI tests
and as far as the build machine we use
it as a Jenkins based machine
I guess the phrase DevOps can really
cover a lot of things we use multiple
analytics platforms that that's as far
as my brains letting me go right now
thank you for that I think that's
certainly giving us an idea so the next
question comes from Egbe if I'm
pronouncing that right
Anke is asking how was the Monkey
Science mobile deployed exactly did you
use cloud service for the deployment at
all
so our mongoose IM is it is hosted on
AWS but we obviously are managing it
there's not a cloud service that we are
using to do that it's all our own server
so yeah this is deployed on an AWS
instance and I think that answers that
thank you that we'll just move straight
on to the next question now here's an
interesting one I guess more from a
project management perspective so
Stephen is asking have you had instances
of people effectively going off on a
tangent and making development decisions
that are not in line with the project
plan but rather pursuing directions that
they feel are the right routes to follow
from a development perspective I'll
start off with that one no we have not
one of the great one of the strong suits
of anaka
is that they're constantly communicating
saying hey they will speak up and let me
know I you know this part of the code we
really should refactor this we should
you know we should switch to this
process but there's an understanding
that they need approval that needs to go
through me first because there are
expectations for us finishing features
for doing all kinds of things so we have
not had an issue with a rogue def making
something
that wasn't requested either good or bad
everything has been inside of the
project manual so far and will continue
to be Tatyana did you want to put your
perspective towards that so the question
again was have you ever had instances of
people effectively making development
decisions on their own and basically
pursuing those were following a
particular plan I think Addie nachus and
I'm speaking from different projects we
have a lot of autonomy but also a lot of
responsibility to team so we estimate
features and come up with a plan and
stick to them and that plan can change
but it has to be communicated I don't
think I've ever encountered a Deb just
doing whatever they wanted without
communicating to anybody of what was
going on but then again we work with a
lot of projects so that might be
something that comes up in you know
homegrown Deb's I'm not really sure
trucks was talking about a naki naka I
don't know if that's ever happened to
you with a with a scored oh yeah
no no nothing comes to my head right
away well thank you for this Tatyana we
will have one final question to ask
Chuck into Janna and we'll have to sort
of leave it at that that I what we do
commit to answer all your questions in
writing after the webinar so one last
question is why was c-sharp not used for
the client app and for the client XMPP I
guess that's one of our audience members
offering an alternative that they feel
perhaps would have been a reasonable fit
that's a good question we actually
started already in our initial app in
c-sharp and we absolutely loved it it
was working in everywhere we went and
better our biggest problem was being
able to get all the resources we needed
that both new iOS Android and c-sharp
it's kind of a unique mix of talent and
so to find somebody that
as all of those and build out a large
team for us it was a little too
difficult so we lent a kind of leaned on
naka to help us jump into Swift and then
as far as XMPP on c-sharp I think it I
am NOT a server developer so I cannot
speak completely to that but XMPP is at
least on the server side is a completely
Erlang world and I cannot speak through
more than that other than that I'm not
sure if there's a way to do that even
sharp on the server sure thank you for
that now we'll have to close off the
question session at that and I'm sure
that everyone here will join me in
thanking once again to tatiana and chuck
for a fantastic talk many thanks to all
of you at wor who have joined us for the
webinar please join us again for the
next monthly webinar we will shortly
advertise now following today we will
send you a short survey to make sure we
capture your feedback of today's webinar
as I mentioned before the recording of
the webinar and the presentation that
was shared today will be available for
you to collect on our corporate website
at the WWII - solution comm thank you
all once again and we look forward to
seeing you on our next webinar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
