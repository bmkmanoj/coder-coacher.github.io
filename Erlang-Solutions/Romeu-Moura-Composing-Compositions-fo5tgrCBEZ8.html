like to thank dr. oz father and same
area because I would have no context
presentation just stolen right from them
so garage sabha is a fascinating book
and who he has were they rude God ok
attention thank you so much if you
listen ok don't get this in the
beginning of the book there is a little
annual I searched the book meditation
was the reason why i created this
presentation really at some point it
does about the musical freedom so for
those who haven't heard
edit the booze girlfriend was an offer
by back through the Prince of Austria
and they contain a very interesting go
take several kennels in several several
different puzzle misko puzzles my
contains a very specific which is this
oh thank you
yeah I'm sure we're working right
so what is interesting about the caliper
tunnels is that it gives an illusion of
being always getting a tongue up and up
and up going always upwards infantry
this come a complete illusion of course
it is impossible but the what is more
interesting about the caliper tunnels is
that it does a strange loop it does a
recursion about the several music that
does relations right there are several
kennels that do requests you have a sub
list and you have Pachelbel Pachelbel's
Canon you have several other canister
recursions what specific about the Canon
Paterno's is that at each iteration of
the cannon it starts enjoyed a no tiger
and then after several iterations this
comes back to the start again now you
gotta get letter letting go with this
but I think there's back knew about
recursion zone with he did that you
cannot really create that sort of
structure and not know the existence of
equations of not know the structure of
equations we there is a whole debate
that will not enter which when when one
has the question stuttered we there are
several people to talk about plateau I I
almost the people to think that the
creator of model modern precautions
Rapinoe with with the induction metal
but back if he used if he used
if use equations on the specific music
in that specific way if you use the
strange reproduce the soften that kept
going on and on he don't from the start
he knew about the structure of it right
he he knew the mechanism I knew how to
use it ha just played it so that got me
thinking back did this in 1747 and be
noticed this in the 19th century which
brings my open question to this
presentation which is what else can we
steal from the musicians and I would lie
to you I kind of empty handed I searched
a lot and is kind of a lifelong journey
I mean you discover music is a real
professional you discover the it
discovered as soon as it's tried digging
into it you discover more and more
complexity the domain is a very complex
business domain is a very good
opportunity to try to try us chops with
computer science trying to model to
modernize the musical domain but I got
there with that impression that I could
just try it like any other domain just
tried you broke it like I do with my
clients like me finance for other things
just trying to crack this and find the
essence of model is model in this thing
and I was completely wrong I have no
idea what led me to believe that there
was possible I I anyway I have just come
several little things in the inter inter
during that did that course on the
travel and I
I tried to partake with the best I came
with you people so when I start this
journey I knew not not nothing about
music who he is no a little bit of music
TV or a lot omega i did all right i
started this without doing nothing about
music theory nothing entirely nothing so
I learned the basics of written melody
harmony during the the last year while
creating this talk which is what i was
going to predict with you so this is
written kind of monotonic or written
right but a return nonetheless what I
mean what am I doing here is
just create an analogy which is with
notes which is always the same note in
measures hours the same measure just a
repetition of the same note with the
same pitch length and intensity when I
modal model izing notes as trip tapos of
pitch measures and intensity so one
quarter is a quarter note right is a
crochet in french i don't know how this
do tell that english and and what this
is doing is just maintaining their
written and here i just changing
identities
which creates the exact same pattern but
changes the intensities from tuna right
face what try to model this thing what I
though my biggest problem was the
intensity in the beginning I had no idea
I start the first person of this talk I
have no idea that that was a problem and
but rhythm is not only intensity like we
show here
we should just keep in the same note I'm
just repeating the same note just though
see watching every continue functioning
yet with just changing of intensity and
a change of measure I have a very
different sound and we feel were to make
it very short I my computer will not be
able to do this but if we were to make
very very very short you will end up
turning written into matt and mello gene
a note is just a very very very quick
written there is only written in music
everything else is just so much
application of it over itself either is
a big enormous strange loop in the
almost the same way that in computer
science you can boil everything doubt
you reducers and we create everything
down to reduces ukraine recreated music
everything down to written
well I changed notations here but what I
did was just recreate the same structure
again again again again I just creating
data that turns itself into that that
other later here is nothing else I now
there's a very important point later in
the presentation is nothing else I'm
just describing music on top of
descriptions of music
and written is recursive upwards so we
have a metric I do you people know how
to read a partition no maybe a little
when you separate your music into bars
which are an assemble of Metro of
matters the bars themselves can be
matters so you have an idea of hyper
matter it just is easier to understand
while listening to it really here i have
the same song breakages before here and
apply an IP murder to it
you keep the same distances between
sounds but from one part to another it
change the elevation of sounds between
ours and create the same distance you
were creating between two notes between
two bars and you can pile and pile and
pile that over again you can start
recreating the structure of written in a
recursive oil port and request way
downwards
just a place into itself and uses itself
as a part into itself if it's oneself
let's let's complex childers in the
beginning what I mean is if I try to
take us a simple example
you end up just doing a group
multiplication of written / written for
it in poverty
and also start getting sounds to to read
it shorter length
you starting at those distortions you
can you can create the sound of a
battery through the white-nose lies you
can create any instrument by
compositions in compositions and
compositions or compositions of the same
the same basic structure of a sound of
salt just by using the a single a single
sinusoidal sound here I have just by
creating a written pattern I started
creating a sound of a battery little by
little so
that's the best measure of complexity
when creating music is that then they is
not very type of all the nature of
things is not really fix your as soon as
you start and distorting things tourism
so limit you start and get other results
started yet we start getting is that the
start transformation which may achieve
in geometric symmetric matrix into into
melody Mel may different mellows into
different instruments everything starts
getting a bigger bomb of mud together
much much like all our legacy code base
right make it it's just that I don't see
a way to perfect handle this we have
several several ways to combat our
legacy into enterprise systems we
created ways to handle this to fight
this to fight this complexity but here
what I find amazing about about this is
that the is an essential complexity the
problem here is ignorance to the domain
you cannot do away with it you you have
something that the feeds on self that
has a compound complexity and that
compound complex it is part of the main
itself
there is no perfect solution to this
I have not you ready to do this one girl
by shifting the the measures we use I
mean into a I have prepared some images
before and then can find my hope that's
not what I was looking for
so you usually seen the partitions
there's no sympathy for the people do
not do not know how to read the
partition write those symbols represent
how many beats you have ensure bar and
what does the size of those beads so
like I put before
when I created those volumes here I
created bits that are stronger than
other bits right and assigning those
those values here to the G should the
different bits inside the bar and
the finger / time signatures is that
they are changeable
leave it although these termites about
I do you perceive the difference at the
end of the bar
well just they just take an original
value we get very boring quickly even if
everything is made off of it it's like
in real life you can do everything with
reduces but just piling reduces and one
of the top on another gets boring
quickly you kind of need to change
things in your life let's talk about
melody I feel old no people here at
older than me here like right so what I
did is what just put the pitches but put
the notes that I wanted to wanted here
there's not really astounding on
anything the thing is if you want you
get the fun of it we want to understand
scales
every instrument has his own scales mean
which means every student has a
limitation of what notes it will play
and you can play a melody in one and in
the given scale I I don't suppose you
have heard this or don't you take them
I cannot do this in program i cannot
program this yet i will someday but i
cannot yet
you you see that he puts a key and a a
scale to this composition every
composition can be modulated inch of
this chaos
the structure of the music remain that
remains the same if I asked you if I
asked you with which is this note or
we're here is doe or C are you able to
find here in the partition don't let the
cup this face when we when repetition
the key here is there to tell the tell
us what what note it will work for sorry
to each of the branches here what note
is attached there what i'm doing here is
exactly the same what I created here
with this with this notation is just
recreating the partition nothing else
there's nothing particularly settlers
into strange about this I just put in
another key into the partition
and kinda even if it changes a lot to
gain cadiz is to see the melody there
the basic structure is there yet
and just by changing it I change
intervals sorry is the name of the is
the name of the scale I don't choose the
names there they are named is one of one
of the several existing scales the like
durian toady I never heard about told
you before what i'm doing here is just
recalculating every note in modulating
them in turn not in a new partition what
I'm not showing here is that to do this
I usually I use mini current a cheat a
lot but was not the point of the of the
presentation face I re regenerating the
the mellow G on the fly by deciding what
should be the pitches oh sorry I'll do
it I show that not that done that that
was stupid that was stupid
ok
yes well thank you sorry that was an
infinite melody that right stupidly to
to show here and nobody should never do
this right this is better so this is the
melody melody before
and
this is after
it's just a remapping on the fly but
there are a huge number of possible
mappings and i could not just put them
in memory of those due to something like
this the the number of possible keys and
possible scales is gigantic so i have to
improvise
we got our money our money is the most
powerful most difficult to understand
the part for me at least I don't know if
some people here really good in our
money I want to discuss with them later
but harmony is changes your perfect but
it was perception of time when you when
you put when you put things put things
in a RMA your perception of the rhythm
and of the melody changed
oh that was awful yeah right and maybe
we can retire it this will be even worse
I've just seen before so you can cover
your ears we gettin tired of the same
melody over and over and over again teen
I will try to just use narrator random
one
let's not do not the worse completely
random one that I had a vision of a few
cheated because I was expecting
something that would just destroy my
ears right maybe this that that has more
like it this morning now that's high
Glen harmonic you taking taking random
random notes will not help me because
I'm just taking random notes at all
possible notes notes ever right if I
really want to have a composition that
gets get get the notes it from a good
place I should try to remain my scale so
what is a scale
ask you said mutation right I'm just
picking picking notes and say that you
use only those notes and by by
constraining
which notes I can take I can free my
little musician here to be more awesome
to free himself itself to feed itself
towards create creating more random
things because it is inside a safe no
the space of action that's better than
the sound i just made before right the
one if you don't believe me oh I can
return there right in both cases a
creative random sounds but here
improvising inside a limited scale where
when the number of harmony is a highly
of a tandem probability of dancing for
office lover
figures I do this by creating holes
right in overtone decode the code it
they call it one two three four five in
the bar under oath I just put them into
mini grant Karina's as holes in touch
with you to fill in but
what edgy is the same okay well volume
can be improved I did not expect you
have this much power I was naive but the
process remains the same I'm creating a
constraint free creativity this is not
what I wanted to talk about what I want
to talk about today is that the music
itself because like I say in the
beginning there's a lifelong thing it's
about this
maybe not do the infinite thing two
times in a row right
yeah that was stupid
is about this or not
I will not try to understand why
ok
I have a problem
yeah what I good
is about this my own my main point today
to better try to bring to doing this
discussion with you people is one of the
points in the beginning of the jab but
he talked about these amo freedoms and
specifically the Holy job says is
sophomore theorems induce me let's try
to crack that one together let's do
let's do it this well what is it is all
my vision ap please don't say GS in the
back in the involve server-side and
client-side this is not that talk I
don't have anything about the bees using
of name so you do do you but this is not
what I'm going to talk about today
anyone
somehow parallel we the same
kinda yeah it's a transformation that
perceives structure the book gives a
huge plethora of examples but i'll try
to cover a few the whole idea is you
you're creating something that you can
take from being the same structure
different behavior or something else a
model a formal model that you can
understand something else through the
length of it right I'm I've been very
crude I really ashamed because there are
academicians in the here they have
probably way better definitions for this
but i would keep that one for the moment
over moment the whole idea is that once
you see an Enzo murphy's we cannot help
but see a mini you that's not a choice
you grab a bite the example that I liked
a lot that it gives into the book is he
creates a series of dashes an operator
and another series of dashers and
another operator and another series of
dashes what does this mean
oh my god so what does this mean
it creates a typographical system right
and creates an isomorphism between those
systems something else that we
understand ourselves and in this case
here we could understand this by being
the operation son to three plus two
equals five or two plus one equals three
and that would be one kind of Islam
afisma as soon as you get this we start
judging the operation like it was the
some the example gives in the book there
likes a lot is that may be just the
subtraction there is no reason to
believe that this the this operation
here obeys all the other loves the some
dos we do not have enough details here
we do not know we will be able to have a
commutativity or something like like
like this here right but we cannot help
but see it anyway as soon as we
understand as soon as understand that
this means a son then this miss and some
right
and and this is a really powerful thing
in software I mean in general but a
powerful thing the software you you
create a lot of those models that try to
create a structure and represent that
represent a sort of your life inside it
and one of biggest problems i encounter
every day don't know if it is the carry
case for you people but for me is people
to try to represent the entire reality
and should they endure the domain model
I see it a lot and another problem much
more frequent and much more pernicious
that I see is that once you put it in
your mind that an object or a function
that means a thing you attached it to
the real world version of that thing and
not for the code itself it has a common
problem
we cannot help but do it because we we
we have a mechanical way of thinking but
you also have a intuitive way of
thinking in our to achieve way your
thinking will get in the way of a
mechanical way of thinking it does
normal that helps us a lot but it also
creates a lot of problems
a lots of people think these images
about nitpicking right Cecilia fussing
people like a neighbor grid which it
announces the fact that this image is
not a pipe and it is an image of a pipe
the tradition of art and the Treasury of
art and and we are inside this every day
which brings me to the question have
everything music today sorry I wrote
code to make music yeah thatthat's I
mean was it music I that that that has a
combination I I have no hope no closed
answer to this I have no closed answer
to this a discussion I had a lot why
trying to learn to do those things was
is this a program that represents a
music is this a notation to represent
some music is this an instrument yes but
which one that's an easy it that does it
is very Altman there's a very easy robot
fingers what I really like about Lisp in
mr. lot I love hasco I really love i
really do but I end up always missing
all my queen ECT and aspirations a tiny
tiny does it I always miss that is that
ambiguity as soon as i created this
melody
the sea I can reattach it will another
another function to the symbol the
symbol delicious describing a date a
data structure and if not nothing else a
very dynamic data structure this thing
here i ascribe the meaning of a melody
to 18 you always fight the meaning of a
melody do it and when i recreated
transforming it into a series of notes
you ascribe the meaning of a partition
to it but if I reach Ainge the symbols
in it without changing anything that i
have created i now have a way of drawing
this or printing it or send it to over
the network or doing anything else is
almost isn't induced meaning &amp;amp; omo akin
icity opens a way to change my mind
about the meaning of the universal
morphisms i have in front of me and
ultimately i should have spent less time
to locate and anything is
to it the thing is
as soon as I've done that I now agree
with you I mean for me still remains
open whatever where this is an
instrument or music that does this work
if I do not put a human visit behind
this and some way or another that that's
for me there's an open question but for
all the other has ideas are proposed if
I have created music or an instrument or
a programmer generator I do not believe
that divide between programs in at
keppel another if the program is later
can replace an evil being and not
believe them incur intervals use
extensively here can replace and even
being the behind this so I do not
believe that this is completely music as
you had to create the rules that gave me
those results so the dynamics I'm Way
more near an instrument but that's open
what I do believe though is that for
everything else I can choose a meaning
and a test my pointer is and I'll should
I will do lighting talk to that tonight
and thank you folks tomorrow night nice
tonight I mean solicitor it is it is
changed I know
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
