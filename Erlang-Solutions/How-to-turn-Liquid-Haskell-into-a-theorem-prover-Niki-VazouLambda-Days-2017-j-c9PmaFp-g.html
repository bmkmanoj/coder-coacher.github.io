describe liquid Haskell and how you can
use liquid Haskell to turn Haskell into
a theorem prover but before I tell you
how let me tell you why
one seduced Haskell as a theorem prover
we said use Haskell as a theorem proven
because software bugs are everywhere as
an example in 2015 an aero plane crashed
due to a software bug have another more
famous example we have heartbleed and
open SSL cryptographic vulnerability
that you to buffer overflows actually
revealed sensitive user information into
into other users so the goal of sorry
yeah it's difficult to do it again yeah
sorry okay okay so we use all these
lambda languages not to fix this bugs
but instead to make these bugs difficult
to express so towards this goal your
mood you were using modern programming
languages like F sharp or camel Erlang
Scala and Haskell that may heavy use of
well studied theories like strong types
and lambda calculus and make statements
like that well type programs cannot go
wrong now to fact-check this clay let's
see if we can encode HAARP lead into the
strongly typed language Haskell so to do
that I'm going into Haskell's
interpreter GHI I and I'm importing data
text a library that manipulates string
and I'm actually packing hot into a data
text and then I'm going to use take
world 16 a function that I import from
Anna
unsafe version of data.txt the Texas we
put a text and index I and returns back
the I first characters of the input text
T so now if I am if I in text park with
true when the lambda my wins because
Hoskins says that you cannot use true
which is a boolean value as an index
because the index should be integer but
instead if I use 502 index the string
heart then I have exactly n court
encoded heartbleed because what DT will
do is basically go into the memory at
the place at hut in store and give to
the user the 500 characters that live in
the memory after heart so it will reveal
into the user information that the user
is not supposed to see so with this we
have encoded harlot into Haskell
so the problem here is that the type of
tech world 16 says that give me an
attack T and then give me an int X I
that is an integer and I'm going to give
you back the I first element of the text
but the in text can be every integer
from minus infinity to infinity so what
we actually want is to split in the
girls into the valid indicators and the
invalid integrals and the valid in the
gears and only indicates that are a good
indexes for that for the text T that is
indicates that range from zero to land
of T and with Haskell type system we can
not express this division of integers
but we can express it using refinement
types so we give we use refinement types
to specify a type for the off take the
day that says give me as input at text T
and then as an intake give me some in
the curvy so that this V is always less
than or equal to the length of the input
T now with this refinement type
specification for take
if we if we try to in tax pack with five
hundreds we are going to get back a
refinement type error and for this talk
I'm going to give back a refinement type
error with liquid Haskell so liquid
Haskell is a refinement type checker
that takes us as input a code with some
specification and it returns okay
only when the code provably satisfies
the specification and it does this by
checking but all the function and all
the arguments of the functions are valid
with respect to the specifications of
the functions provided by the user under
whatever facts liquid Haskell can get
from the environment so in our example
we have the fact that the length of X is
equal to 3 because we statically know
that X is a string heart that has length
exactly equal to 3 and under this fact I
want to check if the arguments to the
function take are valid so what I want
to check is if my argument that is a
value that it is exactly equal to 500 is
a valid argument for the specification
of take that says that the int X of
takes would be less than or equal to the
length X so to check that I have an
implication and the way I'm going to
check on an implication is via an SMT
solver so there isn't a solvers are
basically black boxes the take as input
a logical formula and they decide
automatically if this formula is
satisfiable or not so in this case when
I give this formula as input to this
anti solver lesson the solver is going
to say that this formula is invalid so
liquid Haskell will create a refinement
typer that says that the call to take is
not probably correct it does it it
doesn't probably satisfy the
specifications for take so this is
liquid Haskell
checks using an SMT solver automatically
if the the arguments to the functions
are valid that means that the arguments
to the function satisfy the
specifications that the user provided
for the functions under fact that they
can collect from the environment and the
question now is what kind of facts can a
liquid Haskell collect from the
environment so in the examples we saw
the fact that we used was the length of
cut is equal to exactly three but then
we can have in some programs we can have
other interesting facts so for example
you may need to use that the append
operator is associative or we may need
to use that if I mapreduce a function f
on an input eyes this is exactly
equivalent to just applying f twice and
generally interesting facts are theorems
about Haskell functions so to encode and
prove theorems about Haskell functions
we are going to use liquid Haskell as a
theorem prover so we can use little
rascal as a theorem prover using three
steps so first we can use refinement
types to specify theorems about Haskell
functions the second step is that we are
actually going to prove these theorems
using Haskell and the final step is that
we are going to use liquid Haskell to
check if the proofs we provided for the
for the theorems are actually correct
so next I'm going to use liquid Haskell
as a fear improver to prove
associativity of list appending so to
begin with I'm just defining a classic
list type in Haskell my list is either
empty or it is a cons of a value of type
A and the list of A's and I am defining
the classic happened function that it
takes two arguments X's and Y's
if the
argument is mean when it does return to
the second argument if my first argument
is account when it returns counts of X
and recursively calls itself so with
this definition of a pent I want to
define a tide that actually describes
that append is associative so I start
defining a type that says that for every
input X is wise and this of type at
least this type just returns unit and
this is my basic haskell type that is
going to prove associativity of the
append operator because then they can
come and refine the result type unit to
actually describe associativity of
append operator so my unit type my unit
result ID is refined with a property
that says that if I append access to
wise and then I append it to this this
is equal to appended X to the append of
wise and J's with exactly defines
associativity of the append operator so
now I'm just going to remove the
information that V is unique because I
don't actually need it and again here I
specify using refinement type
associativity of the append operator and
the question here is how can I actually
define the body of the append operator
so the body of the append operator
should be a unit Haskin value that
actually proves that my left hand side
the left hand side of the equality is
equal to the right hand side of the
equality so for example I can define
them I could define the body of a shock
to be just unit but this will create me
a type error so liquid haskell is not
persuaded by the unit that associativity
of append holds so what I'm going to do
is basically I'm going to define the
body of the shock so that I start from
the left hand side of my operator of my
operation
then I conclude that this is equal to
the right hand side of my operate
operation under sub steps that we'll see
shortly and then I'm going to use this a
fun centric separator that liquid
Haskell provides the basically cast
whatever I have here into a unit so that
the basic type system is okay okay so
let's go and basically fill in the dots
in here okay so I look at the type of my
append function and I want to be able to
say that the left hand side is equal to
my right hand side and my left hand side
is right now I cannot do anything but if
I go only in the case that axis is the
empty list it is easy to observe that
and append two y's according to the
first line of my definition is that well
if it is exactly equal to wise so this
function call is interesting because in
the logic this function call will
basically insert the first line of the
definition of the append function so
liquid radical after this call knows but
an appended to wise is equal to is
exactly equal to wise and then we need
to go from the second line to the third
and then again we observe that I know
that nil appended to White's append this
according to the first definition is
equal to wise append to this so then
with this call to append and with a
green cost opened liquid Haskell is
actually able to prove that append is
associative in case that axis is
actually the empty list okay so this is
the proof of list of a pentose activity
in case of the excess list and for the
case in the case that exes is not new
I'm going to show you how exactly things
work in
okay you know you cannot tell the screen
what control zero command zero oh I
don't know it's you cannot see it
whatever I have here yeah the window the
winter is not good you okay nice okay so
this is the classical function I uses
enter my browser okay so I in port
protecting the functions I am rewriting
and then they put a library proof
Combinator's that comes with liquid
haskell that defines operators
lightproof defines qadian the Stars and
the Equality don't so I am defining cons
upend as I defined before and I say
reflect append into the logic which
basically means every time you actually
apply append on concrete input then
insert these equalities into the logic
and I also tell liquid Haskell to check
that all my functions are total and then
I come and prove associative et okay so
I have the nil case that it's exactly
the one that they presented you and now
we have to fill in the dots for the
contrary so I start from the left hand
side I want to conclude in the right
hand side so what I say is again I go
and rewrite so I have cons append with
cons so I can just remove the cons out
of my append and say that this is equal
to context access append to eyes then
again I have append which accounts so I
can again go and get cons out of my
append and now what I a managed to do is
I have here the left
one side of myself of the theorem of
acetate ability that I want to prove and
what I can do is that I can basically
recursively apply the theorem to
associativity and then liquid classical
or this holds because of associativity
in excess wise indeed and then if I just
push cons inside my upend I have I have
the right hand side and liquid Haskell
comes in says yes this is a valid proof
so what is interesting about this proof
is that liquid classical checks that the
information that you give me are enough
to prove what I want it also checks that
the proof is terminating so for example
if in my inductive if in my recursive
call I just assume the proof then it
will actually go and create a
termination error and say that I cannot
prove this and it doesn't check that my
proof takes care of all the cases so if
for example I just here ignored the nil
case when liquid Haskell will say ok
your proof is not complete because you
didn't care take care of everything and
okay so this is a proof of cons of
associativity of the append operator and
the only information that liquid Haskell
needs extra is I define a length on the
list and I say that out the third to
check termination of recursive functions
on list just use the length information
and here I have another interesting
example on how to use liquid Haskell as
a theorem prover but basically proves
equality of Map Reduce functions so Map
Reduce is basically a function higher
order function that takes as input a
function and an input list it takes
input list it cuts it into chunks then
in parallel it Maps its chunk with a
function and then it uses an operator
intermediate operator to reduce my
result so here I have a very basic
implementation of MapReduce that
basically
take the input and chuck in into into
chunks of size L then map my function f
into its chunk and then use an operator
o to reduce its is junk
starting from the output of F into the
empty list so reduce is basically a
fault operation that says that if my
input list is empty then just return my
basic value otherwise I apply the
operator up to the first element of the
list and whatever comes next map is the
classic Haskell map function and chunk
is just a function that takes a list and
chunk sins into elements of type of size
chunk so then I have a recursively
defined sum function that if my input
list is empty return 0 otherwise
it adds the first element to whatever
sum comes for today and I have the
operator that combines the intermediate
result is just my plus and I defined
parallelism to be a map reduced some
where my intermediate operator is plus
ok so the question that arises here is
if I can prove that actually P sum is
equal to Sean and I can prove it via
refinement ID that says that for every
chunk size n and every list eyes sum of
eyes is equal to parallel some of our
eyes with attacked eyes and and to prove
it I need a higher-order my previous
theorem that says that I can prove
equality of self Map Reduce on salmon
class if you prove me that some
satisfied writer in the DT and
distribution so you need this tool
limiter to prove equality of the prove
equivalence of MapReduce distribution
says that if you sum and concatenation
of X's and Y's this is equal to adding
some of X's and some of while and right
identity says that
if you had some of access to the same
event at least this is equal to some of
axis so we use the liquid Haskell to
prove this to intermediate limiter that
I need and then we applied this to
limiter to a higher order Map Reduce
theorem that says
that says that for every tank size and
and every function that operates on the
list and every every fault operator up
if you prove me right identity which
means that up of F of X's and F of empty
list is equal to F of X's and he proved
me also distribution of F then for every
input list I can prove you back that if
you MapReduce F using the operator or
this is equal to just applying F to eyes
so this is a higher-order theorem for
every Map Reduce function that satisfies
right identity and distribution and if
you prove that you get back equality of
the Map Reduce
operator exit full-screen okay so I saw
your demo on how you can use liquid
haskell as a fear improver and with this
yeah i can conclude that you use liquid
haskell as a theorem prover in three
steps first you use refinement pipes to
specify the theorems then you use
Haskell to prove the theorems and then
liquid Haskell math machine checks that
the proofs are actually valid proofs of
your theorems and with this I want to
thank you
so the basic comparison is that
refinement types are dependent types but
dependent types can be arbitrarily
expressive in refinement types what we
say we say that you restrict
expressiveness in basically logics that
are decidable including can interpret it
functions linearts Matic or whatever
decidable logic says something knows
about so with this you get less
expressiveness but you have the huge
benefit of you ask all the queries to
the SMT and the SMT decides
automatically so the user doesn't need
to write extra proofs and then there is
another difference and the difference is
that generally you put refinement types
on top of an existing well typed program
which means that refinement types only
let you reject programs that the basic
type system doesn't reject well we
depend the times um more to increase
expressiveness of your language rather
than reject more programs
because I mean testing is like you saw
that the user has to provide proofs so
the user has to provide proofs when you
talk about Haskell functions when you
need to unfold specific Haskell function
assumed it doesn't know anything about
the definitions of the function so the
user has to provide proofs so for me
ideally what you would do is like you
would I don't know like maybe like if
you have a lot of time and energy for me
it's better if you actually prove
whatever property you want but if you
have if you want something that just
runs and you don't have like the time or
the tools to do it you just you just
test your properties to see if they're
satisfied
yes
yes so the system only like when I
reflect the function into the logic so
in my append proof in my append proof I
say that reflect the pant into the logic
and Vince means that every time you use
append on specific argument you go and
unfold the definition of happened
exactly once
yes exactly once because then like you
could use the definition of a pen to the
logic and say do whatever you want for
this but the definition of a pendant
would be something in the lines of for
every accessorize and G's a pant of x's
and y's and x's and y's is equal to and
it will be recursive so the the logic
would need a decision procedure that
says exactly how many times don't fold
and this decision procedure could go on
and on for forever and there are some
heuristic solutions that work for that
but like we don't want to rely on on
this kind of solutions we want a type
checker that is always terminating and
it's decidable and it is predictable so
we say just every time you use a
reflective function unfold it exactly
once into the logic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
