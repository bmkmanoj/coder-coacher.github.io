being with us this late I know it's the
last session so I will try to keep it
short and as enjoyable as possible and
as enjoyable as possible it can be when
one goes back in time to the times where
one was studying right and teaching also
involves examinations and all kinds of
bad memories but we will stick to the
good part I hope so well one of the
things we have all in common here we
have very different profiles where
people from academia people from
industry people who have been working
with our long for a number of years
people who are just new to along and
really excited I wanted to learn
everything about it but we all use their
long we are all connected to our lung in
in a way and and we use it as a tool for
different things and from different
perspectives but but it is a tool to us
and it's funny how this concept of tool
is so important for humans I mean we
will most treasure this concept we well
we could apply it to a number of things
but is that concept of something
external to to one that we used to
improve things or 20 to conquer things
that are beyond our reach usually and
and we actually use this concept even to
define what we consider an intelligent
being not only ourselves and it does
something that is like a milestone in
history so we consider human or all the
the human being to become really an
intelligent being when we start using
tools and then we decided that was so
important that we apply that to other
species as well so we consider them
intelligent in the in the wall as long
as they demonstrate some ability to use
tools for for different things but then
again going back to ourselves we really
take this to the extreme and we even
have this saying that when you have a
hammer then most likely a lot of things
look like a nail and this should go a
little bit faster but it will come up
anyway so yeah
that's something that I was a little bit
afraid of happening to me when I had
this idea of using our land to teach
software architecture I was well I tried
to step back and say am I seeing
everything as an L just because I have a
hammer and and well I will try to walk
you a little bit of along the decision
the past that make me take the decision
and well of course the the outcome and
well I don't have to tell you that my
hammer was ere long of course as our
chair said I had been using iron since
2001 and it was not until later on that
I became a researcher gnarling a postdoc
in I'm not a postdoc researcher an
assistant teacher at the University of
Appolonia but I didn t turn on for a
number of years I sadly I had to teach
java and I had well I did I thought also
design patterns in relationship with
Java but trying to keep us language
agnostic as possible because as a storm
and said earlier today here in this in
this track partners are really useful
things and they help us communicate
ideas and and they help us work with
other engineers and in a way I thought
that airline could do good feeling some
of the holes that I thought there were
in the architecture were also a little
bit higher up from the design layer in
the architecture layer for software
design and I thought that really the
worst things in Ireland will help me
talk to my students and my students talk
to each other and build things on top of
the concepts that I wanted to do to
convey and to translate into them so i
will go into little right away but the
idea is so well and turban actually had
a really nice slide with the concepts
that you associate usually go with
software architecture so you want the
the students to focus on thinking what's
the semantics coherent of the system
they want to build and try to buy
certain things and try to reflect early
on
what's the ultimate goal of the system
because there are certain architectural
decisions that if you make wrong really
early on and then they're really hard to
go back on sudden it was kind of quite a
huge task but but well as i said and i
thought that Ellen could be of help and
spoiler alert yes it was a success story
and this is the this talk will be the
story of how this came to came to pass
so to get do a little bit of context
geographical context in this sense well
this is the map that you can see
nowadays in allen central above all this
it's a little bit biased because you
only been here if you read you to
restore yourself and you say i'm an hour
long group developer and i live there so
these are all people that have to
register themselves it's not not an auto
discovery system for our Langer's but
you should go there and it really helps
the community to have some statistics of
where are we in the world physically yah
graphically and well that's the church
said I am Spanish and I come from
Malaysia so that would be that yellow
bubble in the middle well in that South
corner of Europe and swimming in a
little bit yeah this blue bubble and
that's kaliesha does the region well
oops the region of Spain I come from and
that's where our university is this is
with the slow again we will get there I
guess well there we go
so you can see where i mean there's 46
million people in spain only in this
corner we were only two million people
but we have some number i mean we have a
tradition at the end our university we
have a tradition of working with our
long as I said even before i arrived in
the research group in 2001 and and we we
could say we were really early adopters
we had a mentor that he was really keen
on Iran he was in contact with people
that the erection love really early on
and well he at the time there was a
study program that had one course that
you could take it was not a compulsory a
curse but it was all on functional
programming and one of the languages
that you could learn that at that time
was a long already so that's the context
so we're still we're talking about this
same in university but I started and we
will see what's the situation now and
why did we have to face this choice of
choosing a new language for a new
frontier subject so one for the Unison
university is named after the city and
for those of you who have never heard of
the city as I said this is a small
region and the city has like 200 35
thousand fifty thousand inhabitants and
we have a small University University
has like twenty thousand students and
well just this to give you a another
view of the city and I can remove the
fog with a few data about the the place
so as I said the university is past the
size twenty thousand students and it has
now 25 well the the university has now
no I don't remember how all the
university is but there are it one it
was one of the few that had computer
science in computer science computer
science studies from the way from the
beginning and
we are building was 25 years old a few
one very recently so this is where we
are this is where we where we were our
study or where our story happens so this
will we will have to also travel to
another place in Europe and you may have
probably heard of Bologna and the
Bologna plan that has happened in Europe
recently has to do with a superior
education with a university education
and was an agreement that many European
countries came and signed and it was
meant to unify university studies all
across Europe so that it will be easier
for people to travel from one country to
the other and well and use their title
so to say to one that they were
recognized and they were they could get
jobs for the studies that they could
that they had done in an easier way and
so that will promote mobility and and
all those really nice things that are
always in the treaties and that's got
those other things and the underlying
idea I was also that although the
university has been had been
traditionally in the up front of
knowledge and development that somehow
was a little bit lacking behind so it
was like being may be out of date so it
was also an opportunity to modernize a
university and well if you listen listen
to politicians at the time it looked at
as if they wanted to well turn all
European universities into these fast
trains and then well we could jump on
them in any point on Europe and get to
any other point of course that was the
the nice picture and then there were a
number of problems because there was not
always the budget to implement all the
nice things that came with that would
have plan but well but in the end the
effect was that we had to
and to agree well know that the
countries had agreed and the
universities had to implement the new
plan so well as you can imagine everyone
the politician sign the treaty and all
the academics go and meet in circles and
decide what they have to do in some
countries they had to maintain the same
number of years in their studies so
probably updated some curses retirement
curses and implemented new ones in other
countries the wrong with some bit more
difficult because what it required
either extending or cutting down the
number of years that people had to study
and that was well that require more
effort to to come up with new study
plans so going back to our example that
meant in our case the Spanish studies we
have well I will try to use the British
terminology but it's not always an easy
translation that's one of the problems
that Bologna tried to solve so in our
case our teachers or professors had to
migrate from the old model in which we
had one degree that was 5dr year loan
that you could call the university
degree and then we also had two degrees
that were three years old that you will
probably call that bachelor degrees
right so you people could have one of
the three degrees and then join or one
much with the long run and get the
second degree later on but that was
where we were and to meet the Bologna
plan we had to change to one single
degree that had to be for academic years
long and they are apt a shin that we did
in order to work to do that this with
one with an amount of change that we
could tackle actually was to do also
upgrade ourselves to to the different
profiles that we were
having demanded by the local industry or
the spanish industry more or less and we
then ended up not having just the four
years but in the fourth gear people and
just a number of things and and so the
results is we have one degree but they
have like a specialization so to say and
that gives them special profile
professional profile so they say so the
device professors in the big room came
up with this sort of plan so this is a
representation of what the studies at
our university are nowadays so you can
see it's in Spanish but you don't have
to read it you just if you pay attention
at the colors so you see all around the
5 profiles so that's a computer science
profile a computer a software
engineering profile a system engineer
profile and IT profile and a computer
engineer so the hardware profile that's
more or less the five outcomes and then
from the core the core will be like the
inner core is the that's the first year
everyone gets the same the second bubble
is also second year everyone gets the
same and then they spread out to to fill
their profiles but in the outer ring
they saw a number of things that you
have to a number of courses that you
have to take if you want to have a
certain profile but also there's some
closeness or there's some proximity with
neighbor profiles or you can also there
some variation in your curricula that
you can feel yourself and you can jump
and and get a completely different
subject from from some other profile if
you are interested in so in this whole
picture that ring thingy is the
architecture the software architecture
course so that in itself it's supposed
to belong to the SIS to the software
engineer profile but as I said any other
student could also have it but the
people wanting to have us over in linear
profile they have to have this this
course and I could now go on
and tell you all the things that we put
in the curriculum of this of this course
but that's not the important thing of
course there are a number of concept is
it that we want to take a cross and
especially thinking that there are other
courses in which student get acquainted
with this with the more traditional
client-server singing depending in
regardless of how many layers do you
want to put on the server side that's
something that they get in touch in all
the subjects right so in this one I
wanted what we wanted to get them
familiar with other kinds of ways of
thinking about this this after structure
that we have to give to do to our
systems to differences in that do not
fall into that classical category so we
wanted them to be familiar and
experiment with distributed things and
put the piercings or leader followers
schemas or publisher and subscriber
schemas and pipeline schema saw all
kinds of things of of ways of
communicating components to to to
conform to build systems in in many
other ways not just the more as I said
the more traditional one so that was the
the purpose of we had in mind
and I need my next slide well that
that's the one of the Zurich theoretical
pulse and then we compliment so we we
get across the idea that there are many
software architectures that you can
think of as skeletons for your system
but none of them is perfect home some of
them feed certain problems better than
others but even if your architecture is
close enough to the problem that you
want to solve that will probably be a
number of things that you have to
complement that architecture with to
give it the available the availability
or the scalability or the photo and so
that adaptability that you want to get
out of your system maybe not now but
maybe in a few releases or maybe in a
future release but you want to be able
to do have and in this case a back pack
of tools in order to to go down that
path so we throw a number of tactics and
number of patterns for that as well but
as we all know you'd not only learn just
by listening and writing down notes in
insane yoke ok when I have this kind of
problem i have to remember to use this
architecture and that's it now one does
not learn that way one learns when one
faces the problem and sit down and gets
in the in your computer and then well
and do things so in this context there's
when when Allen comes into the picture
and we thought well if we want people to
go to the to the slide with the with the
whole different possibilities for Guang
given problem and we actually meant for
them to play with not only one but maybe
a few of these possibilities during a
15-week long course because it's just
half year 15 week and well if we ask
them to do that in say java SE c plus
plus well i can imagine that much of
their time they're going to spend
actually the budding why these thread is
not doing its blocking when they don't
want it to be blog or why that other
synchronous synchronized block is
causing a deadlock or something like
that right and we as a teacher we don't
want to spend our time helping students
fix that's sort of problem either we
want them to face the really nice
challenge so so how much is scalable is
a publisher subscriber schema compared
to more traditional master slave so to
say or yeah I want to do I want them to
do to try for themselves those sort of
to answer for themselves those sort of
questions not to be fighting with with
the tool I want a tool that will help
them and so that's when the idea of
airline for rapid prototyping tool for
the practical assignments came into into
the picture and well I probably don't
have to convince you that it seemed like
a good idea at the time right so they
will be able to really handle a number
of processes quite easily they will
probably be able to connect them well I
can now remember for you that one of the
subjects in the second year core is a
programming paradigm subject which is
quite broad but at least in already know
command syntax right so after a couple
of weeks getting familiar with the
Erlang syntax day they can go along
themselves and start trying things and
that was the goal we combine that with
an agile approach to the subject itself
so it seemed kind of kind of appropriate
so this is these are three third-year
students they are one year away from
going ack out in the world and they've
already heard about agile processes and
all that sort of thing but they actually
seed very little because they're they
don't want work for God for that long as
I said the course of 15 weeks long only
and they usually work in pairs so the
groups are not that big so that they
don't really have a lot of team working
problem and they of course don't talk to
real clients or that sort of thing
so we what we do instead is we take the
the subject itself as a project so it's
week of the course is an iteration and I
provide the requirements for that week
so the requirements of this week as are
as follows and you have to be familiar
with this kind of concept and we provide
usually online questionnaires so that I
have they can automatically check
O'Donnell moon autonomously check if
they have acquired the knowledge that
they are supposed to acquire that week
and for the practical part we also say
well this week you have to do this and
this and this for your assignment and
this might be like tutoring them like
really really closely but we will see
later on which kind of effect it had on
the outcome of the socket so we combined
our classical lecture sign as one will
take them with the Earl am part and an
agile approach for that we also combine
a little bit of individual work that's
mostly at the beginning when they're
getting familiar with their lines inc
tax and then run constructs and and want
things specific to the language and then
they have what we call the teamwork part
and for that we force them into big
groups and big groups in this case our
sick groups teams with six people with
small this far more than they are used
to and it creates a little bit of
tension at the beginning because they're
usually they're used to just call their
body and sit with just one person and
now they have to find at the time to get
six people together and then also to the
division of work it requires a little
bit more planning a little bit more
thinking because it's not just half and
half you do this and I do that there's
six people and they all have to do
something so that also don't have to be
interesting and then first I will let
you know a few of the things that they
themselves said after we implemented
this schema of working so one of the
first things that they said to us and we
run as
an anonymous survey at the end of the of
last year's m and a number of people
said that the the schema they helped
them it helped them do things that they
had never done before but they were more
challenging that they thought that they
could handle so they said things like we
had to do things pharma companies that
they usually do in other courses and
they also said things like this is
killing me now it's not online it's I
don't know hundra but yeah it's some
kind of weird thing with the projector I
guess well they were I was saying that
they were daring to do things more
complex and then they thought they could
do some of the quotes that will come up
they also said that they could they had
never imagined that working with such a
number of processes was not going to be
a nightmare that's something that will
come up on the slide as well and that
they found themselves sloppy at the
beginning because the functional
programming was something that they had
done just at the programming course and
I said most programming course and you
did probably some programming course
back in the day they usually learn that
syntax and usually do a few easy
assignments so yeah I implement a queue
or implement a tree and blah blah but
not really like a real world problems
all the same so that's something that
was different so in this case we were
teaching a language but for a specific
purpose and they also valued that so
that the previous one was the one with
an hour nightmare and this is one of my
favorites that comes up at the at the
end so I wish we had more time because
yeah we were sloppy at the beginning I
was saying because we we have to go back
to this functional programming stuff
that was like sort of almost forgotten
by
then at the end in the project we were
doing really cool stuff that's that was
one of the scenes that they also were
saying and they were like well as a
teacher one of the things that gives you
the one that makes you feel better is
that when the course ends that the
students actually don't want it to end I
want to do more so that was nice and one
thing I don't think I mentioned is that
the the actual pro yet they have to
propose in cells so we force them into
six people's group but they have to come
up with the idea and the architecture
and the implementation of what they want
to do so here you have some of the ideas
that that they have come up with and
they have implemented of course there's
always the number of games whenever you
leave students to do whatever they want
they there's a number of them that are
always choose to do grams they this is
desirably all distributed systems and
folder and system so they will usually
have one or a number of servers that
will either create the games or wait for
players to join in and orespawn a
specific service / for a new party store
sort of thing with a number of different
kinds of games that's also when you
determine the high possibility does
people will end up doing some kind of
messaging system we also had that but we
also had interesting things ask what
crawlers so people at the time we're
doing other courses in web searching or
that sort of thing and they won't they
use the knowledge that they were having
another course and they combine it with
the one that they were having an hour I
software architecture girls and they
implemented very nice web crawlers also
text analysis some other people will
were having this natural language
processing subjects they combine that
with some other kind of functionality
that we wanted and then this are two of
the ones that most surprised me so one
team decided to implement a set of well
do model like a harbor and the system
that work that would outlaw unload the
older
ships coming together so you think of
Frank fuchs port for example so
something like that though a lot of
cheap coming up with lots and lots of
cargo to unload and a set of cranes that
will get those cargo and unload it so
that's what the idea and they model that
and they chose an architecture and they
reason why the architecture was proper
for that and they actually did the
implementation afterwards and this
another one they were simulating like a
smart CD so with lots of sensors to
spread around the city measuring number
of cars of course the measure was made
up but they were pretending to have some
sensors measuring number of cars in the
street or number of people in a square
and then well given information about
what things about that could be improved
in the in the city so they were really
really nice ideas so it's one of the
things that that proves that if you give
people a powerful tool that will use it
for interesting and powerful stuff you
don't even have to tell them what to do
they will find cool ideas and they will
be eager to work on these kind of stops
now from the teacher with the teacher
hat on from the teacher point of view we
also have an incredible kind of results
first is that we had almost no dropouts
from the course so every person that
started the course and engage from the
beginning was able to keep on track and
this is probably not thanks to the
airline but but for to the ideal part so
from the very week you know what to do
every week and you get an evaluation
every week and that so you're given a
little bit of your effort every week so
a little as soon as you have invested a
bit they they get one more motivated to
keep investing because they have already
invested they don't have to wait under
the exam week to actually invest all
their hours in the salad and that had
that really awesome and very positive
result also we have
no really no one left behind so to say
and that's that I blame in the big
groups so perhaps in a bigger in a group
of to do you have one that really goes
ahead of the other and the other is
chasing the one that wants to get to the
goal anyhow but in there really in a
group of six you really have to have a
team effort and if you're going to
contribute in any of those ideas in a
group of six one you have to really get
at least the basics of we will of what
we are asking in the Soviet so that I'm
really positive that it helped that no
no student was left behind so to say but
not only that if you well if you're not
a little bit of how great this tribute
they usually have they have this gotta
go Gauss em shape and their that's
usually center a little bit before the
five so to say or in in the earlier one
of the co a little bit before the sea so
to say but the this and this I blame
both in the adjusting and in in having
Ireland for actually enabling them
empowering them to implement their ideas
helped us to move this this Gauss
diagram and then and so we have of
course we had a number of very good
students that got excellent marks and of
course we had a little bit lesser scores
but yeah the mean she would save the
average of the class was really really
good so it was but a long way than we
expected and was also really really nice
they also felt very positive about the
agile process about the iteration so
they really value that day at each point
during the course they knew exactly what
to do and and as I said it forced them
to keep on track not only because of the
motivation that they have and the tools
that they have to make it happen but
also to give them that sense of not
giving up
and i think i'm getting to the end so
how have fun time I'm okay thank you
no no when when this so as I said this
the first week so the question for the
camera was when these the the students
choose the project that they had to do
in this six person team so they they had
a few weeks to of individual work to get
acquainted with the syntax of our long
and then so but that time we had already
seen a number of architectures we we
hadn't seen all the patterns and all the
tactics and all the things that we can
complement the architecture with but
they already at least were able to have
an idea of what kind of problem could
shoot a certain architecture or not so
we'll to wrap up and thank you for the
question what an ended up with is seeing
myself as having a really powerful
hammer in my hand so it was not mine is
that got all smashed up but it was the
hammer that usually have me so really a
really complicated problem of course
there are number of things that are
still a little rough on the edges a
number of Steel of the students they
said that that we could skip this first
few weeks of of Earl and syntax problems
individual progress a day because of the
way at the end they wanted to have more
time to work on their projects they said
that they they wish they could start
earlier I see a little bit of problem in
changing that because I mean I need a
little bit of time to tell them the
about the different architectures before
they I can actually think of a problem
but yeah but it is true that there's
another way of getting acquainted with
engine is just diving in for the from
the very early but and a little bit
reluctant to do that maybe some of you
that may have come to know where land
just by diving into it could give a
little bit of insight on that but the
strongest point and want to make before
I finish the presentation links with
some of the comments that Katie made
yesterday at the keynote and she said
that one of the things that we could do
as a community was find new ways of
acting people to the community and I
think that's kind of one of the things
that we have managed to succeed at with
this side yet and the schema that have
we have used to to put it in practice
it's kind of a backdoor for people to
come into our land they come to this
course and of course they want to learn
about architecture and they do learn our
architecture there's no reason why don't
they cannot go into the industry and
then the concept that they have learned
they can implement in other languages as
well but their first experience has been
with their land and a storming was
saying they already have this mindset in
which they will think of the different
architectures and the different ways of
approaching problems with this model in
mind they they don't know it they may
not be able to phrase it this way but
they already think of aliens and things
think of while they make Colin they may
call them components most likely but
they are agents and their components
they are isolated they don't they share
as least as well they share very little
or nothing if possible so that's for me
that's an excellent way of getting
people into the community just by
accident so to say and a second side
effect that was totally not look not
intentional but that was really nice to
see was in relationship with that
comment that they did that they said
sloppy at the beginning because they
were going back to a different kind of
paradigm that they were not familiar
with and they were well they felt like
they were in the first year again that
helped create a very curious effect and
it was that's probably a salad for
another talk but we do have a problem
with the number of women in computer
science and we have at a university in
particular it has droppin in the last 13
years 13 years it dropped from twenty
six percent to ten percent which is
really worrying and we don't know why
this is happening and we don't really
know if it's the universities for that
were failing to attract to STEM fields
the number of women that we were able to
attack before or that is something is
happening earlier earlier on in higher
education in high school sore but we as
I said that's subject for another talk
but this the second nice side effect
that we managed is that was that because
they were all new visa again there were
times in which the leader of this thing
of were of six people would be the woman
which is something that we usually never
see in other courses that we have so you
have the six people group and they come
to your office and they so we have this
problem and blah blah and you always
have the people that speaks for the
group and that's usually well the
bravest one or the one that yeah that is
more eager to speak and it's usually a
mailed that that takes our role but
because with this new technology they
were all kind of hesitant again it will
happen that that well it to me it felt
like like the girls in this case they
felt that they had nothing to lose out
that they were in a league equally
equally level place with their with
their counterparts and they knew it and
it was really refreshing to see that but
as I said the most important thing for
me is that we managed to have this this
backdoor and well i think that i will
leave fit here and if you have any more
questions I will be happy to try and
answer them thanks
we're going to questions here dutilleux
students have some stereotypes about
along before starting for example maybe
somebody for that it's a language only
for telecommunications or it's an
Academical language he did have some not
well yeah I started a few quicker than
that not because they knew it but
because they don't they didn't know the
language at all they hadn't even heard
of it and they automatically classified
it into the box of functional
programming you know that kind of
languages that nobody uses and yeah they
were I mean at the during the first
weeks and when they struggle to
understand again recursion and then just
plain a tail recursion and then you yeah
that those are the concert and they are
like why do I have to learn this again
and why would I use this and and then
you get some comments like saying people
saying why don't we use Java with gel we
just use Java for everything why why is
this course different and but then later
on they they find their own answers and
that's that's the best way probably is
he said that a students got weekly
feedback and I would like to if you
would be great if you could say a bit
more about that and especially if how
you would be able to give individual
feedback which is done probably also
irrelevant for the grading part ok so
the feedback as I said we got it
anonymously because I we felt it would
encourage people to share more openly
what they thought about the course we
asked a number of things so we asked
directly what did you like most about
the way we had the course and what did
you like least and we'll things we you
would advise us as teachers to change
for the next course and what things you
would like to have different if you had
the curse again yeah I think you said
you would prove you provided the
students some kind of feedback they
could work on everything yes yes every
week so well so at the University was we
use this platform called Moodle you
maybe it's a well it's a widely
bread platform from University and from
all and teaching so apart from having
all kinds of resources there so they
have to slice there and they have links
to all sorts of news that happen or blog
post that I think they're interesting
that they should read every weekday also
i said like an online exam for them so
it's a typical question and multiple
choice or short text that they have to
write and that unless they have to write
something that then i have to read it's
almost automatically graded so they so
they come to the lecture and they read
the material that i live for them and
then they go online and they
automatically check if they understood
what the lesson or what the lecture of
that week was about that's their earlier
feedback so to say and then the other
feedback they got when they come to the
ditching hours and the practical
sessions as well but they also have an
final exam and they at the end when they
present the project that's does the this
sixty percent of their grade is is their
project so that's most of their work
okay we're we're actually out of time
now but thank you again very much
another applause and then remember to
