trail today so i came in here 15 years
held on this book no problem now we have
picture okay this is them the
traditional latest news from the figure
we have not had any recent releases this
time but I can tell you about the next
ball comes let's see if i can change
something on this can do the clutch next
release schedule for fifth of September
its service release or 50 me one I will
tell you about some of the things that
we will have in it but Michael more into
it if we have time one of the things we
have identifies that the recommended way
to implement the server for tcp for
example it is to use slack key once and
we found that it was not as fast as it
could be so we have done optimizations
about that and we can later on they
think i can do say for you
eps are so you don't have to resort to
other alternatives which are actually
more tricky not so beautiful in the code
now we have dialyzer a lot of things
have happened with dialyzer Costas
installers has implemented a parallel
version and hath said after the P has
optimized this equation part so now dial
s is really much faster than before and
for example for a fork or system its
gates almost linearly so you can get the
speed up of four times and if you have
four course hypothetic and even more
with slightly more memory consumption
when you have Harlem process
in SSL we are working with performance
assets which is detected by open-source
users or bottlenecks but of course we
have a lot of use contributions as usual
and bug fixes in this release point
doesn't work the keyboard footwork yes
then after or 50 the next major release
or 16 B you plan it for december or
january so at the end of the year and we
have a lot of things already in the main
road shall be going to left for example
is cold loading thing when you upgrade
in service today we have to take down
the system to one scheduler while doing
that and that could be a dramatic
decrease of capacity the same goes when
you turn on trace cutters so now we have
improved up so you can do this without
stopping schedules
and this is also an important feature
for just-in-time compilation in future
value of the yellow parts here it's a
masters in in the am to better support
multi-core many coexistence it's all
about reducing no contention and it's
also in sided it's a totally work
package in the EU project release and
Portugal it can will tell you more
details about this later dorsal
don't have some okay that's what I
mentioned about for example a key once
we have more improvements in the network
communication area think that that is
one eyewear me together with multi-core
communication is one area where we must
be really good everyone uses
communication to get it up and we had a
lot of new benchmarks so we can measure
what happens in it each release and so
yes next one is type notation will go
more together with the documentation
will use the title tation in the
documentation by the way although we are
starting with some modules in some of it
and also use here this releases built-in
functions today the built-in functions
they are known by magic in the IBM and
they are somewhat known by some mold you
telling you that it soon it in fact that
now they will be with civil in the
source code in the Mogul leg long just
like an if
under the loader will do some magic with
it a recognized okay this is a built-in
function I do nothing about so that we
can have that better wait for tools that
use the source code to find everything
they cannot find a bit of Isis test
ships they still support
cross-compilation as well the idea is
that you should be able to run the test
use on your target anyway
oh great
and we will have more about more
features regarding neat race soundly
method buy us some by Scott wasting food
shippers open and we will also implement
support for ltd empty which is similar
tracing mekinese actually made war it's
for linux be trace is not rid of the
lightness you can use it to exist on top
we have a mullet in well tool and the
ldap application which is what you will
in the previous race ssl will have more
features and more mazay shins who
support TLS 101 which is starting to be
used i don't think one of two is so
popular yet
and then more performances in protocol
implementation now between both online
mekinese and the way we used I mean for
example diabetes the graphical library
GS will finally be removed hasn't been
supporting for many years the intention
is that we x will take over and that all
graphical tools producing EGS is now
very slow and after or 16 now on the
longer term what probably doing we are
looking at Numa non-uniform memory
access systems what we do about it in
the am we are working on a jit compiler
at least prototyping it and you will
have a presentation by Frey about that
leg day really interesting i think
message passing will also be addressed
that's inside the idea also not lock
contention and things like that as a
spin-off of the release true yet we have
now guys not from the david from greece
working with preserving the sharing in
allen towards when you copy for
something message start with internal
bound also for historians
because this this is cruel to be
potential problems when you especially
when you develop tools like violence
example you can have you can get sharing
but it isn't noble and where you cockpit
and get everything well not sure anymore
then you can get an enormous amount of
memory consumption and it's not not
always easy to realize that it will be
like that the string module is heavily
needed so we will look at that we also
ongoing work right now for better
records and or dictionaries built into
the language forgetting we built in
functions
and eat I mean that goes also under the
nail hashes sometimes so we are at the
moment you're implementing Richard
O'Keefe's frame proposal phrase proposal
that is intended as a red coat professor
but very interested in this amount is
not necessarily all over the surface I
think that the tricky part with this
face is not recommended distal decide on
the same price so that everyone gets
happy
we cannot betray another the first
question we have has to have breakfast
as is besides and you suspect that
converting that house that were helped
to cover from the cops
of course there will be more many core
announcements for horses for many cores
and us richer presented in San Francisco
Los here we still have this darky
schedulers and native processes on the
agenda I you is that we can for some
file can be optimized or real victim
will help for this native processes
but this one intention we have SFTP
needs to be enhanced as well and the
Unicode things we need more support for
unicode source code for the Unicode
aptos will be unicode those work with it
eclipse plugin called al ID to base it
on a new framework on another framework
say inside clips call X text which is a
framework for building super super
letters we just described the grammar of
a system fixes all
but we already have a version that works
perfectly good as well that you can use
this is the next step and then of course
we will have more and high-quality use
contrib users even in the future and I
invite you all if you think that
something is missing on our list or that
we don't prioritize some parts that we
have a list here you are welcome to
contribute and I mean we can order you
can always take up a discussion with us
and we can agree on how out on tributo
if it's a major new feature so we are
aligned from beginning
though
yes some for found ideal some
unscientific attempt to look at what
happens at other questions what topics
are or the hot topics and they can
devote because we have bounced losers in
that area or or just because they are
popular so this was the outcome and I
looked at the six latest six months of
course you have many uncategorised
things as well but first on the dialyzer
there's a lot of questions about
dialyzer and not only the two dialyzer
with the type notation so I think we
need more and I know that cause this
agree that we will we need more and
better documentation about the type
notation and also better about how
please read the warnings you get my
dialects so we will try to address that
regarding OTP design factors us
supervisors yet servers and so there are
lot of questions and I think we will
have to do something significant to
improve the situation not not just the
documentation but design knows why it
hasn't happened much
North County years and now I think it
needs to be refreshed regarding perilous
for example we have some bottleneck
places where you are serial it could
have been better since i got the ssl and
as h creek to area with local questions
probably because it's heavily used in
their applications but also because
there are also problems and improvements
we have shifted from the openssl based
see solutions to an absolution we'll
just cook the routines i think the new
solution is much better than the old one
it's kate's things like that still needs
some more goods and we can do it will
help from you it is you will you tell us
what's what other problems instead of
maybe sometimes just saying oh it
doesn't work i use s comedies it's
really not much missing here
databases not the questions about
databases well but that is also because
there are many other database new system
hours with state relays questions in
general but we are working with some
additions to visa versa the plug-in
architecture person together with our
solutions build there's quite a lot
progresses about building things and yes
I think it could be a provable system so
that you easier can detect what you are
wrong or what kind of environment things
you are missing or dependence is
wearisome when it goes wrong usually
pipe gets the blame sometimes because
the first module compiling our Maggie's
I
the problem is that you have built the
book started correctly okay so
what
and I've saw three questions about
multicore in a category called
performance questions and it not visible
here so there was so many personal but
are now it's leaking made with maybe not
as much trouble maybe I
let's see
can you see this picture yes this is
just some I've shown a picture like this
before if visitor if it's possible to
take the visits to our about orgasmic
indication of popularity of RA in
different parts of the world you see
here that very popular in Russia and
China under places for our solutions of
the office
croco lung yes so come experience and
the San Francisco ended quite heavy in
the eastern part of us
Justin indication
but where they get unknown the
number-one positions are unknown so this
is not very accurate
okay that that was the end of my speech
you how to request house
yes
yo says that it will be good if people
write books about databases Wow and he
himself is writing about the pipe system
entire life for the next additional is
something that the salted caramel
topping the main list is the
documentation of the commercial machine
actually we have some tasks for our at
least for our goals say we we could
benefit from documenting force of it so
we have that
and
ok I think we should it can be okay
