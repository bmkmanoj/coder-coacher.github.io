what company I came from after Jane's
keynote I'm from this big loser company
but we actually have some quite good
products and I will tell you some about
one of them called the SDS and Mme we
have been developing this for almost 15
years now mainly in Gothenburg it is
part of the network for mobile broadband
so if you have an iPhone or an Android
smartphone you're using this every day
and you're not just using it a little
you're using it a lot because every IP
packet sent from your phone will go
through this sgsn node so it's really
important part of this mobile broadband
that is so big today and it's
particularly interesting because it has
airline in it it's not built entirely in
a line but the most important parts are
done entirely in now like I would say I
will try to give you an overview of this
system the outline will be something
like this I need to give you very very
short crash course in telecom networks
so you understand the role of this STS n
in the network and then I will show you
the what kind of services it provides
the overall architecture but then quite
quickly focus on airline and how we use
airline and I will try to illustrate
this with by going through a number of
areas that are very important in this
kind of a system and I will show how
airline helps in each of these areas to
make it really good I will talk about
fault tolerance quite a lot that is very
important capacity and overload I will
talk about multi-core and scalability
and finally if I have time I'll also try
to say something about large-scale
software development because if you're
maybe a couple of hundred people that
are working over ten years with a single
same product and that gives rise to a
number of challenges in itself ok so
here is one view of a mobile telephony
network we usually split it up in a
radio access network and then the core
network so we will be in the core
network that is sort of bigger than the
radio network the core is then further
divided into a circuit switched and a
packet switched core so the circuit
switched is the old one that is
old-style voice telephony it's been done
rough roughly the same way for many many
years
if you're doing a voice call on your
iPhone it's still a circuit switched
call which means that there is a kind of
work virtual circuit set up in the
network for the entire duration of the
call so it's not very efficient with
network resources so everyone wants to
move over more and more into the
packet-switched domain and that is all
about IP so applications on your phone
will send IP packets and the task of the
network is just to route the IP packets
towards the internet and you use this
for web browsing email Facebook whatever
it's quite become quite common latest
years what you maybe not are using it
for is voice over IP the telecom
operators have been quite slow in taking
this step but everyone has been talking
about it for many years but in the in
the telecom networks we are not quite
there yet but maybe soon
so the STS n is in the packet-switched
core network so we will take the bit
closer look at the network this is the
initial GSM circuit-switched Network
that was 20 years ago so there is the
mobile phone called M s a base station
BTS and a base station controller that
is the radio access network and then we
have the circuit switch core network we
wear this MSE node is the most important
if you heard the name a Exe switch
that's about the same as this MSE it's
the brain of it all so a couple of years
later they added the packet switched
port to the GSM standard and that was
called GPRS and as you can see the radio
network is the same it was just two new
nodes in the core network and GSM stands
for GPRS support node and there is one
serving and one gateway so the serving
GSM is the one that I will tell you more
about so to complete the history here we
got 3e which was only a new radio
network with higher speed lower latency
but the core network was exactly the
same
so here the STS M is actually serving to
radio access networks at the same time
because it it's kind of the same
functionality that you need independent
kill the radio type and now recently we
got the 4G LTE networks so there the
verb couple of bigger changes because
they they wanted the bandwidth to go up
quite a bit but maybe even more
importantly they wanted lower latency so
they removed one note in the radio
and then the sts and is called Mme but
it has the same kind of functionality as
the SDS and so Erickson is actually
building these two into the same node so
that's why it's called the SDS and Mme
today and now we have a node that can
serve three different radio accesses at
the same time and that is quite
important for the operators because it
means that they can have their existing
infrastructure and yes just build some
4d radio and then they're ready to do
for you okay so this is the network the
STS on is it's a bit bigger here it
means that it's the most important node
in the packet core I would say so let's
look at this node the hardware is the
most interesting of course this is the
current thing we're selling it's not
these small embedded systems that we've
said this is still big it's very big
it's a big cabinet with three magazines
in each magazine they're on board
mounted vertically each board is based
like one really powerful computer so for
most of the board's we will have recent
Intel Xeon multi-core processors lots of
memory and the all the boards are
connected on the backplane so this is
really a big computing cluster that you
can do whatever you want with there is
also a lot of special purpose hardware
of course in this kind of systems we
have switches we have special routing
hardware we use FPGAs for some
encryption algorithms and there is a
number of physical interfaces that you
need to hook into the network
everything should be fully redundant
cabling all connections power everything
must be redundant
the price of this is high don't know the
actual price really capacity before
starting to look more exactly what is no
dust I it's interesting to look at the
capacity we have been selling so this
shows all the way since release 1.0 of
STS and that was in year 2000 so it's 12
years the capacity is shown in number of
million served mobile phones at the same
time so the latest release we can serve
10 million mobile phones a single of
these cabinets so there are quite big
systems in the beginning the first
release I think the limit was 10,000 but
there was no one even near that because
no one served on their mobile phone year
2000 right and you can see this curve
here it almost matches what it has
looked like in the networks it was a
really slow start for many years but
then in 2007 something happened the
iPhone and they started this revolution
of course and people started to using
the IP the packet switched networks so
there were only some nerds with
smartphones before the iPhone then
everybody started using it and now the
networks are exploding and it's sort of
the same you see in our capacity here it
means million simultaneously attached
users so it's one of our acronyms it's
number of mobile phones really
okay so let's look a little bit more
into the note what do I mean by serve a
mobile phone we have two things we need
to provide control signaling and user
traffic so the control signaling is
between network and mobile phone it's
something that the mobile phone will do
by itself you don't see that when you
turn your mobile phone on or when you're
traveling in the in a car or on a train
and it's switching between base stations
will always send a lot of signals to the
network this we called call only
signaling and it's quite different from
the other thing that is user traffic so
the user traffic is normal IP packets
that are sent by applications on your
phone they have nothing to do with the
network they are just data that should
be forwarded to the Internet and when
the reply comebacks comes back from the
internet we should send it back to your
mobile phone so a mess here in the
pictures will always mean mobile phone
so this is directly seen by you
this we call payload so these two areas
have quite different requirements and
you can actually see that already in the
overall architecture of the system we
have a control plane that does the
signaling and we have a user plane or
play payload plane that does the payload
routing so it means that all the board
is in this cabinet or split up between
these two ports so rather they are used
as control processors or as payload
processors okay so it's the same
Hardware basically these days it used to
be different hardware but today we're
using the same hardware so we can
dynamically assign how much capacity we
need in the two holes
requirement wise we say that we have
hard real-time requirements in the use
of plane the packets that you send from
your web browser that is really
important that it just goes through the
node as quickly as possible we need to
count how many bytes you you pay you you
use because you're going to pay later
for it but it should basically be routed
as quickly as possible whereas in the
control plane we say we have soft
real-time there is still some kind of
real-time requirement but it's not that
strict at all and also the kind of code
that we write for control plane and use
the plane are quite different use a
plane or just implementing a number of
protocol stacks they can be quite
complicated but it's sort of
straightforward still to program the
user plane whereas the counter plane is
extremely complex programming because
you have to implement maybe many many
tens of thousands of standard text epr a
standard so in the control plane you
really want the high-level language and
in the use of plane you want something
that goes fast now you can already guess
that we're using air long in control
plane the entire contour plane is based
on airline and nothing in user plane is
it is airline
okay so that's the architecture I can
say also that the number of these
control processor each control processes
will run one airline instance one
airline beam and me maybe there is
between 10 and 40 of these processors in
in a typical system so it may be 40
airline nodes that sit together in a
cluster each very powerful so it's a big
parallel machine that we program in
airline
so why airline for the control plane
well I already talked about this complex
called high-level language is always
good one other reason for that is time
to market which is always important in
this business whenever there is a new
version of the standard that comes a lot
and there is some kind of new way to
build the networks we need to come out
with this support very quickly if you're
serving 10 million mobile phones at the
same time you can imagine that there
will be a lot of concurrent activities
in the system so to have a good language
support that is very good distribution
is also very good in airline we will
need to communicate between the
different control processors but also
between the control plane I use the
plane there is a lot of communication
Erlang is good but all kinds of
communication I would say next bullet
this may be the most important built in
fault tolerance that I will show you
much more about soon that is really
really important and this is where
airline really shines I would say so
forth the other things you could sort of
implement yourself in see for example
quite easily not very hard but full
tolerance software fault tolerance that
is really really hard to do yourself to
guarantee in C code that you're not
crashing memory somewhere that is really
hard and you'll get much of that for
free in Iran so it's maybe the most
important
runtime code replacement we also use
very good support in airline so I would
say that airline it is kind of the
perfect for building a robust control
plane in a system like this and you can
really imagine that this is any kind of
telecom system because this separation
into control plane I use the plane that
is not unique to the STS and in any way
there are lots of nodes in the networks
that look about the same way ok so what
do I mean by fault tolerance we talked
about ISP in service performance it's
the opposite to downtime so we really
want that this STS an enemy system it's
if it's serving 10 million mobile phones
it really must never be out of service
right we're striving against this 6/9
uptime so that means we're allowed each
node is allowed 30 seconds downtime over
one year and if you imagine that it
maybe takes 10 minutes to restore the
system like this and if you have one
restore trombonist years and on a year
then you have need to have maybe 12 STS
and/or turnest years and that is
completely stable for the entire year
because the I have received figures are
always the average over all nodes so we
normally do not quite reach six nines
but we are not far from that we are
usually at five nines or better so to
achieve that you need to do two things
hardware and software fault tolerance
most people might think that hardware
fault tolerances is the hard one I would
say that that is quite easy what you
need to handle Hardware errors you need
the way to be detect faulty hardware
some kind of monitoring
that may be hard in theory but in
practice it it's not that difficult and
now you need a way to isolate that
faulty hardware I take it out of service
and that you can also do one board seems
to not be working so well we we don't
use that board so it's it's quite
straightforward I will say the
software's of full tolerance to sort of
recover after an error in your software
that is much more hard I would say and
it's hard because you have many more
degrees of freedom it's not so obvious
what you should do if you have errors in
you in your software and you still have
to continue execute because you can
never go down one other thing to maybe
think little about it that it's not so
easy to take the software out of service
right if we take all we're out of
service we will just get a little
reduced capacity it's still ok but we
contact the software out of service
we'll try to illustrate what we mean by
this software fault tolerance we have at
the very lowest level the system
principle that one airline process
should serve each mobile phone and if
there is some kind of programming error
a bug in the software that is sort of
handling this mobile phone and one what
we want to happen is that the process
that hits the bug it should crash and
restart so we get a new one all the data
that we have stored for this mobile
phone should be removed because there
might be some bad data that we have
collected we need the MS to sort of
start it's signaling sequences from the
beginning as if it had been just turned
on the total isp effect for this will be
a short service outage for this single
mobile phone maybe a couple of
milliseconds but the most important
point is that no other mobile phones
must be affected
so here you have this again if you were
programming the mobile handling code in
C how will you guarantee that a bug in
your C code triggered by a single mobile
phone could absolutely not affect some
other mobile phone you can't really do
that in C but in Erlang you get this for
free okay yeah it's it's harder
everything that is more than free is
harder at least so if you're an Airline
programmer you you will know this of
course you use this supervision model
you have a number of work processes and
the supervisor and if you detect some
kind of error in the software you want
it to crash and then there is this exit
signal sent to the supervisor so we can
decide what kind of recovery action to
take either it restarts the worker or he
tells the next level that we have big
problems the important is that the code
should be written so it doesn't try to
handle errors it must crash otherwise
this will not work and this actually has
a name who fancy programming some people
take great pride in writing the most
defensive program the program that
absolutely never can crash but this is
not the way you should think here you
should crash as soon as you find some
strange with your input or anything in
your data that looks strange so it
doesn't really matter what kind of error
that you find in your software you
should crash because then you will get
clean up and probably it will work the
next time you try so that is not obvious
why this helps at all but I would say
that in practice this is a really really
good strategy it helps almost always
against our errors so you should think
like this if there
a software bug I program something wrong
and it's really really wrong it will
always crash then we will find that in
the very early testing right so the
systems we ship the systems where this
becomes important they have only the
really really tricky bugs left maybe
there needs to be a long signaling
history before you go into a piece of
code to make it crash so if this history
is slightly change the code will not
crash it's very unlikely bug somehow and
that is kind of why this helps sorry
yeah so yeah I'm simplifying a little so
depending on what kind of data you are
handling you need to be a bit careful
so we mustn't open up to denial of
service attacks for example so someone
can just send the corrupt packet and we
crash us every time so you have to be a
bit more careful so it depends on the
kind of code that that you're writing
but the basic idea is sort of like this
and of course in a system like this you
know you need a kind of overall strategy
how you should handle this and what we
have found is that we need very many
different ways to handle software's and
we have invented a number of different
restart levels and an escalation
hierarchy the basic idea is that when
you detect the software you should try a
very small restart first maybe yes this
mobile phone but if that doesn't help
you must do something more and that is
this escalation then you should try a
little bit bigger restart so if we find
that the single mobile phone crashes the
process for it and we just restart it
but if suddenly there are many different
mobile phones that are crashing on the
same board then you might think that it
it's not actually the MS handling code
that is faulted it's something else at
that board maybe some server processes
that everyone is trying to use is is
hanging so they don't get service and
timeout crashes then we should do a
restore that will also restart that
server process so it's a bit little big
large restart so the idea is that every
level here should kill more and more
processes it should also remove more and
more of the stored data and so we
created from scratch again and in the
system for this straight
software escalation I think we have five
levels from the single mobile phone to
the entire system one and we should
never never really reach the last one
because that means that tell me million
mobile phones are out of service for ten
minutes maybe yes
No so the supervision tree is only the
lowest level so then we have a number of
state machines that are encoding the
strategy and the strategy is actually
many more dimensions because you need to
handle combinations of software's and
hardware's
and you need to handle many errors at
the same time and maybe if we are in the
middle of a restart and then a board
fails so you get the interaction between
the hardware and the software failure
restock so it's actually quite
complicated and we have a number of
state machines specified in UML that
describe how they should work and then
they are implemented in Ireland it's
normal handwritten airline code that
does all this you should also when you
design the number of levels you have
sort of you should reason about time
versus effect because you should not do
the two big restart because then it has
two large impact on on the user's but
also rate there is no point in trying a
small restore that doesn't help many
times because because then you're just
wasting time you
not fixing the error so I would say it
takes many years to get the system that
works well here but what I what we have
today I think works really really well
if an STS are not Dalia fails and I say
to them that it was actually candidate
ought to be that introduced this bug you
think they will care
now of course not so we have to handle
all possible bugs it might be in the OTP
libraries the Erlang virtual machine or
it might be in Linux may be that we are
using and the idea is that you should
use the same biased basic recovery
mechanism so we have added a special
rule for the airline problem case that
we try to monitor the hairline beams if
they seem to be working and if we find
that one is behaving a bit strange we
will just kill off that Linux process
and start a new one and then that is
tied into this escalation and
interaction machinery the same way so
that was recovery that is really
important but I think what we have now
is quite good actually the STS n is a
very robust system and we have lots of
bugs because the the code weak program
is so complex there will always be a lot
of errors in it
so this this recovery strategies are
stressed a lot in the real systems one
other area that becoming more and more
important when the traffic in the
networks are increasing so much is
overload protection we must never stop
to respond that basically means that we
must keep the load of the CPU load of
the control plane below 100% because the
most of the load are coming from your
mobile phones means we have no real
control over the load so we cannot allow
your mobile phones to fill up
the entire cpu speed because then we
there is no room for our controlling
code to run maybe the recovery code
needs to have spare CPU cycles so we
will try to keep the load maybe at 90 or
absolutely most below 95% CPUs there
should always be a Morgan if if
something happens for example so this
you basically do by dropping some of the
signaling from your mobile phones you
should try to do it in a smart way so we
can still serve mobile phones that are
already being served by the node but we
should not maybe accept new users and
some packets are not good to drop
because they will actually increase the
load if you drop them because of
resounding sand so so this thing to drop
messages that is quite natural to do in
airline so it's really you have a number
of dispatcher processes that checks the
different kinds of load both CPU and
memory and then drop maybe drop some
messages so that's working very well but
what we cannot do is do the olp entirely
in airline because if we if we were to
let all signals into airline it would
simply die because we can get such
enormous storms of signaling in some
situations so we have to drop as close
to the source as possible and for us
this means in the router boards and in
the board with the physical interfaces
on them and that is all always in the
user plane so we have some protection
inside airline which is quite important
but maybe the most important olp in this
notice is timing use the plane this is
something that also takes many years to
get good to get the very robust node and
I would say that we have had quite a
good note for 2g and 3G but now when
we're rolling out 4G we see that there
are numb
new scenarios that we need to have
better protection so this is an active
area of development now for the LTE 4G
case this high load can really be
initiated by many different ways but I
would say that the most common one is is
from network faults if you have for
example links going up and down in the
radio network that will typically lead
to a lot of signaling when they come up
again and that will hit the STS and lot
so we have to protect against that one
other area is multi core that is very
hot topic today the theory about air
long is that you should get scalability
for free I would say that in our system
it is not for free but it is quite good
and basically this workload that we have
that the majority of CPU cycles in the
control plane are spent on processes
running your mobile phone code serving
your mobile phone that should be almost
a perfect fit because we always have
many tens of thousands of parallel
processes that are completely
independent so we can really take
advantage of many cores what we have
found is that with that we instead get a
lot of system level bottlenecks this
patchy process is one thing for example
when you build this kind of system you
always need some kind of dispatcher
processes that does some kind of
decision because before a worker
processes is launched for example so
that it will easily become bottlenecks
when you have many CPU cores the ETS
tables same thing there will be a lot of
data storage from this worker processes
that are sort of stored outside the
process for different persistency
reasons
and then you can easily get low
contention on the ETS tables for example
and other kinds of lock contention you
also easily get when you scale up
communication may not be so obvious what
I mean but it's when you get a lot of
CPU resources inside the same beam and
then we have this contour plane with a
number of airline beams if you have very
much computing power in a single beam
you maybe don't need so many to get a
very powerful node anyway and then it
becomes even more important to do try to
do communication inside one airline
instead of going over the back plane to
another airline so you have to carefully
select how you place your mobile phones
in the control plane to minimize the the
cross communication one lesson we have
learned here is that multi-core
profiling at high load is very hard and
then maybe you should say that you
shouldn't do it at high load you should
do it at low load but because of this
system level bottlenecks we have to do
it at high load because otherwise we
don't see the bottlenecks it looks can
look perfectly fine at low load and it's
not maybe even that you just need to
raise the load it can be some particular
scenario may be a lot of signaling
coming in from the MSE node then you get
one dispatcher process that gets
overloaded and that process may be
alright in many other scenarios so this
is quite hard and we work a lot with
that
we have tried to cooperate with the OTP
and that has been quite successful I
would say we have improved our code
using the internal OTP tools but one
general problem we have there is that
most of them do not work that's very
high load so yes I think they're the
tools support needs to be improved what
I wanted to illustrate this good
cooperation with OTP so this is when we
took the step to upgrade or release
branch from release 14 to 15 this
particular test is done on Intel Xeon
control processors where we use eight
Hardware threads for a line on each
board the test is a kind of traffic
generator that we have that sending
signals it's supposed to mimic a real
network roughly so the the graph is
showing our release branch maybe the
last year or so the CPU load of this
particular test so there are a lot of
functional delivery is mixed with
optimizations to this branch maybe two
deliveries every day all the year round
so there are a lot of things happening
but you need you should be just look at
the trends here and the trend is that we
were at about 30% for a long time and
then when we go when 2 or 15 we got down
to almost 20% so it's a big big
improvement and what I think helped here
was a lot of general and multi-core
scheduler improvements that they have
done we started using the Horford
machine I think you I hope you will hear
a bit more about this some later talk
today or tomorrow we started using
native function for asn.1
decoding so yes someone is very
important in 3d and info
we do that in airline and before it was
airline code only that decoder now it's
a native function so that was a big win
and finally we got the special patch
that we called no-spin it's it's about
when a scheduler has no work to do
it should not be C wait for a while to
see if something arrives it should just
release instead that sort of for us
gives more true picture of the actual
resource usage with these taken together
we really got the big CPU boost so thank
you how to be for this very good runtime
code change in a system like this life
patching is a must there will always be
lots of bugs in the systems delivered
and we have to fix the most important
ones the less disturbance the better the
basic airline support is very good and
we you use that of course but that is
far from enough you need to build an
entire system level strategy on top of
it I would say so for us we need to
upgrade the user plane also of course
which is not airline but maybe even more
important is that the strategy must be
also about operational and usability
aspects because if we have maybe like
2000 STS cents out there in the world in
commercial operation and we want to send
out the patch this install procedure of
the patch it must really be bulletproof
so it should be automatic because if
there are 2000 humans that are going to
type a lot of manual commands they will
do it wrong it's some of them you should
try to get an automatic procedure that
also includes distribution and sort of
planning for the operators and I wrote
down this lost item because it may be
not obvious if you haven't worked with
with systems like
they say if I have this patch that
corrects a couple of bugs and then I go
to an operator and say you should really
install this patch because it will make
your STS n better and then they take the
patch install it and it fails miserably
the entire system restarts
what do you think will happen next time
I come to them and say I have this patch
and you should install it because it
will make the system better no no we
remember what happened last time they
will say and then you get the situation
that you're having a lot of nodes out
there in the real world that are running
really old and buggy software that you
already have fixed the bugs but you
can't get them to upgrade and then you
that will be a big cost because you're
still doing the maintenance and support
for these products right and they will
come find bugs that you need to analyze
and after a week you find out I already
fixed this bug so it will be a big costs
so bulletproof patching is really
important I didn't say anything about
functional programming so far I only
talked about the concurrent porch and
silverware line I will say that the
functional parts are also very important
because this code were programming in
the counterpane is extremely complex and
to help the the people that are reading
the standards they shouldn't bother with
programming details we invented a lot of
abstractions and design patterns to help
them they don't need to think about
persistency of storage for example so we
have a hierarchy of storage that where
the persistency are coupled to the
resource levels so for every higher
restore we will remove more and more
data so the programmer shouldn't have to
think about that it's built into the
abstractions and you can say that this
is a kind of telecom domain-specific
language that is sort of embedded within
a line I would say that there is nothing
GP or a specific in it I think it could
be used for any kind of telecom control
plane this works very well I it's my
opinion it's hard for some programmers
to accept that
they are not in full control and
sometimes they try to break the rules
but then the maybe recovery will not
work because they store data in some way
that were not allowed so and we have to
find them and punish them ok
finally some words about this large
scale so there has been several hundred
people for almost 15 years now working
with this system not all our programmers
but in total a couple of hundred persons
constantly and it's not decreasing I
would say that it's maybe even
increasing we do more active development
now than we have ever done much because
of this 4G LTE rollout but also because
of this traffic explosion in the
networks we need bigger nodes with a
bigger capacity and more robust nodes
because if if one of these huge node
fails it it is a catastrophe so as you
can imagine with very very many
programmers in parallel we have a lot of
problems managing the source code there
are always lots of parallel activities I
think we have something like 40 or 50
parallel teams working now each on one
work package there are maybe one or two
deliveries each day to the main line so
merging and integration activities take
a lot of resources or system like this
one other interesting part is really how
should we keep good quality of very very
old code so we have code that is maybe
10 years old that is still running all
the people that understood it has left
Ericsson for many years ago so how
should you manage that
it's easier in airline because air above
air long is easier to understand I would
say there are also some fundamental
changes to like these abstractions that
are very hard to do because there are a
lot of application code
that is using the framework so the
organization is sort of constantly
working with improving the way we work
we have moved from a classical waterfall
model to cross-functional teams now we
are trying to do lean development with
the mainline and functional deliveries
in parallel I don't think we are agile I
really I don't think you can be that in
such a big organization but we are
trying to work in a more agile way so
I'm a bit late here are the conclusions
air long is more or less perfect for
this kind of counter plane I would say
airline and OTP is very good now we have
had many bugs historically we have lots
of workaround code in our code that sort
of covering up for OTP bugs that have
been fixed for five or eight years the
tools still need to be improved like
high load profiling tools I would have
wished that there were more telecom
nodes that built their counter plan in
in a line maybe that will happen not so
many so far unfortunately so the final
words are air long is fun to work with
and how long can this amazing system
continue to evolve
thank you
