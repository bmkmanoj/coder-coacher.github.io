class you notice on the slide you might
think this is a introduction slide
notice it's already content because you
can see there the name of language this
the first thing I want to tell you that
the language spoken which is capital o
capital C and animal because it used to
be called different things and people
are not clear what this used to be
called objective camel some people also
write it with a dash like that an Irish
surname but it's written like this and
now we're we're clear that the language
is spoken and my first contact with upon
programming was on University actually I
did transfer program before but in
scheme and university I go to of course
it's mandatory for secondary students
and that year it was no camera so I saw
poster when it when it came to writing a
thesis I saw a poster on the doors says
that I wanted only alive open piranhas
from a guy who became a thesis advisor
and I did my pieces enjoy and then came
to not see this a novel or something so
why there's many ways about family and
so it's basically you put your code into
modules and then you can compose them it
works like this this functionality is
called functors so you can put your code
there the signatures there and say well
this spot can be part tournament traffic
with different code from different
module for years it's faster than
average case so it's not the fastest
language it's not particularly slow
either the usual code is pretty fast you
don't have to do crazy optimizations
with making things stripped or lazy to
get optimum performance it just works
mostly design is also strict so there is
optional laziness you can add it but the
default strip I think it's easy to learn
we use it in
University for teaching we also use
other languages we use the serum
beautiful and I think the open way is
just easier for students it has makeup
and by cooking part so if you want to
develop your code you can just use the
back to compiler if you want to ship the
code you can just use that name is
compiler is pretty nice because it
supports a variety of platforms you can
compile it on Windows Windows Mac OS X
you can use an arm the neutral mix you
can even use on hard six
like the rescue pine which is pretty
nice which is something that actually
did it's also one single language so
there's no common language and most
focus in the written language there's no
once a learn language mostly no it's
it's not like oh I can add a color
extension and then things just go crazy
and semantics change it has a macro
system it works this macro system works
like this so they compile it is done
some ast and every processor urges ast
and there's some support for that
language for compressed you can ask for
your macros and it tends to have good
backwards compatibility so any code you
wrote in 1999 and 1995 should be able to
work more or less still in 2015 about to
target group step you could be coming
from Python world actually other
dynamically typed language like Ruby or
JavaScript so what does Pokemon brain
for you example something that's very
important to me is stronger correctness
assurances so I work in a software and I
don't know everything from software is
it's a compiler and I don't I haven't
written it all I just use it and when I
change something I want to know that I
haven't missed something and this back
system allows me it says when I change
something it immediately sends when I
try to compile it
this doesn't work because the you must
match the pipes already you forgot the
case it's very very useful for
refactoring what's also nice is the fast
execution you can call it America 3 9
what I really really love and what I
really miss in many many languages is
the pattern matching so you have data
types and you match on the data types
and you can ensure that you got all
cases and you can structure it pretty
nice and the community is focused on
functional programming support of
imperative programming it's not a pure
language but this paradigm is not too
popular you can if you want to you can
cheat in your functions use a for loop
or a while loop or even a use or
objective programming but nobody does so
very much so the community is mostly
focused
functional Phoenix which is for me it's
pretty good so you don't have like
terrible mishmash object-oriented
functional code which gets very company
it's very soon from one has the
perspective there's not so much the
learning curve is in my opinion much
gentler you don't go into much theory
while still learning it you can mostly
with the code that I like you bro
also this model system is pretty nice we
have module code we have the signatures
you can parameterize it some some
projects do that heavenly for example
they have additional braking system
written locally and it can be modular
eyes because you can develop your own
units and then you can just switch the
module to the native module and then
compile it down the screen that's pretty
neat another interesting thing if my
opinion is Jay spoken it just takes the
bytecode and can generate JavaScript
code from that surprisingly fast I have
seen freaky irregular asleep in an open
world by the JavaScript it's ran on mine
from 2011 and 60fps in the browser so
yes Ronnie you can have the top level or
the wrapper in your browser running so
we can you don't even need to install
cam you can just download this
javascript block executed and try it at
home
also there is hot air balloon this is a
message is overwritten okay and they
even made a online version where you can
type in your you also has been a
solution
with all running the browser also
there's another project which spin
around for a couple of years it allows
to run code on the table on the free
front and back end and you just write
everything in one file and you can share
from easily so it's like from back
development which everybody says oh
that's nice can use JavaScript for
insert in the front end and now you can
use open on the server and run to people
say yeah that's nice nice but it's
unpopular well it's now a 38 language
and github which is not right but
there's a couple of startups like issue
or I don't know maybe you heard Facebook
which uses them and their secrets they
do same thing centralization and the
tools are okay James Street they do a
Wall Street trading the Shibu has is a
game company they wrote has to find a
compiler for their own language cuts it
and yeah there's a little bit of steps
there's a repository of libraries and
specific rap contributors somewhere in
2012 and some github and everybody can
contribute the library and the growth
has been pretty good so far away from
basically zero to over people who are
contributing and you see that the growth
is continuing it's not flattening how to
get so the popularity argument there's a
number of software
beautiful camera there's three install
zero extol used to be a written Python
than the guys who wrote through
installed has some issues with
deployment of the Python Software and
she decided to look into more languages
and he picked I think Haskell camel go
and D and think in brussels metro and he
did a big shootout and then he decided
for his environment Pokemon was the best
and since that started a really nice
blog post serious of a canary to Obama
and what what his experiences with the
migration where there's also pfft and
local MacBook all three of them from
Facebook
PFF ears are analyzed data source code
flow is kind of pipe systems of
JavaScript and heck does this compiler
for their own HP like language there's
Huxley which I already mentioned another
partner the rascal planner used to be
written in a camel that you can see
homeless pretty popular for compilers
and many languages which were added in
Oakland tend to pick some features from
the language for example the option to
browse over similar to Oakland and
the language I'm working on is also very
inspired by Kumho there's concert which
is a another compiler which is formerly
clinton
promisee is this C framework for
analyzing software there's TV which is
fast Korea transformation library
services there's a lot of scientific
software there's talk which is a fear
improver and there's rank languages an
interesting thing
it's a small project but it's a tool to
make to call Java the closure code in a
class way because the the JVM has long
startup time and open doesn't so they
they offer mine Hanuman Rome wrote the
tool which just calls it faster so we
saw that there's why it's not everybody
all over it because it's a nice language
and in my opinion the most the biggest
problem is getting into it getting
started because the infrastructure used
to be rather hostile and this thing is
changing now and I want to give you some
guidance if you want to start how to do
so so in 2014
ok there was this nice book published
it's real good oh come on by three
people yar Minsky from Jane Street
capital this woman is awesome by the way
and from Cambridge and Jason Hickey was
writing a book earlier it's basically
it's the best book ever published they
would use to be books before but they
were very dry and this book is very
indeed in depth but it's also very
interesting I read it on sunny days in
the park and it's for a more experienced
developer so sunny waste your time
telling you how to set up your computer
it doesn't tell you how to install the
Meritor just goes right into the thing
where you can start programming and it
also covers a really huge range of
topics of expansion
because well if you have yeah the
learning is for me if I have issues I
want to be able to talk to someone who
can point me to the right direction I
don't want to lock myself up and then
try to figure it out I want to ask a
question and get maybe some tips there's
a number of communities out there
there's a channel where you can usually
get very very good quality answers
that's a smaller communities where you
can get good answers even for not so
smart questions there's also the
beginners mailing list which is geared
towards more beginners then there's kind
of list which is for more advanced
programmers and you can get all kinds of
even tricky academic questions answered
there there's so there's people so no I
assume we there is a number of editors
that are popular there's not much a nice
that are too popular in the language is
not boilerplate so you you're pretty
much okay with méditerranée premix
there's two modes that you can use for
vendors of syntax mode which is bundled
with the editor and there's nice piece
professor for eight years and now
lambdas training to actually need to
find assisters alright there's a plugin
for eclipse that I haven't tried it and
one very very important tool in my
opinion that just surfaced in the last
couple of months or years is Merton
learning this first party helper that
understands
of the racket code and parses the code
and it offers you a lot of features on
when working with the code in your
editor so it offers completion so we can
just say oh I'm not sure how this was
told just press tab and then just box it
does type inference so if you deep deep
deep into some bookbags and you want to
know oh this expression what is the
title then you can just press some
buttons and just displace in the type of
the thing which has been well our game
changer for me because I started to work
a huge rock base and I knew nothing of
it so I can just type check in for the
type of some expressions and I'm smarter
it also allows naming and things and
it's a particular available in vim and
Emacs and called sublime text you can
just use it from any editor which is
pretty nice so for example if you want
to know there's some huge publish and
contains operations on actual list and
if you don't know what it does you can
just ask enter well there was something
maybe so I can just press a little type
in this top man list off em and then tap
and you see there's a number of
operations on the list module and you
see they're also the signatures of these
functions so that's very useful okay so
building building code you wrote your
hope you want the link the link on socks
because you have to get the inter
project dependencies which files need to
be compiled which one depends on which
other file and you have different
projects with dependencies on some
experience projects and you need to
track that we built them for for your
project and you need to do your part in
a certain order if you want if you
change something you don't want to
rebuild everything maybe the clients can
talk to it it's too much and you need to
care about options but the used to be
quite terrible so you have these stop
and L files or your source code document
I for the interfaces which is basically
the signatures of your modules then you
have got all files for the pilots C code
you can you can compile and Link sequel
together
where and which is really useful for
interfacing with external libraries then
there is compiled of more jewels than
there's compiled native modules and
their supplies archives that there is
type information allocations done by the
compiler and it used to be terrible and
there's also this opening C compiler to
the bytecode compiler then there's the
open seat of op compiler which is the
native compiled version of the bytecode
compiler yeah and there's open up
compiler which is the native optimizing
compiler in this open up dot up compiler
which is the native recompile
native compiler and there's that which
dependencies and it's all terrible and I
works a lot already so yeah there's this
used to suck so there's some solution
for that now there's slight breeze
written down in tools written in the
last couple of year for example most
important libraries can find which kinds
packages means an open pack dairy there
the open compiler does not have a
concept of packages we have just
multiple files you have to comply the
bottle price and if you want to use them
you can specify them to the compiler
this is rather annoying so there's tool
written for it it's totally fine and you
write it in front of the compiler call
and it has an additional option which
both package where you can specify text
if you want to use for example you want
to use async then you just add my
education and include all the modules
and packages pass for the small and this
information is specified by the library
offer this is from Phi Omega and the
tool is very stylish
community everybody rises libraries now
the meta files and you can't just
install them in Houston there's another
thing Pokemon didn't use to ship with
building system before so well people
who learn the language the first thing
they do is like oh I know I write a good
system and then 3 4 5 y 6 7 8 build
system later everybody decided well this
was a terrible idea
so 312 shipped with open a built which
is a pretty nice built tool it can you
can just specify what you want to build
and be testing before rules to invoke
compiler with the tools the pictures
that you need you can also specify
attend unless for text file where you
specify which packages you need and but
and adjustment prior option if you want
to its run nice for small to medium
projects for smaller strips just one
file it just doesn't want me any
configuration and just call it and
expose a binary and it works it's not
popular but it's not a success ok fine
then we continue we have built it but
it's really annoying right you have to
first need to have this configure script
which checks if you have all libraries
that you want to that even installed
then you can specify always specify
which package which modules your package
has and which are against between them
and you have the text file where you
write
system and it's run better so if we just
had a tool that does this don't enter
Oasis Oasis is a tool which is heavily
inspired by kebab there's another file
on this for races where you can just
specify the options the license the name
of package which life needs to build
which modules are there in this library
and it can just generate all information
form you can just generate the metafile
can generate the tax file and if you
look super other build systems if you
want to use your own bull system you can
write plugin and you can bug again
there's not much food system plugins yes
but if you want to but other people
don't so you see there's a lot of
fragmentation this is how this waste but
looks like so it's just the version of
the format picture name some license
bill - that's supposed to be generated
the dependencies the pictures which you
want in this case it's HTTP library and
adjacent library and then you can
generate all the build tool and all the
craft to use for your project from all
of this so yeah now successfully wrote
your program you have build it that's
nice and I need to figure out if it even
runs correctly so there's different
kinds of testing you can do with your
program
to many many but there's like searching
based testing like this classical
genetics human tools where you just
specify some information and check
whether to result from a call is the
same as expected there's property based
testing where you specify property of
your code and then the language or the
library generates data and checks
whether the data whether you program
process the data in preserving this
property will see a moment
there's enumeration based things if you
know Haskell view from a herd of small
tract and there's also continuous
integration where you just build it on
some other machine and you you know
every comment will be maybe with
different compiler versions may be of
different configurations how they want
there's this cool Travis CI which
community project built it from range of
systems and says and test and run some
tests and it tells you this work or this
didn't work so the simplest way is unit
testing there's number of unit testing
libraries and there's all unit not to
creatively named um you see there the
first you open the module which means
you insert all the names from modules
into your namespace go back to but it's
mass per day per slice
and then you find a test to it and run
it
that's rather a bit of overhead there is
a syntax extension that you can use to
shorten it but overall other things
it's okay sir
and if you more in the property based
testing there's also another language
there's one my favorite library for this
is Q check which defines a number of
names for example m'kay test take it
takes a name you can see there in the
code rather interesting property of
Pokemon you can label arguments
arguments can have labels this one is
called name you can also have optional
arguments in the order of optional and
named arguments doesn't matter if it is
optional it just gets you in first
occupied and if you don't specify
anything it's just none then you say
okay this function that I want to test
takes a pair of small things and then in
fact function that you're testing and
well the interesting that a plus B is P
plus a and here's the code run it I find
his name in this function and then I
just run it and by says yeah indeed
after hundreds France he terming that a
plus B is actually gave us a so the
compiler is improvement nice so another
thing continuous integration the you
commit some code and something somebody
else checks it out and says well it
didn't work so dude if you say yeah it
works on my machine that's nice but
maybe you can do better and the typical
way to focus issue
we use some continuous integration
system ii do it basically any systems
but there's some interesting tools that
are already provided for Travis CI it
works like this you can you have your
coke in the club and you add a lot
Travis llamo file with the URL to the
script here you cheat around if you say
it's like see what the 3d ISM and it
just gets the script from this
repository and runs your code with a
number of Pokemon American versions so
you can know if you have changed
something that breaks in a future or
past version you immediately spotted we
can define also different compiler
options here or different packages or
you can even take the same version and
say well this dependence is optional but
let's see if it still works if I don't
install this option or decline focus
option so you test the code and
hopefully works now let's go to
distribute it okay the wrong and as
you've seen there's some there's not
much agreement in build systems so if
there's two like places which is like
aha
then we would like to have a clustering
of libraries which you can use so the
the helpful way to do that is called
Hecate and there was a idea of having
the same thing it's basically same thing
called way speedy but didn't work out
because nobody not everybody wanted to
jump on the voice train so we needed to
do something different so there's
package manager port open which stands
for compact
and it doesn't force people into using
some specific build system it's very
simple it is also nice because it
manages building comparison packages so
it's basically a DM or nvm and the
package manager combined one things you
can install a new machine three
different compilers or whatever number
of piracy want with whatever
opportunity one and the packages and
Obama will take care of switching
between these versions the package
repository is community maintained so
there's no single person who uploads
something and then he just stops and
never updates it but it's maintained you
can add pull requests if you want to
push the library your library maybe or
someone else library that you want to
have this on the system you can you can
also create a pull request
it describes the packages it says well
attest this version number this is the
place where you get far more supports
and checkouts and this is heav so you
don't get the wrong package those who
cares about dependencies of conflict so
you can say well this package works on
every system except for this old common
version or it conflicts with the solid
package which is it is trying to replace
yeah and if you want to install
something if you type in the program
install whatever and then assess
overruns and tries to get the best
configuration for you and it also
handles updating removals so if you want
to update your installation
to delete your sandbox and start a new
but you can also just type in update and
then it just downloads all packages and
updates only the ones that are necessary
to update those kinds removals so if you
remove something stop its rebuild that
is necessary and it works rather well
so here's see the number of packages yet
become acquired and last four years the
red graph is the total number of
packages they usually don't delete all
version so if you're holding an older
version you can still get it no problem
and the blue line is the number of
packages overall so it it's every single
package it is stuck there and you see
there's also some growth so from well
maybe 150 libraries to now 850 libraries
and few years it's pretty good
so if distributed account : you should
have written some documentation there's
tools for that to come shipped with the
library so you have this special this is
a comment and if it started to start it
gets picked up by a special kind of
markup language we can say well this
parameter is called part 1 it's used in
this way or that way
and it's usually is this documentation
specified in the interface files and
this tools rather old and the
documentation that generates looks kind
of holders but there's a new attempt
with akhundov which integrates with the
package manager
to generate documentation or packages
but it's not here it's coming
interesting thing is if you're looking
for a function when I'm looking for a
function closure I posts to the total
Rexach channel I need attachment does
this and then somebody tells me the name
of the function it's it's not a process
scales too well so there's way it's
photochemical scope where it can search
for your eg ice in a number of length
libraries it's kind of like Google or hi
you if you know pesto you can expect the
type in the signature is you looking for
and then it finds libraries that contain
the function that has the signature and
it's not limited to the Sun battery
installed well about top 100 open
packages installed and indexed there so
you can get your results instantly you
can also download it and install it on
your own if you want to okay so you saw
what's there but this this all this
stuff changed recently in the last two
years there were huge changes and Oh
Camilla in 2010 used to be really
terrible or common in 2015 is much
better but it doesn't stop here and we
still have a lot of catching up to do so
what is coming what still coming is
multi-threaded oh camon currently has a
kind of a global interpreter lock so you
can just run one crack at the time there
it is in words from people in Cambridge
who
to extend it it's currently this
problems of the concurrent garbage
collector but I guess it will get ironed
out in the future but you can still use
libraries that paralyze your computation
and different processes and invent works
okay if you don't want to have racks you
can also use a sync event I owe this all
you could say that it's fast and
straight whatever and there's the
lightness for that there is LED which
stands for lightweight frats and async
from James Street which all tracks a
result the same problem and here's an
example of this library it's really nice
right no jail and callbacks everywhere
and the code looks super tracker and
coming from there as wiki is pretty nice
because you see here that's another
function of transistor it takes okay
then
false ID channels this funky has has
five effect so say it's also back
service so I want to call the back
service and I won't get resolved and we
use the slack key word with the %
extension which is basically bind
operator so this can suspend and many
times some other coachman run and when
the result of their just johnson
function and service and then I can
start my execution which I start with
this endpoint function getting your URL
and then I add some headers and some
authentication information and then I
just return a JSON response so there's
no callbacks no everything's so is which
I really Envy the document people as far
they have this basically equal camera on
doc man
aesthetically platfrom l and it's a
really serious effort because Microsoft
really put some thought into its money
to put people on to it the test
integration occurs usually taking it
really seriously and the baby end users
have well et which is kind of an L with
for
JVM but one guy really ugly homepage
drag that you wrote it but this not use
very much and Scala which is well it's
not an elephant I think it's rather
difficult to use and not my cases of
making floats your boat and so there is
open Java coming up there's out
generates JVM bytecode directly so
basically an alternative compiler it's
based on the performance is faster than
the bipod and slower but still very
important I suppose change and it can
also use the JVM run climb in it can
also use threats and can also use
everything
that's pretty nice but okay the
specifics that are coming there's also
other things coming that I can't
possibly see all of them there's things
that are missing stills already for
example did Berger there is oh come on
you got it works you compile your code
to bytecode and get some instrumentation
pop and you can start it and progress
really nice because you can say okay
just do a breakpoint in one minute of
execution or you can do a brand some
functional program but you can also
travel back in time so rewind rewind
call that execution if you have that's
pretty nice but the problem is that it's
not too pleasant to use because it tends
to step often in the Sun alignment is
one of languages written in all cameras
so it shows up in the new traces and
here like in the permutation of list of
map and you're like yeah pretty sure the
baptism of queen list of map somewhere
else and it has some issues with
displaying their shared values because
it can't inspect the code unfortunately
now and the testing box so you can crash
it rather easily so I hope there's gonna
be some better debugger sometime soon
you can even print debugging of course
but also it's missing this profiling we
have some huge code and we want to know
where most of the performance goes and
there's coconut broth and jeepers
creepers
general-purpose profiler you've got two
minutes they work on bytecode and
electrical effectively but unfortunately
the granularity is too low so drop can
display you how often a function was
called but sometimes it's not
interesting or if it's called very often
but spent a little time then it's not
not interesting and you profit is just
cool the rocket just displays you all
that the number of calls and all the
time that we spent there but we come you
don't see too well for your time spent
on distress useless and also they are
very buggy so but these are minor things
and I think the language is really
interesting in its shaping up and you
got the chance to change a lot of things
you get the possibility to get into
community play some great libraries
there are some pretty Tigers coming up
and already here so this is a great
place to be right now so I encourage you
to just pick it up and get the book and
maybe rights and libraries and if you
have questions I'm happy to take any
questions
if you're the top guy everyone might ask
you something maybe some account for
quite a while and I want to ask you
first of all if you have work inherited
background before like something like
Java and if so how how long do you think
that it took you to get refined like
Apple where you were able to be much
productiveness as a small repair
languages yes I did have a backdrop
didn't asically Python or whatever else
object-oriented language you might wanna
use I don't think it's that difficult
you have to get to the control thinking
but you're not seeing me the divorce
could be post you can still fall back on
imperative programming fear like I had
my able to express this this problem as
a pole then just don't and just write a
for loop and it's it's fine you have you
can have mutable variables they're not
mutable by default but can happen and
it's fine nobody will kill you for that
there's no aunty perfect programming so
picking up well I can't say a really
tight because I had some prior
stupid question but I think it exists
the most comparable languages and
probably use that isn't it closer to
Scala no no very because from your
presentation any serious difference
between walk unless Allah wants can be
much more major all these issues that we
have to develop better building system
Dibakar profiler and so he's already
there course covered yet differences
with the prankenfest
so much in my opinion it's a much
simpler language process it's more
limited to
who doesn't try to scale up and it
doesn't try to cover all Browns that
covers the graph the function
programming drums pretty good it covers
the object-oriented ground
well kind of but doesn't try to walk
wasn't object-oriented was camera light
or special I use the same objective but
they the
unlesss combines other limit reaches
white yes the correct data types and the
sonnet library is quite useful for
writing compilers and tools like that
there's the provider the compiler itself
is written on panel so you can't just
instead be inspired by a source code
also it ships with lecture and a harder
so you got the most useful tools for
writing compilers and tools already in
your library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
