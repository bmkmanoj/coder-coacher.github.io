for being here instead of fun day or
more exciting sessions and hopefully and
so yeah and my name is Andrea Mott
norske and you can find me in twitter at
silver spoon if you want to say horrible
things to me and so so I do games that's
my day job and that's what I do all the
time I for the last 20 or so years and
before that I was an enterprise so when
I when I was telling people here mostly
they asked so what kind of games and
then I said to you play games and they
were like here last time I played games
was a long long time ago so instead of
trying to explain what i do i thought
i'll show you what i did and this is a
game i have a production so and i'm just
going to play a little bit you're
playing this guy called jira and you're
a samurai you're trying to save the
world from the underworld and that is
emerging from you me and strength to
kill everything so basically you're
fighting your own ancestral people which
is amazing isn't it and by the way in
this session I'm going to ask you a lot
of questions I will embarrass you so I
hope you do the very same because there
was I got really bored and after all
right to play games and so this is a
very very early demo very very early
alpha but as you can see there's a lot
of animation what like what's happening
here and you know animations happening
all at the same time if you have a AI
for this monster you have some effects
you have a life going and the left top
and and actually you have a way horrible
leader horribler looking version of of
it and I'm just going to leave it there
but it gives you a better idea of what
you're trying to do which is you move a
lot try not to die you're here and by
the way and you're trying to avoid this
guy you have to control you have to
control the input on these things and
you get the gist I'm sure you play the
game before so that's enough of that I
know it looks amazing
and so I'm going to get on with the
actual presentation and sorry
it's just a I'm mystical his guys called
bangert and I gave him a friendly name
that I'm not currently because it's
embarrassing and but yeah we're very
fond of him so what they're saying and
ramen or ski stuff thanks you've seen
this actually I had to I had to play the
game because it was easier than anything
else so I've been in enterprise 10 years
and I've did all kinds of applications i
think at least all the ones i thought i
wanted to do and I did the desktop I did
web I did server side I also did /
getting really bored of life and I
didn't like that and at some point that
I always I'm sure all of you do side
projects and one of the side projects
was trying to start a game and what I
found when I started trying to write
games and not and just a very very small
game but I'm slightly bigger game was
that I was pumping my head against a
very different programming way too cold
so when we know and other types of
development have done it was all very
reactive you know it was like someone
fit something and then you have to do
something about what they did so they
click on a button you do something about
that and someone requests some data you
go and fetch it from a database where in
games you have to do stuff all the time
we don't know the way I was playing
there was stuff happening there was nice
shades of stuff things been moving on
their own it doesn't happen on it on its
own which is kind of sad and the nicest
the games look the more difficult it is
so if you see a nice looking game at
they probably spent a long time crafting
that and so this dog is a little bit
about it's a bit of a runt in some ways
hopefully and but it's also a bit of a
thing about hey you know what whatever
it really does it take away I hope you
take if I can't give you anything cause
you're all amazing and really smart and
I'm really scared
if you're stupid in this conference
which is great because that's why we
come to conferences is that whatever
you're doing there's always some older
different way to do things there's
always a new part of the game
programming that you haven't tried you
should go and try it because it's really
fun and the other thing is whatever
you're doing try to learn it in depth
for example and there is a c-sharp with
a big language it's really hard to know
it well I don't think I've done all of
the C sharp and but I try so you know
whatever you're doing price what that
was my please remember this when you
leave and hopefully so anyway now some
porn stuff how about you who if you made
a game please press your hand proudly
more proudly there you go so you're in
there looking kind so what I'm going to
do is just explain a little bit how this
wonderful different programming model
works and this is a humble game loop I
remember talking about real time and so
what happens here is your initial I
stuff so and you said some state and
then you move to loading contents sounds
images other stuff that you might need
to look like models and i'm not talking
about oh hello how are you or and i'm
also not invitada and something about
like 3d models if you use them and from
then on you're in a really weird thing
to do which is say while true of Petra
Petra Petra stranger so that's what
we're going to be kind of talking about
today most of it and update you do stuff
such as input and you know in port
aransas so you know I was playing the
game and I probably pressed a good few
of those simple things in one frame have
to deal with that just you know it's not
one input it's multiple inputs do you
want to deal with all of them do you
want to remember for how long you press
that and in certain order input systems
do you want to know how much pressure
you apply to that so it's just just food
for thought on how this is not oh sure
games for schmoes
them and then you're going to draw and
draw is actually really fun because you
talk to the other processor in the
computer that most people don't really
deal with much that you view this
amazing piece of kit that most of us has
a pretty decent GPU and your Intel
integrated graphics which is kind of
nearly stunned so you're doing this and
finally you unload if you want to this
is kind of a very standard C sharp loop
and so oh yeah when you're ready when
you're rendering you talk to internal to
either of two open graphics kind of
libraries there are you either talk to
OpenGL or direct x direct backs I don't
know people pronounce it differently and
the limitation and this is that mostly
you're on whatever you do about
multithreading when you go to draw
you're gonna come back to a single
thread because you know that's the way
it works which is this affects a lot on
how you're right games because there is
a definite bottleneck so yeah that's
kind of cool so this is a screenshot
that actually comes out really well here
and from Skyrim if you haven't investor
d or 50 hours of your life and because
it's it's truly an a really amazing
experience and I think this the games is
an art form and and the key to that is
that ok I talked a little bit i gave you
a small snapshot of how technically
complex games can be and but there is an
extra layer of complexity added to this
because when i say this is an art form
and i don't mean it in a kind of
philosophical way although we can go
that way what we get drunk later on and
the thing is that there is a creative
constraint so that means in my
day-to-day job i have two guys that are
amazing artists sitting in front of me
and I have to make sure they are not
blocked but I also need to make sure
that I give them as much freedom as I
can
and think about this from a from a
testing point to feel I mean when you
run your tests what what are you what
are your conditions of satisfaction
anybody wants to volunteer something any
condition of satisfaction one please I'm
not gonna keep going to be tell me one
condition of satisfaction so in a adding
test if you are two plus two what is
your condition that's good okay there
you go so you can't talk that's amazing
so what you what you have is
deterministic in a game your condition
of satisfaction if you could write it
would be it's done right path test it's
really really hard of course you can try
to kind of have the functional test the
game runs and the game has exactly these
pixels here which is some stuff you want
to know but you know from a functional
point to feel which is how you test we
actually can't do it because you can't
evaluate oh yeah we'd right you
actually need a human which is kind of
funny and so I'm just trying to show you
how it works so some some challenges
from technological point of view this
and most games are trying to render at
60 frames a second that means you have
16 milliseconds to do all the stuff I
stopped I talked about which is it's
kind of short now and so am error
handling is different you know throwing
an exception is that even met why would
you do that you can't do anything about
it if you can the game crash and the
game doesn't brush that is the two very
binary states there okay there's some
subsystems that you can live without but
in general this is what we're done but
so and this is all quite complex systems
and they're all interrelated and which
makes them again as you can imagine more
fun and adds a lot of complexity so it's
funny to hear a lot of big guys talking
here about complexity and I'm like what
this is hilarious and
so I did this survey I I asked my game
developer friends on Twitter I don't
have that my friends are partly because
Tony 34 reply and if to reply this
really interesting 5 question
questionnaire and I said what are you
doing how big is your game so as you can
see and how big is it's like generally
small because obviously small is faster
easier and by small it could be a nap
okay and by big egg could be a true
plaguing okay so just just so we have an
idea of what we're talking about because
obviously complexities you know gross
with size and so then I was kind of
surprised and I said that this is the
interesting free programming languages
used to write games and and this really
kind of proves a point that was kind of
a lot of people think we only write C++
and actually that's kind of why I made
clear I write C sharp and any I could
have done the same with lua really but i
know c sharp better so i kind of went
for that one but you know f sharp
there's another prosperous and
actionscript haskell in a what good good
few high school and read the banana I
like that and I don't know it sounds
like sounds like fun i should probably
try and a s3 whatever and so the funny
thing that i found on this survey is
that I said first after this then I
don't have screenshot that way I said
why do you what funk what the elements
of the language do you like about C
sharp and they said it's a marsh
language okay and that's that's good
because you don't have to deal with
garbage collection but you have to be
aware of it and delegates okay that's
that's good I guess and Link they
mentioned as well and I start getting
really worried and because why would you
use link in a game so anyway I proceeded
to that sin and then c++ and
what I asked basically the same question
about C++ why do you use C++ and the
answer basically you know kind of
boiling down I actually didn't perkasie
was so slightly some answers were a bit
crude but they cannot set a
cross-platform and really good library
support which makes sense but I kind of
was sad i was expecting others this
feature and i love it i love templates
and to start a war or something but that
didn't happen and and then i said what
are languages do you use and what
features of those languages you use and
in that case the response was a lot of
dynamic languages and that was a really
pleasant surprise and and I think that
was because most of us and in game
development we do this thing where you
have scripting at the top and that's the
bit that moves a lot and so you know
some positive things some negative
things and this is my reading of this
early so I could be completely wrong so
I'm moving on to I'm moving on to
actually talking about C sharp and what
I'm gonna do just to kind of keep it
slides and then code as I'm going to go
through my slides with some code and
then go to let some actual code these
cubes that are amazing they are so good
all game development demos are all about
cubes and so anyway and delegate funks
ok if you don't know this language this
is kind of basically a call back and
it's synthetically nice and there's funk
of and you know funk of some generic
types of strongly typed this is
beautiful I think it's good it's nothing
I think if you know what this is just
use it so I kind of thought move along
but we all kind of know this now this is
contentious and I put it here thinking
and well I hope for the best and so link
link is one of the one of those features
of C sharp that I think it's nearly one
of the best i love it so I'm sure if
won't took a picture of this right now
next to me Connor garlic hey I would be
embarrassed so hopefully that won't
happen and the things like I try to
think this way when I'm writing game
developed game game code and the reason
for that is that generally linked
generates an our garbage so if the size
of whatever you're doing stuff with is
you know even bigger than say 20 maybe
50 don't forget that you're running this
on you know a lot of times every second
and get your game sometimes can't run
for hours how many times the garbage
collector is called so as a general
thing and particularly on my lower
layers of the Power Architecture and I
try to think do I really need this would
it be better if I just use a race and
you know do stuff the old school way and
then then I think oh no it's okay I can
use it and so contentious I was hoping
people with trolls tougher at this point
but that's okay probably no c sharp
developers here and some safe and I know
this is when i asked the thing about you
know the survey i asked please tell me
what do you use what are they the
features of the language you love i
really hoped that somewhere will
mentioned coroutines because it's really
good and you have you can you can
implement a very kind of cheap coroutine
a type thing with an iterator and but no
nobody said that except the guy that i
work with so that's not fair and so i
assume or one of you know what a co
routines and why they are useful for
game dev and one is because you can
suspend the execution so imagine you're
running an animation remember when i was
running on my game we had the demon
doing crazy things and cheer also doing
crazy things so those are two animations
at a particular frame they are a
particular movement series like and 30
minutes look and so you know at frame 16
he's going to be like this and the other
guy is going to be like that the last
thing you want is to keep state of
everything you're animating because
again think about all that memory you're
using and so suspending that is cool so
actually I should have used this next
slide and because this cut is stately so
you make sense also in Kings hilarious
look it's partnered everything and so
and so how do you do this some code
because we all get bored without it and
it's quite simple you define a
collection I'm sorry an ayah numerator
and so when in your update loop your
core move next you can call current
which is a kind of read thing anytime
you want and it will only move to the
next step on move next I'll show you a
demo so this is more like this is kind
of how it works and then I show you how
it actually works and then in the actual
and how to move on in this case you're
going to change position of a cube
you're just doing this which is creating
a rotation you know when I was telling
you about mats and how we actually use
them all the time I wasn't like my trick
specters or so smart currently and so
when you have to return a value you just
yield return true you could return any
our values what you can't do is pass
parameters which sometimes is annoying
and also you can give return in a
multiple prices and if you want and if
you want to break you just actually your
break and many questions because
everybody's to get really excited about
this I don't know why and so what is an
iterator and iÃ­d compile the code I was
because I thought it was interesting and
our people also thought it was
interesting a few years ago when it came
out and I and so I put it here it's the
oh it's a simple state machine and
that's I think that's good and it's also
good to kind of reach rue this stuff
when you're using it a lot just to know
that you're not crazy and
okay I said that already so this this
was coroutines this was the lightweight
part of the talk and now we're going to
move to the but the bits that make my
head hurts and and that was that was
kind of cool so remember I was talking
about the update and the render so there
was this this really really smart dude
called karmic drunk karma I'm sure you
know him he kind of wrote an article who
doesn't know John karma cuz I'm gonna do
it that way oh okay that's good what's
so Jung karma basically a id Software he
wrote doom which is kind of the first
first person shooter and game and he got
famous and now he's working in oculus
rift and I think he's a genius so um
anyway and the keys normally a genius
was also kind of nice in that he
released a lot of open source code and
what I've done is I brought his double
buffer implementing in C or C++ I can
remember and it's not super stressed and
I port it over to c sharp for your
viewing pleasure and so what is double
buffer and basically two treads and and
well one is rendering the other one is
kind of filling up up offer with render
commands what are under commands
anything you need to render in the code
you're gonna season is just a bunch of
cubes with information about how you run
your cute and so you fill this up once
you're done you swap buffers and there
is nothing terribly complex except how
to sync so you know this in c-sharp is
going to obviously be very stateful that
also means you can up royally can I
say up what I just did and so
thinking happen at very specific times
and namely when you end when you ain't
and also one yard so here I'm kind of
doing this beautiful representation any
love squares they are so nice and define
and so the idea is that you see the
different scenario center sometimes
ignore scenario so the first one was you
create the pile up the rental commands
once you're done you swap in this case
you draw but you finish before this is
done so the render track will wait for
you once you're done you do this and
then finally there always comes when you
do the opposite you're taking longer to
render than to update and it's a it's
very easy to make mistakes and and this
implemented in c-sharp is not long but
you can make mistakes / easily and the
way you do that is M you're looping here
in the world obviously you have the two
threats and and you add the cubes when
you're done you and the frame you think
and on the other side of this you have
the you swap the buffers and you loop on
drawing see the way this is sticky so
you know and why would you go through
this amount of you know why would you do
that implementation because we have
multiple cores I was hoping again I
don't know I am I imagine the stocks
also different I hope they'd the bigger
a little bit better than I hope anyway
so why wouldn't you go through this
really hard work of implementing that
because synchronizing stuff is painful
and why would I not just do a nice
immutable thing that all talks to each
other and there's hugs and our rainbows
and ponies I don't even have ponies in
my slides it's terrible and and the
reason is that you actually even with
this real alien a world implementation
from karmic you get really good and
performance and you know what games are
about performance inaudible ponies
although some games have ponies and so
what you do I promise you to a game
about ponies see and so what you do
instead is use concurrent cute
collections and see I like cuts instead
of ponies I'm sorry and so all you're
doing is instead of synchronous really
hypnotizing it's great to see you guys
doing this and so instead of em writing
the synchronization cult you let the the
concurrent collection do the tough job
and you do that but it's really simple i
show you in the code it's like even if
you don't write C sharp you could
understand why would you too soon you
play with performance there because the
threads when you're using these
collections are are really waiting and
so I kind of did the analysis while I
was explaining this and so the
comparison this is the depth of the
tough numbers and under buffer here the
tread is sleeping so i can use the
processor for anything else I want this
is the other one and I tried with
different kinds of collections which is
kind of sad I expected better actually
this I should probably like this it
becomes better as I'm going but it's
it's not very good and still it better
than using just one tribe but and not
great so what I'm going to do now is
show you some code so you stay awake
because it's really warm so it's so warm
when you're talking
okay so i'm going to show you this
iterator code and it's quite simple and
again please ask questions because i
don't know how much on you know not
understanding this is totally cool you
know i won't think you're stupid or
anything I actually think you're really
smart if your question if you're asked
questions to pro your genius just saying
yeah and so i'll come back to Berlin
we're in the world in game you know sir
I'm using X and I because it's easy to
demo with ourselves who are using on our
engine called duality which is open
source and really nice and so in this
game this is how you write a game in XNA
and I will create a world can you see
that with the size of the screen yeah
and I yeah I updated I created when I
create a new world I have a renderer and
i initialize it and this is the
interesting parts so i have three
enumerators right and i have one that
will actually coordinate the or two just
for the croc and and i put different
types just to show you that you can use
different types and if you don't use a
generic type it won't work so and just
saying in case you're going off to write
this immediately and so when we're
initializing i define this which all
it's doing is move next and and then
when i define this change position for
example and I kind of call a method just
to make it actually separate it and
we're doing this while true for each
primitive freak rotating now the color
one is more interesting because and can
anybody tell me what will happen just
just so guys I check for your being
awake there's two things that will
happen at the times are this is time in
milliseconds
okay cool and you nearly had it you had
a thought there how much that would be
cool and then that's good and then after
five seconds I'll stop I just say no
more changing color this was have an
awesome party wear cargo and so how it
looks for for an amazing-looking demo oh
so change color rotates moves around and
then it stops it does what it should do
the funny thing is like co routines are
actually quite useful in not only game
development so you know Terry though so
let's one them out of the way now you
learn how to the routines really cheaply
in c-sharp however if you wanted there
is a really good co-written and library
called flow and it says also it's
basically using this concept but taking
it a little step further and has
features and kernels and sexually quite
good and easy it depends only in c-sharp
too so check it out if you're interested
I was going to show put it in see the
point and so the next one is this double
go for implementing and no I should
prolly sorry
so
this is this is where you know unless
you used to concurrency this is painful
okay and and yeah i don't know i don't i
don't want to inflict pain but it just
happens so we have x two lists of render
commands this is the interesting ones at
this point and this is remember the two
diagrams we had the red one and the blue
one so this is kind of filling up the
red one okay so you're you're just going
to add a bunch of cubes to buffer
Brendan come and say when it's ready is
going to give it to their render and
throw it and meanwhile you're going to
keep filling be at the same time nice
which a context to your sinking brain
and you're going to have these three
lines of you know three manual reset
events and you need tree thinking things
because that's the way we do second
maybe after widows and so what happens
is when you're adding a cube there is no
sinking which is good because you don't
want that because otherwise it will
block all the time however when you're
done your do this bit of sinking so
you're saying I haven't completed render
it and my commands are ready and and I
don't know if I'm ready or like I'm
definitely i'm not sure if I'm ready to
I am to render or not so it's nice to
have the code organized this way because
after and frame in your brain you kind
of generally go here which is broke as
you finish pulling all the stuff and
you're kind of probably want to run or
something and you're going to come here
and you're going to say and it kind of
opened the door for the render active
say that you haven't completed this and
wait for random comments because you're
saying this is kind of what stopping you
from starting to to add more running
commands here you swap the buffers
remember we had that bit where you
stopped the buffers after you fill this
up so this happened just
for drawing and once you've done that
you say okay now I can go and render
stuff and off you go render happily and
Mary and this is what this stuff is here
because just after you render you know
in the context of how this can happen
don't forget these two threads can be on
different parts of in sections of the
code at different times and explaining
this after like an ant try to explain
this in different millions of ways and
it's always confusing I always feel like
I'm leaving something out and the reason
for that after thinking about it why is
this so hard to explain concisely it's
because it's just a complex problem and
hopefully we shouldn't need to do this
but we do so it's just better to leave
it as tight as possible that that's my
analysis I I hope someone tells me wrong
or something now compare this with that
fire truck or Al Andalus goodbye sorry I
have to let that go it's as pointless so
so that's kind of complex and obviously
I'm showing it here it's like yeah sure
it's done that's great but it's kind of
hard to write if you have to write it on
your own and in game development this is
actually funnier because here we're an
open community we talk about stuff we
you know if I have promised they go like
you how do I solve this do you know and
you'll be like well I don't know I did
this maybe we'll try to help in game
development in person PS people are like
that but it's rare that there is shared
code in places and I find that a little
bit frustrating and I hope that we can
change that I'm talking to you as if you
were like game developers and I hope you
are and if you're not you should be this
is great it's really fun but it's also
really hard and blah blah but so anyway
compare this to this our solution when I
used to concurrent you so basically what
I have here is instead of two buffers I
have a concurrent queue of render
commands so they wait to think of this
is that
every item on the queue which in this
case is going to be limited to two and
that's the key for why this is normal
resolution and so every every item in
the queue is what you're going to render
so it's a whole frame okay so you have
the whole frame ready in one one of
these items of the kid just keep that in
mind so what you do is okay I'll just
highlight it soon easier to see and yet
your new it up and once you end the
frame you have the same scenario exactly
the same once you end the frame you say
and cue this and when we were growing
you're trying to lick you this and and
then you're off and drawing I kind of
I'm feeling like it's kind of
self-explanatory see if I'm leaving
stuff out please shout and this is the
key of why I wish there was a bar
solution that there might be one but it
will make the solution as complicated as
before and you're limited this to count
it because we're doing double buffer so
at the same time this still gives you a
win on on it's not doing what I want so
okay the reason why we're limiting this
tattoo is so the double buffer em and
you are just starting to instead of
millions which could happen because
again you have two tracks if you let
this go wild you've probably run the
update look like I don't know hundreds
of times and so you don't do what you
should do in the in the in the drop you
just brought something random which it
would be terrible and so this is what
you produce actually trying to render
this without and the two threads or the
my machine would complain they will go
into some sort of and so that's nice and
you know man smooth and so yeah that's
that's interesting and some some other
and cope actually should move back to
this
interesting okay
sorry about this this is why I bunch up
all the demos in one and I just finish
off this
yeah it's actually on github there's a
library i'm andrea on github and and my
this library is called see 4g so it's c
sharp four games and which so so yeah
please say have a look and let me know
what you think or if you want to you
know anything tainted play wouldn't
transform it to F sharp and no problem
and i actually took up punches right off
which I kind of regret because I had no
idea how this will flow and many
questions please again if you ask a
questions to your genius amanda is a
genius I don't know that no okay and so
I actually blogged about this
concurrency stuff in my blog Brown
crisis calm and it's cold like that
because they had a band okay stupid just
get over and my company they were
working through that game and that I
showed you it's called biking games but
we also run their digital furnace but
pocket games is the one that most people
know me from it's a really cool cut as
you know I like cuts and I actually
compiled a bunch of references in case
you want to go deeper in this bundle
which is actually gonna hurt easy to
remember bundles bit ly will you come
home on those round prices and the
number tree so you should go and check
it out and also please give up to me if
there's more things i should add and I
don't know since you're not going to ask
questions I stick around for a little
while and thank you so much for for
being here
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
