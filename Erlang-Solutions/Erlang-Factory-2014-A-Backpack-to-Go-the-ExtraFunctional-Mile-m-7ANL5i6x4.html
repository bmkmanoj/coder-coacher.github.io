you for sticking around i know i'm
sending between you and the next coffee
break so i will try to make this as
enjoyable as i as i can so when I was
preparing the slice for this talk I
wanted to find like a nice analogy to
help well get the message across I was
thinking about well how probably most of
us have gone to a field trip at some
point in turn and we we probably put
well depending on the bottom more or
less thought on the things that we take
with us of course there's nothing in the
backpack that we carry that will make us
love the sight seeing more or well
actually decide where to go but it is
important when we take with us because
if your backpack is too heavy you're
probably not going to go a long way and
if you don't have the things with you
that you find that you later on need you
probably not get much further away
either so it is important what we take
with us so today I'm going to show you
and talk to you about a few tools that
we have been developing in in a research
project called prowess that I will hope
that you decided if you want or not to
take with you in your next in your next
trip in sr software development trip so
to say so apart from the excursion
analogy so to say I also chose for the
title this extra functional mind that
relates what's with Richard was saying
before about all those things that are
not probably the core of software
development project but do also
influence how well we reach to our goal
and well in in many many senses we
usually refer to those as extra
requirements as actual functional things
so for this particular talk when I use
this extra graphics in the sentences I
I'm referring to things like performance
or but also the things that actually
help us improve our work improve the way
we can test things or improve the way we
can implement things it's actually
anything that you can use or they will
help you get from this situation we are
everyday struggling and trying to to get
to well that Mike was saying the keynote
maybe we're not really sure what you we
want to go but we we are struggling to
get there and maybe we change the our
minds in the process and decide we want
to go somewhere else but we want things
that will help us along that way not not
get in the middle so we want to get from
something like this from the daily
struggle do something like this right
let's does our goal so maybe some of the
things that i will show you today will
help you in this in this transition so
the same and as also Mike was saying the
keynote well there are a number of
institutions and people demonstrating
through the years that it's not only
about the goals and the requirements
it's also it's the success of the
development projects that we all face
have a very type number of relationships
with things that we cannot really
quantify so we we may think we have the
feeling that if our breath is going to
be subjected to a lot of change that is
a risk in itself well I want you to not
to have that impression I want you to
know that that is a fact and we know
that for a fact we should know that for
a fact another aspect when a number of
us with that fit in this is a
description is it can be the number of
changes that we aren't going to make
either because we don't know the
requirements for sure and they change or
just because that's the ways of where is
most of the times or you can also be
related to things that we not always
identify as requirements but sometimes
we do and for this we have a number of
them I've mentioned their performance
which is probably one of them things
that worry us as a community the most
and we also we have the feeling that
performance is important and I will that
projects can fail if they don't meet
their performance requirements but again
I don't want you to
feel that you sort of know that I want
you to be sure that that is a fact and
we know that for a fact this there's no
excuses in anymore nowadays we don't we
don't get to pretend that that can be
the case we know that it's the case we
don't either get to pretend that we
don't know what the solution is so we
actually also know for a fact that the
only thing that can help us lead with
change or lead with non functional
requirements such as performance
requirements or the two together the
changes that we will suffer in our
separate development projects that have
to do with non functional requirements
or the changes in performance
requirements it changes and reliability
performance and reliability requirements
and such that we don't know how to cope
with with those the only way we can cope
with those is is by testing and we
should also know that for a fact and we
should also know that for a fact that
the sooner we start testing the easier
it would well it will get of course we
cannot wear indeed a success but we can
guarantee the failure if we don't do it
so so well we probably all I hope that
some of you at least are right now
thinking well tell me something I don't
know right so yeah yeah we know we have
to test and we know we have to test as
soon as possible so yeah what are you
here to tell us about that can help us
with that but we can get each and every
one of us we can have different
approaches to our development projects
so eternally each and every one of us
are we are engineers and we have our own
style so to say so I would probably tell
you well you should start thinking about
this and this and some other engineer
will tell you yeah well for me it works
better if I would if I do things in this
way and this other way so we have our
styles we we're not going to discuss who
of us is better than the others right
but we all have something in common and
it is actually that thing that we
haven't gone that can make make a
difference in our mission so to say and
the thing that can make the difference
is actually not who we are but the
gadgets that we
use and that's where this track is about
who won cool tools and gadgets and the
rest of the talk will also provide you
with some gadgets that you as your
airline secret aliens will have to
wisely decide how to use so at the end
of the talk I will hope that in your own
personal airline backpack you will have
at least some ideas of new things that
you can try that will hopefully help you
improve your development daily life so
before I proceed with some demos and
showing you some of these tools where
all these tools have in common is as I
mentioned earlier they've been developed
as part of this research project it's
been going on for home a few months over
a year now it will carry on more than a
year and a half so we will hopefully
still the deliver more things in the in
the months to come but so far well it's
a number of countries involved in a
number of probably well known people to
you already that have been involved in
the development of these tools that i
will be showing you here today the last
for the acknowledgments part and now for
the fun part so first thing i want to
show you it's a very simple tool very
powerful tool also called smother so
what does smother do well very simple
thing that's code coverage it's probably
not really impressive probably most of
you know some other tools that do that
we'll probably be thinking okay what
about cover hang and I'll cover you
probably use cover we can also discuss
how useful code coverage is as a measure
but the thing is that if you're already
using cover why would you consider using
this mother instead well for those of
you who use cover you know that well
what it does is well you cover compile
your code and you execute your tests and
then
and it will help you analyze which of
the executable lines are have been
touched in that execution right and
there's a particular definition of what
an executable line of code is for cover
and I won't get into much detail about
that but cover but its mother presents
an alternative to that and attentive is
that was smaller rather than focusing on
their own what an executable line of
code is and and accounting when you go
through them it focuses not as I say not
on what you execute but on the decisions
that make you finally executing a line
of code so it implements what is called
mcdc coverage how is that different what
different it's different because I said
it focuses not only in just accounting
the line that you go through but how you
get to red line so well that's a number
what is a definition an academic
definition I won't bother you with that
most of the tools i will be talking
about their papers that having published
or papers that are in the making so i
won't though into the academic details
of say but the fact is that we will now
see and our simple simple example where
we can tell the difference between what
cover shows and what smaller shows
instead you can do that fine and then so
is that big enough for you to see okay
so that's a really really simple example
i have chosen here it's borrow from the
Francesco's an assignment on some books
book a girl on my example it's if you've
read the book there's a line exercise
exercise at at some point that asks you
to implement a really simple database
like module with one your create the
database server destroyed and they can
write and delete and be them what that's
so this is what a simple implementation
based on the use of lists who could look
like not really interesting what I'm
really interested here is
in but you could develop that and then
you could have your tests either using
unit and you will probably have a number
of scenarios and each scenario will try
to test some of the features that we
have implemented there and then before
executing the script what you would do
with cover is that you will cover
compile your module right you will run
your tests and run in there this could
be just a unit testing your module or if
you have a property based testing should
should we could also run that we will
also see an example of that but the
thing is that you you cover compiler
module you run the tests and then you
have something for yourself like
otherwise to file and you can export
that to an HTML format and with the
smaller do you will do exactly the very
parallel thing you will smell the
compiler module you will also test so
run the unit tests or run your
properties and then you will also
analyze the file and smaller directly
outputs the file there they are output
the output as an HTML file so we could
run that on the DB module and of course
I will also need to compile first older
modules so we could run the tests so we
will run them first for cover and then
force mother and then we have this HTML
file so one for cover and one first
model and the difference well those of
you who have seen this sort of output
you're familiar with the 80 it will come
so these are the executable lines for
for cover and those who have not been
hit but they are in red so the the way
you will work is that you will know now
go back to your unit testing and add
some few more days so that you can hit
those lines but it is all your own
responsibility to know or to guess and
this is an easy example so you will have
to say well to decide to
expect the rest of the goal and decide
how can I hit this lamp or hard can i
hit this other line and as i say it can
be easy or cannot be that easy right so
with smoother we have a slightly
different approach so as I as you can
see this you're not saying which lines
you hit you're saying or smaller saying
which wich what in with with you in
which way you enter that line of code
that you end up executing and when
you're when you have hit a part on this
one it has this color code so when
there's something like this but there's
a number of ways you can hit that
condition it will provide a terrible
like summary of the ways you could enter
that pattern so that you not only can
know how to hit this line but also the
different combinations of conditions or
branches in that decision that you can
exercise to actually enter in that path
so that's something that one that's
where the difference between the two
tools relies all right so it's
yeah yeah so see this is the cover and
then you see that you well there were
actually no tests for the delete
function and this case they were not
either I mean it was the same subset so
we can run there was another so the the
red means that the pattern has not been
exercise exercise in a way the green
means that it has being exercised in all
the possible combinations so if it's an
aunt or an all you have tried that one
operand is true and the other and the
combination of the two and the yellow is
that you have exercised that decision
but not in all possible combinations and
that's when you when it's actually
useful to come and see in which way you
actually went through that the branch
and which other cases are not it's
actually not only a matter of half I
reach that part of the code or not it's
actually useful we find that it's useful
to identifying that code because
sometimes i do actually reach that but
i'm not reaching that in all possible
ways and in the decision and actually
means that part of that decision so the
decision is too complex so i don't
actually need a part of that of that
pattern or something like that that's
also the case sometimes I was not yeah I
had also here an example with proper
speed machine in this case but it will
it will event it will have the same
result so i won't i won't go much into
that so well that's that's a very brief
impression of what smaller though and
thus there's also a tutorial on you do
with a 12-minute video with a longer
example that you can check I think the
they are collecting the slides and if
not i will upload in at the end of the
dog showed you can click on that link
instead of copying and writing down a
URL you can use the tool okay so
it stills been improved but it's already
usable and we also have a user service
so if you're some kind as to try the
smaller please go and feeling the survey
will be really really helpful as well
and that's the address that you can
point to if you want to try it as I said
this will be online afterwards so that's
for the smaller next tool I wanted to
talk to you about this Jason Jen what
does it do is well as pretty
straighforward from the name it will
generate for you a number of Jason
instances if you provide a JSON schema
and probably you're a senior I ever
again I've seen this a number of times
if you google for that the other number
what sites that if you set an example of
you write a JSON schema they will
provide well they will generate the text
and you can copy and paste or you can
download a text file with that example
or even a sip five with a number of
sample but it's kind of getting in the
way right we would like to have that
embedded in our Ireland tests so that's
one of the things that you can do with
Jason gem because it's written in Erlang
but it also it is more powerful than
other to the do you might have used
before because it's also it's using
quick check on the on the background to
actually generate the the JSON data so
what it's it's efficient and it has
syncing capabilities well again we
probably want to see a demon that's more
exciting so in this case I've selected
one of the and the the more examples in
the in the Jason Jen github page but
what this is one of the diesel schemas
that you could have if you want to
generate JSON objects that represent
people in this case Persians and we
there are a number of properties that
the people can have and we require at
least we have a name and the exam grades
and also some other property because we
at least want to know three things about
a person and then we have a number of
properties there
which are described using constraints
for the length constraints were
depending on on the kind of all that the
type of the of the property even things
like patterns and such so you have
something like that you will be able to
use JSON gin and you will have to read
your file that will create it uses mochi
moochies what you want to I think yeah
that's thank you in the background so
that's dependency and it will create
this schema this is our big schema and
then you will have you will be able to
turn that schema into a generator into a
quick check generator using this module
unfunctional and then that generator you
use as any other you put together and I
generator that you are usually use for
instance you can pick the generator you
can sample the generator and then
there's also a validation capability in
JSON gensou provided that they have a
sample value that you may have generated
with the generator or you might have got
from some other source maybe some other
part of your application built that
obvious then you can validate a given
value against that schema that you just
read so we could execute this and see a
few examples so see this this person
here and we have the name and we have
the exam rate and we also have remember
we have at least three properties and it
will since we said at least three
properties but many other properties it
will also invent new properties because
you could actually if you have a web
service except indigestion you can have
a number of other fields there that the
and this would also have to be valid
against well it is valid I couldn't do
that JSON schema so will produce it
smartly produce complex and well a
variety of conditions for your JSON data
that you can later on use for testing
purposes
or for any other purpose that you can
think of so again you can use the song
again Jen starting now it's a little bit
more working progress than smaller was
so bit kind and that's the URL that you
can get Jason gem from next tool i want
to mention is called level us to get i
don't think i mentioned that before but
the prowess pro yet it not only about
testing is testing on the wall on the
field of web services so we pay special
attention to the problems that are in
here and do the development of web
services and that's what this WS to get
is meant for so to assist assist people
that want to use property based testing
and are developing web services and you
might think so ok that's ok what's
special about web services well we were
thinking about helping people that well
they already have probably a WS
description of a given web service
because that's the file that they used
to exchange information with
third-parties or with clients and they
need to build models or build properties
for the services that implement the
functionalities describing those wsdl
documents or else you might have a rest
api for your web service and then you
again you want to test again against
that rest api and you have to write
properties for right models that
represent the behavior that rest api and
on top of that either of those options
are in a particular domain where things
change a lot so web services are
spreadable particularly all victims of
that continuous change so yeah it's
difficult enough to write properties and
models for web services in either flavor
but if those models once you've written
and then they have to change well it's
not immediately it takes one awhile to
get used to it and and well every time
you change your property or change your
your state machine you can what you can
make mistakes so you want to help as
much as we can in that
in that sense with this toolkit so what
does this to get do or what will it do
well it will first of all generate your
model your test model skeletons so I
wouldn't show you now a few files and to
see what that means so that well we want
to the developer to focus on exactly the
behavior know there are a lot of things
that we can automate on getting a test
model out of a WS deck document or out
of actually interacting with with a rest
api so those are the first steps and
then if you want to fine tune your model
one of the things that takes more more
time is actually to fine tune your data
generator and if you return a generator
if your data is described enough wsdl
document well let's assume that you can
write wsdl so we have added to the ws to
get a set of generator a set of data
generators that you can write in a wsdl
like flavor so you can use the same
constraints that you will directly write
in a WS document you can copy those and
paste them and it will look like a quick
check or a proper generator and it will
provide efficient data generation for
those kind of data structures that you
usually use as I say in a wsdl document
and then on top of that so once you've
used the tool to create all of this it
will also lead with the changes ok so
the toolkit will provided you have a
wsdl version and then the updated wsdl
it would be able to update the model
behind also the properties behind so you
don't have to do all the updates
manually so in this case I won't show
you the live demo but I will show you
how the fines will look like so this is
her actually an example that we have
taken from one of our industrial
partners and it's so it's a real example
so to say so they have this wsdl
document that describes one of their web
services and they have number of
operations with the documents of the
documentation and their input type and
their output types
so that's one but the regular wsdl
document looks like and then they have
their excess d document what they
actually describe what the input data
looks like so and their constraints and
and what the output data has to look
like and again so that's what they
already have so using the wsdl took it
with these two files the wsdl with the
operations and then and the excess d
with the data definitions w as to get
produces first this a long module that
creates all the boilerplate code to
actually test against that which is well
extracts all the functions that are
present in wsdl and creates as i said
all the barley prayed to actually
interact with that web service so that's
like I said that's something that you
will have to write you don't have to
write anymore it's what it's quite a
number of work that you save and then
also as that's to communicate with the
web service but then of course what we
also want to generate and that ws Neal
took it generates is the state machine
that will well implement that the tests
for the test model for that and web
service so we have the general property
that you might be familiar with if you
use property based testing already and
then there's a number one of functions
that we expect to have the initial state
and the commands and those are usually
generated out of the box also from the
wsdl and from the access the file with
the generators taking the names of the
of them parameters and such and of
course what is left for the for the
developers at the moment we're working
on ways of extracting that is the the
semantic information so you will have to
actually implement the post conditions
and implement the preconditions as
something that we still can
do for you but all the other things are
are generated for you so we we save
quite an amount of work so to say this
one say you are less in the other cases
yeah we still don one don't feel as
confident in the other two a sample size
to say just go ahead and use it of
course you can do it first make sure
that you run the example you really
understand what what you're doing but
yeah as that's it will improve keep
improving we just quit a number of
things I still want to do with this with
this tool another thing changing
completely the scope in this call in
this case is called vid spec respec it
will instead of generating properties or
test models as value just took it it's
meant to to do here we will take your
properties or will take your test models
and we'll turn it in something that
people can read and when we say people
we saying we mean non-technical people
or not so technical people ok so the
managers that as micro same this morning
so okay human readable versions of the
desktop edition models and what do
exactly mean when we say readable I mean
we actually mean koo kumba like and if
you know about Comber you already know
what I'm talking about if not i will
show you in a moment what koo kumba like
means but become versa what what they
call a behavior driven development tool
it has so your tests are specified
specified as scenarios and then from the
scenarios the actual tests are are
generated and was originally we didn't
Ruby but there are many clones human
languages in along their two of them
actually and it's well it's a way of
automating their acceptance tests so to
say so the scenarios that the client can
understand and in a very almost human
natural language like way so again some
code that i want to show you to give you
an idea
so this is what a description of
scenario would look like so you will
have a general description and for for
each feature you have a number of and
this is the pattern that you always see
and it's kind of I hope you can read it
but it always has the same the same
structure it says given something and
something and something and those some
things are describing your input data
actually then when you do something and
that something is usually invoking some
functionality in your system and
something and something and it might and
if you have several aunts then it means
a series of steps then something else
must happen so in that something is
usually the valuation of the
functionality your state your testing so
this is what you write in koo kumba and
from that when you use convert your test
generator but remember here we want to
generate this from what well from
something that you probably will write
if you're using probably based testing
which will be this sort of thing so
after developers will write this but we
want to show some someone else what word
the thing that we are testing when we
write things like this well we probably
understand but all other other people
that are not so technical may not really
get the picture of what kind of thing
are you testing with this for all blah
blah so the goal is instead of showing
this to to other people you will show
this right and for properties is more or
less straightforward that that part is
already working but of course the real
challenge is if you have this case you
again it's a borrowed example that
probably more many of you have heard of
is the test of the register
functionalities in Ireland a1 register
and under registered as a well-known
example that have been used a number of
times so if you write the quickcheck
state machine in this case for that
example you will define your
you will define your initial state and
you will have your logic for the for the
spawn function and your logic for the
register function and your logic for the
MA for the worries so you will have not
a state machine with a number of
operations and the preconditions and
postconditions and then this is really I
mean you could show this this module to
someone to your client but it's really
difficult to convince someone that
cannot really understand this that you
are actually testing everything about
your subway tunnel tests and in this
case the kind of explanations that we
are generating at the moment so focus in
this case we will focus on the
postcondition for the reduced row
operation well there's a number of
things of course it's a complex post
condition because the pencil so you're
registered and a beat with a name it
depends if that pete has already been
registered or if that name has already
been bind to an existing piece so there
are a number of things that you will
have to check in your post condition a
number of conditions that you will
implement as part of your test module
and we have to extract that and you we
have to try turn that into some some
kind of natural language description
what's going on so we have a number of
definitions which are the parameters for
the post condition and then we have a
set of requirements that are all the
things that you will check according or
in relationship to those to those
definitions that you've made and then
you will have well our result and in and
well I will mean that if all the above
is is true then you will have a post
condition true and for all the
possibilities in the post condition
we're doing that so still as you can see
it's kind of really verbose so we're
we're working in getting this into a
much more compact explanation what's
going on but as this is what we will get
so as I say at close to another language
description of what's going on in your
test model which is again
something that you can try and there's a
number of examples in the github page
but again it's still working progress
especially the part with the state
machines that will come up but slowly it
slowly but steady i hope and then well
two more tools left the next one is
called the accessibility checker or
short for a checker if you know what
accessibility is then i won't go into
detail but you know probably that there
are a number of definitions made by the
w3c consortium that described what
accessibility is concerning web pages
and the things that you have to make
sure that your web interface fulfills to
be conformance to a certain criteria
according to the accessibility criteria
of the w3c as I say so what these tools
does is to automatically check those
guidelines that are automatically
testable because there are a number of
things that only the human eye contest
but for all the others we have basically
two translated the standard which is a
well very long document in natural
language in this case we have turned
that into properties into quick check /
proper properties so we have now
probably one of the few implementations
in in programming languages of those
guidelines in as I said as properties
this it's being really one useful to
turn that into properties using property
based testing so it's because we use
property based testing isn't it's been
much easier to translate because there
are a number of things that you do by
basically basically implement property
for each guideline then we you collect
number of violence and you implement the
criteria based on that so it's it's much
more powerful than other checkers that
you might have used we actually well in
this case is also an article coming up
compares the accessibility checker with
the a checker which is one of the most
used ones and we see how how things that
the a checker cannot actually find we do
fine and as in the case of the JSON
young one of the good things for these
communities that we have well the
implementation is in Ireland so one a
few size things that we have to
implement in order to build the
accessibility checker are already
available for you one of them is an HTML
generator so you if you want to generate
or if you need to generate HTML by the
HTML or invalid HTML and that's a model
that do a module in the accessibility
checker that this it works for you so
don't go and implement your own HTML
generators anymore we have library that
does that for you at the moment so again
go into one of the final demons that I
have for you here today so how the
accessibility checker works is well if
you're there are a number of sources
that accessibility checker can be and
located so you can check a root URL then
of course you have to start in the nets
and SSL and then this is the model that
you have to call and the function that
you have to call you will specify which
level of conformance you want to test in
there are a number of levels that are
implemented the technology that your
yours using we're focusing in this case
in HTML and you will provide the URL and
say that you are actually testing a URL
you could also if you have the the world
HTML in a string you can also directly
inspect the string or if you have the
HTML in a file and you can do that using
this HTML gin HTML this is the HTML
generator I was talking to you about you
could well pick this this generator and
I say that as a file and then you will
have a very easy way of checking what
the accessibility checker actually
us so well the kind of output that the
accessibility checker shows is you can
of course expect that I will you see
three website it passes a lot of the
criteria so if you go ahead and see how
the accessibility library is built you
will see that there number of criteria
and you will see well which which of the
country is missing or which of the one
of the older properties that are
expected to be fulfilled are not being
fulfilled you have won a good idea of
why exactly you're not complying with
all the with all the rules so to say and
if you if we just invoke it it will now
generate oh and this is the Sbrocco in
next Merle that we haven't actually been
able to pin down sometimes it happens
now we will see so in this case so this
is the the HTML file at a ghost
generator and well this is the the the
conformance output so if we scroll up
down we'll see that for that HTML that
we generated put the criteria the
criteria that failed was the 331 the
numbers have the same that that are used
in the in the w3c standard so you can go
to the standard and look for 311 and you
will see this planation there if you all
to the library implementation you will
see well functioning in ireland that is
actually checking what that country what
means so again you can use this and
you're mostly welcome to use it for
anything that you want I think that most
the most useful part is probably if
you're not into accessibility or new
journal not into development of the user
interface of web service so to say you
still can use
it's email generator for a lot of things
if you're in need of such data
generation and again degi hub page so
the last tool I want to mention and will
be no demo of this one because we don't
have the well the settings here in order
to allow that is mega load in this case
we're talking about a cloud testing
framework and again what is supposed to
be doing when it when it's ready it's a
how do you perform performance and load
testing of your airline system and again
you might have I mean today and tomorrow
we'll be hearing about testing tools in
this case we wonder the aim is not to
have the testing well a
software-as-a-service but the whole
testing as a service because what is not
always easy to have the the in-house
resources to do actual heavy performance
and load testing so mega load will take
care of all of that and I will show you
a few images to try and explain how it
will do that but again as a the back end
idea is to use property based testing
for generating different scenarios in
order to really stress your system and
then being able to shrink down from a
scenario that actually causes your
performance goes to be overloaded order
your load to be too much for your system
at in order to shrink that scenario and
find the smallest a scenario that still
makes your your performance become not
acceptable so there are a number of
things that we will do with mega load so
we will define tests scenarios for
performance and for load and that will
mean a complex definition of what a desk
can do and meaning that a given scenario
might have a different number of phases
so first we create a number of say
clients and then we connect the client
and then we spend some times with the
clients during operations and then we
spawn few more clients so
a test scenario will be something
complex and the faces can be shared with
doing or each face can have well we will
have now we will now see what the
scenario would look like where there
will be a number of constraints on how
much data is going to be grated on how
much requests are going to be created
and those can be shared between phases
or not and the scenarios can also
include smaller scenario so we will have
a really powerful way of expressing this
sort of thing and then a back-end to
execute that that will actually identify
okay so if you do this then here you
find your your performance problem here
you find your your load problem and that
will that will be done as I said as a
service in the whole how this links to
other two that we have seen here today
well the way we will write the test
scenarios that we want to try is using
well Jason so the configuration will be
Jason that will allows us that will
allow us to us to use Jason Jen to
generate a lot of scenarios and then
execute them and one have really really
powerful doubt testing in this case so
we will assess i will enter gate on with
Jason Jen and the whole goal of mega
load will be two 21 to identify
scenarios in which those performance and
load test requirements are not met but
we will also have as part of this work
like the compliment I think because we
with rural with regard to performance we
might want to see when the whole system
is not performing as it's supposed to be
and in the other hand you will also want
to know one specific functionality or a
specific interaction a specific request
that you can do me turn or doesn't meet
certain performance required so we're
all complimenting what Megillah will do
a system whole so deseo system-wide so
to say we will also have half
set of prion functional property
properties as part of a library that you
could use you will be able to use to
want to find grain test specific
functionalities for performance so
that's that's coming soon we hope we
actually teach you to stay tuned around
user conference in June probably a good
moment to list to hear back from us in
this regard our long workshop in
September we will see we will definitely
be having more things to tell you so to
wrap up there are number of things that
we've been doing in prowess and I hope
you at least you remember when you were
back home that we have seen here and
alternative to cover and to inspect your
your tests or you're just efficiency
toes hope to say ways of generating data
so you have to generate a lot of
creation remember that you've so Jason
Jen if you have to generate HTML
remember that you have the accessibility
checker if you're going to work with our
us document and remember you don't have
to do all the work of generating the
skeletons we do that for you if you at
some point need to translate your
properties into something that someone
else can be remember what you saw here
today also and what and expect more
things from the prowess project so I
don't know if you will be able to hide
hike the galaxy with what you've seen
today but at least I hope that you go
back not hoping that you have been
somewhere else and I will be happy to
answer any questions that you may have
now
hi
yes what so the question for the car
another question is that if we have with
the respect to if we're planning on and
not only getting the scenarios in
natural language like form from the
properties but also getting the
properties out of for instance their
spec definitions and the answer is at
the moment no so our main goal was to
get something readable for non-technical
people from the already technical stuff
that we write but we agree with you that
it is challenging to to write properly
for newbies property based testing is
not easy from day one and actually the
information if you already know how to
write specs of course there is a useful
information that we could at least try
to unit skeletons or or hint and I don't
know if that could be part of the same
tool or a complimentary tool but it's
something that we want to definitely
look into it yeah yeah stain tuned um I
don't know so what I will ask you to do
is to write or that to do after to
directly in the in the github page which
I'm not directly involved in the
development of Jess and Jen so i will
have to follow your questions to some of
someone else in the project but it's a
fair question you can check their number
of JSON schemas in the test folder of
the github project that was their number
of not released straightforward things
that are supported at the moment already
I don't know if they work with
probability distributions I don't know
that isn't yeah by all means suggested
because I me one of the goals of getting
the word out soon because some of the
tools are still in alpha or beta status
is that precise that you can give us
ideas of things that we might not have
thought over and improve them so yeah
thanks
right yes yeah that's that's what I
meant with the testing as a service so
so yeah for the camera the question was
what about megaload if it provides the
resources so the notes and the more
knows when when the load is growing and
their answer is yes so the megalobe will
take care of all that so you will have
probably well you will have a user
interface to specify or to help you
build the JSON or generate them and then
from that that's the only thing you need
to provide and of course version of your
system but then the nose and the
spawning of more notes on the provision
of more physical machines in order to
see how far your system goes that is
taking care of by by mega log yes
yes yes yes we actually looked
absolutely if they're there a doc
documentation in the model that that
will be taken and used as part of the
scenario scription levels yeah
absolutely yes yes definitely
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
