practical lambda calculus I have a
lambda calculus it needs a lot of
introduction after Phillip bottlers
keynote yesterday so we'll skip the
theory and and go right to sort of the
practical stuff the things that you wait
so I'm not sure if we're on that track
or not right yes but I think that was
one of the tracks on no one told us
which Jacqueline so we're probably the
finance and banking track yeah we're on
some track and well yeah and so
practical things so you need sort of an
environment to work with the lambda
calculus that's sort of been missing for
a long time so luckily you'll not say
sort of rectify that so ok keep making
new environments but so we have an a
pang set up which runs standard on all
program that runs a lambda calculus
interpreter and when it all puts meat
meep meep that means it's running so now
I have kind of a lambda retro so we can
do you like call lambda functions and we
can get the result on the next line
right so maybe we should talk about the
rules and what we have to work with so
what kind of went through the rules
yesterday yeah Phillips talk there are
three constructs we have variables and
we have lambda obstructions and have
function applications and we have sort
of one computation ruler evaluation rule
which means that if you have some lambda
and you apply it to their value into the
function application thing you take the
body of the lambda will replace every
occurrence of the parameter with this
argument right so we have like a really
useful example here we can step through
this see this red so this is a function
that takes noggin a and the returns
demanding this body so when we evaluate
this like one step we should replace all
the ACE with food right and now we have
a new function that takes a B and this
is the next argument and we can evaluate
this and we replaced all they know
beasts in the body with bar and we can
do the next step and replace the Seas
wind quirks right so so this is very
nice but it's not entirely clear to me
how this is like how do you do practical
things with a say you're running some
business in the omniverse and and you
want to do some computation maybe you
want to count things like revenue or
something how would you go back yeah so
doing the more practical stuff like so
actually learnt way in the omniverse we
always have these lambdas right and we
might use different symbols for them and
stuff yeah i'm not sure if you have
numbers everywhere but we start with
this I'm sure we can like make numbers
okay so you make numbers how do you make
numbers because so like one of the
things we can do with this lambda
suppose we could do function application
so we kinda if you do that over and over
a number of times so if you do like a
lot of function application right that's
sort of appears to be kind of the most
basic thing you can do over and over
sure so if you do function application
four times yeah we want that to be the
number four so that's but that's
basically just your interpretation right
so so you're saying now if you have this
you're going to think about that as
being for anything we can decide that
this is number four so we do this when
we define the number four okay so just
to be clear the sort of the the party
hat equals is not part of the lambda
calculus right if that's kind of them
macro system we built on top right which
means that whenever I write for now I
can do this basement and get back the
definition I decided right so it's it's
for convenience or because you're lazy
and don't want to type f's yeah good so
it was the smiley face so that's kind of
the only virtual symbol for meaning that
no this symbol is defined right so if
you have a mouth and two ice then that's
the yeah okay good so so yeah so what we
send us for is a function that takes two
arguments and applies the post argument
four times the second one so 0 which is
sometimes better to start with and pork
right should apply the first argument f0
time steps so just to return to the
second argument right this is still sort
of a game of Miss or you're pretending
right in some sense in some sense that
this is the number 0 because all it
really is is that I function yeah but I
don't think it would be like happy if it
was just for bit ok ok good so but now
we have numbers it seems you have to
sort of manually construct them is this
gets tedious after a while so writing my
traps right so so so the first function
we want to write on numbers to take my
number as an argument you don't like to
add something to a number right so we'll
make like a successor function which is
like a factory to create numbers or
something yes and I think that's like
from the gyno for book in number
creation factory yes good and it should
take a number as an argument and I turn
a number that is one higher rapture so
we're going to build a new number to
summarize it did before and I don't
really like doing this correctly on the
first try so we're going to do this
first see that it looks happy so it's
probably correct so they filled
it is the successor of this a successor
of 0 you see this takes three arguments
lice the third to the application of the
second to the first yes absolutely clear
yes but then just give you zero yeah
that's just 0 so let's not do anything
yeah but at this point it's like off by
three which isn't too bad excuse me
could you apply the 3 f's so if we make
this add an additional F to the result
of that so you saw that right yes as you
gave a zero back inta badan xjf we
should get one more apps right no it's
twice as happy and you get 3 X 2 3 f's
excellent yeah so this is it's not
obvious that this is less tedious than
writing a lot of apps now maybe you
prefer FS but they get like several
lines of computation which is long as
yet to the app sure which i think is
good I don't know how man I actually
have it could you like to generalize
this to do more like edition isn't now
we have like we have 0 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 yes sir
pretty good numbers we could make nine I
think so if we want to like make nine
with them we could add more eps 25 sure
but erica could try to make like an
addition function sounds useful so we do
like plus it should take three state
takes two arguments and by that you mean
that it takes one argument and returns a
function to take sure next Jessamine and
we have two numbers and kind of the only
thing you can do with the number is
apply it this is kind of strange to me
because now you're saying you're using
the thing you call the number as a
function yeah yes okay this is so the
number can should look kinda like this
if you take enough and have a bunch of
apps in it so we're kinda yeah well what
can we replace the eff with in order to
make an even larger number okay well
which is kinda like replacing the
successors it when we okay like we
should have as many apps as we started
with ssl right so so oh I'm going to
replace them with SS you're going to
replace the SS witnesses yeah I feel
it's okay it's a really large number
yeah but we can also replace this X on
the end which is like right I'm
corresponds to the fear oh right so
that's you will sort of like plug in the
other number yes if we add be so the
number in here and then it's just
continue with some extra apps yeah so we
had sort of all the apps from a on to
write your number be all the apps from
the number be I know Gingrey you can see
it sounds very nice impact or in theory
so it turns into this thing and it
should evaluate into right so is that 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 f-s okay excellent and I
thought my we can get to like 10 pretty
slick witches I think that's one of the
more common numbers 10 sounds useful
I don't know it like I'm very can get
like 12 or 15 or something this way yes
basically but you want to go like really
large like up to 100 100 is huge yeah
I'm not sure edition goes that far no
internalized edition right in something
multiplication which it's kind of like
super edition at this and we have which
also takes two arguments which those are
the numbers with what would you replace
so we want to replace the apps with
something right and the X is kind of is
because the excess what we want to
replace the number zero with and i think
that when i multiply something by serial
get 0 back sometime should be pretty
easy right so at this point it's like
assuming that i'll let you have the
number one we should add if a is 1 b is
like eight we should a date to it mm-hmm
so you can buy a date right it should
work pretty good for mid-sized again is
now just you sort of cheating with your
macro system right so yeah so you can
pretend that this is like a bunch of
lambda sigma as you can see them sort of
expanded as the first step yeah so you
can do like do like this and get the
expand right so you don't have it so
they don't have bad number two so you
should you should use like nine or ten
and I think that kind of no matter which
which number we use right sort of in
general for multiplication it could be
any number you think it should not just
work for eight I think it's a good stock
and but if you plug in B instead right
yeah it should be sort of a times 20
right yes okay so see if it works this
way
should get to 100 which i think is the
largest natural number right is this 100
now just to be clear that we did likely
some late-night optimization of the 50
day yes so it's now gracing difference
to be flow so I'm sure this is kind of
where do you know we Mak so maybe you
can count the apps so I don't have to so
I don't know MX + igoogle dis yesterday
and I google it wrong thing anger and
got like a really Emacs answer it feels
like you have to use all the fingers but
then I know that I wanted to count not
search within a region or something okay
and it's quite simple right so I'm girl
that's 100 according to survive I think
you should hold on to a hundred in case
we need it later yeah so hopefully we're
not going to need it because it's like
way too large yes so now we can add
things what about like if by some ill
chance you would lose money maybe you
need so I think that an economy only
need like things that make numbers go
larger ok but like if you're not doing
that using this for finance and I think
you might want to sometimes things go
down yeah so that won't forget to we
want to like do subtraction and a
predecessor function right that should
be fairly easy right so we all you need
to sort of first you could get rid of
I'm very good khodet in Emacs pretty
easily like just to take the spring and
remove like a knife and a couple of
parentheses yes so so that's like the
easiest way to do it but then we're kind
of back to the thing where it's kind of
hard to imagine that you don't have
emacs right someplace in the omniverse
you probably do so but I think that's
like not proven true or false for us you
will always have the lambda calculus
that right yeah so we can do so so so we
want to do a predecessor function right
and it's kind of so it's less obvious
what you want to replace the absolute in
a predecessor function yeah you want to
replace it with something that kills one
F and then keeps all the others yeah
yeah or you want to replace that most of
its something or not and then Rebecca
well that facing to do an amex yes and
that's so easy with just a function so
it's like a couple of ways to do the
predecessor at least we're going to do
the one that I think is the easy one
right so that they are counting in pairs
okay which I'm just doing it from so
like the pair of 0 0 it's a bit ok and
you can count up in the first part of
the pair right and move the old value
for the first part of it into the second
part so you can remove this Savior into
her and move this one into here at every
step now if you come to the tree you
should have to that's right and that
would be sort of the predecessor to
three you could just sort of because you
you let smaller number piggyback on that
yeah number you're counting up to right
so if you cannot do that like n times
for the number n and pick the second
number you should get number this one
smaller ok great which is like but now
we need like data structures right ok so
we know they're too content page we need
pairs right we're going to make very few
like obviously a function that takes to
document right it's going to return
something and it's probably going to
return a function right simply usually
does so so it's going to return a
function that takes one argument and
that organ has to be a function sin
others a lot of functions it's kind of
it's not like super hard to guess that
this has to be a function right since
that's everything we got yeah
I'm not sure how much timing is I it's
probably a function right and the only
thing we can do with the function is
applied so we're going to apply to the
two arguments right that should work out
somehow so how does it work in practice
if you use it for something so we can
make a pair of foo and bar right and
then we get a function that takes an
argument that and apply to f2 foo and
bar right and how is this a pair now so
we should be able to pick out so this is
a function that should take two
arguments right foo and bar if you apply
this to a function that takes two
arguments and return the first one we
should get oh you got the first one
right yeah so you can turn that into a
function function at X a pair and
applies it to a function that returns of
its first bill foreign to me that you
would sort of apply the pair to
something but that's good yes so take
the first we should get back right you
can do similar thing for second I
imagine yeah again we you would return
be right yeah so it takes a pair of
place
it's kind of interesting that like the
lambdas were not the craziest character
yourself so we take your function of two
arguments let's return to the second one
I take it so it in the Paris even bar
and take the second of it it's like this
and I get back okay excellent and now
you can make a predecessor function yeah
so now we will start by making a
function that we're going to replace all
the eps with right well use like a
helper function for that right so it
takes up here this is the counter yeah
so this is the thing that dies yes yes
the function that should take this and
return this reassures and every time
this is so it takes a parent it looks
like that it will make a new pair and
take the successor on the first part of
the pair and just the first take right
the old first part of the penis into
this second part of the pair and it's
happy yeah so if you start with the pair
0 0 you should get 10 and that's one f +
0 f so guess we're good yeah
we can see that it works for large
numbers let's see I think we did three
right call so the help function right
and we go I know you could pick out too
if you want to do right yeah that's sort
of what you you're aiming for yep and so
now we can make the predecessor function
using that helper function right so Fred
should be a function that takes a number
calls the number replacing all the apps
with friend helped start with Sigma
Sigma it right replaces the ending zero
right a pair and you need to pick out
the second one right yes and that's
happy to write if you do the predecessor
of like 10 we have 10 right you want to
cut this is probably nine FSI 1 2 3 4 5
9's excellent yeah so did you have to
oh you're making like crazy large
numbers yes i think i paid this as a
work for i think it works for 40 yes i'm
not sure it works for a hundred it's
like super large in need to count up up
200 again and a half device oh you're
not entirely clear that it would
terminate I can check to see that this
should now be 40 apps yes protein so
this is the number 40 and we can take
the predecessor of 40 it kind of comes
back to 40 right and they transport a
way yes and then you have 39 so I
imagine doing this it's nice that they
can follow along as it compute against
both mistakes kind of giving yes instead
of happen so you can terminate in case
it's calculating wrong yeah I have it
like a keyboard cultured work and kill
the process if I see the direct but I
right and this should be now 39 f's so
maybe we won't do too much subtraction
because you'd have to do this over and
over again right so if you wanted to
subtract two from 40 you would count up
to 40 on the new account up to 39 yeah
so we kind of like really quickly to do
the subtraction function which means
that we want to take the predecessor a B
times right this is now very similar to
the addition yeah right so we still
don't have like to do it a problem we
have 10 yeah this should now be exactly
six eps which is a new number to us so
it's useful in that sense yes it's one
to hold on TobyMac nice play
I don't want to erase every time no so
you're sort of catching there is a one
two three four five six yes okay yeah so
okay we can do stuff with numbers yeah
maybe uh like we heard earlier that you
can do more in programming than just
arithmetic I think yes well some point
mad about that you could use like
symbolic logic for things other than
numbers yes so so I can they touched on
that because we needed pairs in order to
do stuff in numbers right maybe like
having an arbitrarily large list of
things it's a sort of right so the
number is kind of the same place Turkish
mr. structor it's defined in terms
themselves it can be 0 a successor or
number right so you making this a base
kind of similar right but you also need
things and so I sorry we have like
slides and things so right now must look
like this it's structurally very
similarly large areas and let's look at
it so they're the same apart from you
have us believe contains yes you have
some things sometimes you're interested
in the contains of the list at five is
so we have this kind of illustration
that right so numbers our list without
the champion is a lift right I think
it's easier to use a list in place of a
number than a number in place of a list
yes so you could sort of simulate
numbers using just lists now right if
you didn't care about the junk that was
it he only cared about the length it
will be right kind of like a number yes
the length of a list is a number right
and this is all make-belief anyway so
this
see all the nice and useful stuff we've
made so far that's it so we have like
serum successor look like that and we
want to have a Komsomol for lists a
regular MPs should look a lot like 0
that is you're going to use different
value I mean that it is the function 0
it's the same thing because the variable
names don't matter right yeah it's just
for convenience so uncontrolled look a
lot like successor but right success it
just takes the number that it is more
than virtually straight the list that it
is more than and and some elements that
it had yes to the beginning of the list
so should take an element in your head
right and sort of the tail of the list
and then we'll make a new list on the
form of the same remade the nail thing
right and we'll so if you do so where
would you put the will do this one
incorrectly as well free country on to
nail this is just going to be the same
and we get Neil back right she forgot to
do an additional conf right somewhere
here click on the head on to this
expression again twice as happy yes and
now you have a foo inside ya know if can
make like you can do that multiple times
Hans oh no
and and get this thing yes so it now it
has all the things and then it also
looks very similar to the numbers yes
now you can see that instead of apps
there are seized Ryan HC has an
additional element right what is a
function that kind of holds on to all
the elements we put into it she said
this is a list yep yeah from that time
for stuff so now we have list that's
look lists looking like this right can
still now I'll numbers looking like this
and we should be able to apply them in
order to replace the conscious with
something and deal with something well
what would be the result of sort of
replacing the concerts with s and the
nail with 0 I don't think we have like
one or two yet so it would know yeah
that game Elliot much but there should
be able to replace the concert plus and
the new material to get the sum of the
list ok but this kind of replacing comes
with something and replacing the empty
list with something turns out to be the
sort of right folding a list right which
suggests that replacing successors and 0
in that day is the right foldover number
ok which we have like there's a number
of quotes on this and I'm sure that if
you go like the type Theory direction
you often find something along these
lines at the elimination form right
elimination rule for a type but like
smart people have said that faults are
kind of important so it can make sense
that things ends up being closed sorry
Oleg said this in an articular related
or something entirely different ok that
you can basically build everything if
you have pulled right right so
so some candles so now you could do some
if you if the things you have in your
list our numbers so true yes away week
and electrons successor of 0 on two
clowns successful successor of zero onto
the nail right and if you'd be able to
fold this the same way like so right so
now you're replacing the concerts with
the plus and the nail with a zero yeah
it should add those two numbers together
this is the fault right for ya and this
gave us three and you had one into it so
that hopefully we had one on two right
okay not going to check no good and we
can skip a slide I'd never live up to
what it says right so a fault for
numbers would look like this which is
what we've been doing so far right so
you but you could do the same sort of
replace or we have been doing the same
kind of replacements for numbers right
yeah so if we have this we have like a
really good example did this store this
one yeah so we have a list really can
get like the length of it do I replacing
all the conscious with the function that
takes two arguments it's going to ignore
all the elements because it was counting
how many elements right and it can take
the successor of the second element the
second element should be oh it's you mr.
lambda I'm missing a lambda I don't made
a mistake so far and we got omid
last-minute changes to make like a
really awesome error message based on
talked yesterday right so we're going to
leave it in for now
I would kind of count a nice going to
stay well it's very disappointing that
usually works out but if you take the
successor of the end and replace the
empty list with zero right and they
should now give you the oh yes oh so
this most implement there's missing a
lambda yeah it was wrong to remove it if
you add it in we should get this area
and we can now we have the length of the
list yeah 31 so how how about taking the
length of of a number could you do that
because if you have like the number you
have the number four right yeah you
could replace the SS with SS I guess and
the 0 with 0 yeah that's it so according
to thaw it gives you forth right yes
length of 44 yes this is one of the
things that I kind of like about these
numbers is that it's it's very tangible
how big a number is you can sort of
measure it right yeah so you can measure
it's like this an idol the same way you
can lick their well we get to the pitch
that was this large yes you can also
have this manakish yes this is the only
number that is that large if the one did
that many apps and I mean it's fairly
obvious that say like eight is larger
than say for right because it's just
longer yeah yeah I think we even have it
hey no we don't I look tan and it's
clearly larger yes 10 is larger editor
and because it's like two letters yes in
this is new move as well yeah but I like
six which is also yes it's clearly not
as large as for ya or sorry larger than
four yep yeah and so yeah we have lists
we haven't done much with them Heather
take my thanks on the Sun right we can
make some of those
usual list functions like mapping things
yes so great so we'll do like a map
function that takes a function and a
list it usually does right and we want
to apply the lift to something right so
you need to replace the cons there right
nail can be replaced with nails of
mapping of an odd place to do it and
regulation so this should replace the
concert should take ahead and take a
list the already mapped list right so we
want to count the head on to the tail
but will apply the function f to the
right yes and we'll make like a useful
function to test this with and the x
times X times X now alright useful now
it says knee
probably better and we get this is
useful because now we have a list of two
foods so now we can map something useful
or we have a long story right right yes
and get this thing and right and now you
had a list with just a few and the Lord
lift the left right yeah so it has a
list Oh to loosen it a list of two bars
in it and at least up to question do you
think you could sort of flattened it
because lists of lists and hard to think
about so okay so flattening it Issei if
it's sort of replace all the contest
with append so right pattern that adds
to live together do we have a pen nah so
a pen takes two lists and also we
already kind of cover this that lists
are kind of like number to be on the
care about the length right yes so I pen
this kind of like plus since the length
should be right so you're going to use
them at the trailer by list length plus
the second ones right we're going to
replace the nail and the first list with
the second best yes yeah so i found a
list a list right and now yeah it's true
bartered full barrage excellent so we
can make a flat function takes a list to
place us all the cons with a pen so it
appends right each in the list goodnight
next one right and the empty list should
be damp list right so you glad Matt
useful a list
should get us ready list from earlier
but platen right this is clearly like a
function that we should give a useful
name yes I do you have any suggestions
start at the flat and then map function
on this so we'll make like a functional
do it it takes a function on a list and
it lets and maps I think so that the
obvious thing to call it is greater than
greater than equals which is
it kind of follows from the definition I
think right so now you have the fancy
hair operator for the smiley face yes
nothing so we should be able to maps so
should be able to greater than negative
equals something useful on to the list
from earlier right and compute oh it's
the same and then we hardly for yes but
now we have the useful operator yeah I
think that's about it and that's about
it we could do like feel clear something
over the last five min so we could sort
of answer questions really badly yes
should we try filter of three minutes
okay maybe we're just under yeah so we
need balloons to make filter I guess
okay oh yeah let's not do it up for
questions yep we drop like binding
so any questions I can pass on to you
knows so you should repeat the question
is the this tool available online like
on github or something so this tool is
available in my dropbox I guess so I
earlier we use the sublime plugin it
