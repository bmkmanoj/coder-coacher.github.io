Emily I work for this facility called
Pettifer attack and we are the company
behind elixir which is a programming
language that runs in their technical
machine and acto is a project written in
Aleks it okay and I have to start with a
disclaimer because this tracks called
next generation of innovation and acto
is a two and we are going to see for
relational it is a sequel database okay
and the reason for that is that even
though we are you see like great
technology coming with those
next-generation databases right being a
very good example of those the clients
part about my companies to 80% they
still rely heavily on relational
databases and if you want to eventually
use at exceeding the projects with those
clients we need to have a good story of
relational database so this talk we have
mainly for topics I will give a very
brief introduction to the problem how to
and then how to use acto how after-work
works and how to clear main actor
possible and I'm going to explain
everything regarding an expiry as I go
I'm not going to assume that anyone here
is really knows an exam the only part
that I'm just going to go and sober is
the macro thing because tomorrow morning
next Thomas and I we have a keynote and
we'll talk a little bit more about how
the macro stuff works so I'm just going
to mention it here and if you have any
questions to me to interrupt and you can
get on that
okay so I had a huge story about how
active King's life because I came from
probably has majority between this room
from objectively in the background and I
wanted to solve this relational
and for object-oriented languages we
have a bunch of tools we have a bunch of
books and we don't have such extensive
resource for future programming and then
they spend some time studying trying to
find how we can solve this problem but
long story short I found this thing in
between other things I found link
already used or no one link it's okay so
link was introduced as part of the.net
framework since november 2007 so it's
okay and it's a language integrated part
okay so it's integrated in the language
literally and when Microsoft added
support they add support for the three
main languages Visual Basic C sharp and
F sharp and they have slightly different
syntax but they work mostly the same and
here's an example for me okay so what
I'm saying here is that they say you
know for each P in the database product
in the product table in the database
right I want to select all products we
find more than 25 and order than my name
and then I want to return those products
and what this is going to return is
acquiring so you can see that there's
not going to is a cute them would return
the results for you it's going to return
a query that if you want to fetch the
results need to have some specific
action like carry talk to listen and so
in the database fact the results parse
then make them products and return them
to you and when they introduced it that
as part of the.net building it brought a
lot of benefits okay so the first one is
composition and I'm assuming those
benefits it may not be very far behind
our comparison one that was riding sick
inquires by Ken and you know
manipulating in my hand injecting the
parameters by hand so it brings a bunch
of benefit so the first one is
composition why because this this thing
is returning a query and you can
manipulate the query you can later add
another clause and in other work laws
you can add a limit maybe remove
alleviate some of your data set so you
can impose your part by parts let me try
a huge chunk that huge trick string that
we can have small functions working in
the party I think I forgot to say this
is an example in okay so it brings
composition it brings data security
because now link is smart enough to
escape all the parameters who paths are
not going to have a simple injection
attack and someone can access our data
or wipe out our database are something
in the jar and there is also type safety
because if your if I have a string right
there doing string interpolation that
depends on the language you're using
it's like course in the types and then
if weird things can happen and in this
case if I try to oh if I try to compare
the product I deal with my string for
example say all those those types not
imagine can give you how help whatever
messages and those are very good right
there very good benefits and but for
Microsoft Lync was actually much more
than this because when introduced a link
and then you know what they're talking
about Microsoft they're thinking most of
all they have a sharpener tickling most
about visual music and c-sharp which are
object-oriented most object-oriented
languages right and one thing is that
when they introduced it mean they did
not only allow you to write this okay
but they allow you to try to sing party
like this okay so the end result is
exactly the same and what here is
happened
that it's a much more functional
approach right those things here that
are passing to where it's a little bit
expression so for them it was like a big
move because they were introducing more
crucial concepts in the life of like
everyday object oriented program as
developers right they were getting more
fusion of posters and gagging music with
this so it was a big move and they went
as far to instead of saying the bill of
product so say you know I mean prior the
database you can actually replace this
then they bid on product by some
collection by some America lection so
they were saying you know no those
operations between the database you can
actually do those things in your email
collection right there are direct
equivalents and you can just do that and
do those operations those dysfunctional
style so it was a big thing okay and
link got very very awkward was extremely
popular languages they started to have
their own implementations or their own
variant of link and an experience not
different because you know we have
active and but you can see here that
octo is slightly different because it
will say that active is a language
integrated query I'm saying it link is
the language degree required for
databases and the reason for that is the
following so if we go to the director
role right that beautiful tourist Peron
we have relational algebra okay which is
what simple database implementer we have
social programs like interact computer
programming we can think that etiquette
series and implementation of this direct
official programming video but if your
interests are all we can find direct
mappings in between those things right
we can say also project in relational
algebra is equivalent to a map here in
functional programming or I can say a
select relational algebra which is used
for filtering
it's a special program
direct mappings okay so this is
beautiful in theory but the real role it
always reminds those right like that's
not exactly how it should work the rear
boats that there is a mismatch okay
because the database for example was
optimized for lookups right for doing
those operations and then we are doing
where for example of 2/3 in any member
collection we are bound to a linear
institution time
okay so we have indexes even things like
how you represent the type so the
database you have decimals your language
can have decimals but do both this
decimal type to give you the same
guarantees like how they are going to
truncate the values right so there is a
bunch of very small details that can
creep and then that's why we said that
act oh it's just for database we don't
protect that very integral language
integrated query that can run in
anything can run without services can
run in America lections and so we are
focusing on the databases and that's our
goal so with that in mind this
introduction in mind actually the first
actual example so here is how I write a
query in act oh so it's very similar to
what we've seen so far so they say from
P in product where the problem ID is
more than 25 I want to order by name and
I want to return all piece right the
first difference here is that this is
just an extra syntax so in linking is it
was a language integrated query the
entire needs to know about it right so
here is just a library is nothing
special you just using the elixir syntax
to create those queries and the reason
we can do that it's because we have
macros that can look at those things and
manipulate them okay and then this is as
link is
don't worry that we can manipulate add
other clauses and when you want to
actually get the results you need to go
to a repository rigidly storage writing
something that represents the database
and say okay give me all the results and
it's going to fashion and then do what
you usually do with it so this brings
the same benefits so composability for
example we can this from right is
returning a query okay we can later
extend we can say so here create a
private or HP product we're proud of it
is 125 and then I can extend this
parsing and I want also to add another
by clause that's going to order by name
okay and then I'm extending these new
parts and the reason this works is
because in annex we have something
called protocols and they are kind of
similar to interface in an
object-oriented languages but if you are
closure developed where it's exactly the
same as closure protocol which is based
extension points and there isn't this
works is that whatever you pass on the
right-hand side of being here as long as
it is this protocol as I'm sorry and
again it implements this protocol called
act to that parable we can compose those
things right we can compose only the
finger pass here implements this act of
curve and these are also do a lot of
interesting stuff for example I can do
this
I can sing repoed up yet pass the
product write the product identifier and
the idea of what this is going to do is
go into the database and get the product
with idea of one and then I can say for
each category that is associated to this
product right and then I can get all
those categories Teli needs to send and
that returns me another query so I'm
just composing the patterns right and
then I can have all the categories that
are associated to the product and that's
all because all this thing needs to do
it needs to return to us is something
any command
okay so we have a very nice composition
of view you can encapsulate those things
in functions and extend as you need them
the other thing with that is data
security so every time you want to do a
query in acto so let's suppose to have a
function right so here's a function
called by name that precedes one
argument name and what I want to do is
that you want to return all products we
want to return a query that have gets
all crossing the database with the given
a new passes argument okay and every
time you're passing external data to the
query you need to protect it with this
hat and say okay this is external data
right this is the data that's coming
here from the function and I want to get
all products that it's equal now with
these new exactly right why did you skip
this thing and then we are going to skip
energy that is I'm going to have secrets
actual attacks people cannot send
malicious information from your web
server and mass sleeper databases but I
want to make clear that the reason we
have this hat is not because of security
because you could implement it in the
Hat we could figure it out somehow but
is exactly because I want to make clear
what is happening the database and what
is happening in in annex C so take per
sample d square imagine that we have a
query that returns a list of names of
the product names in the database okay
so this query is it we're seeing more HP
products select the product name and
we're calling strip and it has the
fashion way is this trip operation which
basically removes the space
meaning and Aniyah they stream this trip
operation happening in the database or
in any sphere right here because I don't
have the hacker show these operations
happen in the database right so the Hat
makes very clear what is the owner is
right what is happening in act or what
is way to be sent to the database what
is going to happen Alexis so if right
select one plus one the impose then one
plus one unless you have a hat is
happening in the database okay and
finally we also have type safety if you
try to compare a name here which is an
integer and but the names start in the
database extremely you're going to say
it I'm going to do the priority let me
say okay those types not match maybe you
want to work to try something else and I
had a bunch of examples but I would run
out of find that of frameworks or
libraries that they actually they do not
look like Jackie in their database
layers like in their orange and that
leads to all kinds of crazy security
issues because they are like implicitly
converse doing their conversion and then
they can bypass something in my closet
check and it leads to a security issue
sometimes it is also important for data
safety okay so I talked about card so
far right I'm talking square as far as
pirates but acto is actually it it is
four components okay
it's virus and the things and entities
are data models which are behavior and
we have ripples which are repositories
but life's too short to type of costars
at the time so just saying like wrinkles
and and everybody to expand on the other
ones now okay so the first one is
entities and before we going to is that
me to a little bit more elaborated
introducing traffic theory so let's
start with hello road
so if
are you nuts and fast in between coats
have restrained Heller oh that's when
there may turn this going up recoverable
and then a little bit more structured
approach right we are going to put that
in a module so I define a module called
hello and we were Lucien Road that does
not receive an argument in this case and
then I can create and then it's going to
print hello road and I can call this
function and in that exterior
parentheses are efficient alright so I
can actually just remove them and the
end results will be the same and there
is all kind of solidifies I'll have
additional branches right because when
we wrote the query we didn't have to
write the aquarium with the price is
right you can just remove them it feels
more like what they would give you for
example so you can just remove them
right and from what fro me is just so
now that we've practically a little bit
more obvious right but what from is is
that it is a macro in this game that
receives two arguments right what is say
for cleaning product and all those
arguments here they are keyword
arguments trying to say okay so where is
these the other body is this other thing
this select this is other thing okay so
that's a little bit of electricity tax
and that's how we can have the party
looking like having cereal and here's
how we are going to write a little bit
more about syntax and examples this is
how we can we ship with a best thing or
called xunit and this is how to write a
task in that student so I define a
module called math test and then I say
use excellent cadiz and then I could say
test basic operations to assert one plus
one is equal true the important thing
here is not the testing actually is the
second line use action each case this is
the third common pattern we are going to
see it a couple times still and this
table which is basically a way to say
you know I depend on this module and now
I also to give the opportunity for this
one too
is it cute to inject some behavior in
here right so we basically call call
back there so like okay I'm using you
like do you want to inject some
functionality and this case
this case is just imparting the best and
a certain functionality okay so it's
just a way to set up the module for you
to the surfing particular and we're
talking about modules modules right
which can either behavior functions
right and then we have data as well we
have many ways represent data we have
opposing catalysis and I want to talk
about them there which are records so
records going to analysis we look very
familiar to records in any other
functional programming language for it's
also similar to structs in C it's
basically data right you have there and
you have you can give it has some slots
and it can give names those lungs
right so here you say okay I have a
record with two fields namely an age and
it's just data you can use that anomaly
write it up got behavior in that it's
just just data so we can create a record
like this I could say user name and in
each ten seven and then user dot name is
going to return today so I can access a
value and then because they using user
domain but I can also kind of match on
that right I could say you know this
here I have a user and I want to and I
want to match those things and if this
user is actually a record this is going
to match and I'm going to assign that
age that I define it here to the age
variable right since matching both sides
in this pattern matching okay so this is
the quick introduction to qu Alex Erie
and now we can go back to actor so let's
define our first entity okay here's how
I define a minute
so I'm defined a module in this case
it's in space like product entity and
the first thing I do is use accident and
game all uses this dooming is importing
the student community and an entity
is exactly the thing not a second is it
being an entity is a rapper okay so we
just saw records probably could like
these things for data right and an
entity is exactly the same thing exactly
the same you know the reason why we use
the different syntax to define them is
because the database needs to know about
unification like what is the primary key
what is the type you need to convert
like a float in a database you want to
cast twat in the other excellent so
since we need to keep all this metadata
and you potentially need to connect some
information we created these small DSL
for you to define the entity and to
prove that it is exactly a record right
we can just write these we can create an
entity by using the brackets the same
way rather than entity use the breath in
the brackets and then I can extract this
product name since the talk is in London
I thought that maybe the product
umbrella would be a good idea and we can
also better match to get like the
available entries for the product and so
on okay so that's it
right it's nothing really special okay
and and that's kind of the point right
it should really be simple we just made
it it's nothing more because here we are
in the SP world by diffusion prevailing
keep just data and then we put behavior
elsewhere and that's exact what you are
doing
that's data okay and then so if entities
are data we need to add behavior okay
and and behavior first we call them
models right they're just moving to a
more indirect name so I say okay we have
models and here I'm going to show an
example of a more model is this
it's just a module right behavior what
is behavior people are functions right
that the model is basically a bunch of
functions that can work in a particular
data and the second are going so you
know we just we find one just kind of
function that work on the data and you
could do exactly that and say okay this
is my model and what is totally valid
there is a bunch of concerns that
happens all the time like oh I want to
add validations to my I want to validate
the data or I want to execute some
callbacks so for those cases you could
also do use active model right and one
of those that it's going to bring some
functionality so you can different stuff
that you're defining all the time so
examples so model is bringing basically
right now we are very early on but basic
now we have it can help on three areas
right so the first one is animations the
second one is compacts and the third one
is parable so validations it basically
looks like this so if I have a module
and I news actor model I can define
animations like this I can say validate
product where the main is present the
description has length in between five
and 1000 and I also want to validate the
attachments because now imagine like my
brother has a company or something that
they can call something else too but
maybe attachments for him and what this
is going to do behind the scenes
surprise surprise is that it's going to
define a function right because that's
our behavior okay so it's going to
define a function called validate that
receives a product right a product
entity that we defined for and it
returns a list with errors if the list
is empty it means there were no
absolutely validated it's good right and
then if it is something else right we
are going to match the errors and then
you can
the others as is seem more appropriate
right you can render them adjacent to
the client show them in a why so that's
up to you
so that's litigations there is also
callbacks so again not really a big deal
how you define a callback is just a
function that receives the product right
which is the entity it receives the
repository where you are actually
creating storing that and if you are
going to go to work for Sephora snacks
and a bunch of options and again it's
just a function and you can see here
that they state the data is always
explicit right it's not like the bendy
dickered come in front of chakra to the
world and then you have like or amps the
compacts they are like together with the
data right they pack everything together
and it's hard for you to have callbacks
that can run on different things but
that's not a problem here for this
because it's just they're just functions
so I could define callbacks like that
but if you use actor model you can
actually say before create these before
Chris that or you know we have a bunch
of callbacks and it's going to pack all
the things you pass together right and
call it for you so it just helps you
compose a little bit more so okay we
talked about and it is we talked about
queries okay we talked about entities
that are data we talked about models
that were behavior and and it's nice
that those things they are part right
and try to sell you or probably is going
to say for the 20th time that they are
part and that's a good thing but most of
the time or you you want actually to
have them together right you actually
want to pack them together you actually
would say you know when I I do this
party I wanted to create this entity and
when you save or when you create this
entity I want to turn those callbacks
right you you want to do this wire to be
done for you
that wiring all the time that you need
to so what we what we can do is that we
have the third thing that our model
gives you is that you can say I want to
make this model a parable right and then
all I need to pass is a table name the
entity that it's going to return and
then it makes it parable and that's why
I can use it here okay
so when is it 15 product I can only pass
a product here because it deployments
the parable and calling parable here is
actually doing the work behind the
scenes for us okay so you're just
putting things together and that's why
it suddenly works and that's why we can
create queries and send those parts in
the database and this is such a cold
pattern right that we actually that
merging the model and then together that
it could you don't need to define the
entity own place and a product in
another place like we do
you could just define the entity line
right so saying though I have a water
product which it's behaviour right but I
can define that entity line and that
name results this thing is going to
define a product entity for you that you
can reuse so why so why can put things
together right it's just important to
remember that they are actually a part
of many so we have a bunch of things
like single degree heritance and some
patterns to try to solve the the company
that you put in between the data and the
behavior and so on but here since it is
a part you can actually break it easily
right if I have comments and they add me
and the user they have different
validation rules they need to force
different the integrity concerns in the
same data right you just defined two
different modules just define the
different behavior that's going to work
with that data so that leads us to the
final thing right which is repositories
Erica stories they are our storage so
here's how we define a repository okay
so I just say I want to define a module
called repo and use
people and then I pass adapter in for
now we only support those words and you
can find a URL okay where everybody's
access so here your best actors and
inspire to no that's an actor girl and
then you say oh the username the
password where I can find a thing and
the database name is getting a simple as
soon as you do this it's going to define
a module for you which of bunch of
operations the basic operations are
those six so you have ripple at all that
racemes at Prairie and it's going to
both the database patch there is also
that query and return it to who you have
create update and leave that person's
identity then you want to persist to
that start right to the database and we
also have a big ball and delete all that
receives queries and it's going to do a
batch operation space and so that's so
what's what happened is that you finish
the talk you go home and say okay I want
to use actor and then you define your
repository you try to do a query and it
doesn't work and why doesn't work
because before you actually prove any
query you need to call this function
ripple dot start link and and in our
text plane might need assumption I want
to go a little bit more of how addictive
works and how they are miracle machine
works okay so and this they Thomas and I
are going to expand also in the keynote
tomorrow but so in when you are in the
variable machine whenever you see Alex
you all your code runs in very small
processes and they are exchanging
messages all the time in between them
okay next thing messes all the time
which means that you can have different
processes here wanting to talk to the
database at the same time right so if
you have just one thing
for the enemies you have just one
connection you can have a lot of people
easy radio it's like oh this one is
using and the other ones say okay go to
the queue so we we don't want to do that
right and furthermore you don't want to
open the connection to the database all
the time because that can be expensive
so what we do is that we define a
process for we define a pool of things
that are connected the database and
every time you need to talk to the
database we set everything up together
and for ACTA we use this library called
pool boy which is an ethnic library and
I think riot students in some part of
the reichstag president which is equal
boy and basically what it does is this
right so why do have you have a manager
and you have which is here important in
purple we have the workers okay so if
there is there comes a process prefer
like there's a web request right and you
want to hit the database where they say
that you go to the manager and say okay
I want to communicate to the database so
you ask the manager give me a process
give me something from this process cool
okay and then then they say okay you can
use this woman it gives back a reference
and now that I have the reference you
can actually go to to that thing in the
pool and say okay please do describe for
me and the PO get a bunch of connections
to the database for you so we we can
bring a lot of time and if you're
familiar with other languages they have
very similar thing right they have
connection pools they have trad pools
and they have very similar constructs
right so here is nothing really needed
not doing anything really not over here
but that's just the appearances right I
actually did a bunch of interesting
stuff so in those name is what usually
happens that the manager he is like that
not manager he's the guy that's checking
all the time like hey you do your work
is going to the workers right it's a hey
let's duel I like I used to run the area
do your work properly
it needs to be checking all the time and
here because our running movie we are
running there they work on machine well
we actually who is that we set up a link
right and then the manager can just
relax and if the worker if something
goes wrong the worker and the worker
dies since those things are connected
the manager is going to receive
notifications right and then you can
react to that so we're talking about the
keynotes there I it was about I create a
program it's like what is happening here
I'm checking and exactly 1 ok right when
things go bad the managers going to
receive a message and it can react to
that all right so it's it's a very small
change but it's very important and then
the keynote really expand on that right
I want to do everything even driven
fashion right reacting and the
difference is not only here because
these are very a good improvement it's a
good step but what what the other
languages are doing is that they they
have the manager that's checking this
stuff but it ends up ends up there right
there the connection oh the traffic oh
it's running somewhere in memory that
nobody actually knows where I were
checking it and what happens is the
manager dies right directly is the man
who dies which worse than the worker
dying because if the man is a guy like
the traffic or the production for the
process who is gone ok so we don't end
up here don't end up with the manager
and workers what happens is that the
manager is going to have a supervisor
right it's and it's the supervisor in
your application so application we have
a supervisor that's going to be
supervising the this process tool and
then your issues provider their
supervisor and instead of like maybe
have a worker for correlating statistics
at real time you have some other worker
on the other side and and then start to
look like supervision free
right because the penny where art would
have the supervisor my supervisor many
start to have these tree of workers and
supervisors okay and when something goes
bad they're always asked alleviation and
the supervisor can react on them but if
they say okay that's super nice but who
supervises the supervisors of the
supervisor supervisor what does it end
and it ends with an application okay so
getting the Commission has this idea of
application which is where in fact
everything together and the application
is highly controlled by the runtime so
the runtime knows how to is when to
start when to stop stuff and it's very
highly plastic squeaking everything that
that when we package those things nicely
they're going to get something so I went
into all this thing here just to say
that so if you want to use active right
what I need to do is that your
application needs to have a supervisor
okay it should be part of application
and one of the the things that you want
to supervise is the repository right and
the supervisors going to call it
startling for they're never going to
post our clinic there directly and this
how it looks like so I'm just saying you
know language oh I'm defining a module
which is magnification supervisor and
influence the supervisor behavior and
here we say how we start the application
of going over the details but it is how
I start the supervisor and what the
supervisor does is that it has a worker
which is the repository and I want and
then it could have many workers here
right it's at least so it would have
this worker could have a supervisor that
the supervisor supervises and you know
it could really expand the tree and then
say okay yeah they want to supervise
this tree with the strategy one for all
for example which basically if one dies
I restart everyone everyone
come from scratch and yeah and that's
how I feel like that's how we wire the
neighborhood start together and after
because these are ready to use and enjoy
after so what I talked it here and there
really went at us so I talked about
Paris okay which was where we started
which is where we borrow things from
deep and I talked about there so I said
that link is an inspiration right and a
good inspiration is not only about the
good things you take from it but it's
also the best thing that you don't take
right that you live there and we try to
go to it all that requires and then we
have entities that it's data we have
model represent preview behavior or
repositories they are storage and and
that's the point I want to together that
leaving the things apart I think
ultimately really simplifies the design
if you get like if you get books about
for their comparative enterprise
application that is about putting the
data begins to get power power them
decorate the language is going to talk
to the database right there are a bunch
of issues happening there that is just
trying to align the fact that
object-oriented program is putting the
dating behavior together so how you can
couple that with the database right
there's a bunch of us trying to a new
thing that object or even program is
doing
and here we wanted to do the us
interaction so this one we have we also
are working on associations sorry we
support situations we support code
generators to help you get started we
are working on migrations as well and
yeah that's it thank you very much and
if you have any questions
does anyone have questions so you talked
about models which kind of seem like
objects if you come from object or into
backgrounds so since Alex here is a
functional language could you maybe
highlight some of the key differences
between a model like Sorrento and then
all the exits is nontraditional a big
language okay so so the model here in
this case is just functions so most of
the the third see here it's I borrowed
from the domain for the design thing so
that's why we have a postcard to have
entities which are data with an identity
and the model issues it's kind of the
the place where I put all the behavior
and in this case it's it's they're not
they are not really bundled together
right because every time so this is the
the difference is very subtle but this
is the difference they come back so if
you are for example you see something
like creo that before creating it it is
internally alright it has access to the
data and it can change the data here the
data is being explicitly as argument and
that's the difference right it's it's
not interior fastenings which means that
if in the future because this is not
coupled with everything else if in the
fictional tools is track this call back
to some other place because all the
great thing is the same logic since
there is no coupling between
you're receiving everything's basically
right you're not couples a storage or
not Coco grief anything else and that's
what helps and that's the difference
right it's not having this company
because having
can you elaborate on the curable
protocol what would give its implements
actually okay so the protocol only all
you need to implement is a function
called supari that receives the thing it
needs to return a query structure so if
we go back so if you go back here right
I said that this this thing returns a
party and what is a party a party just
record with information about those
things
so if implement a co carbon that victims
of query you can let in sweet work right
it seems that query and that's why and
that's the current rating for medical
powerful because a car is a car that
just needs returns itself and then those
other things they just do a very simple
thing say okay just permeates if I can
show the source code both of the day
plantations of the park on their means
for any other questions
No well in that case I think the next is
the final session of today the keynote
speech say thank you very much thank you
