working for a building company named
eCos and we're active in the digital oil
field industry we're actually doing
virtual metering surveillance allocation
and start of oil fields and therefore we
have some soft real-time systems so I'm
very lucky that my buzz allowed me to
come here to the conference to learn
more how high availability and and fault
tolerance
for soft real-time systems is done in
the Erlang and Alexia world so I'm very
grateful for that so another advantage
of working for this company at least for
me is that I have this daily recurring
timeslot for myself where I can work on
my own project so actually here this
window that's my mobile office so I have
this time to spend on my own project and
one of my projects as this has some
background so I'm a surfer and I created
my own surfboards and one day I wanted
to create my own surf fins and this is
what I look like and a hat is like okay
I want to create these fins but how can
I get this shape this has to be a
hydrodynamic profile so I do want to
know how to send like plywood or
anything to get to this shape because
you see like a lot of crappy versions of
these fins like this nowhere near a good
shape so this way I created a program
called fin foil and this is on github of
course it's an open-source desktop
application that helps people to
generate these profiles to get your fin
and to help you with building the way
the fin like you wanted to so but you
can do like more stuff with it some
people want to drive real machinery with
it so to produce 3d files and do mass
production all these things so I didn't
want to expose all that logic for mass
production as an open source so I hidden
that behind a web page so what's the
process for people to
Finn so let's go through it so here you
have the application and I took the
elixir Kampf logo really then and said
like let's make the elixir conference
fin so I create this fin and then I say
save the file as okay go to the web page
browse put in the file okay I get this
permalink because I store everything I
want to see what people create and then
you can download it and of course don't
forget donate afterwards so when you did
that you get like this 3d model of your
fin for the LXE logo you can download
that too by the way so if you take this
presentation from get up you can just
click the link and then you go to your
local machine shop and this is I'm not
mistaken this is Peter and Camille these
are guys from this neighborhood and they
printed actually the LXE logo for us
today so here we have two versions of
this logo
so at the end of this presentation I
like to give one to Jose I want to Jim
for organizing the event so also big
thanks to Marco in this room the guy
from ever camp because he spent today to
forget this
this thing's printed alright so what do
I have today so oh it's falling off but
you see most of it so today I have this
application written in C++ and I have
this REST API also written in C++ so
it's kind of a horrible situation
because if the thing crashes the whole
thing is down
however it's now running for like six
months so without any issues so well I'm
gonna be trying some new technologies
like Erlang and elixir and this is like
the libraries that I tried to do inter
process communication so I can have
these thin foil application being
managed
like in Erlang or nearly clear process
so if it crashes I can just handle that
so to finalize my talk I'd like to give
you this piece of code that my wife
wrote me yesterday so she has no
background in programming and she like
spawn the link and let's send my
boyfriend the message and so she has no
background in programming then she said
here in Dutch oh this is really easy to
read this is LX 0 I'm totally with it
I'm totally following so there's no
question that LX 0 is easy to learn
right okay thank you that's my dog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
