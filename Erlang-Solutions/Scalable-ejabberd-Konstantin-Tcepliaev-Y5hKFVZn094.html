Constantine and I'm going to tell you a
couple of words about Yandex see
jeopardy folk and what we've done to
make it make it scalable robust and
fault tolerance first of all probably
all of you know about jeopardy jeopardy
is stands for LNG / demon it is an xmpp
server XMPP is an instant messaging
protocol previously known as Jabba it is
written in ln and for data storage it
uses nisha for temporary data news also
can be used for persistent data or
persistent data can be stored in ODBC
data base while using a jeopardy at
Yandex while we started using it we've
discovered that it is too naive when
your installation includes only two or
three machines and several thousand
connections everything works well but
when your installation becomes large if
you use it on tens of consider its
faulty machines that you can fail and
you have hundreds of thousands of
connections then problems start to
emerge at Yandex we use each other d as
as an xmpp IM server obviously also we
use it as a became for our web chat at
the end ex mail we use it as a transport
for our mobile mail applications for
iphone and android and we use it for
push notifications for Yandex disco
cloud file search service
and the issues with the Jeopardy that we
discovered are following first it uses
direct message passing to protest
identifiers without any grantees simply
using explanation mark which probably of
all of you already know second issue is
that memory consumption of each apart is
a bit large I can say that it is
unusable bitten because of it but each
memory footprint can be slightly less
I'll talk about that in getting detail
later and it uses manisha based storage
which as I'll show doesn't really scale
to first issue and that is my message
passing in ln if remote node goes down
and you try to send a message to a
process that is suited on that note that
message is lost you don't get any
acknowledgement on or an error on
whether the message show was delivered
on not the same is for local processes
if the process itself had already died
you won't receive any error or
confirmation of delivery basically there
is no method to know where the message
was received by destination process or
not and when you use the jeopardy in
distributed environment that becomes a
problem our first thought to fix this
issue was to use synchronous message
passing sent events to other processes
synchronously but after some tasting and
some thought I discovered that it
obviously includes receiving reply
which is of course another message it is
synchronous so when you call the
protests you need to wait for timeout
which is five second by default and we
decided that synchronous calls are
unacceptable for this dusk our second
thought was to separate the messages and
beats to local those running on the same
note as the calling process and remote
using note functional obviously for
local messages we check the process for
a lioness and if it is a live recent
message directly otherwise retakes on
fire failover action depending on the
message and for remote nodes we sent the
messages to to the registered process on
that note which deals with that message
accordingly the same as with local
messages and in this scheme in those
those released process EG BDSM session
manager can become a bottleneck to
reduce the load on the process we
decided to separate the messages we
separate them into critical which is
message stanzas obviously that is
messages drive msgs not run messages but
i am messages they are critical they
must be stored in offline storage if no
client the user / is available and we
used that scheme with DJ BDSM for
message stances and for IQ and presence
stanzas we used the whole scheme with
direct message passing and age a BDSM
can still become a bottleneck if message
it would increase someday in the future
now it's not a problem for our
installation and it can be obviously
fixed by setting the process high
priority or replacing it with some kind
of process pool that's all about the
first issue let's continue with memory
consumption Ln client process client
connection process its state consists of
four near thirty fields which person
then are used only during initial three
negotiation you're in user connection
authorization and they are not used
during prods lifetime later after a
lifetime it's the first issue the second
issue that is something called
subscription lists are always stored in
state and that is pretty large data
structure and the third problem is that
receiver is another process separate
from situates that these two processes /
play / clients and maybe they may be
joined into first issue is large state
we decided to fix this we decided to
split the client brought this into
combat module it's called back module
into each with their own States we used
generic fsm for the initial string
negotiation and then we switch to
generic server using generic server and
the loop function notice the hibernate
option that gives us free bonus
hibernate option 3 guests garbage
collection on that process thus reducing
memory footprint slightly more
the second issue is subscription list
subscription lists is the data structure
that stores information about contacts
with which our quiet our user should
exchange presences presence information
and there is no need for them when user
dance doesn't send presences we have
technical connections for Yandex mobile
mail for push notifications and
subscription lists aren't needed there
and we decided to implement the lazy
retrieval we currently retrieve them
only when presence is sent by the client
separate receiver process it's asim does
not in but receives TCP messages from
socket this process controls the socket
and since decoded xml messages to client
process itself that is obviously an
overhead and we decided to eliminate
that process and to let serious grind
process control the J to control the
socket and do everything a Cleveland
according xml and the receiving those
TCP messages and after doing all that we
discovered that our average memory
consumption for one situation ection had
reduced nearly 40-percent to
approximately half a megabyte let me
stress that this is not about process
hip or something this is just operating
system memory footprint of eloehiem
divided by number of connections on this
note that is it includes important data
port drivers data it includes some
system ets tables I don't know and
second
that we achieved here is that database
load has it could also drop slightly
thanks to our persistent data base load
thanks to that lazy retrieval of
subscriber subscription lists
and that's all about memory now Tunisia
manisha actually is a transactional
database built-in into Ellen standard
package while using it we discovered
that as as long as it's transactional it
doesn't scale after some limit because
you need to propagate propagates all
your rights to all other nodes to return
from the operation it doesn't survive
brain splits actually after brain split
when you can cluster machines do too and
some kind of network outage you're
clusters become split into each part
after their joining they each part of
the cluster cannot secretly synchronize
with another next note that a fatal too
if you your matching physical machine
had failed you cannot remove it from the
skin easily and add another and you
cannot reinstate those note on another
machine if your data is lost and
basically any inconsistency in Asia
Indonesia up is fatal let's subjective
that's all subjective to Yandex I don't
know maybe we can just we just cannot
deal with nisha but this is so and we
decided to replace it with MongoDB
probably someone view some of you
already know MongoDB it is a key-value
storage with the eventual consistency
with mechanisms for failover and load
balancing it kills itself after Prince
blitz by electing the master of replica
sets and
replicating data using a block and it
has thanks to those replicas sets and
the Chardon it has a theoretical
unlimited scalability
well the first try with mongodb was in
late 2010 it was manga version 1.2 they
were still no replica sets there was
something called replica pairs involving
only two notes and they were unstable
shouting we will implemented manual
shouting in session manager using
allocation function on user names and
you will implement it replica players
with mustard master to master scheme
with only one a replica active at the
moment that is all reads and writes go
to only one replica and the other is
used this fellow as a failover and we
also implemented TTS education of local
sessions on each node net scheme alert
well until early 2012 when we started
discovering some issues with it actual
version of MongoDB that time was Mongo
2.0 2.1 and I discovered that our
requests per second limits the manga
note those masternodes in replica fire
reached limit was reached and master to
master scheme has become obsolete to
that moment by MongoDB developers and we
started encountering strange very
strange replication deadlock in which
was very hard to predict and investigate
the cause of it and we decided to try a
replica sets to discard master to master
application and to try replica sets all
database requests as we thought they
needed to retrieve all this consistent
data so we thought that we can not rely
on reading from replicas and secondary
replicas and we've kept them just for
failover with this moment ninja was
removed
lately from a jeopardy jeopardy stopped
the Bengie knowledge at all and the
problem with the requests per second
rate and master it was still the same
and statutory in continue to encounter
in requests on Biggs unload pics and
finally with after some totes we figured
that consistent session session data
user session data is used is needed only
here in one case from while retrieving
sessions of contacts to send them
initial presence and that all other
cases you may have inconsistent data and
that's okay that's completely okay and
we've implemented this scheme using
MongoDB slave okie version option and
after doing all this nearly sixty
percent of full request go to secondary
notes our all rights obviously accrue to
primaries with Charlene we shall Don
username and this cluster a jeopardy
cluster and mongodb cluster they both
easily survive for brain splits they
survive work out ages survive physical
machine debts and mice abuser reconnect
so let word problems and
after doing all this we see huge
potential for horizontal scaling of our
system and the scale a bit limit is
actually as I think sky high in case
that anyone has any questions feel free
to ask that's all with my talk anyone
why you use manga to be at the if you
if you have some problems with scanning
and you actually done that doesn't use
any transactional properties of database
why you use MongoDB instead of Iraq for
example we show in the will bring would
bring less
impedance between systems talking about
react yeah I back in 2010 react was
still not so popular and and mongodb was
gaining popularity that time and I
actually don't know why which we've
chosen MongoDB because we just didn't do
any tests a involving react and mongodb
this is so just just reused MongoDB
thanks
network solutions have made a broad
branch ave jeopardy that used only by
pinner ease and they have gained about
thirty percent decrease in memory usage
you use it it will use this branch I
know we use pretty ancient folk might
sometime in two thousand seven or eight
I don't actually remember and I know
about ending solutions they used beaner
is instead of lists across the Jeopardy
no we don't use that those branch
hi well actually I've got two questions
one specifically on mon général so
about specific question if I got you
right when you are talking about solving
the reliable message little plop problem
yes you said that you have to take took
two different approaches one for local
messages and another one three and four
loko messages you first check if the
target node is life then send the
message using standard penetration rate
or we use we check that process is alive
and if it is we send using ! inside
message hand how's that solving makes
your message sending life because the
target node may die right after you
check
that doesn't solve the problem
completely but it decreases chances that
the message is lost that decreases those
chances
yes but it doesn't
you cannot you cannot be sure that
message was delivered unless you receive
some confirmation from from process some
acknowledgement and that's too cold the
cost is too much of receiving it and you
need to timeout and the I don't know so
you allow some messages just yes yes
that is trade-off between timing out and
delivery oh yes and another question
apparently Yandex uses Erlang least four
month much but all this language is
actually popular inside yummies
sorry oh how popular this man Jesus he's
a good father while planning this
conference then there was a joke bahria
came to one of our employees and said
Timson longest are coming and Timson
replied what all three of them there are
three tonnelle and developers yandex and
we use it the on I don't know three
projects currently two projects so then
why we event is happening
I don't know
I see thank
hello welcome to thank you for
presenting us this interesting results
you know um if it's not a very big
secret what are the numbers so what are
the number nodes and what is the number
of requests per second number of nodes
is several tens I cannot be more
specific story and requests per second
rate on stateful system and it is almost
impossible to measure that because you
cannot think about a request instead
full system there are persistent
connections yes there are several
hundred thousands of them but requests I
I don't know what what you can call
request request in I am server I say
thank you thank you

Getchell new pal because of very large
number of those monitors mm when you
have some several hundred thousand

through inclined to serve truth to
station manager a message she had
arrived from somewhere intro session
manager that is one tricky step process
and you need to send that message to
someone known another note if you try to
set a monitor on the owner on those note
that involves sending messages to and if
I recall correctly those messages are
sent using net colonel rick is the
process of a long vm which can become a
bottleneck those windows scheme and i've
tried that actually and it's just fails
