are embarrassed to introduce me okay so
I got to start off by saying that this
is a work in progress I think there is
something really deep and fundamental in
here and yet I can't quite put my finger
on it so giving the talk is actually a
way of helping me try to clarify my
thinking so I appreciate you all being
guinea pigs and I would really
appreciate your feedback on it um okay
supposed to applaud at the end of the
talk okay now this actually is a thank
you to the people here because I owe an
awful lot of the pleasure in my life to
the work that people you know at this
conference have done you know the Erlang
core a whole bunch of people working on
same nerves which is my current joy and
even Larry wall has given me a certain
couple nights ago fantastic amount of
pleasure and I've also changed to the
future of computing for us all so I
would say thank you and I want to think
about just the people I talked about
right these are people have changed
history and you know we're all kind of
like old kind of great beauty kind of
people but you know what these people
kind of know what they're talking about
and what tends to happen over time if
these old people get new people come
along you might want to think about this
as Erlang and elixir
and the problem for the Erlang folks is
elixir currently has the ring so what I
want to do actually is to is to go back
and look and honest some of that
experience because ice elixir folks we
tend to go around things we go really
cool language alright and ignore a whole
bunch of the really important stuff that
we knew in the past and I think this new
stuff actually comes forward and applies
to what we should be doing tomorrow just
to prove that I am also one of those old
farts here is a picture from I think 71
or 72 of be my friend Toby Bailey the
caption says programming analog computer
actually it was turned off at the time
you were just looking like so let's talk
about some old stuff right this is all
going to lead up to these ideas I've got
about how is your program today but I
just want to get some history and some
background into it so state machines we
all know what a state machine is right
it's a way of pausing a stream of events
we start with an initial state an event
comes along and depending on that state
that we're in that invent makes us go to
a different state potentially and that
just repeats over and over and over
again until we're done a classic example
is like one of these push-button locks
so let's imagine that the code for this
lock was 1 3 1 this would be one of
those cool I hate programming challenges
for job interviews I don't think anyone
should ever do them I've never done one
but this is actually a cool one to set
as a programming challenge because my
guess is about 80% of the people would
actually get it wrong because you can
actually unlock it obviously by giving
it 131 you can also unlock it by giving
it eight one seven one three one and you
can unlock it by giving it three one
three one the trick one though is that
one because if you're just looking for a
one followed by a three followed by one
then you're going to bolt out on the
second one go back and it's just not
going to work
most people get that wrong but doing
this at the state machine is really easy
except it's not okay first of all I
apologize this is Ruby code but who
cares this is how many people would code
a state machine so what it is is
basically we have an instance variable
here state and then we have a function
that accepts the next event and
depending on what state were in we look
at the event and say ah in that case I
want to go to the next state and change
my current state and we just do that for
each of the possible state it's code
like this that makes people think they
need to go out and find a library to do
state machines right I have no idea why
people do that as you'll see in a minute
you don't actually need it but this is
what people code I prefer to do it like
this a state machine is simply a hash
and associative array a dictionary and
in this case I'm using the state whoa
I'm using the state as we sorry that the
key is the state and then for each state
I have another hash which says if I get
a 1 then transition to that state if I
get a 1 here transition to that state
now and my entire event handler thing is
I just basically go from the transition
from the current state indexed by the
key and if it doesn't match then I'm
just going to go back to my default
State
so that's kind of easier so let's take
it a step further let's add in some
external real world stuff because one
thing state machines don't talk about is
actually interacting with the real world
so let's make it do that here I have
added what some people might call a
model
alright the outside world and in this
case it's contraindicated in the lock
and or you use a pass of the color it
turns light on so I've invented my
little state machine language here to
add the ability to put not just the next
state but also the next state and a
function to invoke as I transition to
that state and its really pretty
lightweight the only thing that happens
is event in the last waiting for a while
and I get the one now I am unlocked and
I will set the lead degree otherwise my
default transition which me Sallee means
I've always go back to the start state
is set the lead back to red and by doing
that you always go red if you get it
wrong so let's take that one step
further same code but split up a bit
more so now I have my model which is the
thing that my state machine is
manipulating I have my set of rules
which is what the state machine actually
does then I have a generic finite state
machine it knows nothing about locks and
leads or anything all it knows is you
pass it a set of rules and it does the
business so what actually is a
transition well at the simplest a
transition is just an input in the state
that produces a new state and along the
way it's going to execute an action
potentially you might ask yourself what
is the program exactly the same thing if
you went to like you know computer
science 101 at some point a professor
sit there and Drew's a picture on a
board right input Aero processor output
or something like that and that's what
we're looking at here so a state machine
is really a whole bunch of little small
nested programs this is where we're
after getting to in the end it's you
know pretty straightforward online order
processing you can see how that works in
this case our state is the session where
if we're talking to Twitter or something
so my assertion is that a program is a
deeply nested set of individual
transitions and each one takes an input
in the state and produces a new state
and possibly an updated input and you'll
see why I say that in a minute so this
is the kind of the only diagram you need
to program right if your
those people that loves doing you know
UML and class diagrams on what kind of
stuff right well here is your new your
new Nirvana right and that's all it is
and the cool thing about it is you'll
notice the output and input are the same
so you can change them as much as you
want they compose it's not wonderful so
you can look at something like this this
is a deliberately ugly example just to
show it can be done right so here we're
calculating something to do with an
order which sort of terminating or
finalizing an order for him to go
through it and do all sorts of things to
it and you'll see what we're doing is
we're gradually go through and we are
taking the inputs and using it to
produce suitors of outputs now here is
the thing that's really important this
looks like I'm describing the flow
through a program but I'm not there is
nothing about time in that flow all I am
doing is saying that if I have this as
my current state then I can execute that
if I don't yet have this then I got to
hang around for a little bit so even
though this shows you the dependencies
of State in reality each of these could
be a totally isolated freerunning
process that's just waiting for as the
correct set of inputs to come along for
it to be able to do its thing there is
no time element in this kind of
programming and that's the key
because one of the things that we try to
do when we're coding what Thomas's rule
of good design right is a good design is
easier to change that a bad design right
as far as I'm concerned that's the only
rule of program design and one of the
ways we make our designs better is by
reducing coupling and one of the things
that we do with functional programming
is we have a really major bit of
decoupling in that we decouple our state
from our functions and although that's
kind of scary if you come from an oil
background it turns out to be remarkably
liberating and I think that's one of the
main reasons that functional programs
are easier to change but we still have
coupling in our functional program and
the coupling is this kind of insidious
temporal thing that I'm going to do this
then that than the other now outside its
particular process obviously we don't
have that on the beam but inside each
chunk of code inside each function we
still say a then B then C then D and
that is coupling that we don't need so
how do we code this well too many people
hand code it we could code it as a state
machine I think we have the opportunity
to do something better than I think we
can code these transitions using pattern
matching I always used to use Fibonacci
numbers as my examples of pattern
matching and then some mathematician
said Oh Lucas numbers are way cooler
right and the only difference is that
rather than having one one it's one
three right so so this is pattern
matching calculating the Lucas numbers
and okay everybody seen this every knows
this code will do this kind of stuff
right the cool thing here obviously is
we have no conditional code nor do we
have any sequencing that says you have
to do this in this and this it just
happens that way because things only
trigger when their preconditions are met
here's our lock expressed using pattern
matching so we have a group of functions
here none of which has a very real
parameter they're all fixed parameters
but it's exactly the same thing and the
nice thing about this is because they're
all functions I can return the next
state through along the way I can also
have side effects like setting the light
to green I code a lot like that in my
everyday coding right and it was kind of
looking at code like that that led me to
think about some other things and it
also came about because increasingly
over the last couple of years I don't
know about you but this word reduce and
reducers and stuff has become like you
know the new object orientation or
something it's a really big buzzword
right everyone's talking about
reductions and reducers and you can't
have a JavaScript framework nowadays
unless you've got reducers in there
right so a reducer is that right it's a
function that takes an input in this
state and produces the new state that's
all a reducer is why is it called a
reducer because it is the function it's
the signature of the function that you
pass to reduce and it was going to be
called a fold Eller but no one could
pronounce fold Eller so they called it
reducer instead
so in this chunk of code which is our
lock FSM here is our entire state
machine alright this is why you don't
have to go and buy a library to do state
machines it's called reduce all right
enum dot reduce initial state is you
initialize the lock and then we just
feed it through lot except until it
finishes nothing else to do
and there are our reducers they take a
input and a current state and produce a
new state so our reducers implement
transition that look like that and I'm
about to extend them to look like that
so why should we code with reducers well
firstly it tends to lead to incredibly
small little self-contained functions
functions that are really easy to
understand it gets rid of this shared
state between lines of code right my my
personal view is a variable is a smell
and if you can get rid of your variables
then you've actually improved your code
I find it a lot easier to read it's
incredibly easier to test because all
you're doing is testing one-line
functions by feeding a particular state
and input and making sure you get a
particular output so easy in fact I
don't bother to test them anymore and
they are easier to reuse so okay say
hello to Dobbin Dobbin is a horse that
we're about to beat to death so the sum
of an empty list is zero alright here's
our reducer it doesn't actually have any
input otherwise the sum of the head of
the list blah blah blah you will know
this so here we have list something
written using exactly that pattern right
it all just works and the pattern
matching is going to do the state
transitions to get to the end where we
finish and it's all wonderful why am i
showing this well I'm showing this
because when you explain this in a book
or something you end up showing a bit of
code that looks something like this yeah
you're trying to exit you're trying to
examine how it works or explain how it
works so you kind of expand it out like
this so you could write our code using
the new universal preadly notation as
simply as this you'll have an input
put and the state becomes the empty
input and the new value okay so here's
where the whole speaking company I
didn't draw it it's not me I didn't draw
it okay so I now know how to please you
guys I'm gonna go more dead animals all
right okay so there's something really
obvious but interesting about this here
is our state and in general terms here
is our time first thing to notice is it
doesn't have to be in that order it can
be in any order you want but it happens
to ask you in that order but the really
cool thing is if you add up the input
and add up and add it to the output you
always get the same number 16 well duh
of course you do but that idea leads us
the idea of invariance now if you are
old and gray like me then when you went
to college you learnt about program
proving you know back before they
decided they couldn't actually do it and
you learned about how to program using
invariants and invariant was basically a
statement of what is true at this
particular point all right you say this
is the sorry regardless of the values in
the state this relationship holds
between them and if you can use that and
a whole lot of time you can actually
prove that an if statement sometimes
does what you want it to do right
totally waste of time long term however
thinking about invariance leads to
really nice bits of design because the
more you can think about invariant the
tighter you can make your loops the
easier you can know it's going to work
or not work whatever so my point is that
a correctly implemented reducer is going
to transform state while maintaining
the invariant right it's obviously the
case with some but I think what we're
looking at here is a wider picture so
this is my most pretentious slide ever
the most important thing in programming
truth is conserved I'm sorry they're not
dead actually they are they're stuffed
there's what you couldn't get all three
to sit in the same place like that
otherwise give you that took me forever
all right so the law of conservation of
truth unless your name is Kellyanne
truth is neither created nor destroyed
it merely changes its representation
yeah you're never ever going to be able
to change truth that's kind of
definition of it yeah but you can
certainly change the way you represent
it and that is all that programming is
all of programming nothing apart from
maintaining truth from beginning to end
so some can serve that truth it can
transforms our state but it conserves
the truth all right okay you say big
deal anyone can write a sum why do we
care we care for the same reason we care
about any programming practice and that
is a good programming practice informs
you it doesn't just let you get away
with something it actually tells you
this is good this is bad it helps you
write better code for any definition is
better you want apart from probably Jose
who would say it's not quality but it's
going to be
it this idea leads to some really
interesting code and so I started
playing around with this and used a
framework called diet which is not a
framework sorry I used a really crappy
little library called diet that I enjoy
playing with it doesn't stand for
anything unless you want it to but it's
called diet because it's all about
reductions so come back to our some of
the list I promise I think this is a
last time I sum a list you can you give
me a quick time check to learn how much
is plenty I will carry on what his check
so here's a our set of truths if you
like to sending a list we know that we
have in our whole universe here we have
a list and we have a result we know that
at all times with some of the elements
in the list plus the result is a
constant I'll worship and we know that
we finish when the list is empty
okay now I'll show you that in code let
me show it to you in diet so diet is
simply some macros in elixir that you
express that in kinda like a more
compact form so in my module I use diet
transformations which is what you guys
are and I have a series of reductions so
here I'm saying okay so I'm tending to
use the first element of a tuple is like
a verb but let's just you know it stops
you getting it to some ugly kind of like
circular things so here I'm saying to
Sun a list well the fact was we have to
have a list and a result and here we
don't have a result all we have is a
list so the first thing we have to do is
to add our result in right so we're
going to sum into our list what value
does a result have well we know that the
sum of the list such a result have to be
the same as the sum of the list so it
has to be zero no choice
next the sum of the elements of the list
plus the result is constant so hearing
at a Sun into a list that has a head of
and tail into the result and I do the
obvious thing and then finally if I
going into an AC list then there's my
result again not dramatically
new so how does this actually execute
well I have a thing called diet dr.
pepper and you pass it one of those
descriptions so in this case it was in
the module list some so I pass that
module in and I pass in an initial state
which in this case they don't care about
and then I just run my stepper and I
pass it the initial event so the initial
event in this case is some 1 2 3 and how
does that then work well the stepper
basically looks at this as a big pool of
challenges and it goes into this pool
and says ok which one can I match and
the first limit matches it's going to
execute so in this case it's going to
match the sum list and it's going to
produce a new fad which is some into
list 0 it hasn't finished yet because
now it's going to take that new one and
go back into this list and look for
another one that matches or look for any
one that matches
so in that case this one doesn't match
this one does so it's going to apply
this one we're going to sum into we're
going to do something new etc etc
eventually it's going to get to this guy
down here some into the empty list with
the result returns the result but now
the result doesn't match anything so the
stepper goes not my problem and passes
it back to you and that's why when you
run that you get the results come back
out again let's make that slightly more
Oh actually know what let's actually
yeah let's do it
alright live code time
okay so with any luck at all I actually
have stepper aliased here yep all right
so I am going to produce a new stepper
and I can't remember what I told it this
lump it was example that with some and
no state okay ignore that that's just
implementation right so now I'm going to
use the result and the state a new state
by running stepper don't run on that
stepper and I'm going to pass it some oh
let's be different three two one
all right and honestly I don't care
about the state at the end of this all I
care about is the result so I'm just
going to put the are there so it just
displays the result and I got something
wrong
yay there's my result okay but no no no
no no wait
all right I'm English so I'm bound by
contract to say but wait there's more
all right because this stepper is not
just executing code if I was to say diet
dot debug and ask it to debug that
particular step stepper it'll say okay
I'm now looking at example dot list some
and one of the interesting things I can
do is say hey show me a trace of what
actually happened and here it's showing
me the set of things that actually went
through to produce that result yeah and
if I wanted to I could dig into any one
of those and it shows me you know the
details of what actually happened
I can also well let me show you that
later on okay so let me take another
example let me get out of there
slightly more complicated example this
line I use all the time just because
it's just that bit more complicated than
summing and that is you're given a list
of things and you want to run lengths
encoded so if you have a run of same
values in the input list you want to
replace it with the value and account in
a tuple and the reason I like this is
it's another one of those programming
challenges where you give it to people
and typically they'll get it wrong first
time they get most of it right but
there's always boundary conditions that
throw people off the most common one
that confuses people is what happens if
the run ends at the end of the list and
have to handle that as a special case or
something yeah if you're writing lots of
ifs and loops in this kind of stuff
so instead let's just ask what is true
well help just like everything else
we're going to change our input into our
output and we know that if we really
take our input as it currently stands
and our output as it currently stands
and concatenate them it will always be
the same yeah and then when the input
becomes empty the output will be the run
length encoding list and there's a few
other things we know we know that if our
list starts with a duplicated value
we're going to replace it with that
value and a to and if our list this is
the wrong way around I just noticed it's
our list started with one of those
duplication things and then has an a
after it we're going to bump the count
and move onto the next one
so here is our runner length encoding
written using that reduction style so
the same thing we have to do in the
previous one we have to create ourselves
the output pyeong we're not passed it so
we're going to say RLE of a list is our
only other list plus an empty list
ignore that one here we have the case
where the first two elements the lists
are the same so what we're going to do
is going to replace those four
two elements with the a and a two if we
have one of those tuples followed by the
same value a that we just bumped the
count otherwise we copy the input to the
output and the cool thing about this is
you want to talk about if you write like
this is so easy to reason about the code
we guarantee that this thing is going to
terminate because on every single match
we're removing something from the input
we have no choice but to terminate and
it works it does from top to bottom just
like Erlang analyst to do and yes it
does yeah so the order of execution does
not matter the order in which it matches
does if that makes sense right
so it doesn't actually execute each one
of these things in turn and we're not
giving it a season to execute in but we
are also saying this as a higher
priority than that so again we can do
oh I don't have a early that's why is
the example the early yes okay and then
I can do our comer s equals step adult
run s and I'll give it some input 1 2 2
2 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 7 8
why not okay and I'm just interested in
the result Oh interesting
I didn't give it the command orally I
just passed the list so it went sure I
don't recognize that have it back okay
so I'm going to put our Huntress
this is a feature not a bug I thought it
was a bug but last time I actually gave
this a very very different variation
this talk in Chicago two nights ago and
someone says oh that's really cool
because that way you can code and when
you miss things it will report it back
to you yeah exactly right
ah all right what am I doing wrong
oh it's in code in code sorry about that
I knew it was going to well
yeah nil desperandum all right so and
again though right this is a little
complex example so let's use our
debugger again and that's a look at the
trace this time whoa all right let's
shrink that down a bit
do it again and that didn't help all
right sorry about that
take my word for it it's a lot of stuff
but this shows you every single step it
took along the way which means that if
you have an arrow if you have a bug
which of course you're not going to have
this kind of way doing things but if you
did have a bug it's going to be very
easy to see why you didn't pick up that
extra two or whatever it might be
because you can just see it in each one
of the transitions so let's really push
the boat out these are all kind of like
vaguely academic things but let's look
for the real world right and what's more
important in the real world than a game
of hangman
so let's write a step of version of the
game of hangman let me see if I may
actually have this on the slide yes so
this is the game of hangman expressed as
a set of reductions like the door lock
it actually uses an external state and
in this case the state is the module
that holds things like oh it's not as
module the structure the whole thing
like the current word to guess the
number of guesses that you've taken all
that kind of stuff right it's all stored
in our state and in our reductions the
state is such an important thing that I
just make it available for free so I'm
here I call model name game and that
means in all of our reductions I can use
game and that's just going to refer to
the model and the model at the top here
i tells diet that I'm using hangman
model as my model and I'm going to call
it hm because I can't type hangman model
all the time and otherwise and it just
runs through here and again the order it
actually executes in the order it
matches in is palpable
but the older excuse in who knows but
because it starts off by making to make
a move first thing it does is ask the
model how I already use this letter
right if I have already used this letter
it could just respond to already tried
otherwise it's going to set our new
state to record move and pass in the
move and record move is going to go oh I
need to update the model so it
explicitly says update the model and I
do that because they hate that I do this
because I think it's important to show
people when you're updating the model
and when you're not because you look at
this a little to things update the model
than all of this right and that's a big
thing so you don't to read the whole
thing and it'll be on the slides when I
get around to publishing them but the
idea is this actually will execute a
game of hangman and it's really cool so
let stress you go try and run that
hangman okay now if you if you want to
keep the suspense avert your eyes what I
type the word we're going to get I do
home version that uses a dictionary and
I just hate losing in front of a crowd
of people so all right so there's our
there's our word so let's start running
it R comma s equals step or dot run s
comment what do I call it make move
and I'm not cheating I'll just start
with an A yeah
and again I'm don't care about the new
state I just want to keep look at the
result hey it was a good guess right not
exactly the best user interface but we
can build on that so let's try something
else let's go a B alright that's a
strategy you start at a and you go to
yin-yang go guess clearly it's the best
strategy we can use so let's keep going
while runner on a roll here let's try
see damn all right we have a bad gift
and I don't like that right because I
really want to be perfect I mean who
doesn't so let's just go back into our
debugger here Oh doc debug s all right
and here is the list of states that we
went through to get to what happened the
numbering system here is 100 n dot n
this means this is the first time I
called it and then inside that it
actually run a ran eight separate
transition then here it ran eight again
here ran it again okay so and you can
see that at the end of my transition
here one point eight I got a good guess
yay you'll also notice that this'll dot
changes to an arrow on some of them that
indicates the states changed on those
particular ones so in fact if I get a
bug that's something - the state change
I could do something like let's have a
look at two point three and it shows me
that what happened was I've added a B to
the list of guest things yes it
highlights the changes that make sense
it goes along now I got this problem
that I made a mistake and I don't like
making mistakes so you know what I can
do I can clone my history up to a
certain point so let me close my history
let me just remove this - plug up to two
point eight
all right you'll notice now that has
changed from hangman zero to hangman one
that means that I'm on my second copy of
hangman my clone right and now I can
start making moves if I could remember
how you do that
I know second that that uh our that's
right
so let's our make move so I had well I
have that a B let's do em good guess
let's how was our history now ha I now
have just three states and it went
straight from B to M I'm perfect right
and we can finish that off
so our unless you just do that oh T W
game one all right this is actually
really pretty cool
the fact that I can go back and Buzz
inspect history but also fork it and
then move forward is great imagine for
example you have a server where the
state is kind of expensive to set up
then what you could do is run to that
states that at once and then fork and
now you've got everybody else shares
that initial setup yeah if you need
auditability not a problem and it's
obvious implementation issues like
potentially this is an infinitely long
list and your small details like that
but that's that's tractable you know
there are many ways to compression this
down first thing I can do is replace
each of the individual sub steps with a
compressed version once it gets to a
certain size and I'll I can do more and
more and more compression and get it
down pretty pretty tight accept the fact
that the further back you go in history
the more granular it becomes
so my point is that programming is
transformations and that's what we need
to think about nested composable
transformations and the rule for
programming is number one work out what
should be true number two
make it true and we call that
establishing the initial conditions if
you're a rails programmer you call it
validates prison salt or something like
that right it's what you do to get your
data into a state where you can trust it
and then your only job is to keep it
true as you make lots of transformations
and if you do that your programs will be
correct so this is the slide I would use
if this is a PhD presentation
programming is reducing input to output
in the presence of state yeah this is
the slide I would use if I was jane
austen programming is truth but the
slide I would use if I am me is
programming should be fun thank
Oh God of course it is
I'm confident exactly yes because
everyone can't give me a history thing
that I can do like that not in nug the
point I'm trying to make is and what I
showed the great no I am that's why I
showed your Gandalf haven't you worked
that out yet no Gandalf right what a
night yeah right yeah was it two years
see no the thing I'm trying to get to
here is that all this stuff none of this
stuff is new right I mean you know the
Elm folk like to think oh we we've
invented weed oceans and stuff no they
didn't I mean that was 1958 probably or
something stupid like that all right no
none of us is new and when I've said
that what I'm doing is honoring the past
what I'm saying is I'm going back to the
things yes erlang can do and prologue
could do before it yeah but what I'm
trying to do is to put it into a context
where now we can look at this in a
bigger picture and start using it as a
tool right so it's not just a question
of saying yeah Erlang could do this
Erlang could do all of this any of this
assembler could do any of this in all of
this right it's really dispersion of how
you think about it how does the language
encourage you to think about things and
what I'm thinking is or what I believe
is that if I make it easier to think
about things in terms of reducers people
are more likely to use them and if
that's how they do things then I think
the quality of program will increase so
I'm not in any way saying that this is
brand new
absolutely no you're doing a test every
time you have an equals that has a fixed
value on both sides I love you anyway
Joe anybody else know cuz you're I could
go on all night like this we forget Oh
[Laughter]
kind of why particularly so are you
saying you want to see a javascript
interpreter written using this style or
do you want to see this style written in
JavaScript I don't see why I couldn't a
part of the fact that I'm probably
likely to die before I'd finish or kill
myself what was it but actually it does
it does lend itself very well to that
form of problem because when you think
about it house transforms are
fundamentally what we're doing right so
we're pausing we're matching a pattern
and then we're doing something with that
pattern so you could actually see many
of that kind of problem so interestingly
I wrote a markdown Towser it's kind of
like a sod off as a pet project it's
like one of my challenges when I learn a
new language is to write a mouth
campfire in it and I wrote it in elixir
and it was one of the first large elixir
programs I wrote and it's not written
using that notation because I didn't
have it but it's actually written using
pretty much that style so everything is
done as a match followed by a new state
and it works a treat and it really does
work well but JavaScript may be kind
leave that as an exercise to the reader
