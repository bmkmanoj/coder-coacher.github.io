consulting and well whatever it is it's
a in Germany is typically everything
which is not to enterprise Java is
leading edge so I'm trying to
concentrate on this and i'm working in
projects with software like korea can
neo4j and things like that so I'm also
writing books and it's a hobby because
it doesn't really pay off financially to
write books they all are in German the
current one of market is running OTP the
German book is there a German speaker
around you're a German speaker you're
you're a German speaker so we have two
German speakers seriously um hey by the
end of the presentation I want to get
rid of this coffee so uh I'll probably
ask a very technical question and
probably in German just to check if you
really can't speak German basically it's
eighty percent erling so uh everybody
can manage to read this book and yeah so
this is the story behind this book and
then currently I'm writing a book which
is related to to the topic of this talk
but it's a little bit different it's
called big data for IT decision-makers
it's a one-level about the technology
and for people who are barely rarely
touching the keyboard but still make IT
relevant decisions um and it's on big
data so this is also the topic of this
talk
so here's here's the short story this is
a book itself that thick for those of
you who did read it probably it cannot
read it it's a tall so it's a war and
peace I think it's called Warren Pearson
English so the short story is i'm
sitting at the conference well actually
accidentally i stumbled into this
conference it's in the industrial IT
conference in germany and the guy from
the company called attend city is
talking about his solution their
solution they're selling it to big
customers for on to big customers with
three letters in the name two letters
probably and they all have like twitter
teams they are running twitter teams
just to check if people are bashing
around about that products so when
everybody when anybody on social media
somewhere on facebook on Twitter just
says hey iphone as so somebody has
to react and this is this Twitter team
and it's like he's presenting it in a
way it looks like magic for people who
are not familiar with concept and like
you know with the live demonstration of
something well he says here are live
tweets they are just popping up and
whenever somebody bashes we will see
during the canal during the the talk and
I'm tweeting like iphone this and I
have never seen my Twitter on the screen
and presentation has been running there
but anyway so it's what he knew magic
some-some a little bit skeptic about
this because the guide also said that
they're doing this NLP stuff you know
and they have patents in natural
language processing for many many years
though I didn't ever hear any of these
names you mentioned and I did some LLP
earlier um so just kind of don't believe
it it smells like it's a small solution
that probably it's not something that
you would sell for millions of dollars
it's like a bunch of cues and pipes and
filters typical concepts how you what
process this are sort of data and it
looks like natural language processing
where you just need to do some to run
some analytics on text and find out if
somebody's bashing or not so that simple
for the machine but still is doable as
it goes into the direction of
mathematics and it's like basic machine
learning Oh does anybody if you do a
machine learning for living cool so
haven't at the conference I have two
nights in the hotel just think it can
think of this like who worked similar
probably I will not have this awesome
amazing tweets popping up there I'm
sorry and ah but I can think of
something like that so what I've
tinkered I hope it works because today
morning it didn't have a small present
some small demonstration
so actually I will explain while it's
running a what it actually does i have
i've cheated here for the presentation I
have a flat file were collected like one
and a half millions of tweets and i'm
reading them sequentially and on this
side you see that some of them are being
processed and there is a recognition of
relevant relevant products or relevant
vendors and some tweets would go to the
twitter team informing them that
something is happening that we cut
because typically twitter teams are
people who are just watching at the
tweets at social media information they
only react when they say that this is
actually a rant or is it it's bashing
whatever this one doesn't work this is
pretty cool
no it doesn't
okay no it is yeah I will explain the
whole technology because it sells its
its there's the most interesting part of
it so it runs on one and a half million
tweets starting a react system using
deep discount it recognizes like
something like probably two thousand
which are relevant and dust just
negative positive aggregation there ok
so let let let it run so the use case is
here to UM the first one is well I need
to suck this data I don't need to
quickly see what is relevant like what
is Samsung or iPhone whatever vendor or
product relevant so I can inform the
Twitter teammates like just streaming
the data and the other one is collecting
and aggregating for example you want to
separate those two when you first you
want to inform somebody about what is
happening and the second one once in a
month you will just check out if your
product is performing well they
according to social media to social
networks so did it twitter is actually
the platform form it's perfect for me
because i say things before i think but
i'm not alone there and so just you just
read this stuff straight from the
firehouse actually a cab not accept you
have no access to the firehouse to the
twitter files anymore but still you can
add you can read feet so you can get you
can just aggregate blocks and stuff like
that so then you for work for
notification and batch analytics and all
some guys in this room will not agree
with me that it's necessary to the batch
analytics but anyway once in a month you
would do some batch analytics based on
what you have started that and the
bubbles are
so feeds come in IQ them I filter them
according to some criteria then I do
this fork and I have alerts immediate
alerts then I also q4 formalization
enforced or storing in react then
afterwards one in a month whatever I
would do my analytics and I am again I'm
cueing this I will explain the whole
tech why I'm doing this in a way I'm
doing this just a MapReduce and I put
sentiment analysis and and do aggregates
and three parts and somebody will have
to react so this is basically the thing
and what is the tech because it's sack
match so I need to talk about the
technology which is the most interesting
part for me so use two languages this
one has not been mentioned in this
conference as far as I remember not a
single time also I'm an earl and I so I
mean it explains why i wrote this little
five hundred fifty pages book i said
this twitter part is done with a small
library called 3p entire checked out a
couple of crowler's and just using HTML
clients for a full sucking blog data
queuing i'm doing queuing rabbitmq
through pickers so I'm considering to
replace it with zero because it's small
it's slight more lightweight I saw
everything in react through pas de prata
buswell and it says this is actually how
the Python library does this I think you
can also go through HTTP but I don't use
it and MapReduce is done on the special
modified version of disco have you ever
heard of disco framework okay so I dig
into the code of disco pretty deep into
in order to teach disco speak to react
in a special way in a data local way so
i don't i don't have to you know to
split data don't have to transfer
transfer huge amounts of data i'm just
running disco workers on the same notes
we
running on and I I just take the V note
local data on those notes and I process
it so that's basically it some math
analytics is NLP with NLT k ever heard
the penalty k okay it's a real cool
thing to do natural language processing
in Python with lots of experience of
very experienced guys for many many
years now I do I use an educated trainer
too well actually to pickle the the
training set and I never update my
algorithm so once I trained it I am
reusing it all the time the algorithms
I'm doing here and nave bias too well to
decide if it's a rental not brand
decision tree to do filtering binary
classification based on trigram
frequencies just a recognized language
arm and simple name and antibiotic
filtering based on public and also on
corporal I will dig into it just in a
minute okay so some numbers because
numbers are sexy right I mean it needs
to be big data it's not a small data and
it's not a medium data it's like you
need to compare things so my opinion is
when when numbers become set too sexy
for you you know this guy right i'm too
sexy for my care so so it's just it just
becomes porn so I'm absolutely not into
this numbers upon its so your numbers
how fast you are how much you can't
process just need to satisfy what you
try to solve not more than that because
if you do more than that i've heard of
companies preparing platforms to accept
like eight hundred millions of
connections per second and parallel
simultaneously but having only eight
hundred users at all
I mean it's all about doing this is
 but it's cool to impress people
with numbers my numbers are not that
it's impressive as those of one guy in
the audience who will speak later and
this track but anyway the numbers are on
my MBA that's actually where just
experimented with it I can take from
different feeds including Twitter
because from Twitter you don't get that
much from the public stream it's like
10,000 chaotic messages per minute it's
a an estimation here I can do I can
store formalized i jus some
formalization on the react cluster with
three nodes and based on quorum writers
waste based on quorum something
analytics on round about seven thousand
messages percent per minute are I just
filter just do post negative positive
negative aggregation and some
location-based aggregation so it's not
in the demo it's a little bit heavier
there and it's not that reliable in the
demonstration it's roughly
one-and-a-half million tweets are that
I'm processing and doing this positive
negative aggregation just stream
processing in seven minutes so MapReduce
in 15 seconds on this amount of data
because I've just prepared it it's
already in the store you know um
actually if it's still running it should
do some further magic here but probably
just finished running this is what I
expo yeah it did that's not good um I
can let it run again so I try to achieve
it a little this is the third night
actually in in a different hotel to play
with maps and and how I can do this
location demonstration so I just didn't
believe this guy because I know about
the location problem sent and
coordinates missing
and tweets i will explain this a little
bit later so that that i'm not cheating
i'm going through the web stomp in the
face of rabbit and just you know just
take my stuff from straight from the
queue well also not impressive so some
lessons learned this is the most
important thing i mean i love to
experiment with things i'd love to learn
new things so let me explain a couple of
things here what I've experienced from
twitter is that when you when you suck
from the public streamable you will get
floated by the beliebers you know the
believers justin bieber lovers ha
actually i think that the only reason
for twitter to exist is to provide this
stuff or probably for the public stream
it's actually being filled with
beliebers stuff you will not get
anything reasonable out of it so sick
round about sixty percent of what I've
experienced was completely useless
garbage but when you go into this
analytic spot let's consider some things
you know everybody knows this dude right
so the real name is dhh as well as the
username I mean we know who it is how
would machine know who it is can the
Machine decide if it's a human or it's a
boat or whatever no chance so it's
talking about filtering what would I
filter for because BOTS renting around
are probably not useful the other thing
is ups absurd profile buyers do you know
James garlic is awesome really i met him
in vancouver is a real good Packer i
have deep respect plane but what he says
on his twitter is this on his trailer
profile so when i try to filter for fall
language i mean i will get rid of James
garlic and I would love to hear his
opinion about the iphone you know
so the other thing is as we is a guy
well known in the ER link communities
from Israel the story behind this one is
i met him in san francisco and as we
tweeted around I just recognized that
his tweets are still coming from san
francisco thought he's now 4 month back
in back to Israel like dude did you move
to San Francisco again no I'm here in
Tel Aviv like man so you cannot even
trust in this information there my own
profile on Twitter it says in the
location thing it says just send your
rubber duck it's a long story why I'm
writing this but anyway it's my location
is there a location called senior rubber
duck somewhere on earth I don't believe
it let's look at the language Google is
a pretty cool thing I've in order to get
to have this example here I had to
tinker around on google but this is just
a demonstration I mean Google does
awesome job in language recognition but
when you write something like this would
night I mean it's lee and what it says
it's German well actually based on my
location so i bought things are
unreliable i had bigger problems with
leg language recognition using an l TK
so i'm going for this trigrams that and
what I've learned it was half a nice
actually to find out that Spanish is
anti class for everything it will take
like you know statistically it will take
everything from Arabian languages
Japanese and whatever and I can say what
is not English and German it's Spanish
okay so how can I can filter this I have
no idea why this happened but it's a lot
of tinkering so let's talk about disco
this was a real cool thing I will do
more and more with this framework so
what it actually does is the
distribution is erling based which is
from my opinion this day is just the
most reliable platform for distribution
we just get the distribution for free
and here on Python jobs mappers reduces
and so on the way you run it on Hadoop
is well its Hadoop streaming is just
like openings standard input/output and
just streaming around and you can
actually re-implement part of this code
change some part of disco because it's
hard coded to run something else than
Python so you can call java processes
there so it's a extending this code a
good system is well it's hard to extend
it's a it's hard to change in the core
but it's good it's it's good for change
for extensions you know so it's actually
good but I had to dig real deep into the
platform and to modify very many spots
in the code just to teach this thing not
to fire up new nodes slave nodes just to
accept those who are running because I
don't want my react nodes to you know to
get started by disco this this is
probably a live system so the other
point was this streaming this this
standard input output stream what you do
with react do you have any experience
with react you okay so when you when you
I mean this is the most stupid thing to
ask a key value stores just give me all
keys right it distributed it's
impossible because I mean you will get
like probably eighty percent if
something goes wrong and so but anyway
here I have to suck from the V nodes
from the virtual nodes there so it
doesn't fit well how this communicates
the Erlang part communicates with
pythons through the standard he put
output there and how you accept keys
from react from on a low level because
you will get fluted your process or
processes will get flooded with messages
and it will it will start throttling and
complaining around when you're not fast
enough taking out this message
so it doesn't fit well so on the flight
back from Italian I'm sitting close to
they're not and he's just saying hey why
not aren't you using a cuter so I looked
at at the code there and the extension
was like done in five minutes because
this is a part what disco was real great
to extend and I have it up and get up
and exactly and somebody from from the
disco team has emailed me so we probably
will use it later talking about
languages I had to learn yesterday that
tag matches well is aiming for
functional languages where it's a
functional languages conference whatever
so um just go try coding on the same
project same time erling in Python I
mean they are a little bit different so
this mutation thing I mean I'm running
in this hell on all the time it just
doesn't compile and why the hell doesn't
it compile oh yeah it wasn't Python it
was early what I'm terribly missing is
one of those things i love about Erling
is language and lay the language is
really simple but this is part and
matching I mean I don't want to miss the
pattern matching in any single language
anymore really since I know this you
know about this one right everybody cool
um I just love it and from the technical
perspective for a run time perspective I
need to consider probably running Python
and Erling embedded Lee but this will be
pain in the ass i'm pretty sure because
it will hide behind an if and when
something happens i will probably just
kill the the react node which is not
that good let's briefly talk about
sentiment analysis do you know what
sentiment analysis is so well actually
in this case it's a strong sentiment
analysis because people have to rent or
you have to check if people are renting
so human nature and then tweets coming
from this are well a little bit
unpredictable for the Machine I mean
just look at this tweet here everybody
can read it right would you say it's
positive or negative I mean forget
things like sarcasm right I mean it can
be sarcastic as well so it gets a new
dimension but I have no idea if it's
positive or negative really in my world
it would be real so castings like snow
again so anyway the machine doesn't have
a chance note it doesn't have chance to
deal with something like that so you get
with NLT k you get a corporate corpus a
couple of copper and that the coppers
you use for sentiment analysis and in
order to train your knave bias algorithm
is called movie reviews it's a little
bit filtered but still it's like this
way around there and stuff so we can
have negative and positive information
there but it's not big enough so what I
actually had to do is I had I have
extended it with some further
information everybody knows leading us
towards his he's one of the world
changes I love him really what was he
has strong strong opinion right and he's
well he's not picky about bird birds
he's using so you actually can when you
have a title like this you can expect
that this is pretty negative so I think
that this one was a fake but anyway do
you know this one ever heard of mr.
zecha so that is also an impressive
hacker and he has a much stronger
opinion and how he expresses himself I
mean he's not the most popular person in
the island community probably but anyway
programmers need to learn statistical I
will kill them all
and the whole text is going on like that
you know on and on and on so you can
what I did it just took his whole block
and said it's everything is negative
that it's okay I mean I don't care about
that the fact that i absolutely agree
with what he's saying here really but
it's the way to express yourself right
so it's it was fine for teaching my
algorithm so frequently asked questions
are I did this talk a couple of times in
them to just have some questions here
just to prevent that you asked the same
questions again so why the heck am I
doing this this is the first question
okay it's because I can um nice argument
right it's because i want this is the
most important argument for me I want to
learn I want to get to go deep on low
level I wanted to understand in depth
how frameworks can interact together how
libraries how our signal products can
can be brought together in a way that
it's absolutely optimal concerning the
Machine and combining computer science
with math is the most impressive thing
you can ever do you can only learn
really or in my case I'm relearning
things I forgot earlier as a I mean
during this phase of my life or was more
after chicks and beer then after math so
I kind of regret it right now and have
to relearn these things anyway why not
just used to do um I didn't want to run
this on the JVM to be Honus and I have
to use cases and this is probably the
biggest misunderstanding and this Hadoop
pipe in this hadoop world it's like you
use Hadoop for batch processing this is
what is for you don't use it for near
real-time analytics you just don't use
it right so I have to use cases I have
to solve to use cases separately
well I can reuse my algorithms of course
but it's not the reuse of the whole
stack the more interesting question is
why did I want to use it to run it on
the JVM well technically seeing the big
data is real heavily growing on on the
JVM we have to do Pig hive storm cough
Casper if you go for CP similar things
here my heart for machine learning and
hoping the NLP and stuff like that for a
natural language processing but um any
java developers around okay i didn't
want to have this one on my machine but
actually my mba here is completely maven
free I'm proud of it the others machines
are not so hard really they are kind of
infected but well it's actually a big
data you have half of internet on your
machine um and just to be honest I'm
just evaluating a couple of alternatives
to the Java ecosystem um just take it as
it is here I hope you know this guy um
why am I queuing it because cases are
known where without cues well they say
without cues a gazillion of messages per
seconds can be done well in my case
probably I could but I don't I mean I
have no trivial statistics here its
language processing it's real heavy and
when you go for Python it's getting more
heavier there so I have to deal with
chaotic text I have to filter around so
it's it's a you know I also have the
situation where I'm working with react
and the note that there are some there
is some time we want to protect any data
store from getting fluted by rights
through cues
is just normal and react isn't different
in this case so i have this pipes and
filters concept which is as as all this
bavarian forest and i'm also mixing
technologies I mean the best thing to
mix technologies from what I've learned
during the past weeks is 0 mq it's
awesome it has connectors to everything
so you can just glue together whatever
you like and i will i will pick i will
put it into this tag seriously a rabbit
is a little bit too heavy for that but i
love rabbit well it's early and I know
alvaro intent guys and they're doing
great job there but I think I just need
something small there well actually all
the frameworks you can get are doing
some sort of queueing or buffering
whatever behind the scenes you just
don't get it just probably don't see it
well actually people in this audience
will see this but I'm also giving this
talk to Java programmer so enterprise
Java programmers I'm sorry what's the
difference i mean java program is like
Martin Thompson I'm quite all the time
when he's speaking so why did I use
early in Python well reliability and
distribution erling of the Erlang vm is
one of the reasons um I just don't need
to reinvent the wheel done by zookeeper
and stuff like that it's like you just
get it for free with early pattern in
Erlang probably you can lynch me for
that but it's they are functional enough
for me for day by day usage really I
mean erling is a non pure functional
language how you would say it I mean it
has a couple of compromises their the
trade-offs like I mean the I always says
not side-effect free end and you you
need to take care of it but for me it's
okay at this point
I can do a lot of things with what it
offers actually and the way of thinking
is the most important thing Python is
well is also in a way functional enough
with with lambdas and stuff but anyway
it doesn't have pattern matching so I
would just keep it what it's interesting
about Python I mean it's old enough and
it's used by scientists to implement
real hard things it doesn't matter that
eighty percent of these things are
written in C and Fortran behind Python
actually but still people are real smart
mathematicians doing great job there so
I just wanted to consume this well this
quiz Python combines with Erlang react
and rabbit or in this case i'll enter so
this is the further thing i don't have
so many technologies to switch between i
just have a bunch of them so isn't
python slow like hell i actually heard
this question well it's not operating at
speed at the speed of life by light of
course it's slow at some points yes it's
a interpreted language yes it is dynamic
and so on and so forth but anyway there
is pie pie and I will evaluate it for
this thing I just couldn't I just
couldn't do what I do with NLT k on pie
pie yet it just throws some weird errors
but anyway those guys working on pie pie
it's a different well run time for our
Python it's fast like hell in some cases
and they also swear that the nld k use
case works so I probably just need to
wrap my mind just don't forget I had
like three nights or something well MBA
is boring you know Garrett Smith is at
this conference he's there he's the guy
behind this web scale MongoDB is
web-scale video is the creator of it and
i love this term so can i do this can I
make it web scale
yes well I'm operating on web data just
let let's consider some scalability
points I can scale with rabbit I can
scale cuse i can use exchanges I can go
I can go I can distribute this in a
cluster I can chart the queues whatever
I can dynamite them again scale storage
with react well because it really scales
arm the basic concepts are allowing it
to scale very far I can scale MapReduce
supported analytics with disco react
because it's like running workers on on
react nodes so as many react notes as
many disco workers I can run there I can
scale data sources few seconds count
machines hardware network cloud well you
just name it what's in the future I
don't have the crystal ball what I what
I've started doing is pick lighting
engine for written in Python because
probably I can make a stake out of it
right now it's a little bit dirty the
code but anyway probably i can make a
stick stick out of it and then i will
have to face those guys who are having
lots of big scripts already running on
hadoop so probably I can just go there
and take over and run those scripts on
my stag I will add more data sources to
mix a little bit better to understand
how data will are you know how how is
the interaction between Twitter Facebook
and blocks and start and so on and so
forth do some more analytics there I
will also do some low-level disco
modifications that are necessary intent
as I said you is I told you somebody has
contacted me after I've actually
contacted them to offer help and
probably for this code 5 my whole
changes will go there that but i think
there's your own cue thing for 222
tactic you in between the
erling path and the Python part is the
most important thing so what did we
learn about big data here so it's big
data is all about all about what
followed by how in turn able by the what
with so the tools are just not important
at the beginning just far away you just
need to know what it is so you gather
data you have to analyze it and the most
important thing is you need to gain
useful information I mean data that
doesn't bring your information is
useless it doesn't help you so you need
to know about things you need to
understand what this data brings and
it's not the matter of size like it can
be five bytes but still if these five
bytes are having information important
information in them you've won so
probably it's not big data in terms of
science so you will find new ways to
gather data to collect information to to
derive steps for business improvements
if you into this strategy planning soft
intelligence and enterprise level
enterprise level stalking you know what
it is is when your medical insurance
stalks you on social media and adjust
scoring according to if you tweet about
alcohol cigarettes stuff like that I
know it's uh well it's a gray zone right
but still we all know the disease so um
but you can also change the world I mean
this is the real interesting part you
will not be known after you die by
helping a company XYZ improving business
in a way those people who are fighting
epidemics in Africa using huge amounts
of data movement of people population
and stuff and the lytic saan that there
will be known by that so this is
actually the very interesting thing here
but it's up to you it's also up to me
and and it's up to everybody what we do
with this
if you can you can you can analyze video
streams on on public places in order not
to just record the fact that somebody
has been killed by the other one but in
order to prevent this to happen so these
are things that are real relevant for
big amounts of data as well so we're not
building skynet even if it's there it
will be boring because it's computers I
mean they are stupid they all do what we
say them to do but recommend and
decision support systems this is the
most important thing well I mean people
are not able to make decisions based on
millions of features based on millions
of factors when the machine will help
them make the decision based on three
selection oh and pre-selected three
options this is the most interesting
part so I expect and I think that this
will go into the direction of recommend
and decision support systems well people
will just pick one and say hey yes this
is it and you name it what you can use
it for and it's not about numbers it's
the numbers you have have to carry your
solution not more not less than that but
what's interesting for you and for me
it's a huge field for experiments you
can play with things lots of libraries
are around lots of technologies I'm not
biased about technology some i'm using
what comes and what makes sense in this
case i just used this for reasons i
could explain you tomorrow i will go for
for for storm running on the JVM i don't
i don't really care but you can play
with things you can learn a lot and you
can build two chains and you digging
deep into math oh yeah okay actually it
ran yeah it's finished again so it took
like a couple of minutes to process this
stuff and um
I think that's it yeah thank you so
before before you ask me questions I
have a questions for those two German
guys or german-speaking guys you and you
right ah what sister namitha therma
Felicia bata dena me the film of ed how
about the highest so like about it for
soundcloud soundcloud girly Cassandra no
II yeah ok how about you good sounds
like okay it's got a boy I'm sorry so
you go awesome so we can have questions
now we can use the panel afterwards we
will have the small panel with a couple
of other guys who are our deep into this
topic as well so you decide everyone
yeah it's just a technical question and
that's about it describe just go a
little bit it's a Python framework for
map for MapReduce is that right or is it
more of an airline well the distribution
part is written in darling and the
poison part is like weapons all that
stuff and the coordination and then
turn--turn you know split and and so on
and so forth and you're right adapters
for four different data sources also in
Python that so and it's hard coded how
it calls Python workers actually how it
calls maps there so it will be a little
bit of work to extract this part to
abstract this part away intend to allow
different technologies that so the first
step i did was was enabling Erling code
being cold as a worker actually so this
was the first step and it's it's very
python agnostic so up or Python
it wants to have Python yeah but that
whole distribution part is are written
knurling and this is the good thing
because those guys have some interesting
thoughts in the in the code so you need
to read the quarter to come with me okay
the site about Hadoop that it's good for
batch processing but not for real-time
processing what makes disco better for
real-time processing I don't use disco
for real-time processing as well ah no
the real time processing part is done by
a Python script which is just taking
messages from the queue does some work
and this does notification that's
basically it probably I didn't explain
this part but this this was on the this
is actually the processor here doing
both here the processor takes the stream
and splits the stream into two parts for
immediate notification and for storage
and react and the storage in react is
behind the scenes and then I can do this
analytical part on the react notes and
this one is just an example how I can
alert agile I will just send links to
the Twitter team as emails maybe all
hundred tweets in one email so they just
can click and say okay yeah it hurts so
let's talk to this guy they need to
process it they need to do something
with it typically when you when you rent
about something and I'm renting all the
time about Airlines right so somebody
tweets me back and says hey come on can
we help and I'm like no you can't help I
like I'm having a delay of 10 hours how
can you help me I'm sorry
why do you use a new york and Abdi DFS
interesting question I just wanted to
well the DFS has also this disco DB
right it's like a so it's on top of it
so you can use it as a database as well
but actually I also had to combine this
experiment with digging deeper into how
react works on the low level so the idea
was to ask v notes for data and having
this in mind as well I just combined it
here too also it's not only about react
but it's I think it's interesting for
disco in the future to be able to run
workers on pre-running notes it wasn't
possible to do so it just wanted to fire
up slaves and that's it so this is
actually the important part party the
interesting part if it's react
behind-the-scenes it doesn't matter
because what happens is that I call an
erlang function I just expect the note
to be here I can configure it and so on
and so forth the way you do
configuration for your 44 disco notes
but it's not being started it's expected
to be and I can call an erlang function
there and this erling function does
nothing more than just a sucking from
from v notes on react this one the other
example just delivers raw just returns
raw with a string in the in the URL so
you can do anything with it you know
it's it's really not about react it's
like side projects of the side project
of a side project exactly those
technically is not necessary to do it
like that no absolutely not probably all
we did a little but again experiment
I know this is sort of a your own
experiments on a on a small scale but as
an academic exercise you looked at
tweaking your sample or master data size
to adjust see if that affects the
classifier performance um I'm not sure I
understood the question because I think
the microphone is not on so that working
properly okay as an academic exercise
have you looked at what affects
performance of the classifier on a
message basis well I'm probably you saw
that I'm doing this arm and i'm using
the analytic a trainer and it's with
pickled true so it means that i don't
have to train all the time algorithm
just it just prepares data structures
and reuses them so actually the
classification thought in this case the
tweets it's not that slow what is slow
is processing blocks because you have to
break down in paragraphs in sentences
and have to decide afterwards what is
this really negative or positive or a
kind of you know and I didn't really
analyze what is our what's about the
performance of the of the classification
being done with NLT k I just didn't have
to do it because it just ran it was fast
enough for this case but when it's not
fast enough I have to i can probably try
to use pie pie for you know for the
Python site where it can get a faster
and generally the the algorithm itself I
mean its native bias it's trained native
bias it's not that fat really in this
case
did a answer to crash the question in a
way okay thank you
which parts of the Hadoop ecosystem do
you miss when using this girl which but
I'm missing yeah when I use this yeah
that was Pig yeah yeah I mean I think
that pic and ties are the reason why
it's getting that popular actually
because you can reach people who are not
technicians you don't want to write
these jobs in Python even if scientists
can Python is probably more accessible
for them than Java but I mean what are
pic scripts pic scripts are still like
basic language and you at some point you
will always have to call a custom
function there and somebody has to
implement this of course but anyway it
makes it popular so if I if I go on with
this experiment making a clean stack out
of it as an alternative I wilshire
provide the whole big implementation in
the first step this is the part i'm
missing really yeah because it's for
acceptance outside right any other
questions should we get ourselves some
tea coffee and then go to the panel okay
