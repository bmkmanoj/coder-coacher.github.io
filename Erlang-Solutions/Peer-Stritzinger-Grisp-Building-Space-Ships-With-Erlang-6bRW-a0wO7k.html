element space really here well I must
convinced that this talk time is very
good solo and when they convinced me and
I didn't know that I'm rewrite the whole
talk because now we have to put in space
because before I plan to put in space so
let's look at it look problems we have
if we put some computing in space that's
radiation the the easy way around this
is to use a space colony CPU which is
very expensive which doesn't matter its
place at the moment which is also very
slow like we are talking about like 20
megahertz part of this current radiation
hotter this early on DeLeon ship the
radiation are that spark he also has
power budget depending on where we are
some wishes have more powers on have
less power we need usually we need to be
able to do remote updates
Fabia's reason even space software is
not bug free always and you know if
people are involved um there's also the
safety issue quite something we don't
want like post doors open wide not I
mean yeah if posters of thereof is open
is always fair and actually gave this
almost the same issues with safety and
normal space missiles because the stuff
is so expensive it's really bad if it
breaks and we have real time
requirements the stuff that has to be on
time what we are getting thin
specification as we get an increase in
complexity and we get increasing speed
of the CPU so we are not stuck with the
20 megahertz part at the moment there
are ways around this so but let me let
me first talk to you a little bit
hard real-time Audrina tie means if it's
not the time it's wrong and then that
can be catastrophic very wrong sometimes
for example when we have like two space
and yeah we already did
October heats oh god much pudding think
that's bad you should shut it down now
yeah well that didn't go well
so stop the world garbage collectors
they don't stop the world they want to
stop your program everybody goes on at
least I haven't seen one that stops the
world is jamming awesome so we have real
time and to be able to do hard real time
we need a hardware operating system
because if the operating system has no
hard real-time capabilities any
application that's on the operating
system can't manage to somehow return
because then you can page that printed
at random times so that won't work so I
talk to you a little bit about there are
types of hard real-time system that's
why I picked is because there we put the
element this one so we're running on the
system which came running very small
hardware I mean not very very small
hardware like it--but CPUs like it's not
our inner size it's more like the 32-bit
size there are some parts the 16-bit
systems part they are like poor cases
and of course we can't run element that
very small ones I mean we can't run
element sorry to keep RAM
yet and what's very convenient for
porting stuff to it it has it has among
others it has a POSIX IP I can write so
that looks like this
basically the whole thing runs
detected so there are not processors the
onliest threads imagine you have like
one processor on a UNIX machine with
multiple threads and that's the whole
system so they actually do there are
times internal processes actually thread
so that I can see the memory they can
you can work with a pointer through the
memory of the other process and what
kinds of stuff there's what's known not
there's no memory whatsoever so you have
the memory that that is there and you
have to map the application to the
memory and that's fixed yeah well on the
plus side you can put it to everywhere
basically runs on every architecture
that is of any import at the moment and
some that are actually no more than our
input there it's very easy to port to
hardware and you should also have to
plot the target because when you have
embedded ports you port it to the board
it's not only to the CPU architecture
you put it to the board because actually
you need you need to have a way to come
out of resent so you can run authors you
can run into the bootloader but you can
also run it s bootloader or put on a
free so in order to make this happen you
need a quad support package that you
have to write for the board that's
totally specific for this one board and
I mean you can put them macros or stuff
like this may be somewhat configurable
and it's also open source it has it has
a complicated license because it has GPL
this linking exception not quite lgpl
but a special one so for all means for
industrial application stuff like this
it behaves like a beastie license you
can just link your stuff to because you
have to because that the whole thing is
made together your application and the
operating system is linked in one image
and you put
so the linking sex is very important so
you can you can produce non GPA solution
with it that's a lot which is very
important for the usual suspects who
used tough like this I've put up just a
few examples where artists is used in
real applications automated
automatically vibrating I think it's on
two boards of these vaguely and the
motor controller and on the guidance
system it's also used in automotive at
the moment usually in like border cases
likes racing by stuff like this because
the rest of the automotive industry have
their own thing but if their own
operating system standard that's
different
also for application actually I build
this that's one of my customers let that
actually their predecessor of the thing
we put Allen on the board now so that's
the one before no Allah only opt-ins
autumn's this operating system it's an
RFID system for industrial applications
where basically you have on this oops
sorry no sorry I want this one this is a
transport system here so you have like
these small pellets moving along here
and the RFID system talks to their small
pellets and then finds out what the
product needs to do so you have a
product we had already a product centric
approach approach there it's very it's
getting like in fashion at the moment
it's called use three four zero we did
it back then almost and because we want
to go to space I've put only a few
examples of specialisms that that you
see around hidden parts of the space
mission
usually have a mix of operating system
and a space mission it's in the current
master over in the regular there's a
software-defined range
director radium on the Mars rover and on
all the other Mars probes circling Mars
which are relays for the robot so the
radio bot is running items it's also on
the on the domination to a stereo at
Western and other Asteria I think it's
da mission it's like the main the main
controller but we've our Tony plan on
the plant Observatory microwave
background it's also inertia different
it's infrared telescope and on the Solar
Dynamics Observatory I only have to pick
a few because it's a long list
so Adams is very ingrained in the in the
space community as one of the operating
system one of the three months there's
one commercial one that's used by with
River but the rest usually uses all
terms so we have an operating system
that's like actually into space and if
you put might actually be able to go to
space
one day whatever I don't want to talk to
you about long because usually does
everybody know what Ellen is yeah so I
skip these five slides now actually I
put it in but I want to pick out some
some matches and that we have especially
independent systems in embedded systems
it's usually very hard to get your stuff
into the hardware because it's mostly
over changing interface so you need a
special box to talk to the on man that
talks to the CPU you have to download
your code over this trading interface
which takes awful lot of time sometimes
depending on size and speed the clock
speed of the trading interface and yeah
well usually if it crashes it crashes
and you have to like reboot everything
and start over so you get used to very
slow
compiled a test cycle in embedded
systems development when I when I when I
first put the element on an altered
system and started to work like I played
with uh I wrote a very low-level
hardware driver for just the SPI
interface and talked to their hair they
were cheaper RFID chip from Ella so I
got like a prototype driver in Indiana
which probably will be a replacement
performance reasons was a proper seat
right before the chip but once I noticed
that I didn't restart the system for
three days and hanging away at the mm
shell it you killed to me that's
actually pretty neat and faster much
faster avenues for us yeah well that's
what that's not a bad thing to have
industrial systems where the customer
gets very mad at you and loses millions
if their assembly line stops for example
or billions if the space probe doesn't
talk to you anymore
soft real-time is often enough for many
applications so in in in most real-world
applications I I was involved with then
they're really hard real-time part is
usually five percent of the whole system
so you need only a small percent that's
hard real-time and most of the stuff is
software time work or not real time at
all I mean it should answer some time
and what's happening in a better that
moment we get SMP systems and embedded
and basically nobody in their very
community softer community is ready for
this as you can imagine if you have a
system on it that has it's a scheduler
zone and we actually working on this at
the moment that's very very comfortable
to use the additional power it's also
the for tolerances in in Latin is
usually done by by by supervising
and yeah well lots of problems in space
wouldn't have happened if they would
have had a trouble supervisor so you
probably all know this scene I'm sorry
Dave I'm afraid I can't - hand oh that's
bad doesn't let me in but how this
written in heaven so
the usual thing I shortened a little bit
because usually Eiling is more chatty if
something crashes basically supervisor
noticed that hell is not responding
anyone to help process and we started
so you find except if you put the state
that made hell going mad somewhere disk
yeah you should have wait is the first
system that I built was Alan Hamptons
actually didn't have Ellen Ellen on the
same board it has two boards it's a
reflection system for the car industry
where they can reflash the issues the
electronic control units that go into
the car before they go into the car
because they they have to keep stock and
also there are some common features want
to have like fresh software pretty soon
delivered to the assembly line because
it's if you otherwise you have to
refresh the whole car at the end of the
assembly line and that's the most
expensive part back and do it especially
if it's not like in a garage but if you
have a whole whole of cars standing
around flashing so in this system we
have basically two boards multiple
boards get four main board which runs
FreeBSD I'm a BSD guy and I prefer the
worldly nuts for several reasons not
only licensing so we run free PC on a
tool at the board and that runs a alum
out and this one control several gateway
boards they were connected by our
internal your speeds and inside the
casing because it was like cheap
interface that's pretty fast and little
bit wheels program but once you manage
this it's okay it's actually need for
Ellen because we cannot plug it and I
can reassemble my my my devices while
the stuff is running and like yeah Alan
doesn't sling and comes back again and
the APIs to the actual protocols for the
that actually automotive protocols which
are actually plenty they have plenty of
different protocols for different
application areas mostly in scan and
diagnosis over again but we also have
MOSFETs optical paths for audio stuff
which is very very complicated and you
have flex pay for safety stuff and all
kinds limb for very small stuff like a
light under signaling so we I was I
needed to be able to implement all these
protocols and indeed I couldn't buy them
for one I didn't have the funding for
that ah if I want to refresh broke is
use I need to be able to tinker with my
protocol state because sometimes or
actually not very rarely and they are
broke in a way that they don't talk to
you properly anymore but they talk to
you but you have to get it from their
spec to be able to get them left so
that's how it looks sort of rather big
device big box that's four to two
channels and you can network it it's it
has an Ethernet switch built in so you
can daisy chain it and yeah I used other
distribution to make it behave like a
multi-channel device which was actually
the predecessor of this device so the
previous Esther was a 16 channel device
big box this like their serial channels
talking to these use so now I get the
scalability for boxes because every
everyone every customer want a different
number of channels can you have one
channel for the office and yeah actually
we need only 10 channels 310 channel
unit yeah so I got about this that's
actually got me into heaven because I
was like I want to just to kill this
some days this language was distribution
and yeah it started with this project
the project was for me a proof of
feasibility that it works industrial
applications
these boxes are distributed all over the
world I
I have to remote update them obviously a
lot deaf too hot
I'll pet them I don't have to upload the
code because they are basically booted
switched on for every different flashing
need so this is mattress integration and
I I I'm also battling with latency
between the board's rule D with you go
from the Ellen node you have to show
through the lip USB that goes through
the USB spec then of the USB and on the
other end so I have lots of latency in
the protocols and I have to to build a
flow control for to be able to we have
optimal performance for the faster
protocols so for the same customer that
that I built that austrial RFID system
we actually what you can check them it
happened while we were talking about
that we might put the other one it may
be for the web server for some dynamic
stuff but the rest we keep and during
the talks the rest of the system was
eaten up by Ellen so no it's do
everything in element right some drivers
and see and yeah the I created a new
name for the project it's called the
project it's not very well known yet
because basically because it's not
released yet this website already bad
upset so what's advantageous if we put
data on the actual hardware if you run
it to begin you can go to much smaller
hardware we don't be actually don't
either even you because Helen doesn't
even even you actually I mean as long it
is not running out of memory it's fine
and if it's running out of memory and
you doesn't either if I look at this and
it doesn't either healthy factor this
because it's low then and it's better
anyway we can get very very low latency
between the hardware and
and they because there's an operating
system in between items there's no
operating system that's taking up any
time between an interrupt and almost no
time and now I'm noticing it
I know what you turn on the next slide
actually let me show this so that's how
a system at the Allen on the node looks
like we are they are code this works
yeah here and which runs on they are on
runtime the oven runs on has drivers
like addictive drivers for like network
and file system the the built-in drivers
those trials just talk to the POSIX
block in in our times the file
operations network operator so I built
into our times there's a network stick
which actually at the moment is pretty
old but we this as we're going on
porting the latest FreeBSD networks like
to autumns but nobody usually has its
network stick for free via Steam also
and so we get the latest licenses
Network stack from previous team which
is also SMP capable that's because it's
autumn is s already SMP support at the
moment and well you know network
providers and there might be other
drivers there's also a classic API
that's basically have semi force in
small message queues and it's basically
convenient for writing C applications
but you can also write your C
application part in in the POSIX part
you can switch you can H actually mix
the API of different views there's a co
operating system and they s they see
application usually would run your heart
with ham stuff or stuff where you have
like already RC solution like a
pre-existing solution
like this this usually will run on a
higher priority than they are and we
have to be able to do a lot with time so
any time one of the see threads is able
to run it will preempt the VM because
there's only software retirement so we
can put the hot glue time starting to
the see application but we also want to
have the easier access to their Mario
engine it's it's it's very common to not
write at arrival like into the operating
system which but that the only do it
here what have reusable stuff in PFR I
square see chip that appears on many
boards and you can write a general drive
and everybody can use it for convenience
but for lots of special Harvick you just
you just talk to them on where you just
access the memory their registers of the
hardware and make it to stuff and that's
the this area here and we want the same
close relationship from Yemen to the
hardware for this at the moment I can
only connect in drivers so because we
have EDI
they are imported lacking genomic
linking at the moment the can't dynamic
link and furnace also at the moment the
dynamic linking is a requirement it's
very I felt from Erickson that they
actually removed this requirement so you
can statically you can statically link
your own linked in drivers which at the
moment I I just pinched my Lincoln Drive
back to the main driver table this is
rabbit head with what a built-in
Traverse and you can just hang it edge
again it's statically linked and it's
actually neat how it works
accessing our way because they are
lifting driver interface looks very
similar to our project driver interface
which talks to the Aria so it's almost I
want to want from the objective concepts
from the link to driver to operating
system driver in West Berlin it's very
similar concepts and so this this this
way over here this way over here is this
the part where you can get the very low
latency because you get an interrupt in
the neck the driver you just make the
select run and the VM knows that yeah
and opposed notices what's happening for
an easy access you can also use nips if
you have only one to redirect register
for example which can't be delayed and
it's very fast so once we have the
dynamic linking in our X or Musa dynamic
linking whoever's fast but you can use
missiles so the marker I wrote to you
that's the of respect and yeah let's do
this
keep a space picture I'm sorry so I'm
actually trying to move over
sorry about that to show you the amount
where it's a camera oops
into camera because it's so small so
that's actually what let's put it like
this oh it's very dark
I'm sorry about that it's better yeah
it's not very strong so here you have
basic oh yeah thank you yes the CPU
that's the controller memory flash I
think these are ethernet transceivers on
other side of the board it's mainly
connectors and a few small stuff I think
that's five for the ethernet and these
connectors are industrial Ethernet
connectors and this board is just about
to connect my serial line and then so I
think that's it for this so I switched
to the laptop oh yeah so what we have is
we have the board if a serial line that
goes into the why I use P serial to the
computer we also connect the network
with this connector then that's actually
bigger than the water almost and well so
we have the network into the computer
via serial line into the computer and
that's power supply here so in order to
show this and I'm going to show
distribution because we have a lot
distribution actually running on the
board with city so using straight to
connect there
so Cyril and when I just switched this
thing on you will see that it wants to
boot doesn't
Oh remove the power yeah I service more
now that's basically the bootloader
that's also written autumn's more
convenient because yet only one one
thing the bootloader has a modified if I
press a key while it's a press key it
starts FTP server in order to be able to
look on the actual flash memory it has
NAND flash on it which start to connect
to CPU
so that's the top level device FASS
actual flash file system we're using an
open-source flash file system own that's
for the two attempts so in the file
system you see a bunch of files are like
a home directory boot directory where we
have our boot image and the most
interesting one is OTP because in OTP is
just our TP release that's wrong
my my other courses and also they
actually do the end that is booted
straight from there so let's reboot
again and this time don't press the key
I'm not pressing the key so now it puts
lots beam at them takes 6 seconds until
Eric starts if I don't have distribution
and it only takes 2 to 3 seconds from
power the first two seconds don't count
because that's the controller waiting
for me you could just disable this and
have another way to get into the system
well not get into the system at all at
the moment if I call nose here it shows
no notes because it's not connected to
any note so we you know so I'm starting
my Evernote on on the laptop which is
connected by starting a test note here
ok so they noticed test the binos and
loads here and problems so we need to
tell them about each other
I set the pin to what it's called UID
and demo one thumb that's what we want
to hear how means it's connected now so
if I do notes here now on the world
versus your line
we see our note on the laptop and if it
were notes here I see the event note so
if you have distribution we can have
nice convenience because now we can
remote share which I really love because
this shell is not very good because the
tty drew my eye somehow messed it up and
it doesn't you can't make space which is
very bad
basically you have to cut and paste
clippings because I basically totally
don't think so but now I can like start
another note and make it remote shell
into also called your ID and one yeah we
are here so if you see your notes now
it's like it's better this window on
this windows in the same on a better
note but this was our distribution you
see yeah you also see that's different
versions this is running our 15 happened
to be on the laptop if I do
if I ask the other note this one was
running it's running our 70 which is not
out yet which means basically I'm on
last them so what I can always say I
disconnect the no no from the cover and
see what's happened so now they know is
gone this is in front while it's like
trying to find it's not again a little
bit of their EPMD in order to play on a
distribution to work you need a partner
anymore on each node which is kind of a
hassle if you don't have any separate
process where you can run the partner
but even because it's normally a UNIX
process there's actually quartering that
you can make it work into LinkedIn but
the code was pretty messy and I didn't
want to understand it completely and so
what I did is I wrote a partner buddy
Maggie Nolan and I edit the book today
to the net level that you can like say
start this partner but even before you
actually want to do distribution and
that's what what runs now at the moment
so the party was also in hello
and by this time you should have noticed
that the remote longest one see so I
just disconnect the company push anyone
yeah yeah that was steam oh I lost my
time this meadow how much time do I have
15
so you think
so that was the demo oops
yeah the current status is stable
yeah customers testing it constantly at
the moment boot time you've already saw
the solution is working there that's how
it's built
fortunately Allen OTP has a very nice
cross building system built-in already
which I can just use I mean I didn't I
have to patch into the make files for
like special stuff informative with this
at the moment I have a specialized
thought basically that this whole file
here this part file yeah that's that's
where all the settings are about the
architecture and at the moment that is P
and the architecture is hard-coded in
the config file so you wouldn't need
them you will need to write the config
file for every we've setup you need I'm
planning pretty soon to add
configuration variables so there to the
process there's actually a way to do
this we can just specify like your
architecture and yogi is p-type while
configuring so you don't have to
actually change the OTP distribution to
be able to build it as Artem's
and that's that's also the main thing I
don't want to have any special scripts
extras something I want to I want that
OTP bills wasn't business tools and then
you have you can start working one thing
that's missing I already talked about it
this dynamic linking and the separate is
p.m. the application yeah I I thought I
used this there's a desert economically
support kind of
economically in support which does some
weight of static linking before like
fine finding every module it needs and
puts it into the library because you you
need to figure figure dissolve on build
time but it then can have an image and
can load stuff and it when I work this
slide I still was thinking that you
could use it to have they are nvm and a
separate see application but at the
moment I am I'm not planning to do this
because I I'd rather make the building
of the day much easier in OTP then quick
messy stuff the pro chicken sauce was a
little bit slow since you you see not
much happened distribution we have been
pretty much off the the leaves off the
EOC but now we have no fun you're funny
we had no funding you know what I'm
building for the customer mister system
so this board will be used for a
next-generation RFID system it will do
all the things and more that can be put
under the industrial 4-0 whatever it
might be
keyword there's still discussion but it
actually is the idea is that we had the
first Industrial Revolution
that wasn't a mystery one zero and now
we're at four four four zero I actually
I can't
I always forget what there are other
steps where history to zero one zero and
I mix them up I think one one thing was
steam engine and one I don't know we got
the funding from because of my customer
got into a research project for smart
factory IT
that's why we get to coming now and for
quite a while so that's pretty neat
because from this funding I wouldn't be
able also brought it up in make it
usable for everybody because at the
moment it's a set of pensions on my
machine that needs to be applied to OTP
and this pictures still have small parts
that are project specific and what I
to do is just to make easily build out
of the box but we also know the end is
support for FreeBSD cake use which is a
kernel a global event mechanism to
Artem's because for one thing it it has
only a local event mechanism where you
can like have special events for a
process to wake up but the more global
event Benenson would be variegated
autumn's and since the other can use
these events this would be much much
much less latency than the currently
currently we have a pad select this
length is really loops and not very fast
it still works fine but yeah we are
planning to do more things with the
system so we want to be this reactive as
possible and make they are not a soft
real-time as hard as possible because it
it actually gets pretty hard you can
almost too hard real time how to time
your stuff if you write your code right
like for example if you have a loop at
the end of the loop when you did your
work always called garbage collection so
you can avoid garbage village and then
run this process in high priority and
you know that's hard real time ish not
really there yeah also I want to
implement the scene on your atoms xenon
is a way for for the C program to
distribution which is molten at the
moment it's it's very limited I think
you can't monitor nodes if I remember
right see nodes and we definitely want
money to learn like small words like 8
bit parts and we know whatever we want
to monitor them if they're still alive
something like this so then there will
be money modified see node at some point
in time I don't know where and also
items has a messaging system a limited
messaging system is fixed size messages
and we want I want to make it easy to
send messages to
it's message queues because that would
be pretty neat tool very easy to
integrate see applications tool to our
Terms yeah and also we want to integrate
violence erin has a heartbeat
process basically non-ohmic system
there's one process watching the vm
because we have all these supervisors
inside the VM to make sure that
everything keeps running but you you
want to make sure that the note itself
the textual VM is still alive could be
like a questionnaire or whatever and so
they said what watching process protocol
already it was much SLR and let me -
sending messages regularly and if it
doesn't do it anymore it restarts the
damage and on embedded hardware you
should have a hardware it watchdog also
so there's always a part in the CPU
where you have to write into a you have
to write a certain sequence into
registers regularly you can figure it
and if you don't do it it resets the
whole machine because the power C code
is problem doesn't have to we have the
process to restart for the be Olivia I
mean that would probably would probably
had to restart this and he schedules
yeah
as I told I call this protocol which was
actually was a plan to write a
programming language myself and after 10
years of developing developing at this
comedy our language covers 80% of what I
want to do the programming language so I
stopped this project slowly way and yeah
so I since I had to its I already had
the name in the logo I recited it
because what I want to do with languages
is exactly what I want to do mr. crisp
system now run on embedded systems have
a dynamic very reliable stuff and have
steady can have real-time stuff mixed I
have to think the company will pay for
all this a sparse Rexroat subsidiary of
posh
it's their project basically
I didn't put in too much for my own time
at the moment but I certainly will
and every breaks that the actual
hardware and they are the European
autumns support place to go yeah that's
it
if you if you're running for example
distributed applications it will we just
cover the note and go back into the yeah
if I just powered up again now I won't
be to send a ping that gets counted but
you can there there are higher level
Jana OTP systems end especially a
written system of you write your own
system for watching
monitoring stuff I mean you can money to
a node you can money to a process on the
other node you can link to a process and
I don't know and you have to submit the
application so it's plenty of ways to
make it reconnect automatically and
eventually in the demo that I couldn't
bring I could only get one word
we hope they only have three words at
the moment so the next batch is just
about to be developed one well we got
new funding so you betcha spots and the
other two parts are there at the
customer and they they actually a demo
of a distributed application to show
them like garlic disconnected them then
it does something some fall back end if
we connect it again and comes back again
to the normal mode and that was very
nice to show it to managers and quite
convincing so we can go on basically
almost everything because I mean we have
128 megabytes of NAND flash and actually
if you want to small amount flash it's
like customer always wants to save money
get the other post Laura and but the
most expensive thing on the bonuses is
industrial connectors to make cost and
making like doing getting like the 64
megabyte flat net flash is well you
won't get it in two years anymore and
it's actually we save a few sent on the
board so
once you have man flesh on your CPU it's
like endless space segment as dear I'm I
I'm not I'm not any really keeping
getting even nearly close to the limit
of the RAM let's add the space from for
my method whew
I mean they're the the ultimate flashing
stuff when all the the definition comes
loaded so lots of data is loaded and
it's working it uses 85 mega Python the
FreeBSD box while the HIV Java VM that I
have to use because there's a
authentication library of the car
manufacturer he forces me to use so I
can't get my fingers on the key without
reverse engineering it of course which
is forbidden to me this drama be an only
rita XML file and does authentication
like challenge-response 145 megabytes
it's like yeah okay because at one point
I will crush this and end up with the
memory consumption and I was looking at
this something okay let's make words
because it's not doing anything yeah
that is pretty slim anyway but you can
trim it down in the release if you if
you have I mean then if you don't have
net flash if you have to run from more
flash those are much smaller for the
same price but I think this only will
get convenient if you have an office on
the chip let's build it like the
automotive chips user have to flash on
chip because they felt emotive people
don't want any data or address bus
outside on the board because of all
kinds of reasons envy and plain safeness
and all kinds of stuff so they usually
use the flash and the RAM on the chip
those chips those pickle chips that are
in the cars at the moment they're too
small but the next generation will be
able to run trim trim down version
because then I'd like to
ten megabytes of flesh but you can't
trim it down you make you just put into
I mean the really really snicker this
most nice for the fun bit that's perfect
police file for this not at the moment
because there's no customer to customer
specific code in it but as you saw I've
already made my master because I was
like one of 14 when I started and was
busy doing the port then while whatever
because was slow going project length
was limited funding and so am I moved on
but I already ripped down the patch set
to like handful of patches and which are
separate for the different things but I
I think in the customer drivers into the
OTP and I have to get rid of this first
but it's not much work anymore it's
actually I plan to have like
announcement distribution blah blah blah
but yeah well before conferences but
pretty soon
just watch the crisp you are the this
one there's not much going on I just put
one page up and where I need you okay
they are this one know if it started
looking lost here and on the waiting
list and the usual places</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
