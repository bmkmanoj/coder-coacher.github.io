going on in the OTP team this is the
outline or what we'll say about the
community interaction the plan releases
details of the next two days details of
the next big release or or what we know
about it and their long-term and
something more about lifting all today
so about the community we are working
together with a industrial Anna years
ago and we have some items on the agenda
like the issue tracker the packet
management support in OTP the open
backlog and we have already I mean you
know about bugs island at all the issue
tracker or you can report bugs you can
suggest new features that's already live
it replaces the a line twists are like
banks mailing list which we rather don't
to want to have bug reporting anymore
and we have seen a big improvement by
using this other issue tracker because
it's easier to keep track of of the
reported issues and I mean you can also
see them in the release notes done what
was the issue and so on so the next step
now is that we plan to have all our
issues generated also internally within
Eric so on and they will TP team and and
also the new functions in this issue
tracker so then we can have when we give
it out the release we can have when we
give out the release we can refer to the
issues here and you can read about them
into the release notes and so on instead
of us today we have some
internal issue IDs which you don't know
anything about so it will happen soon I
hope this next thing is about rebar we
will try to integrate rebar more in in
OTP and use it ourselves and the steps
here is the first one is already taken
here that we have put rebar three in in
the a-line domain at github the next
step is to integrate it even further and
also the building of the P applications
with rebar I will talk more about this
later at the end of this speech about it
has to do with splitting OTP and
different repositories so now about
releases the major idea is that we have
one major release per year and then we
have three planned correction packages
to say and between in between that we
have emergency packages or patches
everything here is available on github
and tagged and it's announced on the
island questions list and this then a
maint branch for the current supported
release and there is a master branch for
their upcoming next major release so now
we have ulti p19 dot 0 is out since you
and the next one is done 19.1 21st or
SAP September
I would also like here to say something
about compatibility our strategy
regarding compatibility I got we get
questions about this from time to time I
mean when it comes to communicating
between a line nodes we have the
strategy to support the communication
between the current and two older may
your versions in many cases it works
with even greater difference between
verses but that's nothing that we try to
guarantee and it's the same for loading
beam modules that you can load and B
module made with an older allen system
into a newer a line system but and
usually that works with really old be
modules to very new up a line system but
we don't try to guarantee more than two
versions and the other way building a B
module with the newest version allowed i
am trying to put it into the one older
version that might work by pure accident
nothing to rely on because we could
introduce new instructions in the newer
version they are not understood at all
in in the other one but usually it will
be a check so that would fail at low
time so then in this maintenance track
the next upcoming release is 19.1 and I
have some points that i can mention here
you know about the dirty scheduler
perhaps some enhancements in that area
for example regarding code loading and
unloading of code which could go quite
bad before we have the API therefore
dscp diffserv code points priority on
tcp or what you call it settings both in
the API in the NT to be or i napped and
in in the distribution asn.1 parallel
build that's nothing special I suppose
not many of you are using a standard one
and then dialyzer improvements and
something about our high notes is the
HTTP server and some new features but
there are other HTTP service as well
which are more used than this one and
then we have a lot of contributions from
the community inside the race as usual
and then the next big release plan for
you the dirty schedulers continues to be
worked on and it will not be
experimental anymore I think I said in
some
Francisco this year that it is less
experimental the previous limit in this
after this one it should be not
experimental at all another thing is the
scalability of I you we call it separate
Paul sets which then can make it
possible for if you have many schedulers
they can wait for I owe all of them in
parallel this is not I mean this is not
a bottleneck for all applications but
some of them have a bottleneck in this
case native processes I that's a
continuation of the dirty schedulers
which should enable us to write the i/o
drivers in a different way than today
I'm a more efficient way to delay for
example the tcp driver
then we will split OTP I will talk more
about that it's not for sure exactly how
to do it but and you can be you can
bring cooperate with us and have
suggestions about that us I think it
will impact the current packages as well
I mean if you are using rebar today you
are not specifying dependencies to OTP
or OTP applications it is but in this
case maybe the OTP applications are not
the same anymore or it's a smaller set
of applications so this is about
splitting of the bay and packet manager
then documentation enhancements that
mostly about getting a new look and feel
for it and we will work about improving
the distribution I mean support for
having many nodes today there are TCP
connections between all nodes and there
is some functions like global amnesia
which wants all nodes to be connected in
a mesh and that creates a lot of file
descriptions descriptors that you have
to supervise all the time and doesn't
scale so well there are some floating
point functions seal and floor which
will be introduced the distribution as I
said we will look into the distribution
and support many nodes look at
heterogenous distribution that you can
have for example
TLS encrypted connections to one node
and unencrypted to other nodes
distributed hash table is worked on and
that could be a replacement for global I
could I have other uses as well among
other thing is that to make us being
able to avoid having every node
connected to each other then there is a
certificate status protocol it will be
in the ssl application I think okay dtls
is ongoing work that we hope that it
will be kind of working here and in the
compiler we will work with pattern
matching improvements so the long term
we have ongoing work with just-in-time
compilation things it's not for sure
that this will I mean bring it to a
product depends on the outcome of or
benchmarks and so on but we hope that we
at least can take some good things from
that work it will not happen in the next
major release it will take more time
than that and more about distribution
done and the OTP split this also I will
take that in the next Island Packet
manager is connected to to be split and
documentation will also continue to
improve and we are I mean we are looking
also what Alex series doing in
documentation area and maybe we can have
something in common with them so the
split TT p today OTP is one big git
repository with 52 applications I mean
the first step that we plan to do there
is to move out just a few of these
applications to separate repositories
and we mainly select those that are but
we are seldom used or of course they
don't we don't have any dependencies to
them either from from the core part and
then we will try to build these separate
applications with rebar of course that
will work but we will also sort out I
mean it will impact our internal
building and testing so we find a
strategy that works in this small change
and I will take in bigger changes later
to define kind of a basic ripple that is
kind of minimal for what you need to run
and build our line applications and then
you can fetch the other ones but of
course it can be discussed how much we
should have in this basic ripple how
many development tools should we have or
should it be split between tools and
runtime or
and if we do like this I think the
current applications using or packages
using rebar read to need to to define
what OTP applications or pre previously
OTP applications they have dependencies
to but maybe the core that we keep there
is what's usually what what they usually
have the balance is too so maybe that's
not so big impact yes that's the plans
about this let me feedback about what
will happen in this split is welcome and
of course pull requests and suggestions
about missing functionality no TP rather
than creating a whole new package is
also welcome if we just need to add a
few tweaks and it's better to do with in
some common place and to have too many
different alternatives because I think
one if you have packages like this not
only our packages but all the other ones
floating around I think you should avoid
dependency hell I mean I don't want to
pick a package and then I get the whole
world with with it I think unnecessary
dependencies are an evil thing avoid it
ok ok any questions
he's raised you man it's not a question
but I'd like to make some advertisement
for our new gem state and behavior Mike
was talking about selective receive and
how is how important is how important it
is and gents Tatum is the behavior that
makes that enables you to do finite
state machines with selected received
month and its new in 90 please try that
excellent another one I mean the gem
Statham was introduced in nineteen dot
zero so you were talking about this
distribution right so have you guys
chosen any particular DHT protocol or
sake Adam me or anything to implement
this distribution could you please
repeat I mean you're talking about
distribution right I mean scaling along
nodes inside of mesh so have you guys
chosen any particular or distributed
hash table protocol to implement that
would it be based on code or Columbia or
it's based on cord as it seems now yes
okay
are you going to support a package
repository or something like that we
plan to I mean cooperate with Alex ear
and used if that answers your question
use the hex thing they have and they
already have a line packages in it I
just want to have verified that you use
the word packet manager is it a package
manager or packet manager I don't know
what the packet means you I neither I
don't I mean you what I mean in this
presentation it's that we we have in a
line we have something called
applications and that is a good unit of
installing and uninstalling upgrading
patching having dependencies to and that
what I mean you put each application in
a package but of course it can be
debated if it's possible to put two
applications in same packets usually not
done i think we have always treated i
mean one application that's the smallest
unit that we want to deliver a new
version of to the customer and the
customer can upgrade it we have the up
mechanism for upgrading application for
example final question
following up along those same lines
being one of the only users of included
applications are you going to continue
to support included applications if you
change with the package manager I don't
hear many people supporting it and they
argue against it and say don't use
included application so I'm just
included applications it's a notion in
the up file yeah and I think it means
something about the start order right
only and the other things in the app
file it means I mean if your listing
other applications it also has to do
with start order so I think we have to
do something about where is the correct
information about dependencies because
you can have the premises without
needing to start to have only depends to
a library it relates to the packaging
because the code has need of it yes
let's do it okay ladies and gentlemen
please give Canada warm or out of doors
you
