question how computers change our brains
and the question can computers cause
mental disorders or neurological
disorders so I will I'm gonna say it
right now the answer is yes yes but as I
said I have good news and bad news so
don't worry actually everything too much
of everything is bad as as we will find
out today okay so uh another thing i
need to say there's one rule during my
presentations if you have any questions
please raise your hand during my speech
you don't have to even raise your hand
just say hi you stop I have a question
okay so um our body is amazing but it is
today medicine is so advanced that most
of our organs are irreplaceable so for
example I may have a kidney damage a
hard damaged liver lungs pancreas damage
but it's not a bad news for me because
there are amazing surgeons that can
perform kidney transplant cornea
transplants can trump transplant marrow
transplants blood transplants but there
is one organ that we cannot transplant
and the answer is the brain of course
actually it's a little bit silly because
even if some someday even if we were
able to transplant the brain we we would
transplant transplant the brain into the
body or the battle to the brain
considering that we are our brain my
brain is talking to your brains right
now nice brains
okay a little bit selfish because
considering that I am my brain and
saying that the brain is the most
important organ that we have is a little
bit selfish because it's according to
the brain and and also this presentation
is about the brain and the brain is
presenting the presentation about the
brain and it's selfish as well but your
brains what will like okay a little bit
about the brain by the way this is my
brain scan CT scans so say hi to my
brain it's talking to you thank you it's
how we compliment it's how you
compliment a brain scientist is a nice
brain ok so the brain represents only
two percent of our body weight whereas
it receives fifteen percent of cardiac
output twenty percent of total body
oxygen consumption and twenty-five
percent of total body glucose
utilization so it's small but it takes
it all actually and the brain consists
of approximately 86 billion neurons and
each neuron is able to create one ten
thousand neuronal connections with other
neurons so multiply these two numbers
and you will have the view are about how
complex this machine is because the
brain is actually a machine a big
computer and a lot of money is invested
right now to create to build computers
that are able to assimilate brain funct
the brains function for example human
brain project obtained 1 billion euros
from the European Commission European
Commission
to to accomplish this mission I need to
say that we are not doing very well in
this area right now but I hope that as
our programming tools and our technology
is getting more and more advanced we
will accomplish this mission okay so
right now I will outline a little bit of
apocalyptic vision of our future so
according to a World Health Organization
one in four people in the world will be
affected by mental or neurological
disorders at some point of their life so
neurological disorders and mental
disorders are brain disorders so
something is happening with our brains
so brain disorders are Alzheimer's
disease Parkinson's disease
schizophrenia bipolar depression and
many many more and it's a very very bad
news because considering that we are our
brains we are we are actually losing
ourselves and worse news is that we
cannot say accurately what causes brain
disorders how to diagnose accurately
brain brain disorders and how to treat
them so yeah it's very very bad and
another bad news that people with brain
disorders live a pro approximately 25
years less than normal people so 25
years is a little bit long so it's a
very crucial task to reserve the brain
and find some new cures okay another bad
news European a European posts in 2010
of all brain disorders is almost 800
billions 800 billion it's a lot so
so please look at other diseases
cardiovascular diseases 192 cancer 20 to
200 billions diabetes 83 billions and so
on so on so all these diseases cost less
than brain disorders in total so brain
costs us more than our whole body now I
actually ate a hundred billions consists
of medical issues non medical issues
direct indirect because for example if I
have a stroke and I'm working and I have
a stroke and I cannot work anymore then
my whole family is affected by it so for
example the my my husband for example
will have to take care of me so he can
not work as well and the economic
situation of the country in the Europe
but but yes it's a problem it's look
like this okay the brain is changing all
the time even right now I am changing
your brains physically I'm doing
physical changes to your brains haha and
I can measure that if if we go to my
laboratory I I would be able to measure
these changes because Dickens ago people
thought that the brain is developing
only throughout the course of childhood
but actually our brains are able to
change even in late adulthood and that's
what we call neuro plasticity and
throughout the course of our life there
are new neuron neuron cells that are
created in
several places in the brain so it's very
important because have you seen a baby
elephant a baby elephant is born and it
after it is born it can stand up and
walk and I haven't seen a baby human
baby just after it is born stand up and
walk actually takes one year so why why
an elephant can walk just after it is
born and we cannot because no so
actually the baby cannot crawl after it
is born as well so sorry sorry no no it
is because I will give you an answer
now it is actually because of the fact
that the elephant receives some
information all right so I am because
for you for example we don't have to
learn how to cough or how to breathe it
is deep in our brains it's a it's just
like a protocol that we receive from our
ancestors for from our evolution real
assets and so on so on and we don't
receive as much information as for
example animals because animal brain is
not that plastic as the human brain so
the human brain is actually acquiring a
lot of information and it is acquiring a
lot of skills throughout the course of
the the life and it is it is good I ok
yeah I have a question because the
baby's head is usually to have it for
the baby to get up so it wouldn't make
sense for her to learn to walk I said
that the baby's head is usually too
heavy for the baby to get up so it
wouldn't make sense for the baby to
learn to walk ok but elephant may have
the same problems with you know it's
it's it's heavy as well and
but because it is actually a nurse in
the I don't know i am not as old but i
will find out but you know because a
baby is immersed in the fluids in the
before it is born so actually we have
some time to learn and before we are
born and it is good okay let's go that's
going because i have a little bit more
to tell okay our brains are changing we
I think we all agree and the most
important thing that you should remember
is near that fire together wire together
this is the mantra of all the scientists
that research neural plasticity so for
example because I think you know that
there's there are some electrical
activities in the brain impulses and we
can measure that with eg and we have
brain wave patterns of brain activity
and actually these impulses are
representing neurons that talk to each
other so there they talk to each other
they wire together they create new
connections and and it is achieved by
firing together in the same time okay so
this was a little bit of beginning and
we will use these information to analyze
brain disorders in people who deal with
screens and computers so okay Dracula
hormone what is Dracula hormone is
sometimes melatonin is sometimes called
Dracula hormone why because it is
activated it is produced when it is dark
melatonin is essential for us to sleep
melatonin is produced as soon as the
lights are turned off and so let's trace
this diagram and for example throughout
the day when there is a bit of sunlight
the level of melatonin is a relatively
low so we don't want to sleep so don't
melatonin and around 8pm the level of
melatonin raises and it achieves its
peak around midnight one am-2 a.m. and
then when there is a time to wake up 7p
a.m. or eight am and so on so on the
level of melatonin drops and it's very
important because for example when there
some good days dark days we are sleepy
because there is an information so for
example retina in our eyes is not
stimulated by the appropriate amount
amount of light so there is no
simulation of the place in the brain
called hypothalamus that simulate
another part of the brain called pineal
gland which is responsible for producing
hormones including the Dracula hormone
okay why it is important it is important
because if for example you want to go to
sleep at 1am and you are working on your
computer at midnight or midnight 30 you
are stimulated with a huge amount of
light your eyes that are sending
information to hypothalamus and then to
pineal glands produce melatonin because
there is light so and no melatonin no
sleep so then we go to bed we want to
sleep and we cannot and this is a
problem why it is a problem it is a
problem because this may lead to our
insomnia sleep deprivation in general
and the disease called delayed sleep
phase phase disorder when we are totally
awake during night and sleepy during the
day and there are some researchers that
prove that two hours of iPad use at
maximum brightness was enough to
suppress people's normal activity of
release of melatonin so actually we
don't have to work on the computer a lot
to be affected by this melatonin
mechanism and problems with sleep are
very important but some of you may not
feel that right now but let's consider
that for example problems with sleep are
crucial to the development of other
diseases such as depressions as anxiety
mood disorders problems with memory and
suicidal behaviors there there is a huge
amount of research that proves that
sleep deprivation is a one of the
leading causes of suicidal behavior
and people who don't sleep enough and
don't sleep well our predisposed to the
Prussian so we have a part of our
answers of our answers whether it is
possible to acquire a brain disease
because of the computer oh okay so but I
was talking about melatonin but okay
sorry we have a microphone actually
there is no difference because they are
affecting our retina the same way there
is light there is stimulation of the
retina in the in my eye the simulation
stimulates hypothalamus hypothalamus
simulates a pineal gland and the release
of melatonin area is happening or or not
so every screen in bed oh okay link to
sleep should I stop using computer
screens and light actually there is no
such research to indicate exactly but I
think that you should step two hours
before at least two hours lango question
I told you that I had like a lot of bad
news today a one more question are so
there are several apps for laptops or
mobile devices that make the screen more
orange red like flux or looks for
android devices and they advertise the
day because the emitted light is not the
blue bluish light but more orangish like
natural you know candle light it helps
sleeping better like actually not
sleeping better but not causing this
problem is it I oppose everything or the
answer is actually the favorite answer
of all the scientists it depends because
it is true that blue light has a greater
effect of the retina and it still
stimulate its more but or an orange
light simulates retina as well so maybe
it has less effect but bad news is that
it may cause such problems
oh one more question what about the
frequency of the screen is that doesn't
sorry where you are okay does it make
any difference or does make does it is
it important it's listening don't
probably right now because they are so
pretty much higher but the frequency of
the reference rate of the scheme is yes
I need to say there is no such research
so I don't want to make any assumptions
estimates estimations I don't want to I
don't want to lie and I don't want to
pass false information I think that it
doesn't matter because it's all about
the simulation of the brain so retina is
stimulated when when we see so no matter
if for example if I have my eyes closed
but if you direct your light to tio 2 2
into my eyes I will see some spots white
spots and it is stimulation of the
routine blind people but what kind of
blind is that I blindness or brain
blindness because I blind they don't see
so the way they are in the dark all the
time so I don't think that screen so
sorry oh there are some mechanism assos
mechanized associated with circadian
clock but you know there are some proofs
there are some research researchers that
provided evidence is that actually blind
people are not one hundred percent blind
so for example they don't um they see
black everywhere they leave it the dark
but actually there is some sort of
simulation and also there
other things associated with that for
example if we are living in a society
that lives in the day and goes to sleep
in the night actually it's a start it
establishes our soup kingdom clock just
by the you know because I'm doing this
dis hour this hour and so on some okay
okay so let's go on I'm extremely happy
with your are asking questions okay
let's go to some direct changes they
wrecked changes to the brain so for
example grain grey matter atrophy so
neurons the gray matter consists of
neurons and for your information white
matter is consists of accents these are
connections from one neuron to another
and so okay multiple studies have shown
that gray matter is shrinking and is
losing its volume because of the
processing of because of seeing screens
because of dealing with computers but it
is hard to because you know we should
differentiate between using screen in
general including phones TV and so on so
on using internet using computer to work
and and many many more but I will talk
of any bit more general because I have
only one hour on the right now even less
okay so here you can see
some data from the research from chiba
university and the yellow spots on the
brain graphics are representing places
in the brain that are affected by a gray
matter loss and these places are
considered to be directly associated
with such functions as attention working
memory long organization of memory
analytical thinking and so on so and the
scatter plots below are representing the
loss that the thickness of of the gray
matter and and how it is changing
throughout the course of the computer
use and we can see that the more we are
using computer and screens the thicker
our gray matter is so it is really
important because considering that in
the that most of research associated
with gray matter loss associated
schizophrenia shows that similar changes
are occurring in mental disorders
actually it's I think it's a weak
association between to the these issues
but the loss of gray matter is the loss
of cognitive function so too much
computers are come computers are causing
gray matter loss and therefore there are
causing cognitive function impairment
and therefore they may cause some
neurological disorders because for
example in schizophrenia there is 20 up
to twenty percent
rain Matt her loss and for example in
Alzheimer's disease there is even more
gray metal gray metal loss of course
good news is that it's not like I'm
using computer therefore i will have
alzheimer's disease because it's a
little bit more complicated their
genetic issues environmental issues but
i would like to discuss something that
is really important in psychiatry right
now because considering that for example
schizophrenia is caused by genes we
don't know that for sure but it's a most
probable that schizophrenia is caused by
genes impaired genes actually the myriad
of jeans and mixtures of genes that are
affected and the good news for
schizophrenic is the schizophrenics is
that they may have schizophrenic genes
but there is a huge possibility that
they won't develop schizophrenia in
their lives because the schizophrenia
genesis is consist of environmental
factors and genetic factors so
are you sure are you sure this is a
connected with 4 screen time and not
gaming but because gaming is a special
experience where we have a disconnect
what you see and what I was feeling
schedule is sitting in a place but
seeing screen moving so this very
special experience doesn't really relate
to screen time yes because you know we
will have another examples of how a
special gaming affect brain grey matter
thickness but um it's a spoiler a little
bit but very simple if we play games in
some amount of time it may cause some
benefits but if we play games a little
longer it is treated as normal screen
time and it causes it may cause gray
matter and shrinking so it's a little
bit a paradox because I can see your
face I can't hear what you think
biologists yeah I think I know I know
your point but because but why gave me
why I ok but gaming is explained time ok
so as I said we should differentiate
between you're seeing static text gaming
internet use screen time in general
including TV smartphones and so on so on
but there is not such research to
differentiate it and an exact way to to
to answer your question I am really
sorry that I cannot provide exact
information but right now I am talking
about the exposure to light to exposure
to light up
because we because when for example you
have a monitor in front of your in front
of your face and there is a little space
between your face your eyes and the
monitor and also the natural light the
sunlight it is different than the light
of the monitor but the space between
your eyes and the monitor is really
important and the way you look at it so
for example doctors say and that we
should look at the monitor to diminish
the effect of the light of the monitor
we should look at it from the top
actually so for example looking from
from the downside it's really
detrimental to our brain looking from
the this side or this side so it is
important how when you look at the
monitor what is the space between your
face your eyes in the monitor and the
type of light on the mind of another
question yeah very very quick one is
there any data that pertains to the
ratio of how screen time affects you in
neurological diseases vs for example
genetic factors no there is not such a
research it is you know not many
scientists want to research that
actually when before I was before this
conference I was searching through
PubMed or Google Scholar to find some
publications and they're a little known
about this so that's why I'm underlying
this fact that there is well I know the
weakness witnesses of these research
researchers I know the real weaknesses
of these data especially as
our computer scientists but we we should
generalize I'm sorry but maybe I will
write a ground about it and I will start
with maybe you will inspire me to to to
apply for a grant okay let's move on I I
think that i want to say everything what
i want wanted to say today but it's
amazing that you're asking so many
questions you're my favorite type of
people that i really okay another think
loss of integrity of the brain white
matter so as I said white matter is
consist of connections between neurons
in Europe but there is a specific type
of connection because there are too many
times of connections between neurons
there are access and actions are
connections that provide information
information from the neuron to another
neuron and so for example the
information in action and action can
travel only from the neuron to another
neurons so no different way okay so here
you see the green spots show the portion
of white matter that is not affected in
an urn the relation to healthy
individuals in the relationship people
who don't play computer games or don't
expose themselves to the monitors
allowed and the red spots are these
places where there is shrinking of axons
of white matter observed and enter
as you may see it is in the majority of
the loss is observed observed in the
frontal lobes of the brain and as I said
earlier frontal lobe is associated with
attention with analytical planning with
with memory working memory but as I
observed today you really want to me to
differentiate between reading static
text and gaming and so on so on so for
example in this study it is it includes
also be some in their indirect features
of the internet and by saying that I say
for example how for example Google
effects our analytical thinking and so
and so on I will explain that later in
this presentation so as I said neurons
that fire together wire together and
therefore talk to each other so if we
were one huge brain and in for example
then from this area of the brain was
speaking with men from this area or
would this area of the of the brain a
connection between these two men or
neurons would appear and so in your wire
fires and at the same time another
neuron fires and connection is created
and the more information is traveling
between two these two neurons and
actually this is a very simplistic model
of the creating new connections between
neurons because I also we may head movie
may have populations of neurons that for
example
and have the same frequency as another
population of neurons a group of people
and also these brainwaves may show face
synchronization so for example when we
have 10 Hertz activity and in one part
of the brain and another 10 Hertz
activity in another part of the brain
and even face synchronization between
two kernels of eg or cure occurs then
there is a strong wiring strong creation
of new neuronal connections in the brain
so this diagram shows please look at a
and here you can see a face
synchronization so we have two Connells
you have seen probably EG electrodes on
the brain and so on you have some and
one electrode shows one count of 20
minutes one panel of on the EEG and it
is in like this and other electrode may
show another kernel and when face
synchronization of cures there is neural
plasticity this process occurs as well
so this is the sign that these two
regions of the brain are talking to each
other please look at BC here we have the
exact representation of this process and
why it is important because recent study
at MIT showed that the synchronization
of frequencies phase synchronization is
directly associated with the creo
creation of new memories
so when the two as I said when the two
areas of the brain so for the
hippocampus and renal cortex want to
exchange information and these two this
these two particular areas are very
directly associated with the creation of
new memories especially long-term memory
they need to synchronize these they
their activity what why I am talking
about this because if we consider that
exposure to light of the monitor screen
time internet use and sorry that I don't
differentiate between these but if it
causes this connectivity in the brain
there are less association in our brain
I would like to do an experiment right
now to engage you a little bit I see
somebody a little bit okay right now I
would like all of you to close your eyes
all of you all of you all of you oh okay
so listen to this recording carefully
youtube please yes close your eyes
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba okay oh you can
open your eyes what have you heard but
okay okay once again right now with open
eyes ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba dad okay so
why why we have heard baba at the
beginning and then Dada it is the same
recording believe it is a it is because
our brain uses the same wires to
manipulate different areas of the brain
is functioning so for example our vision
directly affect affect our Harry and our
hearing directly affect our vision
because the information travels in the
same wires and it is important because
when you see me you see my posture you
see my body and you can hear me and you
don't have to think about when where I
am walking and then stop thinking about
this and thinking about where I'm saying
your you are doing this at the same time
because your brain is working on many
areas in the same time and it is
extremely important so for example that
that is why this connectivity associated
with too much a screen exposure may harm
our attention and
our ability to manipulate different
areas of brains functioning ok I would
like to say a little bit about different
areas of the computer use so for example
if I was talking about light exposure of
the monitor and computers in general but
I would like to talk a little bit about
how specific computer tools affect our
life so let's talk about Google sorry
google so these days ago years ago we
had to know where to find information
where to find specific boats because you
cannot because you cannot know
everything or you should you you had to
know where to find the person that knows
something so for example my daddy knows
how to hunt or my mommy knows how to
cook so I so I'm making Association so
okay so if I want to create organize a
party and I need to somebody to hunt for
me the
and I need my mommy to cook so I need to
make a plan I mean it to some analytical
thinking and make my own reasoning but
in the area of Google which is you know
Rugal I'm putting some information and I
want information right now right here in
the form that I expect to expect it and
this is extremely harmful especially
when we talk about teenagers because
they want information right now right
here in the form that I wish worse our
grandfathers our fathers mothers and so
on so on had to create their own
reasoning their plan to are they they're
on their own reasoning to approach the
answer and that's how it is harming our
Brennan and also I talked about this
because the place in the brain that
creates long-term memory is called
hippocampus it is also associated with
spatial orientation so spatial
orientation actually is associated with
memory and that's why we should one for
example people who compete in their
competitions that memory competitions
memorizing a sequence of many many cards
or many many numbers are actually
creating a palace of memory so there
imagining moving for the palace and
looking at different cards in this
palace but they are moving and that's
how they can memorize such sequences of
cars or numbers or faces and so and so
on because of the association between
space and thoughts and memories and that
is why i think the use of computers too
much us because we we can't get
generalize
much but it's may harm our reasoning and
that's why probably these specific areas
of the brain the frontal lobe are upset
to have gray matter loss sorry I have
you think that this question will be
hard um question is couldn't you be just
a matter of specialization in the sense
that memory is important but if you use
less memory you've got more over to use
for higher reasoning now why would
Google be bad because your memory usage
would diminish but your processing power
would increase problem no no because you
know i think that the process of
acquiring information from google is
less complicated than acquiring
information from books are from people
stuff instead of searching for
information we use different pathways
for example for reasoning about this
information that we found and i guess
the question is not if if the access to
information makes you think less or it
maybe maybe it's just when you you know
you don't have to try hard as hard to
get this information you have some you
know cpu powers left to do something no
no there is not such thing that for
example brain is not working in the way
that for example we have some power and
if we use a less power here then we can
use more power here actually know when
brain doesn't use an area it's it's a
disappearing it no actually everybody
because uh because you said important
words trying hard actually trying hard
it's creating new connections it's the
way we create new
neuronal cells and for example and if
there is no such if we if I'm memorizing
things without connecting connecting
into space when I'm memorizing things in
this in the spice website I need to make
more connections because i need to make
connections associated with the memory
so for example that gift like this is
lower this is what it is and that this
lays here so for example at two
connections or two to cells that this is
what it is and that this is laying here
so for example when I want to remember
what was it I'm remembering me sending
here walking like this and look at it
and I can see it in my mind but if we
want to just remember that this is what
it is I it's really hard and actually
accidents are as well accents have nail
in chief it's a she that is protecting
an axle and it helps to infer the
information to travel faster and if
there are more information associated
with this specific cell then a neuronal
sheath me at kneeling sheath is is
bigger and so I hope this answers it
quence question okay I think that I
don't have much time that it does okay
so i have another experiment and I don't
want to skip this because it's important
a in the relation to what and what we
are we were talking about the
but I don't think that making people's
keep food it's a good okay fine so let's
say in the subject of associations I
will show you how it work because you
know science is experiments are
extremely important okay so right in in
a minute I will present some images
photos and stuff like this and you will
try to memorize them in the precise
sequence so one air image coming after
another and in the in this way exact way
you you you will have to memorize it so
please focus your intention and we will
try to find out whether there is
somebody able to memorize everything
okay ready okay let's go okay I don't
usually do that but i can start start
off again but if you could tell quick
pass so okay so ready
okay is there anybody here or there that
is able to tell what you have seen a
minute ago here but uh what types of
things and you know but but it's so
sorry oh I need a one-person anyone's
here okay so uh please try no I can hear
yourself so the Rose the horse the lamp
a house a girl on a bike and then there
was the kitchen and then there was a
market but but you're not the speaking
the right sequence because they're
because they're not following dude this
way that you're telling me aha okay
sorry but it's not like you know I
thought I thought it was in this okay so
there were ten of the items please tell
me so the Rose the horse the lamb the
house the and the house and then I think
there was the bike with the lady then
the kitchen and then the market so I'm
missing two at least
ok ok ok ok ok but you you say 700 wow
ok throws horse lamb how house lady but
Christians market and I skipped all
those okay so you were unable right
actually you've done the best because I
presented it several times two different
type of communities and your score is
the best so congratulations but still
you haven't accomplished collision okay
let's try another approach so you want
to try it yes microphone please oh isn't
this about a working memory this is a
favorite at CF seven plus or minus
laughter you can remember anyway Barry
you watch long TV hour or not yes
actually this is true scientists
estimate that we are able to memorize to
store up to seven items in our working
memory so your data it's our data and
but I would like to try another approach
because actually these images that you
haven't said there are in your brain
there are in our brains so let's try
another approach you will say
on what side of the slide there is an
image that appeared before left or right
to 202 to be clear this is right this is
less ok ok so you can see that in the
relation to other information our brain
is doing very well to determine what it
remembers and what it doesn't remember
and that's why associations are
extremely important to our memory and
that's why connections between neurons
are crucial to the brains functioning
and going back to the point of our
presentation here you have the examples
of some researchers associated with this
issue so for example there are some
evidences that Alzheimer's disease is
associated with disconnection and and
the loss of a special of course loss of
gray matter and are also the white
matter that is extremely important to
make a neurons fire fire together and
also knew your synchrony that is
approached by creating new connections
is associated with impaired cognition is
in schizophrenia but I think talking
about schizophrenia I think I haven't
finished my one fault I think that's
somebody asked a question because it's
not like I am programming our i am using
computer and therefore i will have
schizophrenia because schizophrenia is a
genetic issue so for but it is to
express the genes that is associated
that are associated associated with
schizophrenia we need some environmental
factors so for example consider two kids
one kid is living in the pathological
family and another kid is living in
normal family so no one kid is having
schizophrenia genes and another is not
having schizophrenia genes but two kids
are having our living in a pathological
family so for example this kid that has
schizophrenic genes and lives in the
pathological family family will develop
schizophrenia because of environmental
factors that affect genes and the
expressions of genes is possible because
of the factors that are contributing to
this expression and the child that for
example has schizophrenic genes but
lives in normal family in some way is
schizophrenias you have genes but you
won't develop it and considering that
computers may lead to depression anxiety
stress you know because sitting in one
position for a long time and the sense
of isolation because of working at the
compound the computer for example in big
companies people work on computers a lot
and they feel a sense of isolation and
they may develop schizophrenia if they
are having a schizophrenic jeans because
there are environmental factors
contributing so computers are not
directly associated with severe mental
diseases as schizophrenia but they are
in the group of environmental factors
that can contribute to the development
of schizophrenic that's why we should
diminish the amount of time of
the computer so for example scientists
recommend using less than five hours a
day of computer for people who actually
this this amount I know your your
reaction is telling everything but but
this is a threshold actually you are
doing with computer computers as a
computer scientist so probably your
situation is different but considering
people who are working in companies and
they are forced to work with computers
and for example they have to work many
hours even after work on the computer
and they have a sense of isolation they
have a lot of stress and they develop
depression anxiety in thorns on and
that's why we that's why scientists
recommend for employers to diminish the
amount spent on the computer to around
five hours and I know that this is quite
impossible in our era okay I can see
that we wish it the we should finish so
i will talk a little bit faster right
now so
but you want me to stop I will stop
because I can step right now actually
zipping on the audience okay uh yeah oh
good music yes we have good news so we
have to go so um yes developing for
schizophrenia in general first case yes
around 15 years old to 20 something this
is the crew crucial time to develop
schizophrenia but there some for example
children who are born schizophrenic so
for example they are developing
schizophrenia from the young age but it
is really hard to diagnose schizophrenia
in kids since kids have imaginary
friends and it's hard to differentiate
whether it is associated with
schizophrenia and imagination of a young
individual so another research
researchers research dopamine function
in people who used too much computer of
cognitive functioning and the cortical
thickness as i said i'm sorry i cannot
say more in at the slide but i have to
go to good news
on the other hand there was a research
who examined playing super mario and the
brain and actually there there was a
gray matter development in these people
and right spots on the brains up here
are representing areas of the brain that
reported some development and some bonus
benefits of you playing super mario
because it helps attention it helps our
reasoning because you know it's as I
said it's really hard and wood to
differentiate games into the screen time
and so on but in this research they
played I think as I remember about two
hours a day of Super Mario but I think
and that's why they reported the
development of gray matter but I think
if they would play I would have played
more they would develop they would
report neuronal loss I to information i
will speak faster just this
another research people with dyslexia a
read faster when disposed to some
computer programs improvement in
eyesight people who work with computers
more actually are able to see small
details more clearly like a tiny writing
and also they perceive find differences
differences in contrast and stuff like
this so for example preceding
differences in contrast are the very
first things to be inferred and dementia
and Alzheimer's disease so good news and
also young doctors with previous
exposures to gaming and using computer
in general actually are doing fewer
errors and they are diagnosing better
especially surgeons are more precise and
when actually there are many techniques
surgical techniques right now for
example da Vinci robot which which is
actually which actually looks like a
game when you have to use a robot and
therefore you operate and conclusion
computers are not that bad it depends
how we use them and how much we use them
and also there is a researcher
researcher at university of california
san diego professor Vinogradov the
reported that using computer games
improved schizophrenia cognitive
function in schizophrenic patients
patients ok we knew just this is the
last slide I just want to say I just
want to say that too much of everything
is is bad even too much of broccoli
again too much of water even so much of
physical activity and that's why we
should just stay a reasonable and
responsible for this machine here and
any questions
