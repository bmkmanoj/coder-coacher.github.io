is a Prezi which you can access online
if you want to
in fact I've put a post this morning on
peerless if you go peer list and search
on s fractal my handle or the title or
EF 17 you can get a copy of the talk and
get ahead of me if you want to to see
what so I got coming up next and also if
people have questions and when you think
of them when I'm on a particular slide
you can go ahead and type them right
into peer list and at the end I'll do
those questions first whoever put them
online and if you think of questions
tomorrow I'll answer them tomorrow or
whatever standard disclaimers the all
the views expressed here will be my own
not for any of the people I have worked
for or currently work for or anything
like that it is just after lunch we're
still waking up let me get a feel of
who's here can I have everybody raised
their hand whose age 40 or younger
all right the vast majority of you were
born after I graduated from college so
I'm old another little test okay
everybody raise their hands okay put
your hand down if you've been hacked
someone in your family's been hacked
your company's been hacked or you've
been impacted by any hack there's
actually more hands up in this crowd
than in a normal normal place I talk yet
so that's good you know put your hands
down now thank you so cyber security has
been in the news a lot lately I happen
to live in Northern Virginia outside
Washington we get the Washington Post
every day this is from just a couple
weeks ago I will have to say to those of
us in the cyber community this is a
little bit like a headline that says the
army uses guns
but unfortunately there's been some
other incidents this particular ones in
Philadelphia where that where the train
systems were hacked into and probably
many of you are from the Bay Area you
probably remember this one when they
ransom where'd the the BART system
so unfortunately cybersecurity is in the
news a lot lately and that's because all
sin done the hackers are winning and and
why is it the hackers are winning
because we live in a bunch of glass
houses so it's real easy to throw rocks
at it where the houses are the software
and the software has a lot of
vulnerabilities and I do think we in
this room in this particular ecosystem
can do a lot better and and actually you
know we'll be more successful in the
future because of some of the things
that are done with our language and
that's what I'll talk about a little bit
more so one of the reasons I know that
it's easier for the attacker than it is
for the defender is because I spend most
of my career being a defender but my
career got a pretty much a jump start
back during the first iraqi war back in
1990-1991
I happen to have been doing some work
for for the US government's I had the
right clearances when the war started
and they needed somebody and this new
cyber stuff was nobody really understood
it that well so I did get to work with
some of the information warfare people
in the early days and it really
impressed upon me how much easier the
offense has it than the defense and now
I get to go to a lot of hacker
conferences and stuff like that and it
is a lot of fun to be offense but it's
way better to be defense it's a harder
job and it really needs to get done and
again I think we have some of the tools
to help with that so I'll have more on
that later in the talk I am an official
member of the tinfoil hat brigade this
is me being inducted into it and just
because you're paranoid doesn't mean
they're not out to get you so that is
something you really need to think about
in this space and I'll have a lot of
what we in the in the cyber world called
FUD fear uncertainty and doubt I will
have a lot of that throughout my talk
but it is a large where there's a lot of
problems there is a lot of opportunity
so let's talk instead of talking why
should you be doing cyber sphere because
you're afraid of something let's
about because that's where the money is
so the prediction is that in the next
five years one trillion dollars will be
spent on cybersecurity that's a really
really big number now embedded in that
number is some of the work from this
ecosystem I'm sure whatsapp is in there
because whatsapp is it's a security
application but I actually think it
could grow to be a much larger segment
of it and if you're looking for work
there's 1 million currently open jobs in
cybersecurity now if you think about it
there's a lot of job openings in
cybersecurity that's another reason why
I thought fence is winning because
there's just not enough people working
on the defense and unfortunately if you
saw the talk when the talks in the
morning on the things going on and they
don't know things I think there's
another talk tomorrow on it computers
are becoming more and more pervasive
they're being in more and more things
and as they become more and more things
I mean it's no big deal sign done it'd
be embarrassing to me if my computer
crashed right now but it's not gonna be
the end of the world however if I have
an insulin pump and it's connected to
the internet and somebody hacks into it
I could literally die okay and so the
the safety threat of secure of software
has not really been looked at as much as
it should an organization I could
recommend to everybody I'll talk about
in a second but we can't count on
somebody else solving all these problems
the cavalry isn't coming so I am the
cavalry and so are you and there is a
volunteer organization called I'm the
cavalry that you can get involved with
helping with particularly safety
critical items and and how to make them
more secure and with the Internet of
Things coming I think again there's
large opportunities for the Erlang
elixir OTP beam etc stuff to to go with
little bit of cyber tutorial to sort of
get everybody on the same page some of
the things I'm gonna define maybe a lot
of you know some of them I might define
a little bit differently that some
people use for those people who know me
I'm very semantically pendentive so I'll
get into a little bit and I think it'll
it'll help a little bit to calibrate to
when we get do get into talking about
the ecosystem and what
and be done so I'm not gonna spend the
rest of the time going over all the
different vocabulary cybersecurity just
like every field has its own set of
words that it would take hours to
explain and it's got a bunch of domains
and I'm not going to explain the slide
either they're there just to say it's a
very complex field with a really lot
going on that I can't cover it all in a
few minutes so I'm gonna I'm gonna keep
it fairly simple first myth the bust is
there's a common myth that well you
don't really need good security you just
need to have better security than the
next guy which is the standard you know
I don't need to outrun the tiger I just
got outrun the guy next to me kind of
example and the problem is in security a
better example would be you have to out
swim the school of piranhas and then it
doesn't matter if there's ten other
people with you there you're all gonna
get eaten and swimming is a lot harder
and everything else so what we need is
we need security and security is like to
the boat
but just because you have security you
also can't be stupid you can't stick
your hand in the water if you're in the
boat and we have an awful lot of that
that goes on also so use the the Tiger
example before obviously what was in the
news on the Washington Post and in a lot
of cases there are also a lot of armies
basically there are now whole divisions
of the army doesn't matter which country
you're in you're against all the other
countries and what's going on here in
cyberspace that put a lot of effort into
exploiting these vulnerabilities but all
said and done the reason they can is
because the vulnerabilities are there
some more vocabulary common the common
words in the cyber world are you're on
the red team or you're on the blue team
so I spent most of my career on the blue
team I've been defending assets I've
been trying to keep the hackers out of
the stuff that I'm doing if you're on
the red team you're the attacker you're
the guy who gets to exploit those old
bilities and go in now another set of
words that get used our black hat and
white hat so a red team is attacker a
blue team is defender and it's generally
associated with the black hat the bad
guy is the attacker and the white hat is
the good guy is the defender notice one
of the areas where I'm going to be a
little bit more semantically pen antic
than most it's not good guy and bad guy
that's a that's an emotional judgment
depends on
team you're on the other guys always the
bad guy my definition of the white hat
is the one who has the permission of the
asset being attacked
to have the attack occur and they
understand the risks involved and it is
a very common thing to do what's called
pen testing or penetration testing um
that you want someone to test your
defenses so it is a white hat on white
hat that you you give the red team
permission to attack you for the purpose
of finding your vulnerabilities but if
you are attacking someone else then
you're a you're a black hat how many of
you in the room are software developers
I'm sure you've probably heard of the
agile manifesto if you haven't heard of
the rugged manifesto I'd recommend you
look at it it's like the agile manifesto
but for the purpose of rugged DevOps
there's a lot of stuff in it but one
that I particularly want to emphasize to
everybody is this particular phrase in
it I recognize that my code will be
attacked by talented and persistent
adversaries who threaten our physical
economic and national security so when
you're designing recognize there are
evil people out there and they will be
trying to get into your code and they
will take advantage of it now I don't
know all the things it will take to
secure your code but you probably do if
you have to sort of wear the hat of hey
I'm turning turning sides today I'm
gonna do something bad or whatever I'm
working on you probably can think of
some stuff well do that think of it and
fix it this is one of the the main
messages no talk and security could be
complete without discussing a risk it's
sort of a mandatory if you talk about
security you got talk about risk so
define it a little bit as a risk is you
have something the asset that somebody
else wants to either take from you
corrupt what you have or know what it is
so it's either confidentiality and
integrity or availability so they want
to do something to you and they have
some capability to do that that's the
vulnerability and in our space most of
the vulnerabilities are due to software
bugs now if you have one of these risks
okay what can you do about it
I should be you should be assessing your
your risk posture and one things you use
is you avoid the risk you avoid the risk
by getting rid of the vulnerabilities
put
patches in for example a very major
security breach of a few years ago was
something called Hart believe heartbleed
which was a bug in in SSH believe the
number is still at around 30 percent of
the systems are not yet patched and this
is two years ago it was in all the
headlines is a really big deal people
just don't got around to fixing stuff
fortunately none of our programs had any
of those issues the other thing you can
do is you can mitigate the risk that's
where a security technology comes in you
put in firewalls and intrusion detection
machines and proxies and sims which is a
type of thing that looks at all the
threats that are coming in and enhance
it off to an analyst for decision or for
making decisions what to do about it
that's called mitigation the other you
do is transfer the risk that's where
cyber insurance comes in you can pay
somebody else to basically accept your
wrist that's what you do with your house
with fire insurance you're worried about
your house burning down you pay a little
bit each year if your house ever burns
down the insurance company has the risk
of paying for building you a new house
you can do the same thing in cyber space
but the most common thing that's done is
acceptance which is you just say oh yeah
if they get in they get in and people do
the acceptance of the risk much to
cavalierly
and not formally enough they don't
actually realize the risks they're
taking I'm sure the president of Target
Corporation never signed off on a form
that said yes I agree if I let this HVAC
vendor you know do our stuff I'm gonna
get fired later but that is what
actually happened so talked about red
and blue talked about black and white
now I'm gonna talk about gray which gray
strangely enough doesn't go with black
and white it goes between red and blue
and there's a very good report I'd
recommend everybody look at this put out
by George Washington Center for
cybersecurity University Center for
cybersecurity
it's called into the grey zone and it
talks about the when you're on the blue
team and you're doing defense you're
basically doing stuff within your space
and if you're either a bad guy or a
military organization you're out
attacking somebody else there's this big
area in the middle in between where
there's some work needs to be done on
what is allowed to be done what isn't
allowed to be done blue team's can leave
their space and do things but doing the
classic thing everyone says is hacking
back hacking back is not a good thing to
do if you're a commercial enterprise for
the military maybe but for most of us we
really do that now probably many of you
are thinking hey a to find a bunch of
cyber stuff but doesn't really matter to
me I work on UNIX I'm working on Linux
machines and I worked in Erlang or
elixir and they don't have any of these
problems right so let's talk about that
just a little bit I do think that we in
this community are better off than
everyone else and I think mainly due to
OTP and I'll talk about that in a little
bit more in a second but if we call sort
I'm gonna switch analogies now instead
of the glasshouse I'm gonna switch to
the three little pigs if you call the
rest the world is living in a straw
house it's not very strong and the wolf
wolf can blow it down and we'll use that
as our as our base point and now let's
look at our community and see where are
we we stand so first off of OOP somebody
must've been hacking me
move on all these relatively famous
things bad things that happen to my
knowledge there's been no Erlang or
elixir or any beam based programs
involved that's that that's a good news
kind of thing okay there's a database
that's kept of all the known software
vulnerabilities it has a couple days ago
when I last checked it and had 83
thousand entries in it there were 13
entries for Erlang in there okay that's
a really small number
relatively to the big one and of the 13
only two of them were in the last three
years now that's good news okay it's
probably good news for the wrong reason
it's probably because actually nobody
cares about Erlang an elixir so that's
probably not a good thing and then
security we call that security by
obscurity and yeah maybe it could be a
very outer layer of your defense but it
wouldn't be something to count on it's
like hiding your key under your front
door Matt it's it's probably not going
to keep you out keep the bad guys out
especially when you have a lot of
remember the risk you know risk goes
with threat there's some very high
permit what we call high-value targets
there's some very high-value targets on
list you have the gaming industry you
have video games you have privacy apps
you think all those foreign all those
nation-states I had on that previous
chart aren't interested in getting into
what's a for a whisper so we probably do
have to take security more seriously
than we have been and we I think are
very close to being able to make it very
secure so what what's good about our our
ecosystem in this regard
Francisco gave a talk in this room just
before lunch on the five nines of
availability the five nines availability
are the things that were put in place to
do that are all very applicable to
security the fact that you can write
code and it works even when you have
bugs in it is is very powerful and very
good because it's really those kind of
vulnerabilities that hackers take the
biggest advantage of so let it hail fail
is very good but I think the lightweight
processes is at least as important in my
opinion as sort of cloud computing comes
into the forefront now there is going to
be much much more concurrent processing
going on and as we figure out how to
design software better we're going to
start designing smaller simpler program
that interact more with each other which
which again the Erlang ecosystem is very
good for for doing and it's particularly
good for security applications which is
what I'm pushing so I think doing all of
that gets us out of the straw house and
into the stick house I don't think we're
quite up to where we need to get to yet
which is which is the brick castle so
that's that's where we want to do and I
think again I think we're almost there I
think the one of the more important
aspects of that is the whole let it fail
take take advantage of that but you have
to add to it let it fail you have to add
to let it fail with let it be hacked you
have to stay take into account not just
you have to worry about single faults
and double faults you have to worry
about malicious activity if you just
think about it a little bit you can put
that a little bit more in again it's
going to be programmed dependent on what
you do and all of some specific things
to do in a little bit but yeah again I
think that I think that the progression
of computer languages and software
development is going to start leading us
to a whole new paradigm that I think
we're in a good position for now what
can you do to harden your code more not
this is not rocket science this was
written like 4000 years ago or something
you have to think like you're under me
you have to you have to think like Oh
what if this afternoon I decided to
become a bad guy what would I do and
then you have to assume well somebody
might do that it might be an insider
threat it might be you really can't tell
the difference between an insider
threaten an intruder because once an
intruder gets into your system the act
just like an insider anyway so you do
have to take those into account and
again we talked before about the red
team the you can't have a white hat red
team you you should be thinking you
should be testing your systems to try
and get into them to see what you can
figure out to do and then and then fix
those particular issues now there are
some very common mistakes that are made
there's people put up a bunch of these
lists this particular organization is
the open web application security
platform I think I'm not sure on the P
but it's a group of people who basically
get to go and say hey we want to make
the web more secure let's do things to
make it more secure and they for a
number of years have been publishing a
basically top ten stupid things to do
list of all the hacks that come out in
the last year what were they caused by
and it's really sad the list has not
changed much over most of the time
they've been publishing it and all of
them are mistakes that software
developers could have fixed all most of
them are mistakes that software
developers could have fixed in their
code simple things like input validation
in functional programming it is much
easier to do in validation than it is in
some of the other languages but just as
easy to do doesn't mean everybody does
it okay so you just have to make sure
you you again think like the enemy put
it put input in not only keep the bugs
out but design it in a way that can
handle it
and then you need to think out of the
box some actually let me do this one
first so again the let it fail aspect is
besides let it fail let it be hacked you
have to think about this as fray says
you have to think about what will
somebody be trying to do and then do
that well I do that then fix it so they
can't do that
so thinking out of the box start tuned
case is too small for the people in the
back basically has a couple bad guy
security geeks have stolen a laptop and
saying oh we can't get in because it's
encrypted with a super great encryption
that we can't do it when the real life
is no just take the guy hit him over the
head until he's going to tell you what
the password is so you've done your own
only yeah yeah you have to think about
all aspects of the problem
all right so I want to talk about
attacking responding to attacks if
machine speed now first is why do we
need to do that what's the problem we're
trying to solve so this is from the
Verizon data breach report it's actually
a couple years old I think the new
numbers might actually build up be a
little bit worse and what it basically
says is that the attackers are
sophisticated adaptive automated and can
get into your system within seconds okay
and the defenders are manual slow and
not very coordinated and it takes them a
long time to find people and get them
out in fact the average dwell time the
time between the hacker getting into
your system and you're getting in out of
their system is currently 210 days
that's a really long number it's
actually been growing I think the reason
it's been growing is not because hackers
are getting better it's because we're
actually getting a little better at
finding them but we find them we find
out they've been in there for three
years and that makes the averages co-op
so um but I was at RSA is a big security
conference held here in San Francisco
has held about a month ago being 43,000
and my best friends were over at the
Moscone Center and I heard a great quote
from one of the speakers from the speed
of light to the speed of lawyers okay
and one of the problems is the defense
does somewhat work at the speed of
lawyers and you do actually have to get
your legal team involved when a breach
occurs but what you should have done
it's gotten your legal team involved
before the breach you know I have to not
only worry about the technology aspects
but worry about the process acts aspects
get the legal team involved before so
you have permission to do what you need
to do to respond in real-time but the
problem the fundamental issue is
technologically the attackers are way
ahead because there's lots of
vulnerabilities they have lots of
automated ways to take advantage of them
so militaries recognize this problem
they have this standard military speak
of this stuff called C cubed I command
control communications and intelligence
and they started up some work a few
years ago on this thing called sticks
and taxi and basically how to share
threat intelligence how different
companies different governments
governments with companies can share hey
what are the bad guys doing so that you
know when bank 1 gets hacked they can
share to bank 2 3 4 how to how to fix it
and and learn from those problems works
been going ok but it's got a lot of
process issues because all said and done
nobody really wants to say hey I've been
Act they don't to tell everybody else
that it's too late you've already been
hacked it's not helping you to tell
anyone else everyone else would benefit
but you wouldn't so they have a lot of
process issues with that so now they're
trying to solve the the command and
control side of the issue so and they're
speak command and control is c2 and
there's a effort going on that I've been
involved in called open c2 and that's
what I'm gonna talk about a little bit
more and it's part of something called
integrated of adaptive cyber defense
which says hey if we got all these
Pete's parts we got to make them so they
have standard interfaces to each other
so you know the stuffs all changing very
quickly we can't what we currently have
today in these technologies the
proprietary interfaces and you get
locked into them so instead let's let's
for know what the functions are this is
how they define the function sentencings
is is the indicators that are coming out
of all these sensors since making is the
hey we should add some context around it
and this isn't just an IP address it's
an IP address that's on this bad guy
list that we already have stuff like
that then make a decision about it oh
it's an IP address that's on a bad guy
list we probably shouldn't block it and
then do something about it acting is the
actual hey let's go do something about
it and the first baby step in all this
is to hey we we say go block that IP we
should all be speaking the same language
we should have a common protocol to do
that with and that's what open c2 is
designed to do so they got together some
government people some commercial people
a bunch of large users of technology
equipment and a bunch of vendors and
said ok let's create this language and
they did and I'm not gonna go into a lot
of detailed language but I will have
some some we'll have a demo of it and a
little B in a couple slides later but
why do I think it's why do we need it
and why do I think it's gonna going to
be used the reason the government wants
it is because this military you know
when we get attacked we want to respond
an attack in real time and that's a
that's a good reason the reason
commercial wants it is some what are the
same you what you want to read be able
to respond quickly they of course can't
do the attack back stuff but they can
get into these grey space areas but more
importantly I think the major driver
this is going to be like major driving
with most things is going to be money
and what's the money involved here
there's really two main drivers
Security's gonna want to spend a
trillion dollars over the next five
years it's a really big sum so you can
shave it you know
a few percentage points off but there's
still really big numbers and I actually
think we can shave large amounts off it
and one of the reasons is because as the
world does move to more concurrent
processing more shared resources more
you're changing what you're doing you
can in real time adjust to how much how
much your security spend is most the
time you're sitting there I had a I'll
call it an idle state you're not
spending much on it you get some big
DDoS attack then you spin up a bunch of
resources to deal with it you pay for
them for the amount of duration you need
them and then you spin them down again
well to do that you need this automated
command and control that I've been
discussing so it's gonna save some money
right now you you basically pay for all
those extra resources Liam sit there 99%
of time when you're not under attack
then you get attacked and you use them
they were worth that amount of money but
it'd be better if they were cheaper and
then the other main driver is the vendor
lock-in I referred to before I worked
for AT&amp;amp;T for a large number of years I
used to buy tens of millions of dollars
worth of security gear and we'd have
these bake-offs
and company a would be tout Company B
and C buy a little bit and it wouldn't
beat him out because they're better in
all areas they beat him out because
they're better and you know sort of the
sum of the total was better and then six
months later the company being that we
didn't pick would be better than Company
A me but I'd be stuck because we'd
already have locked into whatever we're
doing because it wasn't just that we
were buying hardware back then it was
also that they had a ecosystem that had
a bunch of interfaces that were
proprietary and I'd have to rip them all
out and put new ones in it was too
expensive
now with this stuff we won't have to do
that so I think that will be a major
driver so now let's talk oak ass so
Anoka is a South American tuber or oak
ass could be open C to API simulator I
don't like acronyms so to me it's a
potato but so this is something that
I've programmed to work on work with
this this new protocol that's come out
open c2 and I should probably say it's
programmed in Erlang and I'm not really
an airline programmer I actually took
the Erlang course from Marcus in the
back of the room two years ago then of
course ignored Erlang for a year so
forgot most of it spun up again about a
year ago to start some work and then
start on this work about three months
ago I have been an early
enthusiasts for about 15 years because I
manage the group at AT&amp;amp;T in the year
2000 I moved from doing a bunch of
spooky government stuff into the part of
the research part of AT&amp;amp;T Labs into
something I used to call the ampersand
because we were the and in R&amp;amp;D we used
to take stuff out of research and turn
it into into development and and there
were some really good people in the in
the group and a couple of more really
hardcore functional programming
enthusiasts and they have these great
arguments while we're going to coffee on
you know Oh camel versus Culver erlang
that I sort of learned all this stuff
from their coffee arguments but they
never actually used any of this stuff in
our job I mean I just and what we
programmed in and once I moved in a job
and there were some great network
research being done by Michael Merritt
and first and long and Kim Griffin so we
had you know we're a big chunk of the
network we had a lot of network
visibility say hey this stuff would be
really useful for the for the commercial
cyber guys like the government used to
do when I was in the government space so
we should make some tools to do that and
I thought of this tool called called it
fathom for plumbing the depths of the
network and as we're getting it was sort
of a little side project we're gonna do
on the side and we're starting it up and
Gary Hudson's was sitting in the front
row here was one of those functional
programming enthusiasts convinced me to
let him do it in Erlang so I did the
project was a huge success it's still
running it's handled you know it saved a
TV a lot of money and in people doing
things but it's also just it's made as
much better at what we do and it was
always up and it always worked and it
was just it convinced me Erlang was the
best thing but again I was a manager and
a security architect not an actual
programmer I retired three years ago
said hey I should actually you know do
some useful things down I've always
wanted to learn Erlang so so I took took
the course learned it and this is
programmed in it but that's all a long
way of saying you know feel free to feel
free to throw rocks at it I'm still a
beginner gonna cover in a little bit
more detail the purpose of it go through
the architecture real quick and show you
where it is I'll show you where it is
right now it's at that link or you can
go to my github repository and see my
cloned copy of it it's got a bunch of
stuff on how to help please help me
ground rules it's got things like the
collective
code construction contract how you can
how we can all work together on it style
guides and all the usual stuff so why
did I do it well I'm on this Standards
Committee trying to put together this
standard and I want it to actually work
I want I want different systems to be
able to inter work with himself more
with it so we need this thing called
validation and verification we need to
we need to verify than any particular
implementation works but more
importantly particularly in these early
stages we got to validate the spec is
right that we're actually making the
protocol the right protocol and so we've
already been using it for this I
programmed this in Erlang some other
people program some actual
implementations in Python we get them to
talk to each other even before we get
them to talk to each other we started
doing stuff I say hey I'm doing it this
way then go I'm doing it this way I'm
gonna hey hey we weren't gonna talk to
each other what do we do that maybe we
should change the spec so that it says
whichever ways the right way doesn't
matter we should at least do it so they
can talk to each other so it's been used
for that already but you can do a lot
more than that you can use it to
actually simulate what's called an
actuator of an actual security device a
firewall an IDs a proxy malware
detonator lots of there's there's a
really long list of actuators which is
useful if you're building an
Orchestrator the thing that's doing
these decision-making things but it's
also useful with no okay thought maybe I
was out of time already it's it's also
useful if you're when you're building
one of these you're building them to
what's called a profile hey this is what
we mean by a firewall and the standards
body is what's putting out these
profiles and again we need to validate
those so it's again coming hand it we're
working on the first one now the
firewall one and it's come in handy for
that but if you can simulate one of them
then you can simulate a network of them
and if you're simulating a network of
them you can simulate being an entire
enterprise network if you want and so
again when one Orchestrator you know say
Bank of America wants to tell M&amp;amp;T Bank
hey we just got hacked and we we think
you know this is what we did to prevent
in case you want to do it what they do
this thing called a course of action you
can give those kind of information it's
not hey I want to put this particular
command in this
to clear firewall it's more than hey you
want to mitigate this big thing that the
language handles both and you want to
test those kinds of things you can do
use this for that also and that gets
into gaming play books it's if you're
going to be attacked how do you want
your system to respond if you want to
operate at machine speed you can't have
a person making that decision you've got
to have pre thought out what are the
under these conditions we want to do
this in response those are called play
books and you can practice them work out
the details of them make sure you're
doing it right and of course if you can
do that on the defensive side then you
can take advantage of that on the
offensive side you can go ahead and read
team these two are we can we find your
way around we've made this set of play
books now let's play bad guy and see if
we can beat them and this the simulator
can be used for all those different
things or will be once some of those
things get finished not all of the
particular things I just said are
finished yet I'm still a work in
progress
so here's a particular open c2 command
it's got four components the action is
what you want to do deny the thing you
want to deny in this particular case an
IP address in other words that's a bad
guy you don't want to let them in you
want to deny it what do you want to do
it with you want to do it with a network
firewall and then there's some modifiers
in case you need some extra stuff like I
want a response back and things like
that and it's a restful api what are
used for restful api is well I used
cowboy comes in and on 80k that
particular JSON that we just saw comes
in on an HTTP POST comes the cowboy runs
the various runs through the various
behaviors it caught up with myself here
and calls the handler for this
particular you know for hey it is a JSON
it is a command it is an open C to
command great hand it to the open sea to
handler first thing open C to handler
does this it spins up whole separate
server if there wasn't one there already
in a simulator you'd already have this
stuff up that says hey what's the
environment am i simulating the language
I made this particular kind of firewall
I'm an IDs I respond to different
commands differently so you sort of need
to know what you're doing there parse
out the actions there's 33 different
actions it could be coming in in that
command I showed earlier than what
example I'm using now is denied so hey
go talk to the deny server that's got
all the hey what's what's being a deny
mean
what am I gonna do it to again targets
is an extremely oh really a lot of
choices for what can go here so a bunch
of different servers to simulate this in
ipv4 addresses ipv6 address this is a
you know malware dot-com domain whatever
and then hand the hand off the modifiers
and when you're all send done you then
say okay I've sort of checked that yeah
deny isn't one of the actions I need to
do and ipv4 is a valid thing but I don't
know if semantically they all go
together so I need to sort of now check
everything so you have them all talk to
each other and come out with yeah this
particular I'm doing a sunny day
scenarios this particular command works
it all goes through and then you say
great now go do it change the state of
the simulator from being what it was to
what it would be is if you really got
this command and you were a real network
and or a real device depending on what
you're simulating and you did it and
then when you're all send done you send
an answer back to the restful api that
it came in on and you're done now what's
left to do a lot still i want to demo
this in a second you'll see that the
responses look like a bunch of internal
Erlang gobbly gook state because that's
what they are at the moment because the
open sea two bodies still arguing about
what responses should look like actually
they just recently settled it but I have
to now code it in want to simulate being
an actual firewall I want to simulate it
being a network of them want to work
with with bigger grey boxes is a
simulator of a big network work with
that and maybe even connect it into a
real a real firewall real quick do a
demo first thing you always do is you're
on your tasks prove that yes I was a
good coder and did write a bunch of
tests and the secondary purpose is
you'll see there's basically test per
command so you can see a lot of the
commands that are in the language that
way I was cheating in that regard and
then I'm gonna run it from shell so you
can see all that junk it creates when
you when you're running it and I'm going
to switch over to a graphical HTTP
client and again I cheated and put in
all that code that all that JSON that I
showed you earlier and that's
is already there and that's in right up
here and this is basically that same
thing that was on that slide and I can
go send a request and an answer came
back and you can see lots of stuff
happened nothing back with what
debugging messages and just keeping
track of what's going on but what it
responded with here shows that yes it
did spin up a couple you know didn't use
that in this particular case I just
turned it on it didn't have an IP V
server before so went ahead and turned
that on it didn't have a firewall server
so it turned that on and there's some
other stuff in there so yes it is real
code it does work yes it's probably not
the best written code ever so help is
welcome for the sake of people who
couldn't see the live demo there's some
canned versions of it on these slides
you just real quickly saw what I typed
in the same as before so let me conclude
with hopefully you've learned a little
bit about security I've sprinkled
throughout the talk some of these are a
couple free books on security Twitter
tweet me or comment on peer list I'm
happy to share plenty of information
with anybody who wants it if people want
more information maybe you want to get
involved and go to some hacker
conferences I highly recommend the
b-sides conferences Def Con is this
really big conference that yeah you
could go to but you'd probably be better
off at a local one there the b-side San
Francisco was just was just a few weeks
ago besides Washington is also called
hacked over fast it's in the fall I
highly recommend that they have the
coolest badges they're bottle openers a
lot of beer flows at those I'd mentioned
before the I am the cavalry if you want
to get involved this is their actual you
get a little bit more from them from
their from your their website but help
out in the safety of software writing
writing safer software will all be
better off if we do that maybe the next
billion dollar airline company is going
to come because one of you has an eye
yeah if you do you know send me at least
a few thousand dollars of it or whatever
again Red Team your code think like a
bad guy think not just your code but
whatever you're working on whatever
project whatever company you're in think
about yes people will do bad things to
me so therefore think about them ahead
of time just the thinking about them
will will make everything better
and again software developers hopefully
you'll build security in a little bit
more because of what you've learned
today obviously I'm very passionate
about open c2 I think it's gonna make a
really big difference I think five years
from now we'll look back and go how why
didn't we do this a long time before how
could they not have done this but I
think they think life is going to get
better with it and obviously I've shown
you my crappy code and want some help
with it so please please help and then
finally I'm going to end with a quote
from Dan Gear he is one of the if I find
it and don't screw it up he is one of
the cybersecurity is leading thought
leaders and he always ends his talk with
this and I was got kicked out of it
Salman and mine with it there is never
enough time thank you for yours
I'm I call it I call it semi-retired I
actually really enjoy cybersecurity so
when I retired I need I had health
reasons so that I didn't want to be
working 60 hours a week but I wanted to
still stay in touch so I I work at most
20 hours a week and at most three weeks
in a row and people pay me of scenes
about some money to tell them
intuitively obvious things they should
be doing so it's a great job by the way
you're all welcome to hire me but only
for a little bit that's an excellent
question again being hackers we all
think very evilly so yes if I was a
attacker it would be a very high-value
target if you ever noticed when the air
force attacks anything the first thing
they take out is the enemy radar system
right this is a very similar kind of
scenario so there's a whole different
group actually that's going into we to
keep this problem tractable we actually
early on had some of those arguments
that said no let's make that a separate
wrap around around the top it doesn't
actually affect what you know whether
use demand or block to tell an IP it's
gonna change our wording let's make that
a separate group that is doing that but
yes it is it is a worry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
