distributed framework for producer and
consumer that guarantees the message
delivery in conceptually here producer
is just something that is capable of
journey events or is the sender that
sends a message and that consumer is
just something that's a target of the
message or it's a receiver or your
message so it's really conceptually it's
just a sender and could be the receiver
and attack test we have been using such
framework heavily and they we found it
it's very useful in terms of boost your
productivity and reduce the new service
long time so if you have any
applications that can be obstructed or
model that you didn't producer-consumer
diagram you may find this system is
really works for you here the layout of
my presentation so first of all are you
I walk you through the problem or a
sealed we are trying to tackle with then
we'll go into the detail of how we
implement such a system that guarantees
the message delivery when we'll talk
about details of each components then by
the end I will give you a demo an
application I saw to that using such
system so give you an idea how I set up
the system and start using here they're
very classic producer-consumer diagram
from here you can see that we have a
consumer and the producer the normally
reside in the same host or server so
they communicate via some shared status
such as they can do short memory or some
pipe right and also can controlled by
some music so the capable can somehow
control them each other and to consume a
message that you need from producer and
this all can done locally so reliability
is already know
a big concern here the relationship can
be kind of abstract like 85 oculi
first-in first-out q between them so
producer is simply put something in the
queue and the consumer pick it up so but
such a diagram is since they are kind of
scoped by the location basically the
inside some same host or server so this
unit is really very limited and for us
is really we want to something it's
distributed we want to that user the
producer and the consumer can be
anywhere in the network right so but
such a freedom of the location come with
Greek costs imagine that you consume a
link might be broken so what happened to
the message then right so someone had to
kill that even the network is very good
but what if we introduce a bug somehow
in the new code and go out well
processing event a crashed man with the
message how can i get the back again
after i fix the back right and it's also
possible that if the only of processing
logic you need somehow let's see send a
message to a downstream server right or
do HTTP POST what if that bounced back
with 400 or 500 error so here you can
see that reliability or how do we
guarantee this message delivery is
really a big challenge here and the
solution actually really simple what if
we just send some feedback to the
producer say hey can you bleed just
recently the message xyd right it sounds
very simple but it's really easy to see
really hard to implement imagine in such
a case that we have really big fat pipe
between producer and the consumer
so even before the producer receive the
acknowledgement of feedback somehow from
the consumer right email earliest and
the hundred or thousand messages already
so imagine you how to somehow buffer or
store such kind of message for future
potentially probably only one percent of
point one percent of the transmission
right but that's a huge burden on your
design of your producer about this think
about if you need to implement or
developer ten different kind of
producers you don't want to waste your
time see duplicate the see similar very
similar retransmission logic into all
your producers that's a great waste of
your talent on time so ideally we want
to design the network we wanted to
network handle it so the network should
be something that smart enough it can
deal with this kind of retransmission or
guarantee the message every so it frees
our developers up to folks on that
application logic so this is really the
goal of this talk we want to make sure
the network handles the message delivery
and the guarantee the retransmission
even if my consumer somehow crushed I
wanted a message send me back some time
later so this is a goal so while
designing our system we basically
following some guidelines so we wanted a
producer and the consumer be simple
enough but not simpler and certainly
there should be no location limitations
that consumer and producer can be
anywhere they can be at the same host or
doesn't or an additive different host so
it shouldn't really matter and there
should be no limitations on the number
of the same producer or number same
consumers so you can have one producer
or 10 consumers it shouldn't matter and
the system should be self prevailing
this means if tomorrow you come up
another idea a I won't put another kind
of producer consumer services in to this
system it should just work you don't
need to ask anybody say oh I'm going to
provide you something can you do that
tomorrow right so our idea is we design
a certain adducing schema let your new
producer and consumer will just work as
long as you follow that kind of rule and
certainly last one is we want to use
some of the show technologies we don't
want to redo this whole thing start from
scratch so here is a very high level
overview of the system we built so from
the graph you can see we have 3 q's
mainly sleek use the first q is the
message queue that is operated by the
producer and the consumer mainly so
produces simply to enqueue to the
message queue and receiver do a DQ here
I call a very special DQ because we have
to be handsome change on there and a
second QE delete IQ so anything that
consumer pulled out from the metric you
it will put into the luigi IQ for future
delivery in case somehow consumer cannot
complete that message is successfully so
then you get a chance to eat right so we
have a little tight schedule that
actually consume this anything in the
lower IQ and the figure out a future
time that should be rich right so for
each event you can attach some time out
velocity at 10 seconds later I want this
event to be expired and you put into the
expert event queue that our new toy
distributor can look at the app see oh
this is expired event for message queue
one or two that should be lead elated to
the consumer so we use three kills and
the two big component one in the
literature camp
scheduler and loot Ida Jupiter that
guarantees your message you will somehow
magically reappear in the message queue
for the consumer so I will use the flow
what cuts through think about that way
think about the producer journey that
you end a and it simply put in the queue
so then consumer will pick it up use
this sdq technology and we will it was
at the same time that is atomic
operation so you you put something also
kill you put into an article immediately
so one operation you do to two things
then the nature scheduler will pick the
ops ii oh ok i'll schedule this for
later in 10 seconds later so think
everything's fine that consumer process
is successfully so it will send a
feedback back to the system see hey I'm
done so just canceled this event and
remove it out of system so then the
retail schedule would happily to cancel
the time I saw everything go so imagine
somehow consumer tied or failed to send
the feedback back so then the time i
will clicking and fired in 10 seconds
then the event will put into the expert
event queue right then the loo hids
jupiter will look at the events hijo
this is the full message queue here so
it will put into this metric you again
then consumer got the second chance to
figure out so that's the way it works so
too fast to facilitate the programming
of this producer and the consumer we
actually abstracted this all this
operation into a java script library and
alan liability so from producer and the
consumer point of view they are simply
to DQ and ink you for consumer the extra
step is and some feedback so the this
kind of framework or infrastructure or
technology we used is totally
transparent to them so this gives us
actually a flexibility so you can
we move the whole back end just keep an
interface at the same you don't need a
card application at all like this whole
thing will still work that's how we the
layered structure works very well here
and we build this whole system is
actually using this lady's technology
ready see the open source noriko library
so all this message queue actually we
map to the latest kill structure right
the luce and Richard scheduler and the
loot I distributor actually we use some
no dress code at this data magic but
this hosting is actually died on the
same server so we have already server
running that's a global release then we
hope OneNote component actually kind of
acting as a little type thing so they
work together become this system so the
question is why you wanna use load is
right so one thing we feel is notices
something is really stable and it's
running really really fast in handle
southern dollar cost per second with
other and they play campaign and most
importantly I think why is he supports
this atomic operation imagining the
graph here right we do special DQ we do
DQ and put the message into an Alec you
immediately so this is hell to be done
one at the atomic operation imagine you
you do it in two step right so you do DQ
then you do another incal to delete IQ
but your second operation might fail
right then you help miss the chance for
retry so this held to be atomic and
lotus in the technology actually we have
been using a lot so we kind of have high
confidence if a system we build a long
date and it should just work this
basically why we to lure this
the next thing I want to talk about is
how do we achieve this self prevailing
so no configuration change and no system
had two catches the server to drill a
start to load the configure or sink
right this whenever you have a new
service you follow the convention of the
addressing it will just work so for each
event whenever the consumer the producer
put into the queue we actually asked
them see you have to give me a service
name so this service name is a London
point that producer will put into the
queue and the consumer will knows I need
to consume from that so it kind of
become a bridge for consumer and the
producer right and the service name is
also used by the hids Jupiter because a
simple handle one kilroy in need which i
disturb you look at the service name and
figure out and this expand event in for
all right so this is another use why we
needed a service name so the second item
is a timer ID or the event ID from the
consumer point of view it's getting some
event right from his view it's an event
ID so when he sent the feedback back to
the system is using this event IDC hey
I'm completed or fail so the timer ID is
actually used by my by the loot I
scheduler from Lewis scheduler point of
view everything is a timer so when he
needed to cancel such event he's using
this time event to cancel these timers
so this kind of 22 concept to consumer
but it's the same thing prime idea even
ID in the system HM that's it so here
example we use basically each event we
have a prefix as a service right then
you specify your service name then colon
then the timer last project is some just
you your ID to identify your timer so
using such addressing scheme are
basically we allows any new services
can be added easily into this system but
you don't have to provisioning or ask
anyone to touch your network so next I
will work you slew of each other
components see what kind of operation
they do so you can start familiar with
the system and get deep idea of how this
thing works so first I will talk about
the producer the producer behavior is
really very simple so using the library
we give you so you simply do kill client
in queue so this triggers the event sent
to the mess with you immediately and if
the consumer is a it can pick it up and
the consummate another option is you can
actually deliver that event in the
future let's say you want to create a
timelessly I won't deliver this even 10
seconds later so in this case actually
the literature scheduler will get it and
they create a timer for it then after 10
seconds it will put into the queue for
the consumer so basically the producer
can do sent event immediately or you can
actually schedule some future events
that's the way you can do with the
system you do two operations you either
send a military or I can schedule
something or tomorrow I would do
something so that's the beauty next I
will talk about the consumer so here
consumer doing a special DQ it's using
the word is PR pop I'll push p means
something blocking so if the queue is
empty is a no event so the consumer is
to simply block there and wait for the
event this is useful because you don't
want to do the BD check that's wasting a
lot of energy so if there's any event in
a queue it was simple
it up and the push to an attic you by
the end right so this is one operation
so you get an event from the queue and
the push this event to an attic you in
one atomic operation so it's a very
special DQ once they get an event this
is the distributed system so we had to
check if the event is somehow consumed
by myself already right if it's yes then
it simply tell the system hole i would
like to complete it so just cancel any
future which i right remove it so
otherwise you then start your processing
logic that's their consumer logic so do
whatever you want once you finish you
always call complete to a system
acknowledge that you have done anyway
you will get a chai again in the future
you don't want to process this event
successfully ten times so to facilitate
the operation of the consumer we
actually define a two and cue consumer
behavior so it is simple to give you two
callback functions you implement any
function then handle event function so
any function basically allows you to set
up set and state that you might need in
your event handling and in the handle
event call you will get a tuple that is
the ID of the event you are going to use
to tell the system I'm complete so
please remove all you try and the
payload the base B is some opaque data
that producer send you so you know the
structural there so you have to agree
somehow you know to pass it carefully
and this is the main to function that a
consumer need to implement so all the
ladies connection and this thing up kind
of handling that young q consumer
already so from consumer point of view
hearing simple example like I basically
have a test the service consumer and
they implement the behavior or
and cue consumer and it provides two
functions one is a need another in the
handle event call so anything here I'd
simply put 0 in my initial state since
the really no need and in the handle
event call I simply log the lion see I
Lucille the deterrent then we will call
the Q Clancy complete this is the
service name and this ID so this is the
whole logic at the consumer side so you
simply implement two functions then
older heavy lifting DQ or check the
status is handled or not all handled
harnessing the loot I scheduler so
Richard scheduler actually is a very
important thing in this system because
it had to schedule all this event for
future we try and make things meaning
all comers so for which I scheduler I
simply work on this hiq so is simply to
a DQ a certainly it's a blocking call as
well the BR pop so it's blocking call if
they know you end otherwise it was
simply in a loop so I also done the
checks if this event actually being
handled by the consumer or not right
because consumer and Louie tight
schedule and they are two can totally
independent the process right the my
list to each other imagine one case is
consumer is really really fast so an
event put in the queue it will consume
immediately and the call complete but
the literature schedule might just
started to get from the queue right so
you don't want to schedule this event
again so that's the reason it held to
check this event has been handled or not
if we handle already it's simple
acknowledge otherwise it will also check
I don't want to wish that system for the
HR if something is really really bad
right so we put some maximum number wise
so if something really goes pear
then you reach a certain times this
event will flat out your system you
don't want to have one event is looping
forever so if we is not exceeding the
ledge high maximum number which I then
it will schedule a time for it the time
actually we implement user user that is
the sorted set so using this is sorta
said so the time of operation is its
eggs at a time a delete this time is
really log an operation so next is the
new toy distributor the lucha descriptor
is really a very simple kind of
operation here is simply TQ and expand
event then put this message into the
service name that English event to the
lights consumer Q so the reason is why
do we need this one right in CLE this
Luce scheduler can put this message
queue directly it's really no need you
add the steps and second component is
the very type descriptor but we feel
like this kind of more kind of cleaner
so we try distributor actually somehow
you can implement another condom
distribution logic if you need although
initially we single well it's really
simple based on the service name so if
you need to some complicated description
logic here then adding a little tired
distributor it makes a lot of sense but
we haven't they're kind of find such
usage in our system yet it just started
designing that way so we feel this could
be something expanded here that's
reading we separate out
so we have been using such system for
quite long it's more than one year
already and the thing so what works well
for us is we feel it really works well
in the self preventing singh so whenever
we have new service we it just works
well so using this addressing schema
well and you don't need worry about any
pavilion Singh orkin fixing so that's
really something works very well and
second thing is the system doesn't
degrade let's see if you have a service
is really really slow slow consumer or
this consumer has been stopped for two
days and you find out is all the tongue
of millions I messaging to the queue
pending for the consumer to pick it up
to the system doesn't degrade even you
have media messaging that queue it
really doesn't matter the only method is
it consume more memory so somehow you
need to alert the system see oh you have
to fix this consumer otherwise I'm going
to delete all your messages right so eat
up all the memories another thing we
found out is it's the system is reliable
and a happily handles billion or event
each day so it's a good one production
quality so what kind of lesson we have
learned one thing we found out is the
release early move is really really
expensive why we find out is we have no
le release right we have actually the
system doesn't scale if you have a
consumer stop for three days we found
out of the actual meeting though
messaging that consumer queue and our
facilities is we tend to early move
whenever the consumer told us oh I can
see one event so we do early move from
this message queue that's oh an
operation so then our system it become
like snail so we were debugging hey man
what's wrong with our system it just
doesn't work
each operation it takes seconds because
he'll remove his occupy or save you and
later we found out at all because oh the
one consumer degrade and it's calling
this complete we do the element so then
we can reshuffle our system so forbidden
use the elder moves or no more early
moon and a thing we learned is that
lettuce expire it's a good one right you
can set expire with a certain time stamp
then this key will be gone so initially
we think oh this is a look really good
one we can use this at the time oh so
our early release of this system is we
using notice expire to set a timer so it
works well well so when we have only
very small system have handed okies
expired the keys right but later on when
our system grows we have like meaning or
even to handle and the tunnel hi mother
then we found out man's in the world is
very students sometimes this event you
schedule 10 seconds later it just comes
out like two hours later what happened
so then we dig into the latest code and
delete this posting a little bit of a
fun huh man the Lotus is using the
randomly can a schema to pick certain
random keys to check if they are expert
or not then the if they expire then they
will delete them right this is random in
nature then the some unlucky guys will
never go to picked up so then we ditch
this expired schema so we start used
already sorted set and implement a
checking on that portion so that's the
way we do the timer the next I will go
through the setup of the system and give
an example of application that unity
system so just to walk through how the
flow looks like so I come up we
is a weather station kind of application
right we have a producer that basically
it's a weatherman he used some belly to
the mandatory tool so he has some pet
that called guang hawk that darling
that's it capable telling if spring here
by the shadow but it's also capable of
telling the world I lived with only two
stage on whether so it's sunny or not
all oohing or cloudy so this is really
interesting pet that can tell the
weather and the consumer basically it's
a it's a gen server code that consume
this report and post it to another
weather station those that's a simple
web server is a trap so the website is
simply hosting the only current weather
report and since this is a report from
groundhog so people really held high
interesting that so we got a big screen
in Time Square to show the results but
the weatherman really is he got is very
reliable delivery system he got so first
I wanted to do is we'll set up the okay
give you better so we will first thing
is we need to start already so I will
start notice first so first thing need
to start these studies then second thing
is to scan start this which I scheduler
on the luge high distributor still add a
note code so we will start the no timer
I called no timer so we got this true
component studied then we will start the
the website we have this is a simple
website I i implemented the user nodejs
we will need a browser here
so the browser is simply load it's a
nation-state the default is an estate
right and so next I will start the the
producer so this is a basically I call
Tammy no for LM producer that can be
posting something then we will start the
same thing because it's another because
we can start the consumer here basically
i will call joon-kyu consume one start
link
so this chance of a star called
basically it held its this is my service
name that's a word a sub stream and this
were the consumer basically the module
for callback holes so you start this
consumer so next thing we will use the
producer we will simply do Inc you hear
the type of yes thank you
so we will report doing tomorrow then we
go back to our browser a leaf flag date
so you guys want to guess how I do this
updating real time at the browser anyone
want to give a shot so it's really a
simple JavaScript chick I ask you this
browser to reload every two seconds so
II so then we will look for the cloudy
next so it got cloudy so and another
thing i want to show is we actually can
schedule a report later so we will we
will create use a timer so we will
create this time / let's see I don't
wanna you get way too long so we will do
10 second timer and by the we need
change this stitched whether a little
bit so we will go back to the sunny in
to say in 10 seconds actually this call
return this time ID in case you want to
cancel immediately then about 10 seconds
later we should see something changed so
this how you schedule the future event
so next I'm going to do something
failure case so let's see how the system
can become it so first thing is we want
to bring down this consumer see what
happens so we will do joon-kyu consumer
stop
so basically we'll kill this process so
consumed at all then we do another in
queue we do ink you looing so nothing
happened here then let's bring back this
consumer reports successfully so this
event is that so can t to be that the
next thing let's try is to bring down
this the downstream web server let's see
what happened so basically I will bring
down this web server and this guy
complain actually it could have load
this web page so then we go back to the
producer again let's see we want to
report solid state again so from the
consumer point of view as you can see
it's complaining the poster error
because it couldn't connect to the web
server then let's print optics no server
and the event actually is going to be
retired in probably 20 seconds of cell
40 seconds based on the number which is
already we try two times so we do the
exponential back-off I think Sonny
probably is not a good one because
initial state is running so let's try
something different
but it's got the word Aleppo sunny so
let's try let's stop this one and due to
loading state so consumer complaints
post the error then let's go back bring
up this website and reload this one is
coming back actually very fast so from
here you can see that consumers and
posted successful for this living event
so even the downstream is down but the
system guarantees that this event will
be there for you to give a second try or
cetera so by default we actually we try
five times and with the exponential
back-off we don't wanna loading this
system for uncibal which I too fast so
here's some links we have so the latest
link and no das is open source the
nature scheduler and the lucha
distributor is you can find and my
github repository and no timer service
to hear conclude my talk thank you yeah
the Lynch has scheduled right the next
slide so so the last estate is scheduled
is following basically the retail
scheduler can t see you end and you
check if not exceeding the maximum enjoy
it will set up time avoid that is go
into into a store just said I didn't
show up here is your setup time being
the sort be set to the score actually
the timing future seconds that you are
going to expire so then this retail
scheduler actually is looking up this
sort beset and figure out who is going
to expire in next second so this is
another kind of hidden work is I'm not I
didn't show up here yeah
that's really a very good one country we
don't have a good solution here
basically is set up slaves of God oldest
event so in case no these somehow smash
it down we got the chance to set up this
hosting at the slave very quickly that's
the current solution but I think the big
challenge or next step for me is how do
I do this thing in the Nerdist cluster
