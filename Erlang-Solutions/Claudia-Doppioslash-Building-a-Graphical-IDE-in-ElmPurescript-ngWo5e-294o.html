building a graphical ID in the Revue
script
I am clouded up to slash I'm a
functional programmer and a game
developer and I write on lambda cut
about functional programming I work for
path dating app GmbH where we build them
by the dialing solutions for in the
control in the automotive industry like
this sort of stuff like this matte
conveyor belt which is actually running
air lag running the beam and we also
make an Internet of Things embedded
board which is about to come out and you
can run any language the runs on the
beam on it including Al exists we got
Wi-Fi and out of stuff and it's bare
metal so maybe check it out so I'm going
to say why are you here my first guess
would be you need to get some front-end
code done and you the test JavaScript so
here is like that everyone you might
also be interested in asking like
languages or undecided between choosing
and more pure squid for your own project
so what you're getting here is not an
animal to script guide and also it's not
the latest and version but it's a work
in progress motive isn't working of this
but another thing about the choices we
made wasn't right or wrong and just
enough of them to know what's going on
and also let us begin supporting a
project from pure as the pure script so
about L I'm going to talk about version
0.1 0.6 name and from there P 16 to zero
point 17 they removed a bunch of stuff
they moved functionality programming
mail boxes Alice's signals and folk P so
if you see any of that and you're doing
out now you don't need to know about
that it's got so don't worry about it
so our project is a visual idea for a
PLC language which has got a nice cute
name a I see numbers blah very memorable
and Piercy stands for programmable logic
controller and sort of a parallel
universe parallel development of
software development so it's been some
function blocks so if you
see it on the on the left there is a
function block on the top there are
events on the bottom there are variables
and on the right you can see that there
is some of some screenshots on some
other ideas but we didn't want to do
just another idea we wanted to do
something more interesting and we were
inspired by the best Victor's talking
maybe on principle which I totally
recommend to everyone and wind it up
with pace so you see on the right the
red function blocks and imagine they're
connected in graphs we're not having
done that yet and on the left there are
these three of variables as they changed
in the last 60 seconds or so so you can
see literally see what the variables are
doing and our deployment is a bit
unusual so there is a PLC language which
we have a compiler for which compiles it
to beam files
this means files run on the beam on bare
metal on those embedded board to
dissolve and also kayo runs on them so
it can sense an information from the PC
programs to our ID so we can figure
things out for this project there were a
few requirements many needed to be very
cross-platform we need to support any PC
iOS and also the iPad pro the
performance didn't need to be amazing
just needed to be interactive so so 30
frames per second would be fine so what
we ended up doing is choosing web
technologies because why we write the
same thing three times or four times but
just use web technologies and that means
JavaScript CSS and SVG you know but
javascript let's not do that
just now so we have a bunch of choices
we are a functional programming shop so
we wanted to stick with functional
programming if possible so there was
Piazza script
CoffeeScript al and typescript and I
think you know what we went through what
we went through it so why do we choose L
and used to have functional reactive
programming and that was actually for us
the main reason why we wanted to use it
because we thought that was somewhat
similar to our lungs and we were also
interested in it so that's what we sold
it but that is gonna faster than we said
with also the great error messages in
fact they're so good everyone is
imitating them even after now and rust
is minute as well
and also some concepts used to be
something that well like mailboxes or
similar to work so that is one as well
so what is that it's a purely functional
strongly typed eager level with the
language they compile the JavaScript it
used to have functional reactive
programming and it's got an ask a like
syntax but without the strange squiggles
and it's also very small language and it
keeps very small because they tend to
remove stuff that not you so much and
now it's optimized for learning curve so
if you have functional programming
experience probably going to be able to
learn it in few weeks it's in Alaska but
it doesn't have five classes and
advanced types so compared to JavaScript
which was digital candidate the main
advantage is if an compiles it will work
at least 90 percent of the time I
confirm that is true almost runtime
exceptions that was a big win also it
can be very confident when the factoring
because what you can do is basically
change your code any way you see fit and
then mindlessly blow through any
compiler errors until they're over and
everything works and this works and it's
also very clean language much more
powerful than JavaScript it only does
many lines of code and you know the
thing with error messages which are
certainly better than undefined is not a
function about them
I think the main thing that makes them
great is that they are contextual they
don't tell you all there is a problem
with your code on the line 356 of this
strange file you don't even remember
writing but they show you what is going
on they show you the bit of code that's
got a problem and they also try to
suggest you ways to fix it if it's
possible and that is very good and you
achieve this goodness in error messages
because they made it a priority they
encourage people to send bad error
messages to agate wrapper and then they
went through them one by one and they
fix them and also it's because I've made
a very conscious choice about taxes and
complexity so it's more powerful Java
way more powerful than Java but it's
less the type system is as powerful as I
asked them and that helps when making
good error messages because there are
less moving this around so that is a
something that made good error messages
cause people as well and also compared
to JavaScript you know and actually make
sense I don't know if you've seen the
web talk but at some point in JavaScript
if you brought a ray 16 you will get 16
commas that doesn't make sense
and there were so Alstom cons compared
to JavaScript the JavaScript
interoperability is a bit inflexible
it's gotten more flexible
after 0.17 but is still a bit maybe
thought of work trapped a big javascript
library also a new language it will
still 0 index is delays so changes may
happen but all in all we thought it was
fine so a pretty structure is a bit
unusual so we have this beauty board an
embedded board that runs this bare metal
beam on and the PSD program result beans
and cowboy and the bullet library also
run on the beam so we have a server and
the WebSocket library and these two
doctor each other and they send through
WebSockets information to the browser
which is running the bullet client
library which communicates through one
port with our WebSocket library which
send information to the PC ID
and then I'll show you a demo so this
has been running since yesterday night
still running and you see the function
block you see the events firing is
everyone seeing this yeah right bigger
better after some knows you might not
see much of it at this rate that's okay
but that's why this so this is a PS
application which is a semaphore so you
can see here red yellow and green
yet another same color sorry I am sorry
about that
so didn't green already if you look at
winning red screaming okay red and green
so if you look at them you can see that
they never overlap and if you look at
the yellow down below she probably had
the functionality to Murgatroid matches
the name of the variables but use of
imagination and you can see that the
yellow never overlaps with a little bit
of both just make it a little bit
smaller so you can actually see all of
them so you can see how seeing your
variables how they change in time is
useful for the buggy so if you they're
overlapping in places they shouldn't
you're going to see it and that was it
so going on with the PLC ID structure as
I said we have the PLC device and we
have a bunch of components we have the
other library which is a WebSocket
library which is a component I know now
a component is a bad word
bear with me it wasn't a bad word yet at
the time and we have a decoder component
which decodes the JSON that comes in
from the WebSocket library and we have a
renderer component which renders it to
the browser and then the or interaction
is captured and it's encoded in messages
that go back to the PLC device so that's
how clicking on stuff you get me the
plots on the way back so these are four
components and these are components
because in zero
sixteen the architecture was called
startup so those are three startups four
of them and it wasn't as in 0.17 where
the architecture is the language you
could still do many things with it that
are not possible I mean they're big
stopper to do now list so the ways used
to work you would have an address which
brought you to a mailbox that you will
send actions to and when you sent an
action it will get to the update
function we also with the current state
of the model and then that would be
calculate the new state of the model and
then render it to the review function
and any browser inputs would send a no
direction through this and you go in a
loop forever and I was 0.16 startup and
this was lit up is made of four startup
the back row netted my mailboxes and
they are wide again in a file startup
which means we got method startups and
this virtually is a bit unusual and I
don't think it's really done anymore and
it was invented by a github user Fox
donut we adopted it because we wanted to
keep things separate we didn't actually
want one source of truth because I work
this way it's more like because it was
easy to expand give that new components
whenever we wanted so it was quite good
for us but it was not reported to 0.17
it might be impossible might be possible
not sure it's worth the trouble and so
this is why we're still on 0.16 this
works I guess well it still works
still still 0.16 solid and we used FRP
heavily and yeah bit awkward to change
it and also this project is a budget so
parting code would cost money that we
don't really want to get the client
paper and also we were a bit frustrated
with the lack of communication because
there weren't any deprecation warnings
that was a brief because version and
that was it and they was too late for us
to change direction so we're waiting for
em evolution to stabilize coming back
maybe in 1.0 is here it is and in a way
of making this we solve some production
problem but what we done working with
them in JavaScript and what will be done
with a
so one of them is how organized
subcomponents Europe is getting felled
big and also also includes a man
projects into an earlier gap so maybe
what I wanted to do is to have basil and
gaps each with their own front-end code
and just to be able to use that nicely
and then also store dependencies that
cannot be sent to one package because
you can't send JavaScript codes to other
packages and one of our libraries at got
JavaScript code so we have to deal with
that so again is subcomponents ended up
being pretty simple so we just have one
directory for each component and then we
just break the files up in action model
view and update and feature is the
wiring needed for this structure that I
show you and then everything is wise yet
again in another one Phi which I call up
to them and then we feed that to the
main data mixing angle and and projects
also turned out to be quite simple we
just have an Allen sub directory in the
ALM project and then we compile the
m-files proof and then we just add the
genius to your HTML file and that was it
and we made a rebar chick dragon for
this so it's pretty convenient about non
are packaged apps that is a bit more
awkward because we have to keep it in
your own repository and then so we fetch
it from our own repository and then we
store it in a subdirectory of the
earlier project not with young files and
then we move only the young files to a
subdirectory of the un-- project not on
the random stuff because then you would
risk messing up and stuff messing up the
unpackage manager and then include the
sub dealing a special jason and that's
it
so about rendering we had a bunch of
choices we could have made our own WebGL
2d rendering engine which would have
been really cool but we didn't and it
turned out as which he was a recent
option so we used it we could also have
used HTML but it would have been fairly
awkward so we ended up using SVG with as
much CSS and as we can possibly use
because animation in I'll need to keep a
lot of weight around and it's a bit
awkward while this is the role of CSS so
we just use it and for this having an
expert on
an expert on SVG and CSS really helps
because I really don't want to the bug
CSS if I can help it and what really
good thing about Elm I think is the
greatest impact for the young the HTML
and SVG is generating libraries even if
you never see now that makes sense you
see the target ECD attributes you see
the nested tags so it's I think it's
really well done and also it's based on
virtual Dom and they are quite dedicated
to make it as fast as possible so
concluding a bit about Al with few
coefficient measures and so it should be
aware if you want to use them with your
projects what Elm is good for which
basically means if your app is a good
fit for the ARM architecture then
everything will go swimmingly and great
and will be fine because if all the
choices are made for you and they are
good choices but if it doesn't then you
have to fight it for them might be a bit
of a problem also if you need to wrap
big JavaScript libraries it's a bit
awkward with the interrupt flows of eval
opportunity use d3 maybe them is not a
good fit also as still experimental so
you're going to have in myself big
changes or you might not but you should
expect rewrite some of your code with
each new version and really the problem
with that is the dam doesn't really have
a roadmap it's a bit more inspiration
base and exploration base so they don't
want to commit to having a road map
there are beta previews and there are
the unloved mailing lists which you
should follow if you want to keep up
with those changes especially that file
over the AIDS the philosophy they have a
roadmap so what next we skip 0.17 0.19
we publish get 0.19 before we come back
when L may be nearer to one with you and
so meanwhile with again of the language
for a spin and now there are a bunch
more options then which reason there is
Paco script very stable and there is
period there breeding like rabbits
more and more so yet again we have to
choose wisely or become them to just
recode everything in another language so
our first choice was you know L please
adopt me I won't mention one and
everything will be great we draw nice
but you know it made out of choices for
us so as a reaction for that the which
was pure scripts as a second language
which is a language which gives a lot of
power and then you deal with it if you
can cope with the types you can do
everything so what is period speak it is
a purely functional strongly typed it
will evaluate the language that comprise
the JavaScript what have you heard that
before but it's got advanced types like
type classes you can have functors
models applicatives
everything like oh it's got a skylight
syntax with all the squiggles possibly
more squiggles and it generates readable
JavaScript because it doesn't have a
runtime so if you can actually read the
code it generates and it makes sense
without you having to keep in mind how
the runtime works there is no runtime
also the community is very nice it's
quite small but it's very open they've
got an IRC channel as like channel Vita
channel a video online meetup they got
everything it's very very communicative
and so going on - philosophy differences
and makes all your choices for you it
wants to be simple above everything else
in what's the learning curve to be
really quick and they really manage to
do that especially now that getting rid
of FRP did give them that because when
people got to mailboxes and other cities
it was like what is this and now it's a
bit more of a plain learning curve but
in pure script you on the other hand it
tells you well you can have everything
you can have all the features you want
but it will take some time to learn them
in fact it could take quite a long time
to learn them but you don't have to
learn all of them to start with you just
only need a bunch and and gives you only
one program structure all your choices
are made for you and in pure scripts you
can do whatever you want pretty much you
can invent in structures
so why do we choose to abuse it after
all and makes a bunch of trade-offs
which they do pay off but they also have
consequences so I've been simpler types
make the learning curve much smoother
and make the errormsgs really great but
it also produces more boilerplate and
you have to repeat a bunch of stuff
because you can't abstract it away also
the components don't really compose but
it is a choice was still a choice so why
would you use Turkey doctrine for me was
about the pipe I actually come from like
closure and dynamic programming but I
got used to the types in element I
actually liked them so I thought I might
be ready now for some more advanced
types for more power and less simplicity
so if you get restless with the spoiler
plate you weren't actually a very good
position to figure out these higher
obstructions because you're going to use
them in an abstract the way the things
you've been beating and some of the
approaches to that are also generating
the code but I think the abstraction
based path to get rid of all that is
more fascinating for me release also
it's similar enough that I don't have to
write everything attaches enclosure
script I would've had to write
everything but you know you can set
apart an applications and pure script
and you still will make the same sort of
sense and it's more similarly syntax
wise as well also it benefits from you
know following a script from a distance
they look at the cost of in Oscar but
they don't just adopt it straight away
they which were a bit until people are
figured out a decent user experience and
then they implement it also the
community is very nice it small but the
communication really works so and also
there are a bunch of pros right pros
compared well the meaning which is
posted which is the search engine for
the code so you get all the live code
libraries or the Triscuit libraries
called
searchable such a mobile type and also
by keywords so you can find operators
type function that conforms to some type
everything and it tells you where they
are and gives you documentation
and it's really nice also I've got a
clear direction because it's basically
following Oscar so you supplement no one
they'll end up eventually and you can
work a lot with the red bull which is
maybe a surprise because usually city
type languages don't really work that
much with the rifle but since it doesn't
have a runtime you can build your
program from scratch in there Apple and
it will work and it also got a very
robust rifle so you can do that and if
you want to do that the biskits by
example book shows you how to do that
which is the official book also it's got
great tools the nipples are really nice
they got a lot of helper things
including type holes so you know maybe
at some point you don't know what the
type of something should be so you just
put a tight hole and the compiler will
tell you what the type will needs to be
what type in its be and also there is a
search so if the thing you're looking
for is a function it will give you all
the function that can fit a typo in the
libraries you have loaded so it actually
suggests you what you should put in
there which is really nice and also it's
got the cool obstructions and less
boilerplate but the main con is it's
next time to learn all this stuff but
the good thing is you don't have to do
it you know at the beginning you can
pace yourself so let me flip for you on
you my reflections about NPCs Alaska so
L is a simplest language it's very
focused on user experience it comes
before anything else and as a
consequence of that it only gives you
one way to do things and make sure your
choices for you and they also very
merciless merciless in removing any
storica baggage which keeps the language
small and keeps the learning code small
learning curve flat and so I think it's
a great entry language if you're curious
about strongly typed functional
programming because you can you know
write in a week without valve of working
web application single page web app but
a limit is it only targets
web browser so if you don't want to make
a single page web app then you're out of
luck so the next step on this ladder is
pure script which is I
a very sensible language they choose a
middle ground between extreme power and
extreme simplicity they still have good
user experience especially with tools
but they also worry a bit more about
power than others
and also a few cities legally one with
it so you don't have to learn about
laziness
I mean lateness is useful in many ways
but if you learn and you don't want to
worry about what laziness is doing to
the performance of your code so it's a
bit easier to read about it's also got
many backgrounds including Ireland so
you can generate Erlang from pure script
also C++ and JavaScript and then at the
extreme end of power is a scale which is
a research language so all the coolest
stuff for the new things come to occur
first then maybe a little bit unusable
generally but the other and they don't
worry about user experience so much and
even though lately they've been worrying
a bit more about tools so they stuck now
which is better than cobble cobble was
hell as you might have heard and they
also have a bit of a difficulty with
getting rid of historical baggage
because Oscar is pretty old and it's
hard to change things without breaking
everyone's code and also laziness up
complexity as I say it's very useful in
some cases but you pay for it all the
time in Oscar's you have to reason about
it and that is it my reflection is that
if you are curious about hire struction
well you don't will really want to take
the plunge and learn I don't know
Peacekeeper Oscar you can try them out
in elixir there are two different
libraries and probably more of them that
I don't know about one is argued at
algebraic data types and the other one
is witchcraft which is algebraic and
categorical obstructions so you should
check them out and see how they work for
you and also if I made you want to try
out pure script which will be very good
and you should be aware that at the
moment still keep revising bowel which
is JavaScript too which has no clue
whatsoever or what is going on with pure
scripts so it will get you the pendency
which may be unfit for your project is
pure script hazard
a new version so after a new version of
your sleeve there usually is a little
bit of chaos that you have to work
through but it's easily solvable you
just get your power file and tell it to
just give you a sensible dependencies
but instead of a crazy one this is
annoying but they're working on it
they're making a thing called PC package
which you can already use if you want
but it doesn't have all the libraries
yet I don't think so let's do a bit of a
frameworks overview dividing them by you
know those will work react in those that
doesn't and also by type complexity so
this is a pie complexity continuum and
on the easy end we have Flair and packs
boxes basically arm architecture and
then there are entries and then red
dragons which means three moments on the
other end with allergen so why would you
start with fly well it's a really nice
little framework to make interactive
graphs it's really nice and as
definitely recommend it as a start you
might not want to use it because you
don't care about interactive graphs you
don't want to do them and you also need
to understand applicatives functor
syntax which looks strange but it
actually makes sense you just have to
spend the time to figure it out
also why would you start with bark box
is actually basically dynamic stature
and for my particular use case is
already includes SVG which was good and
also you can use the interactive
reactive bugger if you want to which
gives you a little bit of a
time-traveling experience it's I think
it's probably the simplest pusat
framework which you can use to make our
single page web app but why would you
not use it in my case it was reactive
penances I mean I really don't want to
install the 3000 react dependencies
higher when it with fire but to show you
that the tax structure is based on the
architecture here they are side by side
PC model is now state and effects are
the effects types that are in pure
script but everything else is the same
in fact it's so similar I'm going to
test you I'm going to show you two code
two pieces of code one is M and
one is biscuit facts and you're going to
tell me which one is on and which one is
pure script right which one also
yep well done so moving on we got lenses
let's frame websites and I don't know
that much about lenses yet but if you
like lenses there is sunlight which is
written by field treatment which is
physics auto so there should be good it
wraps react and then there's optic UI
which is a pure crystal framework
pure pure script so last but not least
halogen why would you use allergen
if you use allergen you won't have to
install a 3000 ReactOS which i think is
a good thing it's also used in
production for a rather impressive app
made by the one data which is also
pencil so you can look at their code and
they have at least four or five people
working light which means is quite
polished now it's also has got but
basically the same DSL and us for making
HTML which is good for me and 1.0
arrived so it won't have probably won't
have to rewrite your code every time a
new version runs which is good and the
best thing about the baby is that types
get complicated and type errors can get
quite crazy so we won't but still it
works out generally and the energy
structure is still fairly similar to the
arm architecture the model is state the
action is broken in action requests
there is a component type and update is
evil which is a free moment but you
don't really have to worry about it and
view is render inputs need to be wired
in the main function which is pretty
much almost the same exam and effects
use the biskits affected some extra
stuff margin and I'll show you here the
HTML DSL which is almost the same well
and it's very nice and now I'll show I'm
going to show you one application in
allergens and that's just a button that
toggles ruling from on and off that's it
so you got a state which is boolean and
you got what would be the action which
is called query so you got a caucus
state which changes the state of the
and then you got our question like what
state is bullying on and then you have
the component definition so this is a
component similar to how you would make
a start-up a noun
you see you've got an initial state you
with a render you got an evil so render
is update and evil when there is view
and are evil is update so their student
pretty similar but you see the type of
it's probably more than half we use do
you know and then we got the render
function which you can see just as a
button and an action being treated by
the unclick and then it is the evil
function which has got another strange
type what you don't need to worry about
it it was basically a pattern match on
the action so you can toggle the state
or you can check this if it is whether
it is on and that is it that makes you a
button that's all goes on and off so
that's still pretty small small code and
fairly similar as well or you know so if
you want to get started with your script
there are a bunch of steps that I
suggest first one is to get it from NPM
or PS vm is good if the version manager
for pure script so you can get a
specific version and then you might
start reading the ability by example
book which is written by Phil Freeman
and you will walk you to learning to
script and if that grows a bit too fast
then you should probably get the oscar
book because they still so similar that
the things you learn do come off I mean
they are quite the same so the code book
is actually a bit ghost that I set so
you can get it and then you should
probably look to take a look at the
ticket competent library because it
shows you the same things in alman pure
script initial so you can see the things
that are made differently for example
like tapas are be different in pure
script they're not first class so you
have to call types and then you could
try out packs a flash should come out in
50 channel 3
now then say hi and also come to the
video Meetup and then maybe you should
try out damage and make an app and
profit so the conclusion is the script
is a powerful and sensible language
which has got a whole lot of
instructions possibly more than you want
they're all that you want and it will
take some time to learn but you know and
we similar enough so you have got an F
start if it done am before and also you
don't have to know everything to start
we didn't even have to know lenses you
don't have to know feminists you just
you can just start putting a small
enough facts and then everything will
make sense in time also it's not
obsessed with user experience on the
language side but these are experience
is difficult it's just not the main
thing so a nice comparison at the end
and works fine with our rank took it to
it even compiled a link and it so
compiles it works and still to the same
and anon boilerplate gets repetitive you
have to write the same thing quite a lot
and includes clips you don't really have
that but the types can get complicated
also you should never expect advance
type in our they probably won't never
put them and you should expect a longish
learning card occurs in pure script also
alma got a curse in text but without the
squiggles and interested you got a curse
in fact with all the squiggles in also
squiggly glory a lot of squiggles
everywhere i got used to it I thought
this is madness but the negatives to it
and there is really no roadmap in Al and
what to sit has got a road moment you
can look it up on the D top and I think
tell me the great nd language into you
know strictly side functional
programming and use it is a great second
step in your road to ask us if you saw
want it to be and maybe should us back
start with with that so this is all
except that you can win what if you're
interested in the budget along and by
the LC whatever you can win one of those
three boards that I mentioned at the
beginning
Internet of Things Wi-Fi bare metal
board so you should look at this website
and subscribe to them
list if you want that
great talk
we're going to have five minutes for
questions see some hands awesome for
those of you in hard-to-reach locations
I appreciate it if you could pass the
microphone down the rail
hi one controversial question you
complained a bit about the manufacturer
for right that Elm
makes your decisions for you but then
you used like on pure script library and
you still mimicked the manufacturer and
for the I'm kind of emphasizing that the
way they are sort of similar but they
are not the same but so are they are not
the same with me to go in depth and I
don't really have the time to do that
and that would probably have to go to
some types that are quite hairy and who
really really want to do that and the
second question would be what would be
your the pragmatic approach meaning if
you would have to build the project like
say two months what will be the tactical
choice if it is I think M is also good
if you have a lot of programmers say
they'll come in and out on the project
so if I had a bunch of programmers on
the project that needs to get started
now and the application is a good fit
for the ARM architecture you don't have
to fight against that then I would use L
if is that it it's not a good fit for
the ARM architecture then I would use
pure script and maybe try depending on
the kind of program s design the project
and whether they can spend some time on
it then you would need to choose whether
to vote with allergen or box because box
is singular and allergen is a bit more
complicated
yeah hi great dog what about the
interrupts of pure script we is
increasing jas libraries like the bullet
client you use right so just get into
silicon wrap any JavaScript library
actually it's a concept you can have
there is it's pretty easy the way it's
on the website I haven't done it much
but there is a wrapper for d3 I think
there is a wrapper for a lot of
different stuff and even of a bad patch
for react so you can evolve react
wrapped in a low-level wrapper so you
can definitely do that okay so you would
say it's better approach them import
well it depends because the point of
pots is to make sure you're walling off
your JavaScript is not making random
runtime exceptions for you so it makes
sense considering that choice but is
what you need is wrap a big javascript
library then that is a lot of work with
pause I think so if I had to grab a big
Java C library I would use peels it yeah
thanks
yes thank you how do you compare the
testing frameworks in these two
languages right and well just get a good
quick check and I think Alma's got quick
check a while as well I mean I don't
even leave you so much because you know
type Python your tests I don't know I
haven't needed to use them because it
generally works but quick check is
definitely thing to check out in pure
script
all right thank you for the talk you
said that you have been developing some
parts in pure script and what is the
experience like was there some pleasant
surprises or annoyances roadblocks in
porting and the first experience is
having to choose a framework because L
gives you the framework and till it
doesn't fit the rest it's being quite
pleasant overall there are some there is
a learning curve to the types to the
abstractions and that is fairly long and
I thought maybe that would be shorter
and I find it keeps going on so it maybe
you get to the level when you know
enough to go on with your program and
then there is still more and there is
more there is more they keep making more
in a scale and then it comes back to
your script so it never ends but you can
still do a lot of stuff without knowing
everything this will be the last
question so you have the slide where you
said that animations you know are
complicated what the modern
complicatedly you need to keep out of
state around there are some nice
libraries in our to do animations it's
just things that were using SVG didn't
really make that much sense for us to
use them because we as we Jesus Murphy
has got the same things and then you at
lesson code to keep up with okay but if
you had to choose either pure script or
Elm for any good animation any single
page web app for each one will we choose
well I haven't really looked at
animation in this code yet it can
certainly be done but I only know about
your animation libraries and they worked
they were fine so it's probably the same
problem anyway because you do have to
keep that state because it's pure and
you need to keep feeding the site around
give it up one more time or yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
