Kent I work in the School of Computing
and together with my colleague we kingly
we've been building a tool called per
set to to help you profile programs are
on multiple hardware programs written in
our lab okay this is part of a project
called released funded by the European
Union which is helping to develop a
Erlang platform for building scalable
multi-core systems scalable across
multiple nodes and so on we call this SD
Erlang as part of that what we're trying
to do is help users to make it easier to
move their programs from arm at a single
core world toward a massively multi-core
world we're building on the the tool
percept which comes as part of the
standard OTP distribution but what we've
done is add a number of features to that
to make multi-core profiling that much
more effective so what we'll see what
we're doing the talk is talk through the
details of what we've done in
transforming percept into per set to and
then we'll show you a particular example
of using percept two to two parallel
eyes an existing our link system okay
I'm very grateful in this to to working
with my colleague who kingly but also to
our other colleagues on the release
project ah that's the university is very
hairy twat and upsala iccf it's iccs in
athens in greece on Erlang solutions
ericsson particularly the OTP team at
ericsson and EDF energy so thanks to all
our colleagues and I hope you enjoy the
demonstration okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
