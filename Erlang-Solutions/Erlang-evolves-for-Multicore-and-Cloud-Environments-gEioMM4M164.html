at goat walls a couple of weeks ago but
some of the stuff here will be useful to
you maybe in a different setting and
different mindset that the ones that
were approached us because being at go
to always has an erlang developer or MLA
that's quite thing over here on the
left-hand side you have your this one
you'd have your average gather person go
to used to be called job which was
something with da with something with
the job and they don't understand these
are the things it's just butta so so the
typical conversation of the booth and
was how will you beat me you say well I
have this cool technology and i'll just
do inheritance no part and none of our
crushing key and then they left the
booth so that's how was to be this gavel
and very much but anyway so we went on
and then we have this fleshy phone
starboard and in adams on twitter I'll
do random peeps and beats as anybody
else and then I had my blog music
musings on a Nolan priest it's not but
I'm not right that often but every now I
get a fit something and then something
has to come out the reason why there's a
story about why I love Berlin there's a
reason why I don't trust a pinch mark
that I hadn't tricked myself so there's
something that you'll join nothing more
commonly yeah so today i'll talk about
Owen fundamentals and for those are
you're already familiar with them and
this will be a recap but it's also
something you can use if you into an
argument with people and they need to
understand what this weird thing is
doing then some of these will be feel
free to steal
these things but these are kind of key
points to help people appreciate what is
about and then even though wrong is a
fantastic thing there are challenges and
some of those challenges is something
we're trying to address with the
research and I will try and and walk
from some of these things and said that
and by the way whenever you have a
question please fire it off because
otherwise we will be far away from the
slides where you had the questions you
just interrupt me there I have a pause
button here and I can just switch that
on and now resume and I have two
warnings yeah first what the truth the
question is will I tell the truth when
I'm talking here this is more than I
think was more relevant when you talk to
Java people yes a little tell the truth
yeah the whole truth nope you can't
handle the whole truth basically if your
Java person and then will also help you
able to be this lead so that's all that
one then one and number two I really got
going in this this crowd this is not a
problem but I was just warning people up
front that well I love the language in
the technology so that might use some
serious love it anyway so long I might
hear one of the founders but also he
knows all these things and the realities
of softwood well my health hasn't
changed that much maybe it's just
becoming more intense that you need to
get your stuff out in a hurry you need
to make use of whatever computing
resources are there otherwise somebody
else will pay you under the market you
need to be able to scale when you're
having your success and then maintenance
you need to take the burden on
maintenance down and that's something
that faces any software company yeah so
what could be let us just imagine here
thinking out of the box for a second
what if you can beat your competition
about being three times as productive as
they are would be nice what if you just
magically got good scalar scale up on
the number of calls and number machines
you had available that would also be
quite nice what if the amount of code
you blew a head to write went from the
cheap I'll come to a small part well
that will also be upon us and all of
this equals money so and that's a good
thing because if you're making money
saving money you could probably beat
your petition the good news is the
futures here and if you just open well
I'm pitching to the fire but anyway so
and then we'll come down to and this is
one of the things where if you're having
issues making people understand what
rolling is about and why is it has its
uses go back to one we have viana yet
actually this is ripped from be honest
fantastic dr. thesis licencia Keith
licencia says yes I said it it's in 10
what we call the doctor anyway that is
by the way a good thesis normally when
people get to that elevated state of
having two together feces it's
unreadable but this one is I feel good
so you can actually read it and I said
that it offers us well beyond the source
stop unfortunately unfortunately I don't
have that on video so anyway it was
meant for the big to deal with artscape
concurrency soft real-time distributed
systems harlequin interaction very large
software systems complex functionality
continuous operations for many years
software maintenance on the fly high
quality and reliability and fault
tolerance now when you look at this list
you're gonna think this sounds familiar
this sounds like the kind of
requirements any odd person will come up
to you if you're sitting with software
development I need to have all this
covered the figures it sounds good if
you could get that package somewhere at
least something that would help you
address these things this is the thing
you have to remember when you talked
about earlier it was designed to solve
these things in a specific domain it was
telecom but as long as you have system
where you can take off a lot of these
points or none might be a good fit I'm
saying mine because I'm we can't push
that on
problem in the world but if you have a
lot of these things in your problem set
this is matt get good idea to pick up
early for it and then so and yes here's
the thing this is where the real killer
part about earning case in telecom if
you take the domain it was created for
all right speak block them let me check
give me a general general-purpose
programming language be C++ Java I'm
being kind there because if you took see
it would be a very small block in the
middle there but anyway the gap between
when you get from the language in the
middle and I've into solving all the
problems of the domain that's called you
have to write yourself and the bigger
the cap the more code you need to write
we all know how much it costs to make a
line of code is of obvious of you then
enters Erlang it's small Taylor so
what's telecon me that the game out here
is smaller that's more look at its
benefits it's right in your pocket in
some way it's easier to develop programs
in this domain because it has a better
fit and then it comes back to if you
have it a maid that looks like something
like this you might have a good chance
of making benefits of using on there and
then the sweet spot following this is
also grill disqualified gonna touch
don't want to deal with the gooey stuff
at the top we don't want to deal with
drivers yet the bottom because that's
just a dragon land no you want to be on
the middle of our coordination and
control so all the problem that has to
do with this kind of thing and in the
Intel accounting world speak this would
be the control plane of things then you
have a good fit with our because that's
what it's meant for that you you're so
playing this is where friends in the
telephone systems it whether the audio
is flowing that's more than written in
assembly I'll see this something we just
put away we control it set it up and
then it runs because there are other
time you
so in other word places where the night
has been used to this now you can start
seeing this is not telegram these are
different things that's messaging
messaging is just a lot of the different
things they're having to be scalable and
responsive and there's a lot of control
thing going on so we have made our own
go on mongoose I am of each ebony that
that's one thing that if you have web
service yours if you ever want to run
with a very robust web server take yours
I've seen people to drive hyphen light
code in job a inner line pad from my
coat in allen and it doesn't break yours
yours distal columns so by this nonsense
that it actually performs so that's a
really good server and then we've been
involved in solutions in paving switches
and soft switch is there as both vocally
payments which for the singapore market
that's actually a very tough place to
get in and do it so it was quite a feat
with elegant solve that problem and then
we are involved in openfoam link while
we're developing a switch in an open
flow switch in their line and having the
benefits of having language that's easy
to maintain and easy to update these
things because it's somebody same way
that's like solutions yes I meant
solutions yeah I am part of the car even
though i'm located in denmark I consider
myself to be at least I'm on the payroll
so I'm one of the guys contributing to
the read novels if there are any a'those
so and then there's distributed
databases i think probably most one you
were the most about is react but that's
also couchdb was also written in this
region early and then this collage such
a key released over that's not used that
much in mr. rabbit rabbit yeah thats a
messaging system
cube actually that's another one yes it
goes on its massive amount of places
where it's used and then again I'll put
in a word from our sponsors here that if
the dual fits you must select and this
is about again take mesh if you have a
problem and you have a tool that fits to
solve that problem why not use that tool
and if the problem is for most people
they don't know that many to he was
interesting with some those you can look
at the implementation of other languages
as well and compare them yeah you see
well how much more compacted how much
fewer lines of code it's taken exactly
the same wonderful when I worked for
motorola we have studied on on that i
initiated that panera yeah and theres
gotta say we had like it took 3rd 3rd of
the code to get the same functionality
has lots of things out yeah I mean grab
it in Cubase best versions of a you can
witness C++ directly yeah you can just
see the pain yeah right that it's really
amazing how much people little test I
give it to the job postings she showed
me a ping-pong program yeah a little bit
of pages it's ages yeah yeah multiple
dinero's in the three lines another yeah
it's done yes I do anyway the thing is
learn about more tools there's more
tools and rolling in the world so
technische is a good place to be and
learn about these alternative ways of
solving problems and again erling it's
not the right tool for everything so the
more tool to use on know about the
veteran form yarn you take a decision of
our technology for the next project I
think that's the overarching message and
the coons about tech mesh is about it's
not about one particular region it's
about solving problems in the smart way
there yeah then we come on to the more
technical bits there and these are the
bits where you can go and we want to
talk to people about what's why selling
a good idea and what does it do
different this is about sharing stuff if
you have a normal system you have memory
and you have processes now I've seen
this because I've seen the secret that
was Tommy Mottola they had
sit from with this one whatever process
to process excesses marry one of the
Portland dies yes it corrupts the memory
and the only same thing especially if
you're doing a mission critical system
would be yeah well you need to kill
everything so that's a core dump of
everything and you can restart in the
scene so you get boom all service is
gone yeah and that means the machine is
rebooting and the operator of the big
system you sold is then calling your
vice president in the middle of the
night screaming and yelling at him he
gets on the plane to Europe and yeah you
know yeah the story is not pretty now
the way Ellen does this is you have
memory but allocate memory for each
process so it's not shared memory the
only way this could be processes
communicate is by sending messages to
one another no shared memory so when p1
goes off and dies boom prop memory yeah
so what it'll be garbage collected at
some point and you p2 over here on the
right and just continue its married life
that's and then that's garbage
collection happening there on the press
of a box makes to me so then there's
dealing with these failures because one
thing is you could say wait wait a
minute you just crash me how can that be
of any use yeah well you need to be able
to then deal with those crushes in the
century wait and the way you do it with
process is annoying it's either you link
them together so that if one dies the
other process dies or you set up a
monitoring scheme and saying if one
process dies the other one will be
notified about that and then you use
that to say okay this process is time
what do I want to do about it normal you
use set up some sort of monetary on that
process oh if it dies I know what to do
and I'll repair the system that's the
way you deal with these things instead
of just you provide infinite amount of
processes running and if you did nothing
when they crashed this would be a real
doubt at least in my mind that you're
providing a system that has value you
need to be able to deal with
these hours in the same manner and the
way it's been done on top of the basic
principles is within neo 2p library you
have supervision trees where you have
the supervisor at the top and it can
have supervisors below and the edges
here the leaves of this tree is where
the processes so something dies down
here it's up to the supervisor just
above it and we can see deadly with this
one anyway so but it's up to the super
bowl is just a profit to take care of
that failure and then this in this way
you can sort of disabled to handle the
faintness and it also the nice thing
about this is your code is not cluttered
with all sorts of defensive madness to
avoid errors you crash and somebody
somewhere else in the system that's code
that takes care of that crash in the
same manner it's kind of similar what
they try to do with aspect-oriented
programming only this actually works so
anyway then there's something where you
can distribute over course this is one
of the things that I don't think it was
intentionally like that from the
beginning with early I think it's
something that have a cold butt over
machines all the machines there but over
course the model actually works as well
because then you'd have you know course
yet to course then there's a scheduler
on each of the course and there's a
number of processes running in each
these course under the rooms and then
Puma machines then you do the thing is
you up move it up a level and then you
have notes notice then in fact just a
java version and another job to do well
on virtual machine yeah look at that for
years virtual machines the only thing
that could be there was java things know
there's an island virtual machine so the
very time is gonna start on on this off
you get a note and whenever you connect
them together using distributed early
then they connect up and in fact these
are TCP connections there and they do it
fully meshed so fully connected so you
end up with something that looks like
this and you can imagine how it looks
when it grows even further so and that's
intelligence in that that you need to
have an organism then hey this is about
the avoiding to die and this is
something about whenever we have a large
system over time the customers will have
that insane idea that a need to enhance
the system in some way at new features
and when it came back to the good old
days of the seventies you've started out
with the glen rock and you learn all the
moves for that then came and made a
disruption a version upgrade and went
into disco you out a business all your
moves were gone you had to restart
totally you out a service for where our
long term e to get back into business
and after disco it turned into yeah pub
and you had to learn new moves again so
you are a business while you learn new
news but the weight of this inner line
and Einstein stay alive is that he had a
process that's running one worse in code
then we load new version of the code
into the vm it's ready and then you said
a code change signal to that process and
it will who start running in the next
version and that's quite useful because
then you're not taking your system down
just moving your running processes up to
the next version and that's how you do a
version operate and that's I think that
a cool name for its hot code operate I
think but that's actually a very good
feature and I can remember the first
time I
this by hand because if you do it with
the OTP language is so taken care of
when you do it by hand the first time
and you write the code yourself and you
have a running process and it's just
upgraded to a new version you feel like
whoa what was it that easy yeah well
it's still not super easy but it's
easier than any other thing I could
think up there so that's really
something if you haven't tried it
yourself go home and try and write a
little process and operate it to the
next version it's amazing really amazing
then despite all this goodness there's
still challenges in terms of making use
of early and I'll go through some of
these one of the things is would it
really scales will it really scale with
urban really scaling it written a
program and you throw and a machine with
many more calls in it or you have more
machines to the thing will it actually
scale well it's hard to say but
fortunately in the release EU project
with the EU project well there's a lot
of companies and universities involved
one of the apart from tech solutions
there's also ericsson and also the OTP
team is in on this one as well there but
this one pen shell is actually coming
out of thumb remember if it's Gothenburg
oh it's the Greek University one they
made a day to where you can put in your
application and then it will run through
a test suite and see what happens and
measure the performance as we had more
course or yet more machines so there you
are getting an answer and then it'll
help you then as a way of saying oh wait
a minute doesn't really scale then you
can start looking for the botanist it
was one thing this that Merlin has the
ability to distribute over course and
machines you still have to think about
it they're still bottlenecks in these
things so you still have to think about
an order get as much scalability of it
as possible and so that's one thing
that's one tool that helps out of that
then if you have many calls running
so many machines who actually have had
might have some questions when you're
looking at a system when it's absurd
process running compared to where when
the other processes running because they
can only do one process exit at the same
time on a call and then you might look
another poster who actually started this
guy because one a thing is you can open
up where you see all the light processes
but you might want to ask these
questions and this is where the percept
to preserve is a inspection tool made by
the ericsson and this degree to get
release is improving the functionality
here and here in this case you can see
when the different the green part here
is when a given function here is
actually running so you can use it to
inspect your system and see what goes on
as you you're trying out different
things with it that might be a very good
way to support a bottleneck in your
system and say wait a minute this
process is doing nothing for that period
of time oh it's because so this is a way
of learning about that then memory
allocation yeah previously and there was
a key point here yeah when you have this
is booty this is the multi colleges to
keep my tongue straight multi-core here
you have a non-virtuous running on the
same the machine but a different cause
you had one message allocator that's
what sir release 12 plus some years ago
but anyway you had one message educator
funny so you had a bottleneck in that
and then in greece 15 this is the
unrolling version right perfect 3016 is
just wonder you end up having a message
memory allocator first edge ullah so you
don't have a bottleneck so things are
running more their separate life on each
core meaning you get more out of having
more course instead of have a central
point of a bottleneck in the head the
memory allocator that's another game
release project between that then
upgrading plugs yeah so
as a shorty put more the code you're
running it's called the current code and
then you have the next code and this is
when you do the upgrades from one
version 21mm and what happens in the
learning system today whenever you load
code IE you put in some code here that's
the next thing you want to run with your
processes or shared us a plot which is
kind of a pain because you just taking
all the productivity our system nothing
happens while you're loading code on
neither of the machine their course
involved even if is the only loading
quote on one scheduler and you don't
have it done for the next jetrel yet it
still got some more while it's doing
that then what's going to happen in our
16 is that you have another course book
down here last code and then the ability
there you get but that is that when
you're loading code then you won't have
scheduled as blocking each ship it will
do the coat loading when it's needed by
that scheduler meaning if you're doing
coding on one scheduler yeah that's
block but the other ones are running and
they're still providing services in your
system there's you don't get these lots
of time with when nothing is happening
that is yes it's our 16 so it's just
around the corner you get this
functionality then as I said before when
you make system and the disputed
learning system and you connect them all
up you end up having this tremendously
nice-looking graphs showing that every
node is connected to every other node
and the thing is it's not that much of a
burden it works for many many machines
the problem is you get a lot of messages
for instance if if this power via dies
you'll tell everybody that he died that
doesn't necessarily mean that everybody
should be notified about that it might
be that he's running something that is
totally unrelated to what's going on on
the other nodes so the way did you can
note that and that's also in release is
they're trying to do these s groups
where you group the notes together so
inside and s crew the nodes are still
fully connected
but between the different s s groups you
can choose and makes how many you want
to connect together meaning that the
amount whenever a note goes down you
have control over saying wait a minute I
don't need to tell everybody that
downtown and then you can have a very
used to solve that not the computer is
with the multicast I today Terrell yeah
then systems can decide whether they
want you to subscribe to that
information about the sender in a
descendant that is one way of doing it
this is the intent of trying to take the
configuration action into learning and
saying this is how the way it's been
developers that it's something you could
try out as a library it's not being
forced into the language it's going to
be tried out as a library and see if
this way of organizing your district
will determine system makes sense and if
it does then of course they'll probably
somebody pushing for it to be be a part
of earning itself but that would be
other with mucha custom would be another
surgery we had thousands be in this
great problem even in connection
definite yeah because a lot of the stuff
popping noise you have normally you have
a system whether clearly discipline
systems are so busy just listening to
noise yeah especially start having
failures on it splits and things like
that and everything comes to a grinding
halt in that case but this is this is
this is not done yet this has been for
out and released so far and right now
they're working at sea I think it's open
in word they're working on that are
they're working on figuring out how to
do this and how to get an increment it's
a sign is there the thinking has been
done and now we need to see how it works
out with the library and how it's going
to affect people coding then if you have
a sufficiently big system you come into
the issue of many kingdom so you need to
probation machines again this is not no
different from any other program
actually it's provisional machines need
to deploy the airline application on it
you need to attach to the note that's
running the early implication and then
you need to dig out some metrics because
you need to know what's going on in your
system and the thing you'd normally dig
out we'll be seeing things like memory
use which cpu load the process here okay
of what's going on and this is well it's
doable and not many good tools are run
at the moment for this so this is why we
here at the Learning Solutions we're
doing tool called Sicily it means yeah
wait for it the official name is cloud
computing lace so you've got this nice
lace that can tie your things together
and when maybe more sophisticated its
cloud cuckoo-land from the Greek
chatterjee where is this town in the sky
where everything is just rosy and good
so that's because this is meant for
doing things with deployment in
computing and anyway after it and just
you see the outer the idea is that you
have a other web UI or command line
interface you fire off things you want
to get done at the end of the day you'll
have your system running over here in SF
is running on these notes and then you
will have a operation and maintenance
note that looks after these snows in
dog's ass or what's happening and then
it reports metrics out this way might be
with rabbitmq we haven't decided on that
and then you collect it off over here
and metrics manager and you can see
what's going on in your system so it
tries to automate all these things you
would like to see about a system as it
revolves and one of the things where
it's kind of nice ears it's just that
but here we're trying to be made an easy
to adapter for amazon so we can deploy
on amazon and then which one we're going
to one more least to know that the
framework we're doing works because then
you can deploy on base
any cloud provider or any physical
machine you might have around but we're
doing just enough to know that it works
and then when the people coming around
and say wait a minute I wanted for
William we're ok then we'll do VMware
and get it on there so yeah that's work
in progress and we actually kind of
looking forward to this one because this
will be a nice way of running systems
yeah office leave the arms of the simple
workflow good question the thing is this
is tailored or focused specifically at
Berlin systems because one of the key
point is that your system under one's
running over here affects the importance
of things about according to the size
but you would like to know about your
earning applications running here a nice
system and there you need something
tailored to do that and we are
constantly in fact we're constantly
looking to see how much of Amazon can we
reuse so we don't have to write
everything from scratch because a lot of
the stuff you're doing here in terms of
setting up machines and deployment
provisioning that's something you should
just get as much help as you can from
whatever cloud vendor you're trying to
interact with yeah same with
confirmation using the city of machines
and you can do mestre scattering we've
got watchin us you never publish your
mattress and feel that if there is the
UI so the thing is we want to get in and
be very very specific about this and get
extra things are one of the things we
have it it's not obvious from this
drawing is that we would like people
that they write their applications that
they write a little adapter so they can
get metrics about their system not just
the CPU and the memory use it but also
specific metrics about how that system
is doing there erling system is doing is
it's always the loop so i can provision
more nodes yeah if i need those yeah and
then one of the things and this is not
in the
the first question we're going to do is
that we would like to have this one when
it Misha's things on what's going on in
the system that it feeds back and you
say wait a minute now it's time to scale
so you can you can set up rules and now
I'll get the provision another machine
look at this one and it then attaches
one and then the end I'm having four
machines running over here doing your
system well that's down the road yeah
for you yeah but the thing is that's not
trivial so the first thing we're doing
we want to do the deployment here and
then we want to see what happens when
you have the metrics in place because
once you have the data coming in you
have you in a position where you can
take decisions about what you want to do
so it's it's ongoing work but that's
definitely in addition to to see if we
can do auto scaling up and down so what
are the back first funny thing because
you wanna see me cut these early yeah
from what I've read so far that you get
a multiple nodes alrighty and one can
never compete unit on an AWS yeah so
seen cooze unit you get out of safe I've
ya want to be the sensible policy that
you could have you couldn't need some
kind of way to jump to provision the
next yep so you need some kind of it
yeah yeah yeah and all of that is
something that that's acid it's very
difficult to come up with a generic
solution up front I think the important
part of our framework like this is you
provide the ability to do things and
then the people that are doing it come
up with their own rules now yeah because
then they know what what is important
here you know when do you need another
machine how would you decide that i
don't think i can come up and ask four
people up front oh you're going to need
seven machines when you get that one no
no clue so we have two more questions so
I broken systems you do that now
watch out the limits set in there so
they can right away yeah and we've got
thousands of systems provision that IV
ended a lot of good work in this holding
area they call it autonomic of good our
algorithms and things and processes
church with a wonderful day hold
mathematical approach yep trying to
solve that problem he's actually
difficult it is easy to get work in the
lab yeah one time something that's under
control when you get out in the water
even disgusting you real money yeah and
with Amazon is costing you real real
money here because they are a zero so
every day at building there so so you
can put your pushing Masters so I'm
traveling should we have set our alarms
on investors and have those alarms sugar
skating actions I also stated level so
that you can bring a park based on your
policy same person Cassidy I'm happy
initialize using Proclamation using the
template so then you have already get
new machines that make the best cocoa
running different to do step until you
push metrics of travel and feel move of
making decisions are going to scale up
we have scaled down and what to do as a
change so desperate things we're looking
at remember one of the face also here we
started out with you see to because we
had we were familiar with that but the
idea is to have something here what
people can basically write their own
adapter and then use it on whatever
cloud for better I don't want to force
people to use Amazon there might be
people out there not in willing to use
my body's Rackspace might want to use
wrecked eyes on might not want to do not
want to run it on their own machines 19
yeah so so the thing is get to provide
people with the opportunity to choose
what they want to do and get some of
these things out
thing to be a realistic the time we get
to the auto scaling is the time what we
have people actually using it for big
systems the minute we get that then the
requirements were that will become
obvious a people would be presumptuous
to think you can think that up now and
say this is how it's going to be I think
this will be based on really using using
it and saying this is the kind of
functionality we need to use and these
are the kind of algorithms we need to
pick up in order to do it in the right
way so but that's something we're
looking at and again by the way the guy
that invented this name is from Sicily
so now we come to something that's a bit
of a dark hole in the history of her
line that's parallel ism well I was
created for as i said earlier explicit
congruence fault tolerance and highly
concurrent system it was not intended
for our beast it has no direct support
for matrix multiplication ray tracing
and costs remain parallel province that
was just not on the plate when it was
created and I think when you look at
technology history taking the choices
that was done with her name was
brilliant because it solves a particular
set of problems where you will and then
forget about the rest I think that's the
most mature way of doing things and you
find it in very few other places that's
why I love them it's it's very dedicated
to this let's solve this one Portland
right there but still then get to these
modern days you want to do these funny
stuff things and they're so we have in
paraphrase that's another year project
we're looking at something where we like
to do intentional perilously yeah so
does any of you know it loose it no it's
a demand-driven data computation
language I had no clue what that was one
two three months ago we had one of them
is working on this project and yeah he's
going to full bed now so he's getting
really hairy he was hurried before he
had the beard though anyway but the
finger trying to drive here is to fight
the shortcomings in the Earl and bein
and the scheduler there and see if what
could we fix something there or we do
have to do something on the side and in
the at the moment you're trying to be at
this way of computing and understanding
of how it works done on the side and
then we're riding a scheduler for that
and then we'll start to see how can we
get things to to match up at variant and
variables in this pea this is where my
head starts hurting slightly just
slightly is the variables infinite
streams of values and then you're you
have done have tried it has any of you
try to Malaysia programming in Haskell
as you get these infinite things and
yeah it feels and obvious mathematically
it's fine but you hit a certain so yes I
saw an example of this kind of program
would be that you compute the running
average of your input is that you take
the first element of the input followed
by the sum of the next of them for the
next we put in is the best of this
infinite string of numbers and then you
have a n which is one followed by one n
plus 1 so that's one two three four five
an infinite stream of numbers and then
the running average is magically the sum
divided by N and that generates another
infinite stream of numbers and it just
comes out I find this to be black magic
but we have gone and he's very happy
with this kind of thing and I'm trying
to be as supportive as I can as his
manager but I don't get simply don't
gather they're all the details of it but
it's quite fun there and this will allow
us to take in and unleash all these
other things with parallel computations
so our audition at the moment is that as
we had early on that you have to control
play with early this is still we still
want to do that and then at the bottom
instead of having dry
for heartburn things like that we want
to have these power of things going on
so Ireland controls all of these
hardcore computations and then it's
spawned off and done at the bottom in a
driver or in some other way so that's
the idea to follow that model and see if
we can bring intentional explicit
concurrency together with this
intentional parallelism and this is very
much early days on this one but it's
funny and it's funny to be part of doing
that and anyway going forward and think
the key point here is that you should
consider Ellen when the problem fits and
I can say this now I think because my
chest was not in the room if you're
forced to do stuff on the Java Virtual
Machine davion if you can't do your
customer says you have to do it think
about using something like Scala and
knock if they all right similar things
to what aaron has in fact acha is a
total ripoff of OTP inner line so if you
have something that used to think that
it actually works because if your
customers forcing you to do something
well so much with the right tool not
necessarily darling but the right tool
then would I write mechanisms for it
there there I think that's there but all
in all all the cases figure it's the
best one when it comes to those camera
and then try to have more focus on the
right tool for the job but given that
you are here already I think you already
have that one but again technische would
be the place to go and learn more about
this I think he would be a good thing to
go there and then learn more tools for
it and I think that concludes my talk
questions
no questions initially we should first
applause and more questions you mention
yes always do AP great about someone
else but ok is trying to do that no I'm
saying within l and I turn to throw the
BB and that's because it works no
bitches yeah but at the end of the day
the thing is the first when you run into
other people and then you realize after
using it for a while I've used it
intensively for four years to Bolivia
system you're sitting there in the
beginning if you kind of can't do it at
the end of their you feel yes covers all
that I need I can't really say that I'm
fro oh to be out and do something else
it might be minor tweaks you won't want
to do we're not the vorlons may be fine
as long as you stay we will create
because instead of doing the recommended
thing this was the motorola project
instead of do the recommended thing and
that the audio processing which is
something that has real time
requirements and five milliseconds of
jitter and things like that we coded
that inner line as well you shouldn't do
that you should have a seat thing
running on that one yeah and that's the
only place we're rolling it as a smaller
line is OTP that had a performance
problem there but it actually works so
just call it superstition that match of
notes yes yeah when you connect that up
someone i think was but that's not sure
yeah but that's it yeah but that's not
all to pee that's a much distributed on
OTP is about writing your own
application running on the note Stacey
Bergeron is how you connect these
different systems on those together so
that's an issue that there's definitely
something where you can say all this
fully connected thing it has its
drawbacks and that's why we have the
work on this group trying to understand
if that's all all the ways of doing that
that's not a quorum yeah yeah yeah yeah
so there are drawbacks of the scalable
distributed erman there but that's not
fast enough it has nothing to do with
OTP and I think yeah you're here here
occasionally people complain about OTP
but in the only actually does the job we
needed to do and then I can't and I
think that's the reason why they're no
more the OTP lamp is out there because
it solves so many of your problems that
you can then even go into we get
yourself if you need to but people
rarely do that because it's not needed
so I think that's no again one has to
remember it was like how many years so
the first or JPEG thing was in 94 95 97
I don't know geesh yeah so it has had a
long maturing period so the kind of
features were added were really so it's
been out there in the field so I'm real
problems for 17 years so that's I think
that's a testament to how good the
library area Ramage's it is is highly
scalable cloud something like this
highly scalable channel solution so
there's a lot of interest might look
like that's got a lot of potential on
the system's I work work
thousands of nodes yeah what'swhat's for
common largest sizes you'll see for
individual early I mean yes this is N
squared problem ya see it was hundreds
of thousand no I can't a pic I have to
make solid oak assistant adjutant yeah
baseball yeah yeah yeah in that sense
they are very small and have to we have
both cause and machines internal unix
can't remember which is calls and
machines where you run into a problem
around from the students i think we had
a stealth company in the state they ran
into problems to run 35-40 machines and
then the wedding and tweet a few things
in the OS because i started analyzing
what was going on where will the buzzer
all the bottlenecks and then they got
off to linear scalability and they
tweaked a few things in the java another
on their BM as well and they ended up
having linear scalability to up about 60
machines that's yeah yeah so it's still
far short in some of the year yeah big
classes they haven't tested it on more
machines you know so but of course it
won't just continue up into the photos
intel of the vendors have given up and
given as fasting processes and we just
get more calls yeah I've really got
systems in my lab very thousand calls
for server that yeah and that's that's
going to be there are crazies going to
increase its and I think they delivered
with course at the moment in Vegas
around 30 did you get a whatever you do
you have run into is just wrong 30
course on the machine and that needs
tweaking as well is that that's an
Erlangen its own OS constraint and I
figure like VRS full support yeah and
then called yeah i think it's an early
in terms of the scheduler what goes on
that because that this is why as you saw
that they're trying to move out so
things becomes more the commode
distributor on the course like the
memory allocator yeah that one goes to
each scheduler so it runs on each call
instead of having a central point and
that other places where you need to fix
things in order to to unleash everything
but its ongoing work and they're working
on it all the time one of the things to
keep in mind though is the majority
machines that Iran is used for these
days don't have that many calls so as I
was very bad you can't actually buy
processes in detail now with less than
16 whatever calls jacket now and that
that yeah dozens of every every move all
fun yeah so and then they are aware of
in indio TPT but they keep the limit and
the amount of improvements that put it
into it they try to fit it with the
market what's out there of common
machines to run it on so that's why you
don't they don't wet invest about time
right now in doing a thousand core thing
there so they're trying to make sure
that they use their money wisely yeah
because our other features of each to be
attended people are in telling like that
may be interested in sponsoring some
other activity because I they are are
y'all trying to they prove everything
random intervals it's a guys they all I
wanted to do the perilous stuff yeah but
there's a range of paragraph styles so
yes they want to do a lot of the grid
snap that's a very dignity you surprised
yeah true but most of the stocks they
have people working on on the parallel
world and innocent and current world
yeah how I understand that but then
again people dealing with concurrency is
a very limited prompt which is sad
because a lot of problem actually needs
explicit concurrency to be solved even
when you get fast &amp;amp; Co machines you
still have coordination problems
so it gets worse yeah exponentially was
you know you have aproblem me that's
very hard to work out that you can
change the problems sometimes the
problems in the OS and sometimes the
problems in the other infrastructure a
very frequently the property of the
machines itself but as you get more
current currency the solar system are
talking about proper very awful as urban
cash because you can have lots of
processes doing memory access yeah you
can get some cash in consistency very
very yeah they it a non-trivial program
to optimize these things yeah and it's
even more market with work out if you
have a system where is the problem is
it's not easy but I'm hopeful that it it
will be easier to solve the other
certainly if you write something you see
with a lot of interest communicating
this sort of it it's an open a tonight
I've got them that's a massive night but
that's just pee and if it works today
actually work tomorrow no robots can be
different that could be a butterfly
waving its wings in total then yeah
doomed so more questions and remember we
have beers afterwards so questions
doesn't stop they'll keep throwing but
yeah the slides be available to people
like me who are very very late yes even
for those that are out there very early
I don't know how we make them available
I'll talk to
make sure that they available and please
remember multi-core which is the code
word for getting a ticket to Atlanta
tonight yeah that's your discount code
and you should just say hellooo you long
live all right never be out to get them
