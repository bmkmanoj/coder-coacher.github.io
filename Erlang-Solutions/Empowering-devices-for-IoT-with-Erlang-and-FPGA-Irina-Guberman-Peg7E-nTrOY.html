coming to my presentation I'm Irina
gruberman I'm an a-line developer since
2010 and I come into airline from object
oriented world and that was a huge
breakthrough for me when I found Joe's
book on early and I became an evangelist
ever since so and now I work at a I am
an IT start-up of leptin I'm a principal
product architect and I'm really
allowing what I do in this presentation
we are going to talk about Internet of
Things and then you're going to talk
about how we adapt to have a very
different take at what you think device
communication should look like now
you're going to take it a step further
to the edge and talk about various
device use cases and the specific use
case will be a looking at is wireless
sensor networks then we are going to
show why we think that with the
widespread adoption of IOT we believe
that RPGs are going to become
increasingly important
now you're going to cover of FPGA and
VHDL basics and go over some level of
detail on how we deploy airline
applications on a CGA board and then
most importantly is the big idea of this
talk is how we upgrade a few G's at
scale so because this is such a fun idea
in such an awesome idea I decided last
night to put a little game on my
presentation it's a very simple game
just a four-piece puzzle hope you don't
find it very stupid just for the
children in the audience up
so it's very very simple it's just if
you as we go along if you see a puzzle
piece just remember what the flight was
about so I hope you pay attention and we
don't fail because it's a four-piece
puzzle if you fail it's the same so IOT
Internet of Things let's ask ourselves
questions how do things communicate
today they devices obviously they
communicate with them all the edge
technologies like Wi-Fi Bluetooth we can
think about Big D you cannot accelerate
but ultimately they communicate over big
old internet and what is internet ever
so and if you think about it a little
harder it's a math so first of all
internet was designed for people not for
things it's inherently insecure Internet
traffic is completely anonymous
if I need a security is built up in the
internet it's on the influence internet
itself what it's not no idea what flow
is what's flowing through then Internet
is optimized for download like consider
for instance content providers the
majority of Internet traffic is flowing
from the servers into the user browsers
very little traffic on the other way so
we all know well the network latency is
a very non-deterministic it's a fact so
is I don't know how many hops your
request will go through how many
problems or bottlenecks it will
encounter on the way so that's another
problem when it comes to devices and
then a tiny little tiny little point
which is more towards internet
revolution it's largely financed by
online ads and just imagine how that
model works on half of the Internet is
taken out by a device traffic
so we have to recognize that internal
doesn't quite fit the role of devices
communication highway and we had a much
better idea we came up with our own
network it was designed for things so
that to not record it has built-in
security there is no anonymous traffic
everything that flows through there
everything is flow through this network
is pre-registered authenticated devices
and it's optimized for any kind of
communication configuration so it can be
one-to-one when you to a magnet to one
one to many and everything everything
that ended up flowing through the snack
is considered an unco and whether it's a
device sitting in the field or a phone
app hosted in the cloud everything is an
endpoint and every endpoint can send
messages to and from as many other many
other endpoints so it has to be snot
work in and out we tested all these
configurations we tested with hundreds
thousands of a simulated endpoints and
millions of messages works great but at
this point for us it's time to take it a
step further to the edge and start
exploring real devices we all use cases
and see how there will be a of
interacting with our network so that's
actually really fun time for us because
we again we get to play with real
devices and our very first experiment
and our very first project is a specific
case of from oh sorry I mentor to say
well one more thing that we since them I
have to go back a little
since our network is real our own
network infrastructure they actually can
ensure optimal network routing and we
have control over traffic because we
know whether we actually know what kind
of devices they aren't worth what kind
of client devices and how many we have
so
so now are we going to take next steps
exploring real devices and you have to
understand so we have to understand what
what real devices we'll be doing with so
there are different types of devices
there are devices that are stationary
and mobile like these two guys and then
there are devices with very low power
consumption requirement and then their
devices don't have that some devices
will be sending a message once a second
and some devices will be sending
messages once a day
some are critical and some are not not
so does there's plenty for us to
experiment in our next our next
experiment is with wireless sensor
networks so example the wireless sensor
networks will be soil soil moisture
sensors how were in the field that the
farmers good information farmers could
use air pollution sensors that city
dwellers could use an instructional
house monitoring both rural areas and
city I could use so what is a sensor
network it's a bunch of very cheap
sensors that can send information to
nearby Gateway node that's the that node
is a bit more expensive and powerful it
sounds information order to the world to
the cloud was called the cloud or the
internet or whatever you want to call it
so let's take a closer look at the
wireless sensor network and I kind of
realized that I just looked at Brian so
for everyone who went to Brian's talk
it's time to get back to earth and look
at real Earth technologies it's Earth
everything is much slower we have
gravity here so like I know this stuff
is actually not maybe not as crazy
doesn't look as great like some crazy
technologies that we just saw but this
is very important for our soul anyway
very simple stuff they have the sensor
nodes
what they do is they collect the sensor
information and accept some signals to
the Gateway know it now
some signals at a specific frequency
let's say a 100 megahertz and the
Gateway is confuse a gateway receives a
signal and it it has a frequency band
filter that's said to only receive this
frequency okay so let's say we are the
company that owns the gateways and let's
say we have 500 of them so we are in
charge of the gateways and we have them
sitting in the field and they are just
only Twitter
receive this signals at 100 megahertz
but let's say the company that is
responsible for sprinkling the sensors
in the in the field the sensors either
got old or they got a better
we got upgraded or FCC regulation
changed and let's say they had to
replace these filters with new one
really cool new filter really cool new
sensors and these sensors happened to be
now sending signals at 200 megahertz
now here the company I'm Sonya we have
become with the company who own the
gateways are pretty screwed because if
you have like 500 of them are thousands
of them suddenly perfect gateways we
don't have to replace them or we have to
maybe physically go out there and change
the frequency band filter to now filter
out everything bytes but 200 megahertz
that's pretty bad but you know modern
will have solutions for these kind of
things it's called a software-defined
radio you actually don't have to
physically change the gateway you could
upgrade software-defined radio that's a
lot of radio tasks can be implemented in
the software instead of hardware so
frequency band filter doesn't have to be
in the hardware it can be implemented in
the software
the problem with also the soft was the
software-defined radio we don't have to
replace the Gateway we could just
upgrade them remotely the problem with
this littell frequency band filter
running in the software is that with
great flexibility
comes great consumption of power and
that that is a very power look that's
actually a very intensive task so what
do we do now there is a solution with
modern technology so also it's called
field programmable gate arrays the best
of both worlds so hardware folk call
them software because they are
programmable and so forth or call them
Hardware because they're implementing
the hardware so if you are a software
engineer who's looking at they are SPG a
board spats and hardware manufacturer
website you'll be pretty confused so the
best term to use in reference to 50 G's
is gate work so we're gonna now we're
going to dive into what if TJ's are a
little bit so we're going to compare
them to like a typical logic gate let's
look at this truth table if there is two
input to stable so what we want is if
both inputs are one output one otherwise
zero does anyone know what kind of gate
of that great job it's an M key this is
how is it Wireless with transistors now
I want to change the truth table I just
want to go with if if one of the inputs
is one I want to output one otherwise
zero so what do I do now what would be
what gate is does X for now I need to
rewire my whole circuit so let's take a
look at the truth table one more time
what if there was a magic circuit that
knew how to store the output and react
who are the inputs and the magic circuit
like that does exist it's called
configurable logic block or clb what it
is is the for static Ram bits if we're
four hours to input keys so for a static
Ram bit it's called lookup table and it
contains the desired output and it's
attached to our multiplexer
just a quick reminder multiplexer sorry
the bits that are the output are called
figuration with or configuration memory
and just a quick reminder what
multiplexing is a data selector so it's
basically like in software terms it
would be like an array where you could
select an RS a specific element that's a
specific array index so if so access has
0 input 0 will be going out if selector
has one it in put on one is going out
and so on just a reminder for those who
those hasn't looked at the hardware
stuff in a while so let's look at a
bigger example a three input Co B so now
it's a three inputs here we are going to
end up with 2 ^ 3 possible outputs so
this is our truth table and if the
inputs are 0 1 1 the multiple action
will keep selecting the value at index 0
1 1 from will lookup table so 0 will be
output if the value is 1 0 1 evaluate
index 1 0 1 will be selected and now the
output will be 1 so one thing to
remember we talked we're going to be
talking on upgrading and tg8
if you're going to have our lookup table
information sitting in a static Ram bit
it will be safely there while the board
is powered up but if we need to reboot
the determines information will be lost
so just a thing to remember for you
we'll be talking about in one detail we
will need to store this information
somewhere in the non-volatile memory
space so and then when the word boot up
it would be copying some tool that knows
how to do it will be copying from
non-volatile memory space like a from a
flash drive into the static Ram so
another oh oh sorry no it's time for a
lookup table pop quiz so how many of us
around this we need to create a lookup
with nine inputs great job
now how many logic gates is that just to
remind that one assume this is equal to
one flip-flop and one flip-flop needs to
nor gates so that would be a sorry
how much okay anyway good job now things
are looking pretty nasty
maybe somebody thinks oh no I don't know
I don't want to deal with all of PJ's
looks like the gates are expecting
increasing exponentially the truth of
the matter is we are not going to be on
you're not going to be a odd they're not
going to be doing with nine input of
PGA's in our specific case you only want
an eye on input a CGA we're going to
break it up into three three input
look-up tables and also one more for the
three output to join us so how many how
many action bits now
so we have four tables each one has 3
inputs 2 ^ 3 times 4 32 that looks way
better than 1024 so in practice FPGA
they are not going to be used that I'm
going to have sold so many input they'll
be broken down until maybe 3 input to
output
I've read that the best way or the best
configuration - 3 inputs to outputs I'm
going that I won't go into that science
but so FPGAs are consisted they are they
can be seen as an array of Co beef
connected through programmable
interconnect and here is a very nice
picture that's how fragment of the F of
T J hooks and I stole this picture and
this information from a very nice
presentation and SPG's from a professor
a dr. Konstantinos status so here's the
link if you want to dive a little deeper
into a few G's it's a pretty good place
to start one more thing I stole from him
is a bit of a slide about configuration
bitstreams configuration bitstreams are
that was going to be sitting in the file
that we'll be using to upgrade FPGA
so it's equivalent to our executable
binary in software again from the same
presentation so this would be basically
for every field V will have the woke up
table plus the on/off switch and for
every for every switch box I believe I'm
right about that is just these are just
an off which is for the inputs
so I rewrite it to program with PGA's
now hold your horses SPCA's are not as
simple as you've seen this was just a
very very basic introduction realistic
they'll be from Xilinx which is pretty
much hard features like the biggest FPGA
manufacturer and almost a monopoly it's
going to look this is just a one CLB
that's how it looks if you try man if
you try programming these things with
bitstreams
it's insane so to keep our sanity and to
actually get anything done we're going
to use hardware description languages
that's what people that's what hardware
people program Asics and logic circuits
and FPGA is with so there is two like
most popular hardware description
languages are VHDL and very long I
prefer VHDL for various reasons you
might want to read up on the difference
will be in VHDL so hardware description
languages are very different comparing
to software languages a very different
paradigm they are describing a very
different underlying system what they're
describing a system that's inherently
concurrent so if you think about just
imagine up a bunch of in a bunch of i/o
pins everything happens simultaneously
those pins don't have input and output
sequentially so if one of the pins
changes the whole the whole thing
changes oh you have to reevaluate the
whole everything in the circuit every
all the output so this hardware systems
are inherently concurrent while software
software languages they describe
instructions for a processor that
process of instructions sequentially
that's why concurrency in software
languages is so hard
concurrency in a hardware description
languages is actually inherent it's
natural
the only so a lot of people actually say
that is they all look the same to them
like look very similar to software
languages but that's only because how we
write instructions we write them
sequentially how else that's why they
look the same to us but they're very
different that's actually the hard part
so we're going to look at a VHDL example
full adder so actually we will see how
it will be very similar looking to a
software language first we import the
library something we are very familiar
with then we declare an entity full
adder at this point we don't we just
care about inputs and outputs we don't
care about anything else it's similar to
Java interface or function Declaration
and see you and but then the most
important this is the actually defining
the architecture so we have a couple of
local variables which are declared at
the top and then we have four statements
so the first here we actually assign the
local variables and then we assigned the
outputs that depend on these local
variables okay so that's so far looks
very sequential like to me but look at
this if I change this circuit at all if
I like shuffle this like all these four
lines anywhere I want so now I have look
I sign local variables at the bottom I
just shuffle that random way it's not a
problem
it still works exactly the same and
local variables get assigned immediately
so that that it doesn't matter when you
put it in there in your block so that so
if you like to dig deeper and arrange
the other is a free online resource it's
a good start but at this point we are
going to be done with the education and
theory and basics and we are actually
going to jump back into reality to make
things a reality the truth of the matter
is it's always it's not always but very
often it starts with shopping so
me shopping on Xilinx website for FPGA
board it was quite a saga I'm not going
to go into it but I will be happy to
share my experience after this
presentation but one thing I can tell
you as a software as a software person I
was way happier than this woman when I
finally place the order so what did we
buy we got ourselves since we are
interested remember we are interested in
programming LCR software-defined radio
we got ourselves a board that has an
RFID a transceiver that's connected to
the programmable logic that's what we
need and then the range of frequencies
that that's our hardware will be limited
to is from 700 megahertz to 6 gigahertz
so if you remember our example I wanted
to go from 100 mags megahertz to 200
megahertz so we are well within hardware
limits here and then last but not least
is the processor so we have zinc 70 20
processor it consists of dual core ARM
Cortex
in iron and it has all the bells and
whistles a 102 caches number of Antibes
memory I own a mule floating-point units
just your very good critical processor
and programmable logic so at this point
will be somebody might be asking you are
we going to run airline an FPGA so the
answer is we are not going to run
airline an FPGA for this particular for
this particular for this particular
problem you're trying to solve we will
be running airline on this board but not
an FPGA we are going to be running air
lying on the processor and we don't need
to we don't actually need to for this
particular problem we don't need to
rewire the processor with it just got
our processor that's hardwired and
there is no point to implement
processing with the logic gates because
you'll be wasting them there are others
there's other options like there much
software processes that FPGA boards come
with but for this particular situation
we are more in
the radial part being controlled with
SPG being configured with a CG
so now why do we need to run airline
what they're going to write what we have
developed back to our my company is
often what we have developed is a
generic Dobson client which is another
summer is narrowing it's not it's not a
necessarily on server but it's
technically on a finite state machine
what it can do it can receive control
messages from the cloud and it also can
send messages to the cloud it's very
basic now what is so what we want to do
is to be able to operate FPGAs with it
so now we'll make a DJ flavor adaption
client so we'll send it feed streams
remotely and then it will know how to
upgrade of TG the cool thing is we have
found out unveilings
website that there is a way to upgrade
of PJ's remotely and I know like it's
not a problem in space but on earth it's
a big deal for a long time as TJ's were
just you know the prototyping tool and
they were just you have to upgrade it
you actually have to have it connected
to your computer
it was very it's a big fact that they
can now be upgraded remotely such a big
deal but there is a way so you can sign
a partitioned remotely on to the fpga
board and partition is anything you want
to upgrade software or FPGA which is
between you'll be sending machines or a
data file and it's a kind of involved
process
upgrading FPGA you need to copy
partition to the cue SPI flash memory
and then the some tool will know how to
copy it from the platter non-volatile
memory until there in our particular
case we care about configuration memory
not these other places in memory because
we only care about upgrading FPGA we
actually don't care about software why
we don't care about upgrading software
for this pretty cumbersome expensive
process why they don't care about
upgrading software and our board with
this process that silence came up with
because they're running airline an
airline has this unique capability of
hard code loading so now we don't have
to upgrade the software
it was it's I think it's too cumbersome
and it's very difficult to do well it's
okay for a PGA's but the software part
we can just do it the easy way with
airline cut code loading so we have this
we have we have this bit upgrade of
SPG's can be upgraded remotely and then
this is just a bit of a detail about our
FPGA flavored captain client if control
messages bitstream with the checksum we
just copy it to flash memory of for
death to do that you actually need to be
able to do that you need a tool called
you boot you'll get back to it a little
later then if control messages upgrade
we're actually going to be running the
tool that knows how to copies from QSB I
into configuration memory the other
thing out that the already mentioned
software upgrades can be done much more
efficiently with just a link hot code
loading so that will be part of the
power of PG flavors Apple client and it
can it can also receive messages from
sensors but themselves chances would
have to be smart also so that's sort of
gray area right now to have something
smart be able to send the erlang
messages will have to do a little more
work it will talk about it closer to the
end
so now a little bit of detail on how we
would install Airlines and our own
airline application on and all these
dialing stool and everything we need on
the FPGA board so the first answer of
course is like the primary instinct
almost a Linux and if the PG boards take
the one that we bought it comes with
pre-installed um Linux it's called
pulsar a version 8 from a company called
Wind River
it's an Intel company and it comes with
a lot of things already pre-installed so
it comes with you boot which you really
need for upgrading FPGA and also for
persisting those upgrades between
reboots then we need we need various
dialing few tools then we need the
device free binary for our Zink 720
board and so that's what this that's
what this existing Linux build comes
with but a dozen columns is they are
lying and the optin client so what we're
going to do is we're going to make our
own with a bit baked and they pick is a
dope system for embedded systems it's
supported by open source projects you
have to open the merit and windriver
open source labs it has it's kind of
it's just a layer on top of open and
valid but it has all these Eiling stuff
baked in so big cake is actually very
easy it's just like baking a layered
cake I'll basically you'll be adding
layers to the PB layers that come file
enough if it's super easy stuff
wink wink have you baked a layered cake
by the way when I say it's easy give it
a try
so the layers we are interested in our
pulsar atrocities so I had to rebuild
the whole image because
I didn't know there's actually a way to
not with building image you can actually
bake recipes on top of pre-built images
so I rebuild the whole thing I'm sort of
big baked newbie I'm actually a baking
you do as well but it's baked especially
so Paul sorry eight recipes I rebuild
the whole thing it was actually it was
actually pretty easy except for I had to
I wait I just had to wait for three
hours and a very powerful 24 core
machine and it was done it also took up
40 gigabyte of disk space on the no idea
why so that's clinics for you so that's
one layer the next player was matter
airway so matter airline is just a bunch
of bitbake recipes that will build a
very tiny six megabytes of beam and
there is this is the this is the repo
and then the last layer is septum client
recipes it's going to be coming through
soon available open force not yet so
that's it that you have now we are ready
to make our image and there we go next
step would be copy this image to a micro
SD insert micro SD in the carrier card
of our board and then put the board and
there you go we have we have build the
board with airline and also our septum
clients starting on booth so now we can
next thing we can do is ship our port to
this take them to the field take our
actual FPGA with the Sony take our
gateway to the field and from now on we
don't have to ever touch them again we
can just manage them remotely so how are
you going to manage them remotely now we
know boards are the gateways are
manageable remotely but how are we going
to do that we have specialized up to
clinical the PGA Managers for instance
and what it does it can it can be
running so if in some apps like
somewhere in the cloud maybe it's on
FPGA developer this decay
maybe it's a just a standalone
management app it's really not up to us
how that's going to be done but the key
is it's capable of grading thousands of
gait players as long as they are running
that FPGA players often client is soba
form so what is this FPGA manager it's
what it can do is it can upgrade away
can reset it can upgrade them remotely
and secured by security by sending
messages to any number of gateways close
up to network and let's say this is a
message we need to send let's say we
have like a sensor network in the
Chicago Airport or O'Hare Airport it's
going to have a bunch of wake up the
pollution sensor gateways so we're going
to send the payload our upgrades of our
bit streams that we came up with to
change the frequency bands over we're
going to just send to the ipv6 address
of that or or the pollution gateway or
if we want to upgrade multiple gateways
with the bitstream we can sell it to a
bunch of gateways subscribe to would say
as a folk of pollution central topic
which also has an IP and the Optimax we
will take this up to network will take
care of distributing this bit streams to
all of the other IPS that are subscribed
to this topic we actually are not going
to go into the details of that but if it
can do that so this all sounds pretty
trivial but you know this is a pre I
think it's a pretty neat idea we can
actually upgrade thousands of cj's on a
remote way so we can maybe say it's
revolutionary I know it's difficult to
say this after all the space talk but
if any every genius idea is simple right
anyway our next steps is actually I
didn't really like the Linux approach I
think it's too heavy for an embedded
system so our next steps will be
exploring actually kind of continuing
this project with is optimize and
minimize the software is the actual
kernel on our board so what I want to
explore is using Li on zan and it was
just too risky for the timelines I had
so I didn't go into that but I'm really
really looking forward to that part then
we actually have to get our FPGA design
done unfortunately at this today I
cannot show you the the actual FPGA that
we came up with but it will happen it's
a time travel couple of months forward
and you'll have will have it all open
source to the gray actual FPGA design
and everything it will actually
implement the frequency band filter
adjustment with FPGA and then we are
going to test these files so we came up
with a pretty cool project which will
you just have a Raspberry Pi which is
capable of sending our signals at
different frequencies I forgot the range
but it falls within the range of our
board I was actually hoping to do this
or during this presentation and some
people told me that the crazy ambition
for the timelines okay and but we will
if anybody got interested in this
project we will have it all posted we
will be posting this to our github
account and you'll be able to follow and
so and that's actually been that's a
link to the Raspberry Pi to that page
where we found how we can send two
signals of different frequencies with
Raspberry Pi
ok now it's time for assembling our
four-piece puzzle does anyone remember
what the four pieces work
right so first please the gods after
Network second second piece we are
trying to assemble the part the pieces
of the puzzle we were supposed to pay
attention for all the now we need to put
the pieces together sorry
how do our greater Fiji's that's the
upma yeah that's the second piece add
two two more pieces anyone great
the other one was actually the you know
they deserve to client that knows how to
send Sandhya bitstream through the
network and then the next pieces oh
don't worry I was paying attention phone
I got you covered
no problem the last piece it was
somewhere at the beginning so it's
really not your fault
I had it all like distributed on a very
uneven manner if we had any
three-year-old in the audience we will
have this problem but we are adult
thank you
so there are of course teeth is actual
so the most important view it's at the
element client sitting on the FPGA board
oh thanks for missing that so here we go
we got the four pieces by the hair our
King on our Kim I don't know and it's a
PJ board management orchestration
so I'd like to say how huge thanks to
the absent team for helping me and
inspiring this presentation and also
letting you do it during work hours so
questions oh the one we got is that we
paid $900 for it but we haven't gotten
the care area and I'm not like I said it
it's a saga if you want I can I'll be
happy to share the details it's a it's a
lot of talk yeah
Wi-Fi is just a specific frequency so
there are cheaper boards to it could
actually get cheaper boards and their
CGA we got is pretty powerful the guy
who I was working with with the support
guy he said we were going to get a
really expensive one at first and he
said you don't want to really need such
expensive boards because there are a
number of TJ's coming with these boards
like the same it's more like the other
gadgets that it comes with that are more
powerful so you don't have to spend that
much money to start playing with it oh
oh oh actually this is a very very very
good question and it's part of this the
whole purchasing fpga saga so when
you're purchasing it on as I links a
website you will not realize that but
Xilinx has a very powerful software
development and hardware development kit
called Rivaldo so certain boards are
included in this you don't need a
license to be able to generate
bitstreams and certain boards that are
high-grade actually need a license and
it's the license cost three thousand
dollars so you have to be careful not to
buy the board that doesn't fall into the
free license range and I was like that
the guy told me
a bunch of boards they actually say on
the side that it's included but then
there is a bunch of those boards that
are coming with zinc with their arm
processor they won't have proper detail
about you know I'm not sure I was
looking for it it's kind of hard quite
frankly I would not recommend it they
have because because if you have the
money to buy their very expensive boards
you probably have the money to buy
$3,000 - school but if you're just
starting to mess with them just get
yourself a board and it's enough okay if
you find if you find the way to good if
you find a way to do that I would like
to learn from you I would like to learn
from you because I know that this I was
for now I would just go was there a bit
was the Vedado because that's included
and I can trust it and I have a lot of
the day actually comes with a lot of
designs like a lot of example designs
with it so for starters I wouldn't try
to do lots of something else
definitely except where I would probably
know even without doing that that
they're not going to be as efficient so
if it was a spaceship maybe I wouldn't
go with to jeez those you wanted to be
upgradeable then maybe I would the thing
is that the trade-off there is always a
trade-off so I would say Asics are
probably always going to be 50 G's but
maybe it's a power of 10
I actually reading about this the
trade-off is really sorted how often is
just uh it's just ten times there's
gonna just be sometimes more
time-consuming it's not a lot like maybe
so folks will probably like a hundred to
a thousand times more DJ's is like 10
times less efficient than a six in
general but in general and I agree that
if we are doing this we will have to
measure maybe you could make it even
better than ten times better than ten
ten times worse thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
