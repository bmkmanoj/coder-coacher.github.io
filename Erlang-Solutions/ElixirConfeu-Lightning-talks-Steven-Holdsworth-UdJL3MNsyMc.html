presentation on visualizing the lecture
processes in 3d first of all I'm Steven
holzwarth if you ever seen me on Twitter
I'm the dog with the mustache so first
of all credits the airline library which
wires up to Ruby graph which displays
the visualization was written by
Christian crab through and EB graph can
be found it you buddy lad droplet so
first of all what I had to do is add the
reference to the project simple another
think we've all seen that quite a bit
then I created a couple of functions
which we're going to spin up n number of
processes just to give us something to
look at here the first function will
spin up a link to process and the second
function will spin up a process it's not
linked so let's see what this will look
like so I'm going to link to an I
accession and in the Miller tab I'm
going to so you download the EP graph
software I just have an alias so it's
got somewhere there so I'm just coming
up with the shortcut BB has it been
doing this a lot and it's really fun
so in my I accession first thing we need
to do is set up the tracer so Earl EB
tradesmen and every time a process is
created or exists it'll send a message
to the graphing software which will
display a nude so if i run at nine this
is what elixir looks like and we can dig
in this is just bare bones elixir you
get to see all the processes of what's
going on so the blue circle so the blue
spheres are named processes the red are
the omnium processes and the green
squares if i can find one are the ports
so let's start creating a ridiculous
amount of processes
so first of all i'm going to start
unlinked processes it's the 4000 and if
I block the UI thread it's kind of cool
and toggle little and you can see them
come up and disappear so it's that again
I'll get there quicker like particle
physics isn't it ok and then ll create
an oil disappear I don't make it a
little faster but I could look at this
all day and there's many other
applications for the software as well
this is just showing processes and the
edges or the lines between the spheres
shows the links between the processes
which we'll see in a second but that
could be converted to show messages
being passed between processes as well I
really don't stop this I only get two
thousand but well anyway it doesn't
matter we can create some more Caroline
right this is my and let's create some
link processes so where they've been
created i'll be over at like search
let's two three yes how do i get in
there fast
probably have to do it again
and Chris is saying once the wired up to
the oculus so there's something to
disappear but we need to get back home
taking a leak gingras oh no the back too
much yeah well I'm going to just kill
this right and then I'm not it again for
the link process and that'll be me so to
wear my running this thing started again
this is wobbly anybody had the light put
up here I've got good empathy for you
not this one and there's it crashing
okay so I'm just like it so clear Oh
turned up very quickly cuz schoolwork so
I image this needs and pops it Phoebe
graph probably be
ten thousand one up so there we go and
there we go so you can see the links all
back it it's not me thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
