quick background to what my background
but also how the airline vm timeline
looks like so our link is quite an old
piece of technology it was it started
out in 1987 I was six years old at the
time I didn't know a thing about her
active programming lang programming I
didn't have a clue about quite a bit of
stuff i think i will ask the same
question the question was why not i was
asked the same question to my mother as
soon as I'm back home now eric has been
released as open source some years later
and this is why we all can enjoy this
piece of technology nowadays I was about
to start my computer science degree here
at the University of sub agh university
and by the time I graduated airline vm
got the SMP support so it went
multi-core now despite that I have like
10 or more years of airline development
behind me the lessons from erlanger line
vm that i want to share with you today I
believe apply to many different
technologies so if you are not sold on
airline don't worry I'm not going to
pitch Erlang to you I want to share with
you some lessons learned from the
airline systems that we have been
building over the years which I believe
can be important for any big system no
matter in what technology you're going
to build it because what I think is that
conferences like this one quite often
focus on how to improve our development
testing how shall we use static types
dynamic types what are the benefits
and we keep on discussing different
things we argue that certain languages
are better than the other and this is
all good this is about improving our
efficiency of programming this is good
but we need to look at it in some
context time context how much time that
system an IT system leaves is spent on
the development of the system versus
maintenance of the system there are
systems that have been running for 20
years even though I've been double in
development for a few years so if you
think about the whole design process and
development process and then maintenance
process now you get a big picture of
what is it that we are trying to do we
are building software which will run for
a year for five years for 20 years so
airline vm of course is about the
development phase how do you design and
test and program but equally if not more
important part of the airline vm and the
airline gecko system is about
maintenance phase how do you maintain
the system and don't don't go insane ok
so i will now try to share some ideas
why certain properties might be of
interest so those happen to be the
properties of the airline vm because
those are lessons from Erlang but i'm
quite sure that a lot of those
properties are assured across different
technologies so i will try to well share
my thinking about why certain processes
are needed and hopefully you can get
something out from it there will be some
takeaway from this presentation which
applies to your technology to what you
are doing so behaviors design patterns
of course this is well known subject
there is
there's nothing new here client-server
canyon state machine airlink has also
application and release design pattern
as part of its so called OTP what it
means what is it for it means that we
have consistent maintenance procedures
you build one artifact and you will
deploy it always the same way no matter
who built the system when was the system
built where it is supposed to be
deployed one way of releasing airline
software something that docker is trying
to help with boxing the system making
sure that this actually is easy to well
 so in Erlang terms we have their
language appear elise which you can put
into a tarball you can see here listing
from one of my airline tutorials
workshops that you can find on my github
at the end of this workshop you get to
the point where we build a release which
is packed into a terrible and then this
turbo is a self-contained airlink system
so how do we deploy airlock will copy
tarble we unpack and we run being
something that's it at a self-contained
it has the airline go runtime system
inside all the libraries applications
and everything so this design pattern
which is not built on top of airline go
TP it is part of airline go TP it is it
is there because there is a very good
reason to have it this makes ensures
that every team member will ship
software the same way if you had a big
organization tens of people working on
different small things the deployment
procedures will be consistent this is
good for maintenance systems will be
well maintained by many people over the
years
okay another property here robustness
robustness with supervision concept that
probably some of you have heard already
there was some there were some
presentations about their line
supervision trees already the idea of
focusing on the correct case rather than
trying to mitigate all the risks and
have defensive programming style so we
we are accept that things will crash no
matter how good programmer you are and I
bet you are the best programmers in the
world you will have some bugs that will
sneak into the system not because you
have designed them in the wrong way
because users will misuse your systems
because systems are always built
correctly those are the users who misuse
our systems so let it crash it's not
about oh I had this bug it's about the
user has used your system in the way you
would never think that it can be used
now so what for exactly for this reason
we need to be resilient to misuse of our
systems so ere long has the concept of a
supervision tree hopefully some of you
are already familiar with it we have one
processes observing other processes in
the system one the observing one is a
supervisor the one doing the job which
is being observed as a worker you can
have like trees of those so have many
workers and supervisors and so on this
really helps encapsulate issues problems
catch them deal with them locally and
move on another interesting property
it's 2015 how many systems that you have
to design are not distributed systems I
don't know
but probably quite a few of you have to
build already distributed systems it's
the Internet it's the Internet of Things
systems are distributed now better
lunkheads is aware of network of the
distribution layer so distributed
airline is how we call it is something
that powers the internal communication
what for it's not only for building
distributed system but it's also quite
useful for accessing your node remotely
so have a cloud and you have a react
cluster 20 nodes how do you maintain
this cluster you want to have some
observing tools of course gather some
metrics but sometimes you may want to
connect to those nodes and well observe
something inside inspect a node so
Erlang distribution provides you a
feature which if you have two airline
nodes as in airline visual machine
instances and they are connected
together they see each other right so
you have nodes cut and flee and if you
have two islands of nodes like here that
island consisting of dog and bird the
moment you actually connect one of the
left-hand side of one of the right hand
side nodes dragon here he will
immediately get the full mesh the
airline distributed layer is aware of
other nodes it will gossip about other
nodes and you will get a fully connected
mesh and you can start sending messages
from cut 2 better than for fleet dog now
your network consists of all the nodes
being able to connect to a remote node
and to execute some code on it helps not
only with spawning a shell and doing
something it actually helps build some
interesting interesting tools which help
us maintain airline systems I believe
some of you are familiar with the UNIX
top tool which looks something like this
right you have the OS level processes
they view the top tool reports CPU
memory consumption other things similar
tools can be quite easily built for
airline you're connecting to a remote
node for a long distribution layer and
you draw a similar work picture with
airline processes in it and you also
report hip size reductions since last
call other things so think about someone
who is not really an airline programmer
on daily basis but he has to maintain an
air lock system what is a typical way of
inspecting some misbehaving well linux
system running in your cloud well you
connect to it typically the first thing
you do is you type top to see what's
going on which process in the OS is
consuming gram or consuming CPU and the
same here one of the erlang know this is
behaving maybe something you want to see
what is causing it you connect to the
node and you see there is a guy who's
quite busy or he has allocated huge heap
it's not necessarily recommended to run
this in the system which has million of
airline processes it's a different story
but still I'm just trying to share some
thoughts here that the ability to
observe to inspect your system
is extremely important because once it
goes live you need to have tools means
to find out what is going on inside and
borrowing concept ideas tools from the
UNIX or Linux environment is a good idea
people are maintaining linux boxes for
ages i would like to frankly have a
similar set of tools for airlink VMS
which would allow me to do pretty much
the same inspection as I can with some
Linux tools all right some more
properties hot code loading which well
as if you read about hot coloring people
say that this enables non-stop
operations and it's it's true at the
same time it's quite complex to leverage
hot cold loading feature on a live
system because it requires you to be
very very careful about what is it that
you upgrade it whether your other
amnesia schema has changed or not so hot
coal loading for life systems well yes
but use it with caution what I would say
it's it's the shorter development cycle
which you can immediately benefit from
so what is your typical development
cycle so you have a user story you need
to implement so you have this story you
start to develop some tests and then
they in well help you structure your
implementation and then you want to test
it at some point so compile and test it
and imagine that setting up your system
in order to test a module takes 10
seconds or maybe half a minute because
it has to start some databases load
something into memory it takes time to
test a function which has been just
recombine
with hot code loading after compiling
the module and loading it into target
system system under test there's no need
to reload the whole system it's enough
to either log just a module and you
immediately get feedback is it what I
just compiled working does it do what it
has to do this does shorter the
development cycle meaning it takes less
time to do the iterations of developed
test developed compiled test it does
help and non-stop operations is there
yes however it's quite tricky business
and then tracing airline vm has tracing
built into the Erlang vm into the
machine so of course there are DTrace
system tab or other tools available for
linux kernel user space that you can use
and you can do very interesting tracing
but here this does work even on windows
this does work even on Raspberry Pi the
tracing is built into the vm this is
quite important because again helps you
understand what is going on it helps you
quickly quicker I believe narrow down
the issue the problem the flow of data
for your system and again it's running
within the Erlang vm so all platforms of
the airline vm supports get dynamic
tracing in it
it helps for light debugging if you're
already maintaining a system in
production it helps you understand well
which function calls are being really
cold with what data both arguments what
do they return and there's no need to
instrument the code up front so how many
times did you have to put this one more
print out in your source code just to
better understand which branch of your
code the system is actually executing
how many times I believe many times so
airline vm means no dupa debugging this
is the term for you know da da da da
pai-1 dupa to the battery yes it does
yes it does how it works really I
borrowed this slide from matts thank you
much you can enable/disable tracing on a
live system and it really doesn't cost
you much to have this tracing on or off
as long as it does not trigger in other
words when we turn on tracing is on the
right hand side we just had this extra
jump instead of instruction which let us
go for some tracing pattern so we do
some pattern matching and if these
triggers at racing event then we
generate the tracing event if it doesn't
we just continue with the other
instruction so that this is not ok it
does have some overhead of course but
it's not a disaster
and then you can have quite a few
interesting tools built on top of the
Erlang tracer for example airline
performance tools the e / repository
where you it's called read back one of
those tools that is part of a / where
you provide this dis pattern this
intention what is it that you want to
trace you want to trace function calls
to the module lists function sick we
have some two arguments and then return
what is it that the function returned
again and then when the function is
actually called this is line number two
in my listing you not only get the
result of calling the function go out
that's normal but you also get to see
this extra printouts as you can see
below which is the process ID executing
the code followed by the tracing event
so what is it that has been called okay
another interesting to build on top of
airline tracer aflame which is some
flavor of of another tool called flame
with flame graphs maybe some of your
familiar with flame graphs they do
probing of stack traces to understand
which functions the system is being to
our calls frequently as a flame is based
on airline tracing we don't need to
probe stack traces and this gives us
some extra interesting feature which is
the ability to notice blocking calls
which in if they are drawn in blue
so that's all I had for the time being
as far as the airline vm lessons is
concerned the main takeaway from from
today is pick the technology which is
right for your job for what you are
doing which has the support for
technologies libraries that you need but
also keep in mind that the system that
you're going to work on for the next
month or maybe year year and a half is
going to be maintained and thus your
technology does your technology stack
has all it takes to maintain the system
for 10 years and in my presentation I
try to highlight what is it that may be
needed once you went life so hopefully
there is some well some takeaway even if
you're not an airline programmer if you
are interested in airline maybe because
this is the first time you have heard of
it I have few slides more what you can
do next first you should watch a London
movie it's a masterpiece of Erickson
Department of moviemaking were some
great celebrities like Joe Armstrong if
after watching the movie you are still
not convinced i recommend air langdon
movie sequel this one is for modern
audience you can find both movies on
YouTube then you may want to explore
some open source projects that have been
developed in Ireland rabbitmq for
example we had a pleasure to listen to
some RabbitMQ architect
only a few hours ago mangoes IM
interesting xmpp server implementation
ry'ac database couchdb database those
are open source project large-scale
systems have been built on top of those
technologies you may want to well read
about it and try to ask questions why
sorry why Erlang has been used in those
projects there's also airline community
if anyone would like to join you can
find us on their lung centro you can
find us in stockholm in few months time
there is also lambda Academy where we
teach airline you want to join us and
help us build our polski internet search
join us and we will be asking difficult
questions some interesting problems to
solve this is actually not part of a
long solutions as in our day-to-day
business it's more the effort of the
community here to learn the functional
paradigm so lambda Academy is about
helping people learn the functional
paradigm through interesting challenging
problems and the Internet of Things
seems like a challenging problem that's
all ahead I'm happy to answer any
questions you may have if we have time
we don't have exa any questions
the question is about the lambda Academy
classes the website will be refreshed
and it will provide some more details
soon it's about meeting once per month
physically in Krakov so that we can see
each other face to face talk about
things we can give lectures we can teach
people about some concepts live but then
throughout the rest of the month we are
developing through github an open source
project or projects together we
collaborate from github issues we
collaborate through other world
technologies but this is done mostly
remotely and we meet once per month and
the lambda Academy okay any other
questions
all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
