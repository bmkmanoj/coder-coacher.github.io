Francisco 1.9 pounds of message-passing
but I can't find Francisco but I'll
track him down you guys will help okay
so I'd like to talk about the IOT
revolution and I will actually come to
the strong types because I know that
there are a few programmers in the
audience here ok but first let's talk
about the Internet of Things and it's
everything or as a friend of mine says
it's the next 100 billion devices real
soon now right so what happens in
revolutions is each time we get oh yes
you've arrived just in time for your
present 1.9 pounds of message passing so
you have this ok you have this in that
case now you've got two even more
message passing that's right yes I
signed it yeah okay so it's everything
right so let me just keep track of the
time here how long am I supposed to talk
again 45 minutes ok so therefore 20 ok
so ah we have a mess on our hands when
it comes to IOT because we have all
these manufacturers and their salsas so
you get your refrigerator for
manufacturer X and it says don't you
know your data is valuable it goes to
our data center you get your TV for
manufacturer or why it says don't you
know your data is valuable it goes to
our data center and x and y are two
korean companies i won't actually name
them that hate each other
[Laughter]
their data centers are never going to
talk to each other right so the citizen
sits there and says whew we're screwed
okay so the idea is to make these things
which we call islets okay for
integrating the information locally and
this has several very important things
one is that we'd actually put things
like the car here is our car doesn't
have time to go back to the data center
okay in order to break in time to keep
from killing the kid it's just not time
to do it right and there are other
things as well namely these hundred
billion devices if they were all
directly connected the data centers
which is completely overwhelmed the poor
data centers and besides the data center
too busy making money off advertising
they don't want to bother with this okay
so so the idea is to create these these
these things called islets and there's a
problem that we live in a world in which
you have to recoup the investment for
things means you have to make money so
these things have to be profitable so
the idea for making the profitable is to
do a better job than the other guys who
are firing these targeted advertisers
that it to do a better job okay and then
you said yourself how can this be good
well there actually is a reasonable
business here connecting merchants with
consumers right there really is the
consumers in their nature have this
excess income that they need to spend
and the merchants need to stay in
business there is a process that ought
to be mutually agreeable by which you
can do this
the idea is to do it the way they do it
out to these brokerages like Google and
Facebook right are gigantic and the
other guys are just gigantic brokerages
and so that's the idea here that is
being pushed
so there's a fly in the ointment
something called burr fine steam and
it's it hasn't passed yet they're
waiting for the next terrorist attack
don't you know says covered entities
must provide unencrypted information and
technical assistance to the government
pursuant to a court order and a covered
entity is just about anybody you can
conceive of and the court order can be
just about anything you can conceive of
so the contractors have gone to work and
contacted a designed a gigantic
concurrent system which conceivably
could be implemented in airline but you
might think about whether you want to
sign up for this one or not it's called
Nyborg nivel which stands for nothing is
beyond our reach gigantic concurrent
system based on message passing right
it's a technology it's as as a piece ed
Oppenheimer said you know they came to
him the physicist came to him and said
you know we found out that Germany
doesn't have the bomb right let's
internationalize this thing off behind
the shop he said well look the Japanese
don't want to surrender and it's only 20
kilotons we dropped that much on Dresden
right this is just another weapon work
but unfortunately Stanislaw olam had an
idea we got together with teller and
they invented something 1,000 times more
powerful than what we dropped on
Nagasaki and Hiroshima at that point op
he said this could kill us all but was
too light so teller was quite happy to
be known as the father of the h-bomb
nobody wants to own up denied war
so what goes on with nyborg okay there
keys you have to have kryptos keys okay
so you generate a public key private key
pair slice in a Faraday cage by special
hardware in multiple independent US
government
and posed in such a way that the private
key slice never leaves the Faraday cage
which was created okay software never
sees these private keys if they're going
to do this they say it's not going to be
like clipper you may know about the
Clipper Chip it's not Google it and
Wikipedia this time we're going to quote
do it right and quote okay now also
encryption decryption is performed in
the Faraday cage invisibly to all
software of its command post the public
keys are distributed to authorized
manufacturers for installation in IOT
devices each IOT device 100 billion of
them get a different public key so you
say nobody's going to use this well
welcome to the Nyborg internet on the
naval internet in order to connect with
the public Internet a device must
present a certificate from the
manufacturer that if it receives a
packet that decrypts using its public
key then it immediately uses the packet
as a bootloader to take over the device
with a virtual machine without
disrupting its ongoing activity so the
device is taken over invisible you while
you're talking on the phone hmm okay now
you you say well what about whatever I
if I take my phone to France they say
well we have a deal for you okay as
Roger said each company spies on its own
citizens and then we trade so if you go
to to France then they come back to the
NSA come back to the NSA or the FBI
whoever's got this thing right and say
okay we suspect this guy we won't let
him on our internet unless you let us
spotted - what about it okay and then
the security of this thing one of the
interesting aspects of this is a
security risk is mostly assumed by the
manufacturer of IOT devices that they
cannot be taken over except is described
as
above and if necessary they know they're
going to have bugs in this thing a
device can be taken over repeatedly okay
so what's going to be the cost of this
thing well they like the system so much
that they think that they want the
nuclear command and control system to
use it and that thereby provides another
source of funding it also means that
this system will never be public made
public because don't you know it
controls the nuclear can't command and
control system and if there's another
expense here namely it will if all the
countries do this it will then we have
to audit against Japanese Chinese and
Russian backdoors in our phones that
will make it slightly more expensive but
this is not going to be cheap so there's
a concurrent system for you and there's
an article about this that I've written
actually published on something called
the social science research network you
just google me in that and you can get
the whole article so now that I made
your morning let's go back to the
Internet of Things right so one of the
interesting about the Internet of Things
is at any point any it can be totally
disconnected your car can be out of out
of connection with other stuff as you
drive through various areas you might
drop your cellphone in the swimming pool
right your Wi-Fi comes on and goes off
your refrigerator getting repaired so
that means that the eyelet has to
operate distributed across all these
intermittently connected devices just a
small matter of software as somebody
says ok and also because the clock cycle
hasn't been going up for a long time the
only way to get performance is to have
lots of cores and that means massive
concurrency
just the kind of thing you guys aren't
interested in so long time ago different
coast back back there on the right coast
there was empty things called actors
there have been a long time ago now
actors like quantum mechanics have been
a work in progress this means that you
know Schrodinger didn't really
understand quantum mechanics when he
first wrote down his equation right
there was a lot of work that was taken
that had to be take take place after
that equation before quantum mechanics
and there was the matrix mechanics there
was a Fineman diagrams there was quantum
electrodynamics there was quantum
chromodynamics so we did not it was not
initially conceived okay in its
full-blown glory in 1973 but it had a
simple idea from the start okay it's all
conceptually based on message passing
and so the way it's modeled and this is
modeling what an actor receives a
message it can concurrently send
messages to actors that it has create
new actors and designate how to process
the next message it receives so
fundamentally down here there's
something that's very simple and but now
life begins to become more interesting
it's message passing using types
messages are the unit of communication
but you can only send a message to a
recipient using its type because it
might be a mechanical arm or some other
piece of hardware right and each one of
these piece of hardware get ready to
deal with this thing like to have its
addresses in a certain form right and
has to follow a certain protocol so if
you've got some type you know
refrigerator for manufacturer X that
will be a separate type and it has to
talk to its hardware using a certain
type and using other types for other
kinds of message
so what does this mean it means the
types are heavy lifters types just
aren't you know little strings like
imager or float or a count Raggi
but you compare string light they're
full-fledged actors in their own right
this is strong typing amplified so the
types have to do equality if they have
to do typing subtyping they have to do
the messaging they have to do the
encryption and they have to do the
marshaling to get the messages from one
diode II device to another
IOT device so these things are heavy
lifters so this is the interface for
type of a particular type called
brilliantly called a type for example a
type might be integer or it might be
float oh this is pretty abstract let's
do something simple let's be brave and
have a program but our really small
program so here is a small program it
says I get into floats and I ask if they
are equal to each other so that's what
equal question mark is we don't use
equal because it's not the mathematical
equality right this is the thing that
returns a boolean how do you do that
well what's really going on behind the
scenes is we ask float we send this
message equivalent and gives it N and M
and let this actor called float which
you thought was just a string this actor
called float let them decide whether or
not they're equivalent so that's an
example how we're beefing up the types
to make them full-fledged actors in
their own right so let's do something a
little bit more now we're doing the deep
dive so those of you who don't like
chicken scratching can now tune out for
the next five minutes while we
deeper promise you will be back soon
okay what do we have here we have an
actor of course but this is an
expression actor something which is do I
have a pointer I don't I'll try falling
off the stage this time which is an
expression of Thai which is what
happened like he noted here last time
expression of type boolean and little
half moon guys here there meta
parenthesis okay in this particular
dialect parentheses are used only for
grouping and for nothing else so
therefore these are massive parentheses
and it says it's an expression it says
it's this is this is between the
half-moons is an expression asking
whether this thing is equal to that
thing and these two things are
expressions so this thing in half moon
where did it come from
it came from here this is an expression
so what we're doing is we're giving the
semantics for that expression using
message passing so how do you do that
well you've got an expression to the
left-hand side of the equal question
mark and expression to the right-hand
side of the equal question mark they
mostly must be both the expressions of
some type so we're going to implement
expression of boolean using when an eval
message comes in with an environment e
we return a boolean and the way we do
that is we ask the type whether the
values of these two expressions are
equal or not so it's like baseball the
umpire sits behind home plate when the
person comes sliding into the plate
whatever the umpire calls that's it
this is out he's out says safe you say
okay that's the deal the types rule okay
so what else can we say here there's
some funniness going on here about
distinguishing between programming
languages and what we just saw was a
programming language particular one
funny chicken scratching stuff don't you
know we're distinguishing between
programming languages and models of
computation why bother
was a model of computation a model of
computation enables you to reason about
whole classes of systems right so if I
came up with something that you couldn't
implement in Erlang right that wouldn't
be saying as much as oh there's a whole
class of things that can't be
implemented maybe your line can be
tweaked in some way so it could do it
so what can't some things not do and
this we know from models of computation
here is a simple account and it's the
ordinary checking account and it's got
messages coming in from all around the
world we got get balanced messages and
we got the thousand messages and we've
got the withdraw messages and if you get
up.get balanced message then you return
my balance local variable that i've got
if i get a deposit message then I will
get up update my balance with the amount
if I get a withdraw a message then we
have a conditional test here the
question is whether amount is greater
than my balance or not if it's great if
it's not greater than we decrement the
balance otherwise we return it through
an exception okay
this is something we can prove something
about the lambda calculus can't do this
this means that pure functional
programming all you fans out there can't
do this logic programming is not so
popular in this community but pure logic
programs can't do it either
don't tell Kowalski okay so that's one
of the things you can do with a model of
computation that you can't do with a
programming language and it gets even
more interesting even if you have whole
systems right and you Cluj around right
what you can do with the lambda calculus
and you could put a little too global
stayed up at the top right and just
switch click click click just like in
the original object-oriented programming
with Kristian Nygaard and Olli and Han
Dahl basically ah
Kristian Nygaard was a young guy he's a
great big Norwegian very friendly guy I
enjoyed many a late evening three hours
drinking Laney aquavit with Kristin in
the dorms of Aarhus University he was a
terrific guy so he went there and they
got themselves a reactor and they're
afraid that thing's going to blow up
blow up oz law so his job was to
simulate it and he got busy and then its
simular won and then he got together
with Kristian Nygaard they did stimulus
67 and that was the birth of
object-oriented programming properly but
it was a simulation system it had a
global state the clock would go tick
tick tick tick now he did it in a
modular way so that each one of the
little things that was being simulated
only knew had to simulate itself and
interact with the other things that was
directly connected to so it was a
modular form of simulation
but it was lockstep simulation so if
you're a believer in functional
programming for which we use the lambda
calculus as our bogeyman or our peers
logic programs you have the problem that
if you have a big organization most of
the action is lateral communication
within the organization with the various
pieces updating their own local states
asynchrony a seriously so there's no
global clock that goes thump bump up to
the Department of Defense and as each
thump comes in so you see the reason the
lambda calculus peer logic programs are
thousands of times slower is they have
to go back to the root each time they
have to actually do the global clock
they go back to the root okay bring it
all the local state back to the root and
then for the next clock cycle
distributed all the way down to these
guys and then gather all the way back up
again to the root because in the lambda
calculus and if your logic programming
the director of network assessment
cannot update their local state
asynchronously so this is why we have a
model of computation it's so that we can
prove things like that and this is why
we have quantum mechanics so when the
whoo-whoo is when the quantum mechanics
says you can't do something and the
whoo-whoo say yes I can then the
physicist says here's quantum mechanics
will turn it okay
so the idea is to have these eyelets for
two reasons well those are two aspects
of doing the eyelets one is we use the
actor model computation to to implement
them and we use the eyelids to protect
the citizen sensitive information
against Nyborg the idea is to declare
for each citizen that their personal IOT
in their eyelet is protected against
self-incrimination the Fifth Amendment
the United States and basically your
insulin pump is part of you okay same
thing for your pacemaker and in the
course of the next eight years or so
these little devices that we all have in
our pockets are going to be replaced by
something else and you say what could
possibly replace these six billion
devices in only eight years that would
be pretty amazing won't completely take
over in eight years but it turns out the
computer eyeglasses never mind
certain big manufacturer down south who
didn't have such such great luck with
the first go are going to replace these
things using a holographic eyewear hard
to believe isn't it but it's going to
happen so those eyeglasses also will be
protected against self-incrimination so
big brother can't literally say I see
what you see that's what we're up
against
[Laughter]
hmm was it somebody famous said you want
it darker
[Laughter]
okay so we're going to have a meeting on
this you can talk about it today down at
Stanford and you can look it up yourself
and you've got one of these favorite
little devices handy right it's HTTP
logic - collaboration org and we've been
here before this guy JCR Licklider who I
actually had the pleasure to know at MIT
when I was there a great great guy
like what we call him lick Li CK that
was his his name he just went by
Licklider I mean if you have a first
name JC RL JCR you might go to lick also
so here's the deal
in 1962 decades before personal
computers and internet became household
words the revolution that gave rise to
both of them was set in motion from a
small nondescript office in the depths
of the Pentagon in an age when computers
still meant big ominous mainframe
mysteriously processing punch cards what
are they the occupant of that office an
MIT psychologist named JCR Licklider had
somehow seen a future in which computers
would become an exciting new medium of
expression a joyful expression to
creativity and a gateway to a vast
online world of information Lick had
that vision and now he was determined to
use the Pentagon's money to make it all
happen and he did from as director IP at
teo he funded the MIT artificial
intelligence laboratory the Stanford
artificial intelligence laboratory
Newell and Simon at Carnegie and Doug
Engelbart at SR I he started the funding
for all of them and made the revolution
happen probably the most important
computer scientist that you may not have
heard of before
so Lick was pretty fantastic
and that gay but that gave birth because
see that was that was the thing that was
when the computer came out of the big
glass room right and went on to
everybody's desk and now into
everybody's pocket and now with the
Internet of Things it goes into
everything has an IP address and if my
bar comes to pass a back door to boot
[Laughter]
that's the question of the hour what are
the computer sign is going to do with
this one so we're going to set up a
table at lunch today please come join me
we'll get a big table and back and talk
about all this so I think I've left a
little bit of time for questions
the legal problems on the technology
well there actually is an academy
inspectors Academy of Sciences Academy
of us Academy of Sciences which actually
has convened a panel that is actually
studying the issue of the back doors and
I've been talking to them and I've been
urging them to issue they have a
one-year mandate and they were thinking
of waiting a year to issue their reports
as new new new you need to issue a
report now so I'd urge you to go to the
National Academy and the directors of
the the administrative directors of
studies is a great person talk to them
and urge them to issue a report sooner
rather than later because we are still
in the early stages of this right this
is when the invention was made it was
made in Germany lots of it they
discovered how to split the out of the
bomb in Germany split the atom in
Germany of course the bomb was made here
funny thing about that but this is still
the early stages this is the point at
which knob or has been invented it has
not been implemented it will not be
trivial to implement their important
policy things they need legislation they
have to pass ver feinstein in order to
make it legal so it's very complicated
socio-political technological issue that
the computer scientists now face this is
the moment the physicists paced and look
what we got
can the pube the question is can the
computer scientists do any better
question
okay I don't know I've been practicing
well all this stuff gets incredibly
complicated in order proof something
can't be done you have to have a model
of computation and then you see in the
model of computation okay you have a way
of explaining in that model of
conservation the lambda calculus and
pure logic programs and then you prove
the theorem that in that model of
computation they can do it now that's
another thing which is AP AP if you look
in that book that I just gave Francisco
girdle actually got his theorem he got
that he got it was technically wrong and
with the proposition
I'm unprovable is not actually a
proposition of mathematics because it
fails for interesting reasons that you
this talk namely it doesn't type check
the proposition I'm unprovable does not
type check that doesn't mean that
incompleteness not will and it doesn't
mean that incompleteness is wrong
instead there's a different proposition
that's that is true but unprovable a
different proposition about the integers
the proposition by the end about the
integers that is true but unprovable is
that the proofs of the theory of the
natural numbers are computationally
enumerable that is true but it cannot be
proved within that theory so that is the
true but unprovable proposition and if
you want to learn more about that come
to the event next week at Stanford
that's right it is true that there are
true but unprovable propositions but he
got the wrong one sorry about that
girdle right so they and we knew we knew
that there must exist true but
unprovable propositions because of the
work of church in 1936 where a church
proved that it is computationally
undecidable to decide whether or not a
proposition is a theorem or not whether
it can be proof that is computationally
undecidable and because it's
computationally undecidable
it also must be there must be an
inferential e undecidable proposition
because hold on to your hat otherwise we
could decide whether any proposition is
provable or unprovable by simply
enumerate in all the theories and to see
whether its truth or its falsities proof
and that would be decision procedure
there can be no decision procedure
algorithmic decision procedure so there
must exist an undecidable proposition
inferentially
compounded question school computers
that's right yes in the following way
namely we will have intelligent
applications but we will not have for
now artificial intelligence which means
the name of the game now is
collaborating with humans to make more
intelligent systems the computers cannot
do it by themselves in that respect lick
was absolutely correct but he what he a
psychologist called symbiosis we now
call collaboration effective intelligent
applications must have intense
collaboration with humans or being
ineffective what that means in practice
is that we will have computer assisted
driving for our cars for a long time
at least a decade and we will not have
computer only driven cars because we
can't do it and we had a long history an
AI where we claim we're going to do
certain things by date X and then date X
would come and we prove very very far
from doing it
history is unfortunately repeating
itself so that's a good point about
lickin and collaborations collaboration
with humans is the name of the game and
that's what this event in Stanford is
all about good question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
