concur
do is talk about how processes can be
given names talk a bit about how they
can apply timeouts the processing of
messages and make some general remarks
about our processes tend to look you
know what we did in the first part of
the the session was to talk about how
processes were created using the spawn
Biff remember Biff is is the airline
terminology for a built-in function that
is a function that we can call without
mentioning which module it comes from so
spawn is the the Biff we use to create a
new process which will run code from a
particular function in a particular
module and we pass messages between
these processes which don't share memory
we pass messages by using PID bang
message or PID pling message the
exclamation mark symbol on the left of
that is the process identifier which we
get back as a result of spawning a
process that's the way that we get hold
of a handle on a process and then
receives the receive statement where we
have a number of clauses which can
selectively process messages which are
stored in a mailbox for a process when
they're received reminder just that
process message passing is asynchronous
a message is sent doesn't have to be
processed before the sender can carry on
and do other things and processes will
will store messages in a mailbox until
they are processed ok let's talk a bit
about how processes can be named we do
that using the register
BIF that takes two arguments it takes an
atom which is going to be the name the
alias of the process and it takes the
PID of the process which is how it is
identified and remember the PID can come
back
a spawn any process can register a PID
and once a process is registered any
process any other process can send a
message to it we can find out what the
registered processes are by calling the
registered BIF and we can find out the
PID of a process by calling whereís
with its alias as argument let's take a
look at an example of this in practice
we have a process with PID 1 and what we
see is underneath that process we see
the start code for the process the first
expression to be evaluated is spawn of
the server function in the number module
with no arguments and that returns a PID
and then the second statement we execute
is a registration so that new process is
now called analyzer because we've called
register with analyzer and PID you can
then see how we interact with that new
registered process in the analyze
function and you can see there a message
is being sent not to a PID now but is
being sent to that named process
analyzer and that sends a message and
doing whatever sends some data to be
analyzed by that other process but any
process now can send a message to that
to that process was with whose PID was
stored in a variable PID but is now
named by that that name as that's
accessible to any other process
you see an example we said that message
sending to a PID never failed if you
send a message to a non-existent PID it
simply gets thrown away that's not the
case if a process is registered if we
send a message to a name that is not
registered we will get a an error we'll
get a process that tries to send that
message will terminate with a bad
aaaghhh error so I have to be aware of
that
that we get the way that you handle a
problem like that is different between a
non-registered process and a registered
process the next thing I wanted to talk
about was how to deal with message
reception timeouts now let's suppose
we're in process with PID B we want to
we want to receive a message within a
certain amount of time we start to when
we come to the receive statement there
may be messages already in the mailbox
in which case we deal with them but
suppose we there are no messages in the
mailbox when we arrive at that statement
and we want to be certain that we will
move on from that statement within a
fixed amount of time what we can do is
use the after version of the received
laws so what we have in this sort of
statement is we have received followed
by a number of standard clauses with a
pattern and a body and then we have an
after the after keyword followed by a
timeout expressed in milliseconds and
code that is to be executed if that
timeout is invoked so if in this example
we receive a message within the time
timeout then expressions 1 will be
executed
but otherwise we like will execute
whatever code is there in expressions to
so we can be sure of processing a
message and moving on within a certain
amount of time so here you see an
example this is and the analyzer example
we've got a receive statement that if we
get a reply message we simply transfer
transform that into an okay message we
receive an error message we simply
transmit that but if we receive we
simply return that if we receive neither
of those within a second and what we do
is we return an error to pull together
with the atom timeout
so we're effectively finding another
reason to fail there so this this
analyze function might return the result
okay and a value or it might return an
error from the analyzer process or an
error due to a timeout so we've had to
we've dealt with that now it's possible
of course that if this is having a
timeout Clause means that there are some
messages that might not have been
processed they might arrive later so we
have to be aware that those messages
will go into the mailbox and will need
to be potentially need to be handled at
some point let's take another look at an
example here this is a function that
will send a message after a particular
time and
let's have a look at what happens there
what send after does is immediately
spawn a descend process which executes
send in the timer module with arguments
self which is the the ID PID the
creating process a time and a message
and what what we have in the body of the
send is a receive statement within after
with a timeout but with no standard
processing so this will there is no way
of handling any messages that come in
all that can do is after the timeout
send a message to the to the PID so
there you can see that what this does is
send a message after a fixed amount of
time and what you see in the sleep
function at the bottom is simply a
function that will that will sleep for a
fixed amount of time before terminating
so there are ways of of ensuring that if
we want to not to send a message
immediately we can use the this end
after function if we want simply to to
do no processing for a period we can use
the sleep and the both of those use the
it's degenerate form of the receive
statement where you've got no message
processing clauses in there
now what you see here is a azide as we
said earlier on if you use a timeout
it's possible that you will leave some
messages in the mailbox which you don't
want to do you've timed out so you don't
want then to process those messages
properly here's a nice example using
again this this timeout mechanism to
flush any remaining messages from a
mailbox let's have a look at this
how does it work we've got a receive
statement with a which will process any
incoming message and we got a timeout of
zero so the way that the effect of this
will be that if there are any messages
in the mailbox the first one will
immediately match and the effect of that
is to call flush so every time there is
a mailbox in the every time there is a
message in the mailbox
we will loop and call the flush function
again if then we empty the mailbox and
call flush again we will timeout
immediately there are no further
messages and just return okay so this
has the effect of removing all the
messages from the mailbox without
performing any action other than to
remove them and then terminate when
there are no message no further messages
in the mailbox
so just a reminder of some of the some
of the definitions that we've been using
we use the term process for a concurrent
piece of activity in the system and as I
said right at the start of this chapter
in our line you can run thousands tens
of thousands of processes simultaneously
these are not like operating system
threads they're not like Java threads
these are lightweight processes they're
also unlike OS threads or Java threads
in that they don't share memory each
process has its own memory which is
separately garbage collected so the
garbage collector is very fine-grained
and will ensure that on a per process
basis memory is recycled so if there is
no shared memory between processes the
only way that the process is going to
interact is by sending messages and
that's the way of of sending data the
data might be data or but though the
data might be to help in communication
so in order to pass information about
processes we share their PIDs and those
pids are often a component of a message
it's often the return address so you
send a letter to somebody with your
address on the back and they can then
send a message back to you using that
PID I talked about time outs talked
about a process is registered if it is
given a name using the register bit or
built in function and we said right at
the start about process termination
there are two ways a process can
terminate a process will run the code
for a particular function when that
function terminates the process itself
terminates and that's called normal
termination otherwise if there's a
runtime error the process will die and
that's called abnormal termination
now I just wanted to conclude by talking
a bit about what the skeleton of how a
whole lot of processes look it's often
the case that a process will we'll have
this this form that a process will be
started up by calling spawn so in this
in this example we're calling the
function in it from the server module
with some arguments so we start off by
calling this init function and what that
does is set up a loop so looking now in
the body of the init function what do we
do what we call an initialized state
function we set some House steps and set
up some state and then we call loop with
that initial state data the powerhouse
of this this process is the is the loop
function itself and what we see there is
the body of the loop is a receive
statement and it has two clauses the
second is to handle a stop message the
stop a turn and what that does is is we
do execute some code that's that cleans
up and then terminates but if we receive
a message that of the which has to be
handled in some way what we do is we in
some way we handle it calling a function
called it handle here and that gives us
back a new state and then what we do is
we call the loop function again but with
that new state value rather than the one
we started with and this maps very well
on to the example we saw earlier of the
function to keep a running total what
the loop what we did in the loop body
there was the new state was got by
adding the the latest number to the
running total and then we called the
loop again with that new running total
what we did when we terminated was
simply send a stopped message back to
the function that had created the
process that
created us so they so this pattern of
doing some initialization and then
sitting in a receive of our loop until
you receive a message to stop which
point you terminate gracefully it's a
very general pattern for for how
processes in Erlang tend to look so
that's we've come to the end of the this
chapter on concurrent Erlang we talked
the two two things we've added to what
we talked about earlier where the idea
of process can have a name through the
process of registration and also that we
can timeout in message handling so we're
not forced to wait forever inside a
receive statement and we finished off by
talking about the general format the
processes had what I'll do now is just
give you a short demonstration of a
registered process and then we'll call
it today let's go back to the example
where we had a process which would keep
a running total of integers that we sent
to it and here we see it we start up by
spawning the main function and here's
the main function that receives either
stop message or an integer in the
integer case it adds it to the running
total and calls itself recursively this
loop just as I said at the at the end of
the the chapter this is the typical
process structure what we have here are
the functions to interact with that with
that process the add function that sends
itself plus a number to the PID of the
process that does the addition and here
we have the stop function that does a
similar thing
so we spawned this in the start function
we collected the PID from that and then
we use the PID in these two functions
however if we do if we make this a
registered process we can have a much
simpler interaction with the the adder
process let's look at what we do what
I've got is the two version side by side
here
we start up in the same way we spawn the
the function in PID PID and then we
register that PID under the name of
adder and now once we've done that
registration we can here send a message
to adder and we don't have to pass that
PID around as an argument to add or stop
so let's take a look at this in yelling
shell we compile it and then we can
start it and notice we didn't have to
capture the the result of that in a
variable because we can send messages
like add five directly or add of 17
without having to pass in the PID
because inside the body of the add we
have the name of the process and in a
similar way we can stop the process just
by calling the stop function and there
we are so instead of having to pass that
PID around we use the registered process
okay that concludes what I wanted to say
about processes and concurrency and so I
will stop there
