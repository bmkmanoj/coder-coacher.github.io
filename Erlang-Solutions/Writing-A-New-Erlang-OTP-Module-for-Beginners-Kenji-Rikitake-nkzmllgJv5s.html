name is kensey Ricky okay
I'm very glad to come back here again
and this is my ace presentation at the
San Francisco and elixir factory since
2010 okay yeah um in this talk I'm gonna
talk about what to do if you want to
commit your code to earn OTP itself and
I'm talking I will be talking about my
own experience so what I did for TP I'd
written six implementation a random
number code for own Island since July 2
2010 they are all on github so feel free
to look them up and I've tested and
published the result at many places
including past years of discount France
namely 2011 and 2015 and at HTML and
workshops I submitted and except on the
gut got the papers accepted two times
and 2011 and 2012 and after doing this
random number stuff for nearly five
years
now the code is a part of OTP since OTP
18 and you'll be getting a major
revision at OTP 20 it's already
available on the master branch but the
official release will be July 2017
you'll be getting the details on
tomorrow's presentation by Lucas Rosen
about the OTP status or Oda Beach State
of the Union okay
this talk is not about technical talk
I've already given multiple talks at our
own factory on the details of pseudo
number random generators and there are
the rhythms and the implementation
details and for all of those stuff I
don't want to make a duplicate on this
presentation and if you have any
interest on me all of the technical
details you
can see the video archive the YouTube of
their own factory of course I'll be glad
to answer these those questions during
the conference I'll take I'll take them
I take them just free--free to meet for
me feel free to ask me for that but I
will not go into the details in this
presentation on the other hand in this
talk what is talk is about I will
explain what I've learned from writing
in an OTP or a module for the OTP itself
and I will include the three major
topics - bopping software for OTP
working with the LT team sorry OTP team
and how to gain the community support of
your code okay let's get to the first
topic I'd like to talk about software
development for all non OTP yeah why new
code there are there are many reasons
for writing a new piece of code the most
critical ones for fixing a bug and
closing the security holes and there
will be a need for support for new
devices I think that's one of the most
important important thing to do on
writing new code and of course people
want new features or even some cool
stuff and some people may say they want
to change effects what they don't like
although I don't recommend it because
it's it's um it turns out to be an
argument and which is not a creative
argument so I don't I don't recommend to
do so if you the bottom line is that if
you want to commit the code that's for
do it for everybody do it for everybody
please okay before trying to commit your
code to OTP you need to think carefully
before making a change to the OTP OTP is
for all other users
all other uses does not no longer means
just other users all elixir users are
affected by this and all LFE users are
affected by this and let I have to say
that all OpenStack uses are affected by
this because open rabbitmq a very long
time Alain product has already become a
part of the OpenStack so when you wanna
make a change you have to be very
careful cheri speaking and you also need
to think about who needs a code is this
for some specific implementation or some
specific use or is it for a general
change like finding a like what she like
a very critical bug like yeah there was
an elixir bug recently like what should
I say um there's a module an elixir
called plug and it deals with the ER
file pass and that kind and Joseph Elam
immediately released about bug fix to
the elixir community and that kind of
thing must be them very in a very fast
manners and very widely or otherwise
there may be a real damage but only
handle hand if you're going to put some
new features new features you have to
discuss that a lot with other people or
OTP people otherwise you may prematurely
put into the code and break something
else which is you want the least so
talking about new future you got the
very conservative and you also need to
remember once a piece of code is
committed removing it is a very
difficult task for example random mojo
which will be deprecated I don't know
removed from OTP 20 and now it's
deprecated since of the OTP 19 is being
there no has been there since 1998 if
you track the whole logs of all on
source code which is huge from our own
version 8 not 18 8 which is raised in
1999 you still find the same code there
as you find there in recent our own
source code so removing the old source
code is very very hard once it is being
used by many people so if you try to
commit something um you have to think
about that removal is very hard ok so
let me explain about the rationale for
random module the rationale for
including Ram module was mainly to fix
the security issues of random module to
make it short the random module is
exploitable by anyone who has Mac Mini
or PC or laptop PC within less than 10
hours by a C code it only has 2 ^ 43
sequences only think only please then
it's a big number but it's it's just a
Showtime for computer so I proposed some
of the alternative algorithm which has a
2 to the 64 period or 2 to the 112-680
period or even longer to to the 1,024
period and these long periods may sense
by the need of a lesser possibility of
being exported and
there's another need the second one is a
better API because two random module two
random function the seeding function of
random module random column seed slash
zero or slash one it has three it has a
serious deficiency that when you when
you are not when you use the random seed
or I'm sorry when you when you use
random uniform or better say a random
function itself without any
initialization you will almost always
get the same result
mmm so it's not random at all if you
just call it random uniform at the
different processes you will get the
same result if you fail to initialize
with something with external randomness
such as time or process number or that
kind of factors so on ran module
everything is ultimate eyes instead once
you call ran : uniform you will get
totally not really Tory but trying to
try hard to be totally different
initialized parameter so you don't have
to worry about the Random randomness of
the seeding itself okay and the next
thing is about multiple arisen I
mentioned three algorithms and those are
already built in to the random module
but random module itself has a
extensible extendable architecture so
you can add more algorithm later if you
at least if you know how and there are
many there are other features that it
provides not only the uniform
distribution but a normal distribution
normal distribution is
what is used in the statistics and it's
called also called Gaussian distribution
it represents the what I say natural
behaviors natural behaviors and it's
it's also called a bell curve and the
other stuff okay now the I have put
another stuff in for the OTP 20 it is
called the jump function and the jump
function means jump function is
providing the result of the same result
of equivalent result of the calculating
a very huge number of sequential
iteration which the two to the power of
56 or 2 to the power 64 or 512 so that
by jumping by providing it by doing a
jump once before initializing the random
number you can guarantee that the
different the result of the different
processes will not overlap practically
so these important so these stuff new
stuff are already into run ran modules
and one good thing is that the default
algorithm of random module is still as
fast as random module even with the high
repression on the 64-bit computers so
it's not only my work it's also D
there's a huge amount of work poured in
by Dan Goodwin dicin ltp team maintainer
about the on this or how to make the
round module a better thing so that
everyone will satisfy so let me tell you
about the bottom line the important
points that you need to have a rationale
that convinced all uses of olan olan not
just all an elixir LFE or all community
ok
okay let me talk about the prototyping
and when you decide to write your own
all a module the first thing you need to
do is to make an independent repository
independent means that you can isolate
the code and the development from the
assistance system and this will make the
testing much easier and you also need to
learn common tests common test is a
testing framework which provides a unit
test and some good features like
concurrent tests or specify being able
to specify a test sequence many ot PE
not not only I'm sorry many other
modules are provided on the unit a unit
is good but rewriting a unit to come a
common test is not that hard once you
get learned to it so if you want to put
the make the your code compatible with
OTP you please use common test and you
need to learn dialyzer dialyzer is a
framework or not not framework it's a
tool of providing statistic static
analysis of all code by the given type
and data specifications providing type
and formal types and data specification
is very very important on OTP because
all ODP functions are wizard without the
type specification your code will be
100% rejected and the search is desilva
here you also need to be fluent in Earl
doctrine
our adoption is XML based documentation
system which I'm going to explain later
so this is a test case a part of this
case I picked up from the ran module
test case and first of all in common
test you almost always put the keyword
suite
and when you find that when you find the
source code with that file name it's
it's a common test it's a common test
test suite so you can find many of these
in the part of our source code and in
common test you can define the sequences
of the test in all slash zero function
it's over here and you literally list
all the test case functions in this case
begins with seed in turbo and and it's
going to interval fault and all all
those stuff and it ends with a group
group is described by a tuple with with
the first element group and the group
name over here and what does group do
group is the set of the test which has a
common characteristics when you specify
the option of parallel into a group
which is listed under the function
groups all groups must be listed in the
function of the groups for example a
group called basic stats it's right here
there are three functions called basic
stats uniform one uniform two and normal
and those tests are running concurrently
or parallely so that the execution time
will be reduced in in case of multi-core
and you can in the in this case you have
you also have a reference jump and
there's a reference jump state and
reference jump object and these two
tests will run concurrently so by using
these kind of options wise way you can
show you can shorten the time of testing
and without without making it without
changing the sequence or other testing
restrictions so this is just things
example of the common test feature there
are a lot of lots of features in common
tests so and I suggest you to learn
common test if you want to make a big
system on not only your OTP but for all
the other applications ok and next about
dialyzer dialyzer is very simple you all
you've got to do is to make file called
PLT which is a templates before learning
will dialyzer and i'm i will not talk
about that it's in dialyzers manual you
can find it in the dallas manual and
it's built in into Ã¶land m'kay or rebar
3 or other built prop popular building
tools but on land module there is a one
very interesting property that it uses
an improper list right here improper
means that the very end very tail of the
list element is not know on olan the
tail element is is supposed to be known
to be proper and and why it should be
why it has to be that is that many of
the lists module library assumed that
okay but so and also the dialyzer
assumes that all this are proper lists
but sometimes in this rare case actually
Dan Goodwin soon he used he used this a
very packed structure as an optimization
for speed and memory you have to disable
the dialyzers dialyzers function of
detecting improper lists and give it a
warning
so here's a directive I'm sorry it's not
a directive in NOLA
it says attribute and the dialyzer
attribute with the function here right
here described and with no improper
lists don't check it this is a flag and
in imran module we specify this direct
dis attribute for four of the functions
okay so the bottom line here is that
when you use the analyzer you have to
use it wisely don't don't give don't
don't let the dialyzer generate spurious
warning messages and that will hide a
much important one okay all right the
next one and actually the last one for
the prototype prototyping is about the
Earl Dobson this is a um kind of hard to
read XML document this is the strict
Excel document which is a part of the
ran module and it's about the functional
function explanation because it's begins
as funk and these tags these tags to
define in alt oxygen manual so if you if
you are interested in what these tags
are doing please refer to the Earl
doctor manual and one thing you have to
remember is that it's neither a markdown
or restructure text or nor HTML it's not
a simple HTML because you have to
generate the HTML and PDF from the same
file all together with during the build
process so it's an XML with specific
tags if you want to if you if you have
to write a memo you need to get
accustomed to these tags for writing OTP
manual
one good thing is that if you are
familiar with a docx format it up format
can be converted into this old doctrine
format pretty easily okay
and here's the converted result with the
dotted box I only show the source code
up here right here and this is a
converted result during the prototype
during the prototyping phase of the
documentation so if you want to work
with our Note ep you have to know three
things common test dialyzer and earl dr.
okay okay now I'm talk about I'm going
to talk about how to work with OTP team
I'm going to show you first a couple of
tweets from loiaco gun the also of
cowboy telling tips on getting your prep
patches so pool liqueurs merged which is
part of from tweet timeline on February
2017 okay I'm gonna leave this or out
first how not to get changes merged send
big patch without previous discussion
get patch rejected with requests for
changes and not doing those changes
requested so the buck so the summer to
summarize this this tweet tells they're
sending a huge patch or maybe a 100
lines of 1000 lines or whatever or
entire file abruptly without a thorough
discussion beforehand with some someone
else will always be rejected because
it's hard to deal hard to verify hard to
analyze and hard to hard to test so
unless you are really sure
with what you're doing don't do this
okay and here comes the second
consecutive tweet I'm gonna read it out
to how to get changes merged disgust big
picture with maintainer right two
changes one small step at a time this
doesn't necessarily mean oh one line for
each but one small chunk maybe five one
function or one data type for each and
submit them in small chunks and this
this tweet tells that having a
discussion when the broader goals with
maintainer be forehand about what you're
doing and sending patches in small steps
one at a time is a key to successfully
merge your patches a I'm not saying that
making your final making making merging
your patches the final goal is a good
one but if you want to contribute
effectively you have to let your ideas
through to the maintainer or the OTP
team or whatever few controls accord so
and here comes the last weight I'm gonna
read it or out again the key is a
constant discussion around the changes
so it's all about communication and if
you don't if you're not interested in
and other part of this presentation
please remember that the core of this
presentation is that the constant
discussion around the changes is the
most important part to make a better
software or made a better contribution
and their effective contribution so okay
let me go to a little bit details how
about the what to do to include e
includes your stuff to the OTP when
you're going to issue a pull request or
PR on the github OTP is entirely
maintained in the
you need to tell what you're going to do
with it and how it changes and effector
does not affect other modules what and
how is easy to describe untwisting pull
request issues you can you just document
them but the harder part is that what it
will affect what or what will it will
not affect determine the range of the
range of what what will be affected that
is the heart that is a hard part and for
example in the ran module
almost everyone using the random module
will be affected and the range was huge
and it affected RabbitMQ RabbitMQ after
he wrote their own wrapper code to
switch between random and ran module I
personally didn't think that kind of
code is needed but that's their choice
and some people simply switched the
module header of random into ran in many
cases it will work but the bottom line
is that you and that it affects a lots
of people so it take almost two years to
migrate so I of course I know that and I
and with the OTP team we discussed a lot
about how to migrate or how how to make
those programmers easier to migrate but
after all somebody has to suffer from
the changes so a tree you have to
document that before sending your poor
request and your you will also have to
include test cases test cases is a must
I have to confer some of some of my code
doesn't include test cases
bad I'm sorry I'll be punished about
that but but the reality is that without
test cases
OTP will not never ever accept your code
and there's other important thing type
specs types pad thai sophistication for
all global global means that which is v
which is visible to the from the
external modules or applications these
are required and i also have to confess
my saying that i forgot to write some of
the important important tech specs in
the jump function recent recent commit
recent commit to the OTP and dan dan
Goodman's in my partner accidentally put
into the production code and the author
of dialyzer professor Costas ago knows
he's a very great and emotional person
immediately responded that you were
doing the wrong thing and he / he
scolded litter is coded dan the white
didn't - ye why didn't you check that
but the story doesn't didn't end in this
way cause Professor Sabonis immediately
Walter Paget patch for the building
system of the OTP which uses a Travis CI
so that every part of the code will be
tested under the dialyzer so he's not
just an emotional person he's a very
practical person I admire him a lot
so this kind of attitude is required
when you really want to commit to the
OTP you have to be proactive okay okay
so let's get back to the last one
documentation you have to describe what
you do in the Earle manner Oh manuals
manner all I don't know whether all
manual is is really little orphan tree
for the newcomers but the those are well
described and one good thing for a
non-native speaker like only
keeping a speaker like me is that it's
not full of American slang for British
banks or whatever it's written by a
Swedish people so they are they are very
they're using the common expression
which is are much understandable for me
like Japanese so okay anyway use right
the good documentation good test cases
and of course efficient aspects okay and
how to issue a poor request when you try
to issue a pro request to fix a bug
report bugs before the pro requests
reported reported reported by speed is
three times because because not because
so many people are complaining that bugs
on Twitter or everyone everywhere maybe
on a stack over for every word that is
okay but without reporting the it to the
OTP team OTP team doesn't really know
anything about it so report bugs before
sending a probe request of course you
can do it together all together and
choose the right branch right branch
means the branch means there there are
many branches in OTP source code tree
for example when you put the new feature
it over it it has to be on the master
branch master means that it's on the
development it's not on the release for
example for the time being as of now the
going to be OTP 20 is on master branch
on the other hand there are there are
main branch
there's mayn't 19 and mate 1890 mate 19
years for version 19 and maintain teef
18 is for version 18 and bug fixes for
specific releases should be sent in sent
in to those branches - so you gotta
choose a right branch so okay so the
next topic it's about separate commits
fro separate changes
freeze mode utilize your code motorized
your command so that the OTP people can
understand what you're gonna do with
each part of the command and this is a
requirement so that OTP team can use the
command called git bisect so that each
of the command and the get get get log
can be examined in infantry and made so
make sure each commit works and OTP team
may request you to squash multiple
commits for example if you commit one
line for each commit and you throw them
100 100 commits in the same pool request
they will understand but they will
almost always request you to squash 100
commit into one so get accustomed to use
the command called git rebase it will
benefit you to streamline what you
really do and the OTP
I mean github okay next talk about the
communication with OTP team maintaining
steady communication is important as I
told as I told you in the previous Lord
sweet and OTP team may send you some
private email for the contents which is
not appropriate it not appropriate to be
put on the github issues so use them
respond them wisely maybe maybe they
want to ask you for something before
make it probably publicize something so
get the bottom line is keep forceful
communication and the other trivial I'm
going to tell you a trivial thing that
OTP team work in Sweden time Sweden time
8 over 8 hours our head of now from the
California time and to soon be nine
hours ahead because the next week
because you wrote Europe and US Canada
they are saving time schedule are
different remember they
different so your your summertime is not
there's so time zone difference should
be respected and you should also reflect
their weekends their vacations or their
holidays because for OTP team dealing
with OTP is their work the job the duty
and the business for for not for
volunteer like me it's not necessary
that that in in that were say in that in
that work manner I maybe I can do it for
fun but in 40 P it's not for fun it's
for therefore business so respect their
weekends don't expect the immediate
reply for for watches flow to the OTP
people and the one thing I have to
mention is that OTP team members have to
deal with many many modules and many
many different parts of the or on itself
some of them are doing all on vm
together or on SMP scheduler or all on
memory allocator or garbage collector or
some very difficult part of Ã¶land as
well as other demos other modules so I
gotta tell you that time for you if you
want to commit the cold time for you
it's usually very limited I have 5
minutes financial ok ok I'm gonna speed
up let me move on to how to gain
community support for your code the
easiest the first thing you get to do is
to promote your code publishing github
and elsewhere
give talks and conferences like I do now
and write proof of conference proof of
concept and show the problems if it's
about bugs
I wrote a C code to exploit the random
module within less than 10 hours with
and the proof of concept that proof of
concept called
finally move the OTP team to make an
alternative namely Ron mojo okay and
about code maintenance and support this
is a rather ethics issue but once you
commit the code to OTP you were
responsible for your code and you are
also being asked for bug fix or
enhancement so you got to be ready once
you commit your code and if you just
keep it keep it leave it without
untouched old code may be removed by the
OTP team's discretion so you if you want
your code to be in OTP you have to
maintain the contact frequently and the
last but not least be careful editing
features OTP people or olan people or
maybe your extra people they are very
conservative on adding features okay on
the last topic all on OTP has has Apache
2 license and license is a very hard
part it's it's I think it's a field of
lawyers not for programmers so I'm not
going into the details of legal details
but one thing for sure is that
unfortunately a Pashtu isn't
incompatible with GPL v2 and v3 so if
the code is declared GPL you cannot
bring and bring it directly to Apache
Apache to code including our own OTP
unless it is explicitly relicensed on
the other hand MIT and BSD license code
they are ok to merge but in general lees
licensing is almost always needed OTP
team will ask you once they decide your
code is your code will be a part of OTP
so to last to conclude this presentation
there are lots of things to deal with
OTP team and this is a kind of um kind
of
how hard things to do but I still I want
to emphasize that our community and OTP
team always me always always always need
your help because they are severely
understaffed and the volunteers for
Allen performance increase is severely
understaffed and they need to get more
talents and people to improve the
software I I'd be glad if this
presentation helps you to understand the
situation of OTP team and how its
maintained now let me show you the
reference the time is limited so I put
the document on web specific for this
topic and if you get if you get to slide
you will be linked to the document
online and before finishing the
presentation I'd like to thank GMO
people for supporting this presentation
as a recent activity of people and the
Institute where I'm working as a guest
researcher and acknowledgement for Dan
Goodwin he's a super person to make the
whole optimization of rain mojo and
Sebastian vineya with with who is a
inventor of the new algorithm Exorcist
star and plus and the Dan actually then
actually request a service channel for
writing an algorithm for specific for
Olin and Sebastiana did it so Sebastian
did the very cool thing through rolling
and I also thank all the solutions for
giving this chance and to talk so thank
you for any questions
yes deficiencies they're getting rid of
initialization phase
okay so can I understand um can I refer
to you that you so do you do I think
random module is going going to be in
pretty still be improved in new world
Jewish okay
instead his questions about any
possibility of improve improving in the
old module instead of writing a new one
oh that is impossible because because um
AAA s 183 is based algorithm of random
is designed in 1980s for 16-bit
computers and although at that time it's
new and it was innovative but then I no
longer recommend it for any use any
production use or any testing use so if
you want to switch so if you want to if
you have a lot of land around the number
routines switch it to ran immediately
right now please I'm sorry this would be
your inconvenience but please okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
