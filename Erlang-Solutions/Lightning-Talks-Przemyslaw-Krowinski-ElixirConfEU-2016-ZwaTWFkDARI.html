today I want to talk to you about a few
a basically one project that I did in a
league here and it consisted of your
umbrella apps and what is that about
it's actually a really silly thing a
while ago and I noticed that of course
the web is full of spam and these ghosts
like clickbait articles like you can see
there and they kind of all follow the
more or less same pattern so I had like
an idea to basically serve them I make
her small database and try to create
like artificial intelligence that we
basically create stuff like that for you
if you wanted for some reason and yeah I
decided to learn a few things about Alex
ear Phoenix about em and later put it
all on Heroku and basically see how how
it works and as I mentioned step one
must to visit some of those websites
vary from content so I took website like
BuzzFeed other like that I don't even
remember and created a small database
basically a text file of different
headlines then I parsad using Alex here
and i actually created a few umbrella
apps to do that one was part of things
the other one was learning based on that
the other one was doing something else
and the others once something is I like
really went crazy leave that basically
see how how it works and what I use
there are a Markov chains so basically
my absence their sentences and then it
looked at each word and after that
decided how probable it is that another
world will come after that so even if I
have basically their work the letter I I
can I after reading some articles I know
that usually after I i will have em
m for example Sam or something else oh
there is a small chance that after I are
we'd have do or something else that some
basically this is my update and I also
put finishing their as another umbrella
up and my idea was that Phoenix will be
displaying basically the results and
presenting you letting them to you as
web server because basically a hike
online newspaper and after I got this so
you can see the results in a text file
and later I display like stuffing L mean
I really like simple way in bootstrap
like black and white for now but yeah I
supposed to be unused which a result I
actually had to handpick a lot of them
because yeah it tended to generate
really offensive stuff sometimes and so
ready mentally girls are sometimes I put
some political stuff in there and other
crazy things so yeah it was ready with
sometimes and yeah let us learn
basically microcenter visas and umbrella
apps worked like really well I was that
was supposed to be closer or collapsed
no matter basically put them on Heroku
and I wanted to test how it works and
see it's just worked out of the box just
one line of configuration and that's it
what you have to do like compared to us
stand up singing sleep alone and I was
really surprised by seed because
actually parsing all of those beings and
this thing then was actually faster than
the start of ping servers so that was
just well for me because I did similar
stuff in Ruby one time and in Wright's
actuality and see I took like two
minutes or something like that so well
and other than that I used l and yeah
I'm really I love em but i'm still
learning it i don't know that much but
it was like really forcing me to write a
really nice CSS code to anything about
how to make CF classes and stuff like
that so that was really cool yeah and if
you want to see the up source you can
visit my web my portfolio and go to the
github or straight to the github and
yeah they call this of course awful but
feel free to make comments and stuff
like that thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
