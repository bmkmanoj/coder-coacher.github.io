formally welcome you to the erlang
solutions monthly webinar like I said my
name is Martin militia on the EVP for
the AMIA region here at erlang solutions
and today's webinar is a continuation of
a series of webinars we have been
running across topics of interest in the
world of our line and the leaks here and
dealing with solutions based on these
languages and the beam in general
specifically today we will be talking
about the advent of smart phone
messaging and how it has rested control
over emerging markets with the creation
of things like whatsapp in 2009 now ever
since then messaging has grown in
popularity all over the world and places
like Latin America and Africa are no
exception to that particular rule so
today we will focus on the lesson that
tunnel has learned as a company in its
first 18 months of operating in Latin
America now as with any live event
please do excuse any technical issues
that we may face today I'll just briefly
tell you a bit about erlang solutions we
are a product and services orientated
company we are completely devoted to
like and the leaks here as languages we
work with organizations and individuals
using our line and licks here and we
help them support them and support
companies and like I said individuals
using these technologies we have offices
in London Stockholm Krakow Budapest and
San Francisco we work on projects all
over the world we develop aligned based
products and some of those you may have
heard of such as Mongoose I am our open
source messaging platform and wombat OEM
our monitoring and management technology
for Erlang and elixir systems now I'm
really pleased to say our speakers today
are carlos sierra the founder and CEO at
tunnel and nicola very day the mongoose
I am product owner at erlang solutions
we're deeply privileged to have both
Carlos and Nicola speaking at the web
and telling us a bit about tunnels
latest accomplishments and a bit of odd
Mongoose I am as well so please allow me
to finish by saying you're welcome to
pose questions throughout the duration
of the webinar just use the chat
facility on the webinars interface our
speakers Carlos and Nicola will answer
as many questions as possible at the end
of the webinar if any questions are
unanswered you're welcome to raised in
by email and you will have my email
address at the final slide of the
webinars presentation I would now like
to hand over to Carlos who will be glad
to start us off
okay thank you thank you I'm Laden for
for that kind introduction so welcome
everyone thank you again for joining us
at this webinar so we're gonna start
with an outline of what are we going to
be covering during the presentation so
um we're going to talk about the story
of Clara and address and you will be R
with me with this story and we're going
to try to explain what is it that makes
emerging markets different from most of
the developed world use users of
messaging also we're we're gonna start
digging a little bit more on the
challenges faced by businesses with
mobile first workers Clara and Andres
are the perfect definition of a mobile
first worker and we're going to go there
and try to explain what is it that we've
learned over the last few few months
also we will give you a presentation an
overview of what the tunnel does it's a
very niche very specific messaging
service for emerging markets
we will also tell you more about why did
we choose Mongoose I am to support or
backbone
later on we will we will talk more about
the product at Mongoose I am the product
and Nicholas will be joining us to give
us some larger explanation of how it
works so well so the story of Clara and
I so a tunnel we we really take user
centric design very seriously and we've
been observing the lives of thousands of
users and we've been observing hundreds
of companies in emerging markets and
have been able to shape our product
according to their needs and it's very
interesting to see how those needs are
very different from the needs of users
in most developed countries for
developed markets so the whole story
that I'm going to tell you happens in in
managing and met
is Columbia's third largest city it has
around 2.4 million people at this point
the picture you're seeing here the left
that the bottom left picture it's it's
one of the pictures of a very highly
populated area of managing where most of
the middle-income middle low income
families live and it's it's also
important to notice that 95% of the
population on meta-gene runs on prepaid
or on a pay-as-you-go model and that
makes it very different from some from
what we seen in other markets like the
US and other developed markets so again
managing the city you're seen here it's
one of the third largest cities in
Colombia and and it has huge amount of
its marketing users and just to give you
more details than that this graph tells
a different story of what really is
going going on in terms of what
messaging and what a smartphone adoption
is going through so the next two years
if you notice it's Martin penetration in
the regions in these two regions in
Latin American region and the developing
countries in general will look like
smartphone penetration in developed
countries it's going to be very similar
I mean it started only in 2012 it was
just 10% of the population and now it's
gonna in the next few years going to
turn out to be around 70% so the the
different the difference between these
two points in time 2012 and 2020 is that
most of the users in 2020 in these
markets this Latin American Caribbean or
developing markets are getting connected
for the first time so they know they
didn't have any other option to connect
the net and now they're using their
phones to connect for the first time so
that's a huge huge step in terms of how
they get empowered through the use of
smartphones so I'm gonna start tell you
more about Clara
and the woman here in the left is Clara
her name is Clara oh yeah she's a real
person she's she was open to to share
his story with us and she's 33 she was
born in meta-gene actually she got her
first smartphone in December 2015 and
the reason why she got it was because
she really felt this social pressure
friends using messaging and texting each
other through these chat apps or
messaging apps and she really felt that
she was getting behind so that's the
reason why she joined the smartphone
revolution so she's the mother of four
so she has four kids who Leon Camilo
John and Betty - she calls it Vito and
she's also married to undress and we're
gonna talk about androids later on and
well one important fact is that she's a
self-employed I'm and she pretty much
worked with different companies at the
same time actually she works with three
companies at least at this point in time
she worked for a born it's a direct
sales company that sells cosmetics and
and on those kind of products she also
sells a product called Herbalife it's
another product it's widely known
worldwide and also she works for a local
US direct sales company called noventa
so she considers herself to be a direct
sales intrapreneur so she's she's has a
lot of control over her time and she
pretty much knows exactly when to devote
time to selling the product and not the
nice or the interesting thing about this
as Clara is one of the 1.5 million women
in Colombia in this country who brings
additional income through her household
by selling products and services via the
catalog so that's that's a
to reality it's 1.5 million people in a
country like Colombia numbers are even
higher in other countries like Mexico
Peru Argentina and Brazil and that's
just to count the Latin American case
but finally her favorite apps are mobile
apps are one what's up and she loves
what's up second one it's been Columbia
app is her Columbia's largest bank which
has a huge online presence and a huge
digital presence and also tunnel and
we're going to talk about why why tunnel
is her favorite app he's or it's in the
list of their her three favorite apps
now we're going to move to undress and
embraces again it's Clara's husband he's
a 35mm he also lives in managing and
he's was born in managing he's a
smartphone user since December 2013 he
was early on a smartphone user pretty
much he is also an independent
professional
I mean he's affiliated and he works as
an independent professional affiliated
with Columbia's largest insurance
companies so he works for surah one of
the largest ones king he also works for
saguru does mundial another one local
one and for AXA it's also an
international conglomerate of
uninsurance business so he's not alone
in this job I mean he worked with other
35 drivers in marriage and he's a driver
and he works for these companies as a
truck driver to help ensure insured
people from these companies and he's a
well he's third one of the 35 in
managing but he's also one of the 650
650 drivers at the company these
companies employ along the whole the
whole country and he got he got his a
smartphone earlier than his wife because
his employer suggested him to have one
so there was like a requirement for him
so you better get a smartphone if you
want to keep your job and that was the
the reason that that he got a smartphone
barrier early on
so I'm gonna tell you bit more about how
smartphone messaging has changed the
lives of these two persons first Clara
and Andreas they really live a very
different reality when it comes to how
we use messaging and under daily daily
lives so but it's a very different
reality from what how we use personal to
personal messaging and the reason why
they do it is because for them messaging
it's all about saving money and saving
time and those have become to become the
main drivers of adoption of messaging
among them so they're part of a new
growing middle class of population in
countries like Colombia Brazil Mexico
again Argentina and also we're seeing
the same thing happening in Africa and
other countries and these are users were
getting connected for the first time and
and they're using the technology to work
feed their children and to save further
education so as I mentioned before they
completely leapfrog the PC laptop
generation so they they've never used or
at least they they're not very familiar
with the usage of laptops PCs even web
browsers and they're starting they
started to use messaging right from
their smartphones so that's that's a
huge desk that has huge implications in
terms of how they are accustomed to use
technology one interesting thing is that
whatsapp as we mentioned at the
beginning what seven others have created
a new set of communication habits that
companies like tahno and other companies
are using to enable new and very useful
use cases for these individuals and for
the companies that they work with and
finally as I mentioned also I think
we're really at China we really think
that Clara and Andreas are the best
definition of a mobile-first worker
that's that's a it's a very interesting
way of defining the mobile-first workers
so they just went out to be
become mobile users because they needed
to in order to sustain their families so
that's that's one point so I was I was
also interested in sharing with you or
observations about why is it that we
think that emerging markets are
different in terms of how messaging is
being used in these markets so as we
mentioned we were very user centric
design in terms of how we build a
product we're listening to our customers
every single day trying to get cues from
it from them and we learn some lesson so
the first one is it smartphone messaging
that's you my I basically conclude from
this it's pretty much the foundation
technology for these users were getting
connected for the first time so it's the
new platform for them it's it's we hear
a lot of news about how messaging is
taking over the world and how messaging
has taken over 10 years in developed
market but the reality in these markets
is that this is the only way for them to
connect this is the the most familiar
way for them to connect so it's very
quick it's it's convenient it's personal
it's alert based so it's very feels like
using SMS like services so they feel
important when someone or even a company
sends them a message and it's pretty
much mobile first
so messaging has become these
foundational technology that was that
that's one of the first observations
that we learned for the past few months
second is that it turns out that mobile
phones are the way that everyone
identifies themselves in these scenarios
and these are markets so it's it's it's
very interesting how how number
portability exists in most of these
markets that means that you can you get
to keep your phone number with you all
the time
independently of their operator that you
choose so that makes the phone numbers
the way for them to identify amongst
other people and and one thing that
we've also observed is that email usage
is incredibly low I mean people really
don't use email for anything
I mean it's unless there is something
that really requires them to they open
up some emails they keep forgetting
their passwords but messaging and phones
on the simplicity of using a messenger
that is associated with your phone helps
them and gives them a lot of control
over their digital lives and that's one
of the observations also that we've seen
third this is more of a market centric
observation it's that it turns out that
this winner-takes-all
message in messaging or that there's
going to be this notion that there's
going to be just one player that it's
going to take over the world
it's just going to be the king of a
messaging and everyone's going to have
to obey by the rules that's that's a
realization that's becoming harder to
achieve I mean we we don't see that
these users are just trusting just one
one option they're just trusting the
communication habit I mean they're
trusting the way that they're
communicating so that can be exploited
by many companies many of you here in
this webinar could be using messaging as
well to connect and to engage with your
users so so that's that's one thing and
button unless you're in China for
example where it really makes sense for
the government to have just one or a few
players can be easily controlled that's
another story but outside of China I
would I would argue that it would be
it's gonna be hard to achieve these
winner-takes-all in messaging space also
one thing that really helps companies
like tunnel on your companies this is
new access to the personal graph and and
push notifications and personal graph
and push notifications are completely
levelers they really level the playing
field for new players to innovate and to
have access to what others have had
I've had access before so again
winner-takes-all it's harder to achieve
or the Giants and it's that's a good
news for for small players like like
tunnel and many others for one thing
that we really are observing and we're
really hearing the companies that we
talk to all the time we speak to
companies as I mentioned every single
day it turns out that messaging is
quickly evolving from being a
convenience oriented service and that's
that's what we call the developed market
approach which is how people are using
messaging it's just a very a better way
to do it to do phone calls to do to do
SMS or or any other communication method
to a different type of approach with
that we call the necessity oriented
approach and that's we think that's the
emerging market approach people are not
using mething just because it's nicer in
emerging markets because it's cheaper
and saves them time and it's just the
way to go so I haven't come for a
comparison here between what what you
find in time in messengers like facebook
Messenger where you you might receive at
at some point during your interactions
while we a tunnel we were completely
focused on these utility rien value that
we provide to the companies and to the
users o companies have to pay for it
but they don't have to be exposed to ads
and things like that distractions like
that so that's that's point four and
point five just to finish up with with
the emerging markets difference is that
there is a new generation of consumers
we're opting for nice new message based
services like tahno and others and
they're now helping us draw a very clear
line between what's a personal messenger
and what's a professional messenger so
most of the users we talk to the really
want to connect with companies using
messaging as a format they really feel
like they they they should be using a
different tool besides their
personal messenger I mean they don't
want to use their personal messenger to
connect with the companies that they
work for they really mean that they
really feel like they need something
else and that's that's that's something
that we've really been focusing on and
building over the last few years and and
that's a final observation so let me go
through now the challenges that these
companies face I mean we're going to
talk about the sewer the company the
surahs the avons those companies were
down there we're operating in these
markets we're really feeling that they
need to connect with these mobile-first
workers but they really know don't know
how so I'm gonna I'm gonna give you some
some perspective on that so first most
of these companies feel like they've
been left behind when it comes to really
taking the advantage of using smartphone
messaging and and that's because most of
the attention that we see in the
messaging industry has shifted towards
person-to-person messaging and that's
what we hear every single day I mean
then the new feature that helps you
share more or accomplish something else
and help you become better communicate
but no one has really thought about how
to build something from day one thinking
about how companies can take advantage
of this trend this messaging trend and
that's something that we've been
listening in to the market second
existing businesses communication tools
really have not responded to the change
we're seen in user habits so when we
talk to these you research they tell
that they'd rather use messaging instead
of doing phone calls or emails or even
web chat that's we're nice for some
people who have computers or have access
to web browsers but they're not really
as useful when it comes to people who
only use phones and messing you on their
phones so companies are just starting to
wake up to these reality I mean they're
they have build infrastructure over the
last few years over the last decades
that it's centered around technologies
that no one else's is using and most of
you their users prefer not to use third
point is turns out that personal
messengers like the ones a we also we
all know we're not built for
communication and coordination between
these businesses and their extended
networks of users like the insurance
company with their network of providers
or assistance providers so and we're
talking about companies connecting with
people or with individuals who are not
even part of the organization so it's
not easy for them just to assign a new
email or assign a new Google account but
so they can have have a hangout
conversation because they have not
they're not inside the organization
they're outside the organization and
there are thousands of those out there
so there needs to be a tool that helps
them connect and what we also found is
that the current tools are available in
the market are somehow ineffective they
don't they don't really have business or
they have lack of a huge lack of
business control most of them create
distractions and some have ads and and
at the end some of them or most of them
don't align with what the needs of the
business are so we we found a woman
found is that there's no one single tool
to connect these businesses with their
networks of mobile first workers using
the way that they really want to
communicate and that's what we working
at tile so as I mentioned most of the
tools out there are personal but not
professional for these type of use case
so I'm going to briefly talk about
tunnel so we define ourselves as a
messaging service that helps companies
empower their mobile-first workers and
that's that's where really if their
motivation or day-to-day motivation and
in just in this week quick slide for
medium sized businesses we're a
professional solution that helps them
communicate and coordinate groups of
people even if they're not part of
another organization as I mentioned it
so it's a great way to scale an ottoman
many of those interactions that used to
be done through other channels like
phone calls and other traditional
channels and it's ideal for
communication with agents sales
representatives consultants brokers
intermediaries almond butter there are
many definitions of these intermediary
audiences that we target also tunnel is
a its assets offer service that really
helps these companies feel like they're
really getting to this digital
collaboration economy because they share
technology with their networks and they
can in exchange more and more
information more quickly and for the end
user it's a tunnel is a free tool it's a
free messenger that saves them time and
money that's very clear it's also a
mobile messenger that has no
distractions
there's no daily jokes there is no
family pictures from the weekend there
are no ads and it really helps them stay
ultra connected and focused with the
companies that they work with on a daily
basis and finally also it's a tool that
empowers them so when you talk to them
they they all feel empowered and that's
that for us it's just a realization of a
dream which is empowering more and more
of these individuals and we're talking
about billions of these individuals
around the world or getting to be
empowered for the first time so that's
that's that's part of our plan so how
does the product look like so this is
just a screenshot of the product it's
it's pretty much a web-based management
tool for companies that's where
companies can manage the interactions
with their end users we also have this
mobile client or mobile first client
which is an Android based application
and oil falls for an iOS application
that helps them engage with these
companies in very different ways and and
again it's it's it's being built with
company control at the center of
everything and that makes the mentor
very attractive for companies here you
can see a screen show of how your iOS
version looks and how our the other
androids
versions look like so finally this is
how Clara and Andres see their daily
messengers so if you notice that you
have a company called Herbalife they
have a company called novo benta they
also talk to other people in their
network other friends that are connected
as well but most of the conversations
that happen in these messages are really
professional so there they really feel
like they have the right tool for the
right job
so they use it right now the use tunnel
to place orders they solve customers
report inquiries they receive marketing
messages from the companies that they
work with and Android for example he
gets Sir Pervis updates and and reports
visit statuses and things like that so
it's a very interesting way for them to
to connect on our daily life we without
the need of a phone call or without an
EVO of a mess of a personal messenger to
connect to these companies so why are
companies subscribing to channel again
just a brief I think we mentioned this
before so we really feel like companies
really want to be in control we are not
an ad based we don't have an ad based
business model it's it's completely
utilitarian so companies pay for the
service they they pay more if they want
more and we we are really generous in
terms of how we keep companies an
entry-level version of tunnel free free
of charge so they can explore the usage
of these type of use cases so we we
don't have any distractions as I
mentioned it's a very professional
communication to a person versus a
personal communication tool and also we
have this flexible enough our full stack
solution what I mentioned full stack is
that everything is integrated I mean the
web client the mobile client are tightly
integrated and they could be connected
to the company's api's and data sources
and that makes it very unique and very
useful for them to to feel like they'd
have their own tool and what we're
seeing is that we're saying how Tonio
has become the preferred messenger of
choice for some industries and that's
where we're seeing
week after week so finally we we are
just really scratching the surface
tunnel we we think that at this point
we're very focused on making tunnel the
default messenger of choice for an
increasing number of industries and and
that's been a really interesting journey
we're really working towards that after
that we really have plans to build
really sophisticated a more complete
automation layer in top of tunnel so
that we can provide or customers or
subscription-based services that helps
us reinforce the value proposition for
companies its cost savings at speed but
it's using technology it's using AI to
help them achieve more with these
networks of individuals we're also going
after building internal as a platform
where companies can build their own apps
on top of it I just briefly showed you
how companies can build mini
applications on top of tunnel and you
can connect those two to their IT
systems so what we're doing is we're
really going deeper into how that could
be achieved and how can we open it up to
or in more companies so that's some of
the plans that we have so finally I'm
just gonna try to wrap up very very
quickly why is it that we're using
Mongoose I am out to support our
backbone so the first reason is it has a
great connection abstraction for mobile
and web users so it helps us implement
different types of communication flows
from person to person and business to
company its business the consumer I'm
sorry or business the person and
business to business messaging so we're
really into enabling those type of
interactions and Mongoose helps us
really achieve that so this is one of
those platforms have they had that has
lots of contributions and that for us
it's it really helps us to get that type
of help because he helps us reduce time
to market the features and all the
things that we've been working on so it
helps us I mean it has supports for the
ladies
standards such as under XE p such as
multi for groups and we just recently
launched groups which is a very
interesting feature which a group it's a
groups implementation where companies
are in control so imagine having your
your whatsapp but when we're someone
who's a master of the group which is a
company has every single right to own
that information and to manage all the
interactions and to manage the
permissions of the of the people inside
the group so that helps us implement
very easily a feature like groups so
it's anyway everyone knows it's based on
maturity I'll just like XMPP it's it
provides us it gives it a lot of
automated tools our automation tools
from sorry so we can deploy easier and
finally it's two things more easy to
scale it's it's it's open source which
is ideal for these type of projects we
can just play with it and and tweak it
if necessary and we have a great support
from the development community finally
how do we use Mongoose I am a tunnel so
we we have an implementation tunnel
where we have build custom extent
insurance using hooks XMPP hooks to
route messages from businesses and our
web client to send push notifications
for mobile users
we've also tweaked the Ireland code
custom code
they're basically a custom code so we
can add some very specific parts of the
of the we can solve some of the very
specific problems of the parts of the
problem that we're solving so the idea
as I mentioned here it's to support more
than the basic feature set that we have
available and we can expand more if you
want it to we you finally we use docker
to automate the deployment process and
it we've been so far super happy using
the platform and and we're really thank
thankful to the the team at Erlang to be
doing this huge effort to to contribute
to the
in this chair so we know further to do I
will now welcome Nicolas its Nicolas the
product owner of Mongoose it's the
person in charge of this at earning
solutions and just a reminder for
everyone we will have some time for Q&amp;amp;A
at the end of a Nicolas intervention so
Nicolas it's so that's I'm handing to
you thank you thank you very much Carlos
very clear good morning good afternoon
everyone
I'm gonna introduce you to the Mongoose
I'm very rapidly so what is Mongoose I'm
Mongoose I'm is a platform for companies
to build the applications that offer
conversational experiences to customers
if you can go to next slide please the
colors so we deliver Mongoose I am for
each scale the one just before exactly
thank you so we deliver to early-stage
companies starting with a 90 up to
unicorns so companies who have reached
the product market fit like tunnel are
really in the middle and we are able to
massively scale next slide so the main
features of the Mongoose and platform
rely on chat or messaging whatever you
name it so as Khalid said there is
interpersonal messaging that you can use
to build your chat application or your
application that that does something
else and to which you add a chat all so
what you have is features around groups
like Carlos was mentioning as well and
also we offer some pieces for social
networking still based on text but also
some media up into that we have some
features around voice one-to-one voice
all these contributes to your
application building so that you
increase your acquisition
your retention and your referral because
all those features attract people retain
them and make other people come into
your application next slide so on the
next slide I'm gonna detail the platform
the platform is made of several
components some of the components are
back in some of them are in the
front-end so in the middle you see
Mongo's I am the messaging and chat
server on top you see that there is two
ways to communicate with other persons
that's using the XMPP technology or the
wrist technology so in every
configuration we have libraries for you
so that they can be integrated quite
fast on your client-side application on
the left side of mongooseim we have load
testing infrastructure that is a
continuous load testing infrastructure
this allows us to measure the
performance impact of all the commits
all the pull requests that we have
either from within the team inside onyx
illusions or for contributions and down
you have warm bath helium that was
mentioned earlier bomb-laden the
monitoring and operations system and you
have also two demo applications that are
available on iOS and Android there are
very simple and very early stage full of
bugs but they are here as a technology
demonstration and code example and
finally on the bottom right corner there
is two additional back-end servers that
are available today
one is Mongoose ice that's the ice stern
intern server that allows you to offer
voice communications and also Mongoose
push which is a push notification server
next slide now that was very technical
now let's talk about the benefits all
the platform is massively flexible and
figure Abel you can choose whatever the
components you want to deploy and you
can deploy them whatever you want
so as kala says it's a mature and proven
technology and we test it even more so
the development as a result is very fast
and you can trust it as I was saying we
have we offer massive scalability thanks
to the L tank
and the next year languages and their
features their inner qualities but also
because we have architectures that scale
like you can deploy on single servers
you can deploy on clusters you can even
deploy on multiple data center that are
located across continents of course we
contribute to communities and an
ecosystem because we cannot live by our
own so we contribute to our land and a
communities obviously but also to iOS
and Android communities to the xsf an
XMPP community obviously and also in the
web community everything is extensible
as Carla said through the help of web
hooks and by developing Erlangen alex
here as i was saying it was widely
tested and deployed so it's not only
tested by automation but also it's
tested by real people by massive
deployments across the world and of
course it's open source and open
standards so you can deploy it right
away
next slide so a little word about the
roadmap
last year we mongoose name was a single
server we pivoted to a platform the
platform is as I was saying multiple
components so we started by offering a
REST API client libraries client
applications but also that
differentiator that is Mott light that
is a group chat that is compatible
totally compatible with the mobile
industry today and also but sub that is
a design pattern that allows you to do
social networks so this year we are
working still working on the 2.1 release
we have released beta 1 and beta 2 that
is already available and while still
continuing our effort onto the plan so
this is a string
turning of the platform as I was saying
we are offering now two new components
which are mongoose eyes four-voice
Mongoose push for pushing litigations we
have massively increased the quality of
the code and the documentation and the
tied CLT that is the time continuous
load testing platform is available for
testing every PR that you will submit to
us so what's coming next year is the 3.0
and we will be focusing on alera
enlarging the capacity of the platform
that will include IOT and chat bots so
don't get me wrong the platform is
already ready for IOT and chat bots but
we will increase that in that capacity
thanks to new features and also will be
delivering some significant tutorials
for you to integrate faster and coming
next please suggest what you need for
your business and that's it for me now
up to the questions next next slide I
promise and thank you Nicola I am pretty
sure that everyone on the webinar
thoroughly enjoyed this I am sorry to
say that we have just a few minutes left
for Q&amp;amp;A but I would still ask our
audience to post questions we will pose
the questions in answer sorry northern
English neighbor received and will try
and answer as many of them as you can so
let's start with the first question
without losing any time tell us when you
start in tunnel and you know it's come a
long way progress to where it is now can
you tell us a bit about the sheer energy
the time the investment needed to create
an application of this type and at this
level well what did it take and you know
how hard what to sort of get to get to
where you are now well that's a great
question
so thank you thank you for questions so
it's been a it's been a journey as I
mentioned it's it's been a journey where
we we bene
lucky to have a tremendous team behind
and we have one of the best people and
that I know
build in our technology and building a
platform that it's as I said very user
centric so we don't build a future we
don't move a single line of code without
really validating that our customers
really are dying for the future so it's
been a journey we've been working over
the last three and a half years on this
project we launched the project or
almost two years ago and now we're we're
seeing as Nicholas mentioned we're
seeing product market feeds so it's been
a team behind it's it's an effort of
team really and and it's it's with it
with the help of platforms like mangos
we've been able to achieve more with
less okay thank you for that I think
that answers the question oh I'll just
move straight on to the next question
and again even though it looks like we
can only answer a few we'll try and
answer as many as we can
so you you talked about you know the
territories that you're currently
focused on specifically South America do
you see the service advancing and
entering other markets after emerging
markets do you feel that the use case is
similar or that there is a market for
time oh yes I mean the the clear answer
is yes we were already seeing traction
in other markets where we have companies
interested in using product and pretty
much replicating what we've been able to
use or doing in emerging markets like
Colombia and Latin America so we really
think that Africa is one of those
markets where there is a huge
opportunity that the dynamics the market
dynamics are pretty pretty much very
similar to what we're seeing in Latin
America we have a huge percentage of
prepaid so people rather not people
rather use messaging instead of doing
phone calls and when it comes to
interacting with businesses it really
makes sense to use messaging we're Shane
lower
- adoptions in these markets but I think
it's just a matter of a time where we
will see as smartphones getting to a
point that we we saw in the picture in
one of these lights so I think Africa is
one of those Southeast Asia it's one of
those crazy markets in terms of how
people use messaging on a daily basis
and how they really want to go from use
a personal message using a personal
message to start using a professional
tool for the daily work so we really see
that there is opportunities in most
developing economies we really think
that the use case in developed markets
is a bit different people are more
connected we don't find these mobile
first users people are really connected
at the library at the office and at home
so that the use cases are different so I
think for now we will be focusing on
developing markets I think India it's
huge and there's some players who have
done inroads in that market already but
we think that there's a huge opportunity
for everyone then the tunnel seems to
have a very unique angle at looking at
things so you know I would think that's
very much a market for YouTube to
compete for there now just to move on
straight to the next question cause one
of our members of the audience Lauren is
specifically asking before you got to
where tunnel is today did you initially
set up an MVP and if so was it on the
same online platform or did used on
other staff great question we really
tested tons of things I mean we we had
the opportunity to go out there find
different options in the market and
after doing many experiments after going
through the whole process of setting
things up we found out that mangu Zion
was the right choice for us for a use
case so yes the answer is yes we did a
lot of research and also we did a lot of
experiments with these platforms and we
ended up using and goose as it was
because the reason
that I mentioned in one of the slides
which is it's a huge support and it has
a lot of information out there available
so you can start from scratch I would
know with no problems so let me just tie
into that with the next question which
I've indisputable for this you know we
ourselves and erlang solutions have done
a lot of work but what we're seeing is
that one of the biggest challenges in
messaging is scalability and how you
wait for unexpected volumes of traffic
that sort of tend to go up and down how
you scale up but then also scale down
and save resource so can I ask you your
own experience in terms of scaling your
technology yes so for us scaling is a
top priority right now we are we are
seeing an increase in the usage of the
product
one of the nice things about product
we're building is that we somehow we can
control that growth because we are the
ones who help the companies adopt the
product and invite or promote the usage
of tunnel messenger so it's it's a very
important subject for us and mongoose
has helped us think about scaling from
day one
so with us is jonathan from our team
who's in charge actually from all of his
killin team and who's currently helping
us grow from the number of XMPP servers
that we have today to the number that
really want to get to in the next few
months so if you have any additional
like very technical questions about
scaling I think Jonathan will we have to
help us thank you for that and thank you
for reminding me I should have said at
the beginning of the Q&amp;amp;A session that we
also have Jonathan Valenti on the
infrastructure at tunnel joining the Q&amp;amp;A
session from a more technical
perspective so ready and available to
answer any more
technically challenging correct
questions and the next one might be of
interest about yourself and Jonathan and
it concerns your current monitoring
infrastructure so what do you currently
use do monitor your service and you know
components such as Mongoose and so on
I would leave that question - Jonathan -
Jonathan if yours you're around it's I
think that's that's much better for
yourself right article yours - yes yep
yep yes so basically for the monitoring
we have a lobster third-party services
actually hitting our services URL so
basically we're able actually to know it
something is working or not
ori so up up and down and you also have
a cluster implemented in
cornets so it releases you for us to
actually know if a service is down or
needs to be scaled and we also actually
collect all the logs from all our
servers and we define rules to actually
know if that's something that we can
improve on performance or there is an
error that we that we must actually sold
like a hotfix or in a new feature so
it's actually kind of implemented in
several with several methods wonderful
thank you for that Jonathan now just to
try and honor all the questions that our
audience have asked and I do apologize
for questions did not have time to
answer we'll just move straight on to
the next one and Jonathan and Carlos
this might be one for you again one of
the members of audience is asking how
does a solution such as tunnel compared
to something like layer and I'm not sure
whether you've heard of layer but
Larry's website it's a reasonably well
known service as you've said you know a
lot of people are trying to sort of any
what what happens none with a unique
flavor so to speak and giving a certain
niche so how does your solution compare
with something like later that's a great
question
just the short answer to that is we're
an out-of-the-box full-stack solution so
we help companies who want to start
engaging with these mobile-first workers
start seeing results in just days so if
you have a company you want to go out
and try different things if you go to
deal with layer for example it's it's
great because it's very it's just
beautifully designed for those companies
who already have some sort of digital
assets like anna at the mobile app where
you want to integrate messaging with it
but in our case were not embedded within
companies apps we're a full stock
solution we're a universal messenger
it's a new tool that everyone needs to
start using so the implementation of
your companies takes just hours I mean
you go to a website you can activate
your company in just a few minutes and
right after that you can start using the
service from scratch I mean from from
day zero so there's no need to do
anything beyond just activating your
company and inviting your users but
that's a big big difference so we're
we're a full stock solution where
everything's ready to go from day one
while there are other options where you
can integrate messaging within your own
apps and do more very custom or very
particular things suited to your
business model or through your use case
thank you for that I think definitely
sort of underlines the distinction
between the two two models but speaking
of models another member of our audience
DBA specifically is basically saying you
know look we've talked about what's out
we've mentioned telegram and we've
talked about their business models now
can you tell us a bit about the tunnel
sure sure it's it's a
question as well so it's very simple
business model we have three plants we
have a it's a classical sass description
model so we have a free plan it's a free
plan it includes access to unlimited
number of users you have a limited
number of agents from your company you
also have the unlimited number of
conversations that you can manage or
handle within your company instance we
also have a pain plan and that's a it's
a plain plan everything all these
information is on websites channel comm
PW and Al calm on the pricing section
and this second plan allows companies to
do a bit more it gives them access to
metrics so they know exactly what's
going on with their channel this new
channel it gives them access to groups
for example they can manage now groups
and on a control way and also it gives
them access to broadcast services so if
you have these 200,000 users or 200
2,000 users out there you want to
broadcast information to them it's very
easy to do that from a painful and a
tunnel we also have a more sophisticated
plan that includes more features geared
towards automation where companies can
do even more with with with a platform
so it's a very simple pricing model free
Pro and enterprise and those are the
information is available on our website
thank you for that I think that answers
the question now I'm really sorry to say
because I really enjoyed the whole
session we have one minute left in the
webinar so I'll just use it to quickly
ask the final question from Humberto
Humberto is asking if we have a product
that's supporting voice but would like
to add instant messaging to this product
would you recommend Mongoose ion for
this particular use case so this is my
person forgets a question for Nicholas
maybe yeah yeah so we
yeah you need me to repeat the question
yes please I couldn't hear it that's
fine so comparator is asking if we have
a product that supports voice and if we
want to add instant messaging to this
product would you recommend this I am
for this use case yes definitely we have
seen many of our customers integrating
messaging across VoIP services and
definitely mangu Zayn is one of the
solutions of choice we have experience
around that also you can bridge XMPP
with protocols like SIP and thanks to
our REST API not only the client facing
REST API and also the back end facing
rais'd API you can integrate better into
your infrastructure excellent thank you
for that now I'm really sorry to say
we've already run over the allotted time
for the webinar so just briefly say that
I'm sure that everyone here will join me
in thanking Carlos Nicola and Jonathan
for a great talk and an even better Q&amp;amp;A
session
many thanks to everyone who has joined
us for the webinar as audience and
please join us again next month for our
following webinar now after today we
will send you a short survey just to
make sure we get your feedback on
today's webinar and please also note
that the recording of the webinar and
the presentation that were shared with
you today will also become available for
you to collect on online solutions
corporate website at www.petland.com now
thank you all very much once again and
we look forward to seeing you at our
next webinar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
