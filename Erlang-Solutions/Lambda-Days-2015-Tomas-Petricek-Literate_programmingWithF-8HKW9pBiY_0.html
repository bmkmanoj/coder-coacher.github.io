there is a shark in the title the slides
are actually partly written in a shark
so you'll see all that I've served but I
actually want to start just by talking
about literate programming as a surgical
general idea and I'll move the mouse
away so that you can see the picture in
the nice shape so I'll start by talking
about literate programming and then I'll
show you what has happened in the HR
community and how they the HR community
is using some of the ideas so let's look
I actually let me let me start by sort
of a historical perspective here so I
did some googling just before the talk
obviously and the idea of literate
programming first of all this is not
literate programming if you if you put
comments on your properties and the
comments say gets or sets the name of
the person and the class is named person
and the properties to name name that's
not very useful so if you're if you're
commenting your code like this that's
definitely off literate programming if
you're commenting your code in more
useful way that's still of literate
programming and the idea actually comes
from from Donald Knuth you can see he's
not very happy about the previous
example so what he was imagining in his
literate programming book was the idea
that you could sort of makes text and
program code to write something that you
can read as a human and what he says
here is let us change our traditional
attitudes to the construction of
programs instead of instructing the
computer
what to do we should concentrate on
making the human beings understanding
what the computer does and I think this
is really important idea because when
you're writing code the computer needs
to run it obviously but very often you
come to the code later and you again
need to understand what it does or in
the in the age of github you put your
 on github and people who want to
contribute to it have to understand what
it does so it's really kind of equally
important to explain what the program
does to humans as it is to explain this
to the computer and code had this system
called web if you look at the code
growth down there he actually says I
choose the name web partly because it
was one of the few three-letter words in
English that hadn't been applied to
computers
but you can you can see it's kind of old
idea so in bed what he was saying is
that he had this sort of format or
language where you could write documents
so you could put text in there and
format the text and you could also put
in some program and in this case the
document formatting was tech and the
programming language was POSCO so you
could combine these two and here's
here's a little example so what you can
see here is there's I think the at star
symbol at the beginning that's just sort
of denotes the beginning of a section
and it's some program to print primes
and then what's in the sort of slash
square brackets that's something that's
actually no just text but it's serve
comment for the program in there you
could use some some formatting and then
the program
this kind of interesting thing he
actually had the system where you could
name blocks or parts of the program and
then reconstruct the ball but this
saying here is that the whole program is
basically some call or the program print
crimes that sort of declaration in
Pascal then here's some constants and
then he says other constants of the
program in angle brackets and when we
generate the Pascal code it will insert
something from somewhere in the file in
that in that section and then there's
big game trains the first and prime
numbers which is again referring to some
other part of the program so it's kind
of interesting system if you if you look
at them if you actually go back to the
original idea which is what people think
about literate programming as just
writing comments they they actually miss
white not from the original
interesting interesting idea here so
what do we what can be doing a sharp in
a char we have sort of similar similar
similar thing although it's not really
implementing new idea so what I'll be
talking about is bit different but some
of the ideas are there as well you can
write code and because we are at low
forty forty years later and we are all
hipsters we write the text in mardow
logic rather than in my tech and
obviously we will not use Pascal movies
a sharp instead so you can write the
code as sort of mix of markdown and
f-sharp and then can be various things
with it you can sort of focus on the
f-sharp
good and in a chart when you when you
have it you can run it in XR interactive
so you can edit the code run it
immediately see what it does or you can
just use this with HR projects and then
you'll end up with something that you
can compile and run or we can look at
the markdown part of this and in in
markdown we can do a couple of things
with it
one is there's this recent project
called FS reveal which lets you generate
slides from later attach our programs so
this slide is actually written in a
sharp and it's generated and it's using
revealed ojs to show that show just show
the slides
there's tool that every that was showing
earlier when she talked about science
which is this FS lab journal and that's
what you take your literate programs and
it produces a science scientific report
their way and the last box talks about
documentation so you can also use these
tools to generate some sort of
documentation and this is actually doing
something different than just XML
comments so I'll say a few more things
about that later on so let's see what we
have here the the slides as I said I'm
using here that's actually written in a
charm there's a couple of nice things
you get from the FS reveal tool so
obviously you can embed a charm snippets
you can actually embed snippets in other
languages and it will colorize them the
nice thing here is that with a chart we
also get tooltips so if I look at concat
it's a function that takes a string
which is a separator then it takes
sequence of strings you concatenate and
it gives me a single string so the
snippet here is a fancy version of of
hello world with the vibe operator we
take a sequence of strings
the print the result but also it can
embed the result so if I if I jump back
to my editor which is here
well actually I like move just explain
what's happening here there's like some
piece of code at the beginning which is
saying here's the title and description
of the presentation I can change the
theme I can add some fancy 3d
transitions which I disabled and here
I'm just writing so I'm mixing my crown
with some embedded HTML because we don't
have marked out for everything but if I
so on which side am I literate slides
with FS reveal there we are so this is
the slide that I'm showing currently if
I change it to hello croco and save it
there's there's another another thing
that's running in the background in the
window here so there's like a belt strip
for your slides that keeps running in
the background and if I switch back and
refresh this then it says hello crack
off in the source code but also you can
see it updated the output so I didn't
just I didn't have to write the output
manually it has this service that the
literate program not just invested the
text there but it also runs it and lets
me about the status here's a--here's us
like a more interesting example because
embedding embedding text output is I'm
sure Knut would like that but we're a
couple of years later so we need to add
the charts as well there's a question
yes yes um so the question is in the
code and I have this define output hello
so what does this actually mean I'll
talk more about this later but we sort
of have some special syntax that you can
use to tell the tool how to deal with
things so here I have this define output
which says capture the output of the
snippet and then later on I have include
output which will print the output there
so the next thing I have here is
inventing charts and here I'm using the
World Bank type provider so I say World
Bank and then I access country's Czech
Republic and European Union and then I'm
creating a chart that contains how many
people go to universities in Czech
Republic and in the you this is
motivated by some Czech politicians who
said that there's too many people in
Czech Republic who go to universities
and we need to fix that and actually it
turns out that so here European Union is
blue it turns out that there's sort of
in the recent years where close to the
average of the EU so I've stuff like too
many people go to universities and again
this chart is generated automatically
and FS reveal runs the cult and embeds
the chart that's exactly the thing I
wanted to show you so can we see the
stats for Poland the question is what's
used for charting it's using the F sharp
charting library which is reasonably
reasonably nice charting library it
doesn't work I think this is like one of
the that's that's one thing in a chart
that doesn't work on on
because the library isn't available
there ten sharp words I'm not just fine
but the charting library doesn't and
there's a couple of work-in-progress
libraries that produce like use google
charts or something like that so let's
see how Poland is doing here the type
provider for those who haven't haven't
seen any a shark before haven't been to
any of the talks I think all of them
mentioned PI providers but what's
happening here is that the World Bank
type provider actually connects to the
to the World Bank and it gets the list
of countries and then it generates this
type which has all the countries as
properties so Poland is still still here
that's good
yes Ukraine is here as well
Scotland isn't they're not yet maybe we
should include Scotland as an optional
value but I can get the indicators of
Poland and then I'm actually just going
to add Poland as another as another
country here so that's Poland what color
am I am I not using white I can only do
one so I'll use white and then I saved
the file you can see here it's service
triggers the update which we runs the
code and then now we have Poland so
Colin politics overeducated and I can go
back to my code it doesn't fit anymore
so I would have to I don't know write
some helper function to make a fit but I
guess the nice thing here is that you
don't have to create the chart do some
screenshots and cut it and paste it back
in PowerPoint and then you change
something
doesn't work anymore so this is this is
using the idea of literate programming
but for one sort of fairly fairly
specific task for just building slides
so I think if you've seen how this works
what is actually behind this there's a
couple of couple of things that happened
in the HR community and if you if you
haven't seen anything about HR them I
think one of the really nice things in
the HR world is that there's really
active community that's quite excited
about I've sharp and there's lots of
things to lots of people doing really
interesting things so I think there's
this how many people here come from the
C sharp world or have done some C sharp
before quite quite lot I think there's
one III just do C sharp and C sharp is a
fine language and one thing I but one
thing I certify found interesting is
that when people didn't like something
about C sharp everyone was like ah
Microsoft should fix this and this
really changes when we come to the HR
community where when people don't like
things they just fix it and f sharp is
open source and it can actually
contribute to all the standard to Linux
but there's also great number of
additional live ways that people have
built to solve some problems they had
and so this actually is this slide that
is probably the most technologically
advanced slide deck of the conference
but it's using what it's using lots of
lots of interesting libraries so f sharp
4matic is one library for doing the for
parsing the F sharp curve and formatting
the coast event it's also using the F
sharp compiler service which is
basically a Doppler DLL that contains
everything that the HR compiler
and this gives you access to the SR
interrupts so you can tell the surveys I
thought you made a sex tape it and give
me the output which is used for the
chart and I think it also gives you
access to all the editor tools so if I
actually go back to my F sharp code
snippet somewhere where's my sharp code
snippet here's like shut closed lips
then like here I get I get routed this
is exactly the same text you you can see
in visual studio or in summer in studio
while some are in studio formats it
better but it's the same it's the same
source because they're all using the
same underlying library to access the
data and that which to take this
literate script that I was showing here
before and it does some interesting
transformations on it so it looks for
these horizontal lines like the best
days - and it also looks for these ones
to indicate section beginnings and
section ends so it parses the script and
then it splits it into sections and
generates generate HTML with some really
as specific tags the question is is
number of stars of the - is important no
you don't have to have exactly 80 I
think that it's just ordinary markdown
really so in markdown I think you need
to have three or more and then it's a
horizontal line and then I was also
referencing as I slop which is this data
science library for F sharp which gives
me access to the charts and the type
providers and so on and finally if I
switch to the console there's fake which
is f sharp make it's not a fake library
in fact
ready real real library with something
like three thousand comments on github
and over hundreds of over hundreds of
contributors and it's pretty amazing
library for doing sort of build
automation many of the many of the
extract libraries use this but it's not
exile specific I think it happens is it
for some things as well and it gives you
things like built everything using a
mess belt run all the tests generate
documentation built NuGet package
push the new get package to do get
become fake thus automatically retry
this because new get comments always
down so it sort of solves all the
problems you have quick bills it's also
using this slave project which is a
lightweight web server so if I find my
navigation bar here it says local host
because it's hosted by by the web server
one thing I didn't put in the slide is
packet which is another really nice
library that happened in the excerpt
community recently packet lets you get
get references from look at but it
doesn't create the whole crazy thing
that that new game gives you sort of out
of the box so it simplifies the
references basically but it also lets
you reference like individual files from
github which is sometimes nice if you're
referencing something really simple and
don't want to have like ten megabytes of
references or one hundred megabytes so
there's lots of things that have been
happening in the SR community and this
is sort of putting most of them together
and the other thing I'm using here or if
I go back to the literate programming
idea then the extra formatting library
actually lets you do this in two
different ways if I what I was showing
before in Visual Studio
that was an ordinary f-sharp sprint and
that's that's one mode so that you can
use where you really just write an
ordinary a shark script and all your
code is just a shark
it has fsx extension and the visual
studio and all the other editors
understand this and then you can use
these like open parentheses star star
comments which is just special trick
because open parentheses star is normal
after comment so we need to somehow
recognize these special blocks so if you
have two stars you can put mark down in
the comment and it will be turned into
HTML and then we have a few tricks start
comments like define output or include
output that are used for controlling how
the evaluation and the formatting works
so this is sort of the mode where your
program is a valid as sharp code and the
nice thing about this is that you can
just open your code in any F sharp
editor the editor will understand it it
will ignore all the special comments but
when you're when you're typing the code
like I was doing here I can actually do
dot and see all the indicators so I
guess the main reason or the main thing
why you would use this style is that you
actually can use any normal excerpt
editor the other option is that you can
write markdown and just have special F
sharp blocks in it so again this would
be mark the FS ruby library can deal
with this as well you just write mark on
github all will show it nicely on the on
the page and then you have specialized
sharp blocks and I press reveal will
pick these format the code
and it can run the code as well so I
think there's there's definitely sort of
more that could be done here to make to
make Donald clean happy because what he
had in the original web system was
really it wasn't Pascal it wasn't like
that it was something that had
properties for both of the languages and
I think one thing we could do for
f-sharp in the future would be to have
something like this where you could
actually either use something that's
marked on base but the codecs our
compiler actually would understand it
and it's actually not too hard yeah so
the suggestion is to use the f-sharp in
F sharp you can say this which is just
like special variable name when you put
double backticks you can put anything in
there but so you could you could misuse
that in some interesting ways I think
there's actually the XR compiler is open
source and I think sort of parsing for
markdown wouldn't be too hard so yeah I
think we can we can probably do
something that's closer to what Donald
Knuth had in mind when he was talking
about literate programming all right so
when I was I was recovering from my
addiction to PowerPoint I and I started
writing all my slides in in markdown
that was that was really nice but most
thing that you don't get in markdown
format is that you don't really get the
defensive smart art things from
PowerPoint we can create like diagram
so I thought I should get some bad ones
because diagrams are fun and if you're
an excerpt programmer and you have a
problem then you create a domain
specific language for inner sharp so I
wrote this little language for creating
diagrams so this is actually the code
for the previous diagram and I'll show
this in the know describe what's
happening here and then I'll show it in
the editor so what's happening here is
that if you look at the lines eight to
twelve that's just saying create a
horizontal split with three things in it
one two three which are different colors
and then the make box function creates
rounded rectangle and puts the text over
the rounded rectangle so if I find fun
change it to diagrams are boring then on
as well again trigger to trigger the
runner and when the finishes I get a new
diagram the language itself I'm not
going to talk about everything here but
I guess the idea is actually really
simple because we have this graphic
style which says a graphics is either
empty or it's a rectangle or a rounded
rectangle or an ellipse or text so
that's the basic building blocks and
then we can put margin around them
or we can put multiple things over over
like render them all in the same area or
we can split the space that we have into
multiple parts and then you can also set
the fill color and the alignment for
text so this is this is really all I
used here it's also all I used in the
previous diagram which was
like markdown to PDF or markdown to HR
so so far I was I was really only
talking about the but basically this was
this was talk about how I did my flight
but I have a few other things to say so
one library that's using similar tools s
FS Lazaro and I'm actually going to show
you how you can do this if you're you
can you can install this SS lab journal
template for visual studio so I'm going
to create a new one put it in c10 I
think FS lecture 34 is a great way for
my project you can see I was debugging
my installer that's why I have 33
previous versions so when you create
this it will create a template and it
also installs the new get packages for
doing data science with a chart it asks
me about some security things yeah sure
enable it's basically asking whether it
should run the type providers and then
when you're when you're done I'm going
to delete the default sample because
that one is boring and then I can add
one more there's a couple of samples to
sort of teach you what you can do with
this and this one is interesting because
it's also using the r type provider o
some air
i think i okay let me restart visual
studio the reason why i had to restart
visual studio is that visual studio then
it closed the PI provider it loads it
from like one directory and when you
then have a new project that loves the
ty provider from some other directory
it breaks something so I get a sharp
script where I can just run the run the
runnable at sharp snippets
mikesh loads to load the library and
then what this is doing is that it's
again using the World Bank and it gets
the depth for all the all the countries
in in euro area so we get all the
countries for all the debts for all the
countries and you can see I'm actually
using the diesel I'm pay for working
with data frames and this automatically
aligns things and treats it lets me deal
with missing data as well so here for
Latvia they don't have data for this
part so I get this data frame with the
data and then I'll let me do one more
thing here this is just picking the one
with the highest depth then I'm doing
some linear algebra I woke my chart this
is showing the the depth for a couple of
countries so I can just write code in my
script file and comment it with with
comments and if I run this then it will
it will start sort of close all
application we will make this sort of a
background background process in the
next version so at the moment this takes
sort of quite a lot of time because it
actually needs to reference all the
libraries again question so what this
what is actually what is actually
dealing with these define output that's
happening in Excel formatting so that's
our formatting with this and it exposes
some SD with all these special
information ok so I run this the console
are finished and then I have this nice
HTML file here which shows all the
current events with tooltips
it also can
and better that they have frame as a
table so I get some nice view of the
table I can put in lytec equations and
so on it's integrated with the math good
math library for doing numerical
calculations so I think here I'm just
calculating some correlations or maybe
I'm just doing something random to show
how this works but you get lifes
formatting further matrices as well and
beneth charts and this is what
everything I was showing earlier it also
integrates with the r-type provider so
you can call our from f-sharp and it
nicely embeds the outputs so this is one
of the one of the nice uses of the
literate programming idea the other one
that many people in the HR community are
using is for writing documentation so I
think this is this is example for the
documentation for the World Bank type
provider and if I think I can actually
click on this oh yes so now I'm like on
the page and they the pattern here is
that many of the F sharp libraries they
give you the usual XML comments and
that's sort of useful sometimes if you
have like library with lots of functions
but what's generally more useful is to
have a tutorial so this is the World
Bank tie provider and the page says
here's a code sample this is for the das
and there's some description or if I go
to another type provider like the CSV
type provider that one has lots of
options somewhere so you can put in
lists so it's really just a tutorial the
problem with writing tutorials for your
libraries is that they really quickly
get out there
you write the tutorial put it on your
blog and then you change the library and
then you change the library again and
someone goes to your tutorial and
nothing works so I'm going to go to one
example here and this is a tutorial for
the 4d dido library for doing time
series and the frame manipulations and
the nice thing here is that we can just
run all the code so I can run all the
code here in excerpt interruptive I
think there's some charts as well this
is doing something like getting some
financial data and comparing how long
Facebook exists on the stock exchange
that's the yellow bed and how long
Microsoft exists or something so you can
see Facebook is obviously very young but
the key thing here is I can when I'm
writing when I'm writing documentation
like I'm a programmer I don't want to
write documentation right I just want to
write code and here I can write the code
and then I have to write some comments
which um I can deal with if it's in my
favorite editor and let's just comment
so it makes this the writing of the
documentation actually reasonably
friendly and you don't have to like open
Word or Emacs to write like that you can
just do it in the same process that you
use when running and writing code so I
here I'm just I'm using the D library as
an example and there's also a script as
part of this that actually builds the
documentation so if I run build
documentation that goes over all the
same
but all the scripts and turns them into
into documentation so I think I have it
open here
that's the documentation ires ires
editing if I go back to the
documentation and do some silly change
I'm just going to write a function our
world and then I go back and update my
documentation then it figures figures
out that only one script has changed it
gets does all the formatting think this
is taking longer because it's also
running all the snippets and there's
some depth alerts to the internet but
then I get it in my documentation again
with tooltips so that's how you would
write documentation using this the nice
thing here is that it's not just like
running the thing but and there's a
there's a template called project
scaffold that gives you all of this out
of the box what you get from there as
well
is there's some unit tests for the
library and when you make a change to
the documentation that wouldn't compile
your tests will fail so if you change
something in your library but don't
update the documentation to reflect the
change then you will not be able to
release your library because unit tests
will take and that's really useful
because you know that your your
documentation is always up to date with
with with respect to what your library
does so projects scaffold is another
thing you can use it's sort of template
for creating dotnet projects
it works with c-sharp as well and it
gives you a couple of the tools like
fate for doing the
say the simple built automation with
nougat really says and it also gives you
this failing unit tests for
documentation and the documentation
tools together with sort of automatic
publicly publication of the
documentation so if I built the library
it will generate these Docs and it will
push this to the gh-pages branch on
github so it's perfect if you're using
something that's open source you can
change it as well it's just the template
to do whatever you want with the dots
like copied somewhere and an internal
FTP all right so to summarize I think
there's if I I go back to what Donald
Knuth was doing I think what I was
showing here is not really the same
thing because I use the literate style
of programming more for scripts like
doing the well I think there's there's
two areas where this works really really
well if you're doing some data science
or some data analytics it's really easy
to produce records of what you're doing
if you're writing any calculations that
someone else should understand then this
is really the the best way to document
your process and I also use this folder
for the walkthroughs in documentation
which works really well as well and
obviously as you can see from my slides
it works where it's really nicely for
building slide decks how can we do
something like what Donald Knuth was
doing with his back systems for sort of
building the whole complex software
using literate programming I think
that's film an interesting problem so if
you want to learn more about this Allah
I'll clean up the slides and post them
somewhere so you can follow me on
Twitter there's also a couple of links
if you're interested in more F sharp
to f-sharp that org and we also have
this f-sharp
Works company that's me as a couple of
other f-sharp people so if you want to
use that chart and need some help
getting started then let us know and
finally thanks to Carl came who did the
FS reveal project that basically I was
talking about or I was using in the
whole thanks we choose this F sharp
program so the question is yeah you can
yeah I don't have to repeat that because
everyone hear the question questions
first
I think this so I use that further for
the journals and the notebooks and for
the documentation so many of the
libraries that use this for
documentation are real-world libraries
the D the library that I was editing
here that's actually used by and it's
sort of funded and developed by Blue
Mountain capital which is a hedge fund
in New York if someone uses it sort of
internally for some like internal
reports I don't really know I think like
putting the libraries together that's
fairly recent thing that we did so I'm
not I'm not sure if there's anyone who
sort of build something on top of this
and they use it as like internal
reporting
oh yeah there's there's there's there's
ss blog project which people use for
blogging and that uses the same tools so
it's it's used by quite a few people for
for various things I'm not sure I
haven't managed to sell it to anyone yet
so no nobody's that's true but I think
we actually we actually talked with
bluemountain about using that for some
of their internal scripts where they do
some data analysis which produces
reports that they send around by emails
so turning that to you something like
this was was really interesting option
for them but I'm not rating if they did
it already or not yet can we invert a
shark interaction previously reported at
the stars well it's open source and this
would be an interesting project it would
actually be really really easy because F
sharp interactive is available just as
as the DLL and I suppose you would have
to do some like server client
communication that would call it sharp
interrupt it and then print the results
but I like this idea what's it what's
your github ID
this will assign it to you after perfect
Oh is there a d3 integration so I
haven't used III here there's I think
there's like all the other tools that
you need to make it happen are there
because there's spawn scripts which
translates F sharp to JavaScript and it
has this mechanism for referencing
JavaScript libraries so I've used
something like that we're doing like
WebGL with F sharp and the same trick
would work for doing d3 without sharp so
that's another that's another work that
we have the do you mean the diapers or
if I had interacted p3 in the slides
what would happen I don't know do we
have some JavaScript experts in the room
and it's using reveal its using rebuild
of Jas so I think radio table chairs
works with v3 the the arrows only sword
is capture I think keyboard like error
but I can still click anywhere and yeah
do whatever I want thank you
sorry oh yeah there's a there's a lesson
of rec work but we also have stickers
let's see I closed this I go back to my
source code there's my sample why could
so this is all run using fake so if I go
back here and open my fake bill scraped
then it gets stuck I think it will run
I'm kind of curious them yeah oh I'm
sure you can do that running generate
that start
look there start webserver I can run
this I'm sure this will fail miserably
start back sticker oh yeah because I
already have this one running that's
easy to fix
now this one is killed ah there it is no
no no this rose oil oh yeah no I started
it from the record I would have to sort
of inline it in the rebel but it's
definitely doable we can do everything
that Scala people
if we have tight providers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
