executive director of the skeleton tour
at EPFL I'm also a subtle kind of
professor Northeastern University at
Boston and I have to start my talk by
apologizing for not not physically being
here I got really sick just before the
concert started I don't know what's
going on here it's always like everybody
got sick and it's like a ridiculous flu
and yeah so I don't know if you guys
have this going on at polar but it
somehow crazy here so I'm really sorry
that this happens right right before my
flight basically but anyway to the to
the main point of my talk to the bay
topic I'd like to talk about what what
myself and many others are beginning to
observe in the open source world and
it's sort of shocking and nobody nobody
really sees these things these changes
yet and there was a several very nice
articles recently which has highlighted
some of these these shifts in open
source and I'd like to share some of
these with you and also to show kind of
what we're trying to do in in the
scholar world to deal with some of these
challenges so the title of my talk is
the dramatic consequences of the open
source revolution unrecognized
challenges and some modest attempts at
solutions it's Skala so if you learn
anything today I want you to learn that
the trends that we're experiencing it
open source has have really changed
compared to what you might think or sort
of be familiar with about open source
that's super important so let's start
with a riddle um what what what does
this have to do with Scala or forget
about Scala what does this have to do
with your favorite open source
programming language or framework or
whatever or what about this this is a
this is a zebra crossing or a crosswalk
that we'd say the Larrick in English
this is a sidewalk these are what does
this have to do with our software or
okay maybe this is slightly slightly
more obvious what this might have to do
with open source software I don't know
any ideas
these are all examples of common shared
physical infrastructure anybody could
use these things and they end up being
pretty central to our lives without
these things without a sidewalk without
a crosswalk without a bridge we can't go
to work we can't take our kids to school
these are things that we have everyday
around us that our government provides
to us and that we don't really give a
lot of second thought to and as sort of
we have something else that sorts
parallel to this in the digital world we
have some kind of digital infrastructure
there exists a digital infrastructure
and the digital infrastructure I would
argue is open-source software so I mean
just think of some piece of open-source
software that you take for granted that
you use all day every day you can you
can draw a parallel with with things
like sidewalks or other physical
infrastructure that you depend on and I
just want to point out that through
throughout this talk I'm going to what I
want to talk about open source I'm going
to refer to open source of sloths maybe
it's not a super sexy a curative but
it's it's a little bit more correct
because it means not just open source
but it also means free slash Libre
software and open source it kind of
refers to either of them
indiscriminately so it's kind of the
correct a credit to you so I'm going to
be sake floss all the time just so you
know what I mean so anyway just like
anyone to use a bridge or a sidewalk
anyone could use floss and projects
whose source code is open and which has
pervasive enough licenses you know can
kid that allows people to freely reuse
and remix software these things are
digital infrastructure and there's a lot
of digital infrastructure out there that
you probably work with or use and we
could use this stuff to build software
that we directly profit off of or softer
that otherwise helps our day-to-day
lives or businesses it just kind of gets
us through our our jobs basically but if
we go back to physical infrastructure
what happens with with your driving
around on the road did you see this so
if a road is by physical infrastructure
and there's suddenly a big ridiculous
whole little road that's going to break
my car what we do about that well
typically what you do when you have
broken infrastructure
in the physical world you have some way
of contacting whoever's responsible for
that infrastructure currently it's it's
a trendy to use some kind of reporting
app every every big city of the u.s.
seems to have these several European
cities they exist as well I don't know
if Krakow has one of these they report a
problem with infrastructure apps but
they're pretty common elsewhere so what
happens is you have a citizens that
absorb observe you know said pothole
they call the local government or they
use this Avenue like hey guys fix this
pothole it's a problem and then
eventually the government will get
around to fixing it you give some
information about where it is you said
it phono added sub sub crew a week later
we'll covered patch that pothole that's
how generally things work in the the
physical world but what do you do when
this happens to your digital
infrastructure digital infrastructure is
fundamentally distributed we don't have
any kind of central government you can't
go to some government you can't go to
let the Toronto government it'd be like
hey guys you know spark broke today
could you guys fix it it's our whole
business depends on it like that would
be crazy right it's sort of
fundamentally a different structure so
this so that you know what I hope you
notice here is that we depend on a lot
of digital infrastructure and our jobs
but the single infrastructure that we
depend on it has no way to be fixed if
there's the issue because things are so
decentralized either you fix it yourself
at a local for Greece and then for a fix
back but you can't just complain to
somebody and say hey look by tax dollars
we pay taxes so fix this you know
everybody's kind of got to take care of
themselves it's sort of sort of
different but yet the same time we need
this stuff quite quite a lot because the
board more important so this is business
in general probably the first I don't
know 60% of this talk 70% of this talk
is going to be about floss so just I'd
really like to show you some of these
treads because they're really important
especially if you're writing a business
that's depending on some kind of open
source software these are things that
you should be aware are happening
because they could drastically affect
how you know how things things that you
depend on change or if there's a problem
or whatever these things are these are
these are important trends to be aware
of
Georgianna but a conductor scholar and
show you how we're trying to do some
things you know being aware of these
treads to sort of fix some of these
problems and I'd like to quickly point
out that there were several people's
writing blogs which served as sources
for this talk so before I get started
with some of the interesting insights
that I found I'd like to give a shout
out to Nadia eggball in particular who
wrote this wonderful report called roads
and bridges the unseen labor behind our
digital infrastructure this was
published last year in July July 2016
and it was funded by the Ford Foundation
which is a not-for-profit organization
that she basically went around had
collected lots of data got lots of
materials for open-source developers a
coffee still depending on open source
and there's lots of exciting and
interesting things that came out of this
study so and then finally I have to give
a shout out to Peter him kids who wrote
this wonderful book called social
architecture which we are using in Scala
universe to try add you know improve
sort of the community aspects of our of
our open source sort of world so anyway
I found Betty references that you're
going to see if this talk at da DEA's
excellent report and anything that I've
gotten from somewhere else I will cited
line just so you could visit it later if
you're interested
okay so observation number one everybody
is jumping on the floss bed wagon I hope
that this is not a contentious statement
to any more and I can I can back that
statement up there's a company called
Black Duck I'm not sure if you've heard
of this but they're they're known for
running a popular survey of open source
software at companies you know relative
to open source software basically so
they run this ad you'll survey asking
companies about their open source use
and they also are you know a pretty
important reference point because
they've been doing this for about ten
years they've been collecting data for a
long time and if you look at the two
last surveys that they've they've
released
they go to lots of copies in 2015 I
talked to thirteen hundred and thirteen
companies and in 2015 they talked to
twelve hundred and forty companies and
what's what's you know really important
to note is that 78% of these companies
said that they run on open-source okay
what does that mean I'm not sure exactly
what reading an open source means but
the interpretation is that many of their
their software projects depend very very
strongly on some kind of open source
software so they're building on top of
open source software open source
infrastructure and what's super
important about this is like I said this
is a company who's been writing a survey
for 10 years if you go five six years
back this is up to tides over what it
was a 2010 to a 2010 people only 39% of
companies that they've surveyed so that
they ran on open source software at all
now that's up to 78% that's a massive
increase of companies who will openly
admit that they run their stuff on open
source software so that's a big deal
the the bottom line insight here is
basically that companies are depending
bored more on fluff more than they did
before
so this survey also included I mean
there's this survey was of course not
you know not just what question there
was many questions so I've selected a
few key points that are that are
interesting so in 2016 the top three
reasons that these 1,300 companies said
that they used floss was in this order
the top three ranked reasons the quality
of the solutions were the highest the
point here is that the quality of some
piece of open-source software was higher
that if they try to develop an
equivalent piece of software in-house or
they tried to pay for some proprietary
thing so this is pretty interesting to
note right because sometimes there's a
little bit more of like a disrespectful
view of open source you know it's maybe
more of a best form of bizarre it's
better to pay for something that a
company develops but in this case 78% of
these
these who said that they wrote our open
source software collectively said the
most important reason why they did this
is because the quality of that software
was the highest and kind of in step with
that point is the second reason which is
competitive features and technical
capabilities so this open to our
software it had features that you know
were proponent if right sort of in line
with the quality at third like the third
reason which some people often think is
the first reason so they would use an
open source project the third reason is
access the ability to customize it fix
it so you seal the source is open you
can change some problematic part of this
library or framework or whatever you're
using and you know while I just continue
with your life right you can you know
either send it back upstream to the open
source project or just use your fourth
version locally and that's unblocked you
as a company you don't have to make a
bug report to some company like
Microsoft and hope that they're going to
eventually you know merge this chair fix
this bug and then send it back to you
right okay and finally a 56% of
companies consider Floss options before
they even look at a proprietary solution
so that's in 2015 so the survey showed
that a majority a large majority of
companies don't even look at proprietary
software they just go for a floss open
source whatever software first like they
you know oh we need a database they
don't even look at any company that does
proprietary databases they just
immediately will go to the open source
stuff that exists first and if they
can't find something there then maybe
they'll consider a proprietary choice so
that's that's a big deal and that's a
big deal because what it means is that
that open source finally won right I
mean not so many years ago five ten
years ago it was still a battle whether
it opens forest was was worthwhile or
whether you know provide to our software
is going to continue dominating right so
here we have thirteen hundred companies
and fifty-six percent of them consider
open source before they consider
proprietary software that's that's a
that's a big point
okay so there's another another data
point so unrelated
to this survey that was done by this
company that I just discussed there is a
ocular ad venture capitalist a mark
sister and he's you know what of what
everybody but I have a blog article here
where he was talking about a lot about
why flosses is a good idea if you're a
startup why why you should care about
sloths
so I'm just going to read two quotes to
you really quickly in 2011 you know as
of the venture capitalist he was giving
advice to people right starting startups
and he wrote it when I built my first
company in 1980 died it cost two point
five million dollars in infrastructure
just to get started and another two
point five billion indeed costs to code
launch bench market and sell our
software so in 1980 dag you needed
basically five billion dollars half of
which was spent on infrastructure the
other half of which was all of the work
of coding logic managing and marketing
and selling the software however he says
open-source became a movement mentality
severly infrastructure software was
nearly free so now we pay 10% of the
normal cost for the software and that
money which for software support because
they don't have to pay for the actual
software anywhere the software is free
so they pay ten percent of what they
paid before so it does take 2.5 million
they pay 250,000 and instead they get
support for that open source software
which is significantly cheaper right and
he argues that a 90 percent disruption
it cost spas innovation so basically
things became only only ten percent of
the price in 2011 that they were in 1999
so he argues that you know open source
is causing disruption in the world of
tech startups another another famous
entrepreneur is marked trigger of the
co-founder of Instagram that he has a
similar sentiment about open source
software so he used open source software
as a way to help startups scale quickly
and save money in a blog article that he
wrote the link is down there at the
bottom of the page
he says it's it's better to borrow
instead of building
wherever possible because there are a
hundred of fantastic open-source
projects that have to build through the
hard experience of creating it's Kalei
companies especially around
infrastructure at ma degree that can
save you time and let you focus on
actually building out your project so he
argues hey just reuse open source
software if it exists that will save you
a ton of time and effort and therefore
money you could focus on your product to
get further faster basically so this is
advice that he wrote on picking tech for
startups so he argues hey go with open
source because it will get you farther
and what's really interesting is so this
I can't I can't comment on the you know
like the numerical like accuracy of this
but this article here by Dahlia and
while the link is at the bottom of the
slide here it argues pretty pretty
decently that if you look at the open
source software that is to grab depends
on the at least one hundred forty three
billion dollars of instagrams what
billion dollar acquisition you could
attest to being able to scale quickly
using open source software so basically
riding on the backs of open source
software you could say one hundred forty
three million dollars is kind of what
open source software brought to
instagrams was billion dollar
acquisition so yeah of course there
could be lots of disagreements how this
calculation was drive that I think it's
pretty reasonable if you're interested
in seeing how she arrived at this number
I encourage you to have a look at this
article but the point only here is if
you have a unicorn start up thing you
can you know basically use a lot of open
source software get some more really
fast and actually that open source
software has a large a large impact in
sort of an evaluation of your company
you can even like you know chunk off a
part of it and say that the open source
software brought you this much value
basically but what's perhaps a little
bit sad about that of course is that
that money is not going to the open
source projects themselves it's going to
well you know whoever going to lots of
other people basically
so okay you have these treads but the
same time at the same time this is going
on like the whole world especially the
start-up VC world is is encouraging hey
guys you can say all this money get
farther faster and you know increase how
much your company is worth by using
open-source software rather than
building stuff yourself it's a great
idea
yeah more and more companies jumping on
this bandwagon you got enterprise
companies jumping on this bandwagon lots
and lots of people are jumping on this
bandwagon and like I said 78% of
companies in 2016 and said that they
were using open still running on open
source software but meanwhile it's not
you know as we have like this basically
asymptoting behavior in the number of
people using open source software we
have the same or fewer people
contributing to to these these
absolutely essential open source
projects probably the most famous
example is open SSL we all remember
heartbleed right in 2014
66 percent of all web servers were using
open SSL and meanwhile you know at 60%
56 percent of all web servers in the
world basically we're using SSL B while
this mistake was maintained only by a
few people and they were volunteers
there were people getting paid to
maintain open SSL and Steve Marcus who
who was one of these contributors but
not the most active of them noticed that
another contributor named Steven Henson
was working full-time on open SSL
because Steve Marcus was volunteering
his time he asked he asked Henson what
what he did for income were he got buddy
from and he was completely shocked to
learn that heads had made only 1/5 of
the body that mark has made and Marcus
still had the time to volunteer to open
SSL so Marc Marquez you know even even
contributing to open SSL he always
thought that basically open SSL was was
managed and taken care of by a lot of
people at this is actually surprising to
him
and what's war is he Marquez who urged
you know five times what heads heard
thought that Marquette that Henson was a
significantly stronger program that
Marquez but yet Henson was basically
underpaid and barely he take himself
alive at just contributing all of his
energy to OpenSSL he had doing close at
site you daddy ate so that's a that's a
scary thing right
so what Steve Marquez says is I'd always
assumed that you know just like the rest
of the world that open SSL was a large
active and well resourced team yet in
reality open SSL wasn't even able to
support a single person's work that's
that's big right
and yet industry government etc nobody
really realizes this right we all just
use open SSL we don't think about it
right so of course when heartbleed
happened you know some of these things
became a focal point that open SSL got a
ton of money donated to it but this is
the reality of basically every really
essential infrastructure project that
you depend on and it shouldn't be a
heartbleed that makes us all go oh no we
should tell how from that sig right that
sig that's what some guys struggle to
get litigate poverty to keep that piece
of important difference structure
available to us and we only really care
about it now when there's some massive
vulnerability like obviously we
shouldn't be doing that and this is
getting worse and worse and worse as
industry government and everybody else
have no idea that this is the reality
underneath these things that we depend
on and that we advertised people should
use and so ok I don't know I love this I
don't know I'm sure people have heard of
this I've you know I've recently
discovered it within last year have you
ever heard of the truck factor the truck
factor is the minimum number of
developers who have to be hit by a truck
or quit an open-source project before
project is completely killed basically
and in 2016 there was
a experiment done by a university in
Brazil
and what they did was idea was
collecting data and they were trying to
see how important this truck factor was
how vulnerable some of the most
important github libraries were projects
like github
how vulnerable they were to you know
losing what developer that the project
completely disappearing what they found
they looked at the third 133 most active
projects are you know and they
determined that you know they determined
they were able to determine the amount
of information concentrated in
individual commits from team members so
they could then calculate the truck
factor based on who is moving around
code basically so they did that they
calculated the truck factor based on on
sort of commit diffs and things and what
they found was that 64% of projects
relied on only one or two developers to
continue surviving so maybe you have 150
contributors to a repo but only one or
two of those developers are really the
ones driving the project and making sure
that it continued to develop or have
bugs fixed or stay alive the the if you
want to have a look at the you know the
paper is usually interesting I'll show
you some more data from it in a second
but the link to the paper is here at the
bottom of this slide so I encourage you
to have a look at it but here is here
are the results in August of this of
this study that they did it's kind of
weird how they displayed these results
so this this in this column here that's
highlighted orange with TF that's the
truck factor and you want typically a
higher truck factor you want typically
more people who are able to move around
more logic and be responsible if another
person disappears right so a higher
truck factor is better a lower truck
factor is horrible and the bottom line
here is that there's only a handful of
projects with a high truck factor vast
majority of projects have just one or
two as you could see most projects most
most of these 133 projects fallen into
bins 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and some of its pretty
pretty scary too
so in the it is a truck factor one
category of I wish I could show you with
my
finger right now but what you have is a
sass so sass is in there we all have
heard of sass maybe we've heard of our
ex Java that's that's got one just one
contributor github / Android I'm not
sure that it sounds like a github
project for something involving Android
Adam the the developer Adam Michelle
side the Adam the IDE I believe these
things are all all just one one truck
factor factor one truck factor two is
even more crazy
so Padma's PI data pendant so if you are
familiar with Python bed you know pandas
is a very popular library for for data
stuff that's that's a truck doctor too
otherwise a closure is truck factor too
so if you guys use closure there's
basically just two people that are
keeping that project that that
programming language alive that's
important to realize but there's a bunch
of projects here that that you know are
generally open Delors Rock factors free
so ruby bundler these are all things
that people people use quite a bit and
they have super low truck factors so
it's a little bit it's a little bit
frightening and shocking to realize that
something that you've built your
business around perhaps you have a big
closure stack and you know here you
realize that basically if if the two
people who have who have who are
responsible for most of the closure the
closure code base are are sick or
something that the whole project
basically stops that's pretty scary
okay so I swear this is going to be one
of I've got basically two to last quotes
here so two more slides of reading
quotes - I swear ever to stop with all
the quotes after this but I'd like to
read to you a quote from this dismiss
report that I imagine at the beginning
of the presentation called roads and
bridges by Dahlia eggball she quotes a
log type Python developer at member of
the Python Software Foundation he
observed a very curious trend which I
hope you also be good to notice yourself
so he said he observed in the early days
of the open source pool but there were a
relatively few projects and in general
most people who were using a project
we're also contributing back to it so
we're so it was kind of commutable
communal you you know you use something
that you you know it's like as if you're
going to use a shared kitchen you you
know maybe it's nice to fix a little
part of the kitchen that everybody else
is using because you're also using it
too it was kind of the open abides of
open-source software but but in recent
years both of these have changed likely
by uncountable orders of magnitude so
you know the basically he's arguing that
we have in dollars between producers and
consumers so there are there were before
there was roughly equal producers and
consumers now there's significantly
worked with Cerberus data producers so
it says these days you know so just to
continue reading the quote in the past
where these these two these two
producers and consumers were roughly
balanced everyone put time and effort
into the Commons and everyone reaps the
benefits these days however very few
people put in that effort and a vast
majority simply benefit from those to
those who do this imbalance has become
so ingrained that for a company to repay
it either Tyra buddy even a small
fraction of the time that they derived
from the column the common so open
source software it's always been
thinkable
okay so like let that took kid for a
second what he's arguing is that now
we've got a few people who are just
producing open source software and
literally everybody is consuming it and
now companies I mean it's unthinkable
for a company to consider
giving back to this open source they're
building their businesses off of that's
that's kind of the tread that we're
finding ourselves in okay and this is
last quarter I swear so you know just to
continue with with this sort of this
trajectory of whoa buddy were users very
few for open-source developers there's
also growing resented or growing issues
in the bugs maintainers to open source
software and I'm just going to read a
quote from riot big who who writes
documentation for Ruby on Rails and in
November 2015 he said he was going to
quit all he decided to quit all
open-source work and this is his reason
I do not have the time or energy to
assess open source to invested open
source anymore I have not being paid at
all to do any open source work and so
the work that I do there is time that I
can be spetic doing life stuff or
writing it's not fair to expect me to do
even more work outside of my regular
work and the dot get regularly or not
get fairly compensated entire remaining
for it it's also a great recipe for
burnt out and just making me generally
grumpy so this is just one one quote and
you could go see the the the blog
article that escaped from here on the
right side of the slide but there are
many more examples of contributor bird
out or bait or bird out as as we've
shifted to this culture of many more
users that producer many more consumers
dead producers many more users of the
source software that people who are
developing this open software what
happened is people are treating this
open source these open source developers
as if you know they they paid a lot of
money they deserve some kind of support
or some kind of you know the customer's
always right sort of treatment so people
are getting threatened and attacked and
treated very badly at the open source
world then they ask themselves why about
giving my weekends or why am i you know
having a lower salary to do this if
people are just great to appease me
right so there's this maintainer strain
this maintainer burnout that's beginning
to happen it's born where companies and
more and more just you know random
individuals in the
are beginning to depend more and more on
open source and the last the last sort
of data point that I'm going to present
to you is it gets it gets even scarier
so everybody's gone floss crazy
everybody is using open to us floss or
open source free Libre software in their
fax even the Department of Defense is
doing this actually they've been doing
it for a long time even in 2003 report
showed that the US Department of Defense
with a major user applause and that
swath of even being used to mission
critical situations I have no idea what
they use big philosopher but for all I
know they could be like having drones
using this stuff you know and if there's
some crazy heartbleed like bugs you know
the government probably is going to have
a lot of trouble fixing these bugs right
so undoubtedly I'm sorry unexpectedly
the Department of Defense security
depends very heavily on open source
software and this report actually turned
into a sort of a panic attack
not to bed open source software to
Department of Defense because of 2003 it
was a discussion should we develop our
own software or should we use open
source software and this thing ended up
being a good argument that hey don't bet
open source software use use open source
software instead promote a broader and
more effective use of floss so board
more more more more floss don't stop and
to quote the article the Department of
Defense concluded that
applications that are written using a
floss tend to be much lower in costs of
the proprietary equivalents yet they
often provide higher levels of
functionality with a good user
acceptance so basically they're cheaper
and people are happier with them so
let's say what a continued use Explorer
scary if like bombs are being programmed
with floss stuff and there's one really
stressed out guy he's ready to quit
developing on it and you know you've got
the US Department of Defense freaking
depending their missile systems on this
stuff I mean okay maybe that's a
ridiculous ridiculous thing to say but
you don't want like garbage depending on
this stuff but there's one poor super
stressed out guy who's ready to quit
develop a about this
a software but just disappeared peace
out to Indonesia never come back you
know that would be pretty horrible for
for some of these really important
critical piece of developments or
software so I hope I hope what what you
you know what I've been able to show you
here are a few treads that maybe we're
not evident before you sat down and came
to this top so what major thing I hope
you walk away with it you remember it's
that music floss over proprietary
software is now mainstream nobody people
companies largely don't even look at
proprietary software they just go right
for a floss solution and further
startups Enterprise ateva governments
are depending on this digital
infrastructure and now we have orders of
magnitude more users and same or fewer
contributors and this is kind of setting
up for a major disaster the whole world
was depending on these things that has
super shaky foundations because nobody
is nobody is really putting in enough
well I can say nobody is but we are not
putting enough time collectively into
our digital infrastructure as we should
be we are not fixing the potholes in our
streets we are just getting I agree that
somebody else isn't doing it that poor
guy is a kaduk pain he's just going to
quit so that's you know kind of a setup
for a major problem that's that I see
down the road a little bit so if you ask
me what my personal opinion is which
could be totally ridiculous a totally
wrong what I believe strongly is that
more companies should be made aware of
this tread and they should be scared to
death about this because things that are
important to them could just drop off
the face of the earth and that could be
you know something awful it's you know
huge huge development burden for them if
this happens right so what I believe
strongly we should do is we should try
to change our mindsets and our culture a
little bit I think that more companies
should make an effort to contribute back
to open source software and back to
floss so if you if you're depending on a
piece of software if you're building
your whole stack on something if you're
profiting off of it
you should try to donate a little bit of
time to give back to this
area Structure because we have no
international governments that are going
to help fund this we've got to somehow
invest money to tie back into these
things but they're not just going to
develop themselves forever especially as
we get more and more people using and
depending on them they become bored more
important that nobody wants to pay for
it okay so that's all we're going to say
about the general general treads the
open source software but you know
scholars what of one of these open
source programming languages we have
ecosystem both of libraries and projects
all over the world that people are
depending on and developing and you know
as Scala continues to grow more popular
the question is okay well what is this
whole presentation that I gave you the
first half what does this have to do
with Scala you know what what does the
Scala center has to do with this so just
to give you a quick quick intro to the
Scala Center thing so we started this
last year in March it's a not-for-profit
center established at EPFL
EPFL is the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology at Lausanne and just you know
if you're if you're in the scholar world
if you like Scala you're part of like
the Scala relativity I just want I just
want to remind you that this is a part
of a university in Switzerland this is
not in California we have nothing to do
with San Francisco California this is
the University work Scala was this cute
little academic language came out of
this this campus and then kind of spread
all over the world and and were based at
Eddie PSL where were you know I did my
PhD with Martin O'Dare ski on Scala and
many of the people that work at the
Scala Center either they were somehow
affiliated with the university or the
group or they were well-known developers
that have come and helped us you know on
on Scala related governance and other
issues so yeah this is this is EPS L
this is the expression behind the
scholar logo in case you were to wear
this weird red spiral staircases the
Scala logo and to give you a quick
rundown of what the Scala center is
about we have basically three bullet
points to our mission
and it is great to read them real quick
so bullet-point would independently
guide and support the entire scallop
unity bullet point to coordinate
developed open-source libraries and
tools for the benefit of the overall
scholar community 3 provide deep quality
of freely available education materials
for scholar okay so to summarize guide
and support the Scala Trinity and to do
it independently like we have no company
chasing us with a stick telling us what
to do we we do what we think is the best
for everybody the best for all kind of
approach a coordinate develop
open-source libraries and tools that are
for the benefit of everybody so really
like if something is not useful to
everybody we're not going to focus on
something that's useful to what company
or what is your go-to try spread out our
impact on the open source well but that
we do and finally to provide education
materials so to keep things like these
books going to continue writing
documents that help people learn Scala
etc and what's cool is that
Scala the Scala Center is equally backed
by Ted companies who have major
stakeholders and scholars so all of
these companies are basically putting
donating money and putting it into a pot
and we are using that money to hire
developers to work out these issues that
we determined to be you know absolutely
completely broad for the good of all
sort of initiatives and the it's so far
that's working out pretty good pretty
well and kind of roughly the scholarship
trades to make it easier to contribute
in general to not just the core Scala
libraries a client or anything but also
to people's libraries that are part of
this Kali Yuga system so anybody else
like if you have a library that people
have started using and that's written in
Scala we want to help you figure out how
to grow your contributor base and
increase the truck factor of your
library because as more people depend on
it you know we want your library to
succeed to stay alive we don't want you
to get stressed out because you're doing
this on your weekends to quit everybody
needs this library so we're trying to
basically increase the truck factor of
everything as a scholar ecosystem that's
kind of what we would love to be able to
show we've done so we've got we're doing
lots of things
we're going to very soon regard to
release kind of a list of the things
that we've been working on in the last
last year but some of the some of the
you know more important initiatives is
to democratize in the standard library
by splitting this mess of libraries that
we have the scallops at our library into
scholar Corps added to defied something
that the scallop platform where we put
the control completely in the head of
everybody else so people you know not
not that me dot Mart not anybody working
on the copilot literally a community of
people who maintain widely scholar
libraries at the scholar ecosystem
they're going to be the ones that decide
what did this so-called scallop platform
so that would somebody download scholar
the idea is that they get this thing
called scholar core which is the minimum
you know scholar standard library
possible that the compiler needs in
order to run and the rest of the stuff
that would cut along the batteries
included part of the distribution would
be defined by the community so people
deciding what what the most important
libraries are that in general beginners
and intermediate users should be getting
first we're doing things like ecosystem
hackathons or trying to help people
learn how to to contribute to other
scholar projects at the Scala ecosystem
and were working on what's called the
Scala improvement process which is
trying to find a way to help people
actually make changes to the compiler or
propose new new language features or or
you know subsidized changes in a way
that the Scala compiler works so I'm
just going to quickly run through this
the this I kind of briefly mentioned
already what I meant by corn platform
but just in case you're not familiar
with Scala what we do is we ship this
thing called Scala library jar which is
just a ton of stuff that's collected
over the years that nobody's really
maintaining it's sort of frozen in time
as the compiler got stabilized it's sort
of shipped with Scala compiler and it's
it's it's got to follow these strict
the compatibility required it's because
it's shipped with the compiler
the idea is to break break that thing
that bottle with acceded to this very
small scale course egg which like I said
it's a very bit above like set of core
core things in the the standard library
and the Scala platform sig which as I
described a few moments ago is sort of a
batteries included set of libraries that
the community decides is what people
should have first and Julian Julian the
sharp la is a guy who's leading this
this splitting these things up and if
you want to get involved in this this is
the guy you can go to I'll show you in a
few slides a link that you would go to
to participate these discussions if
you're interested another thing I
mentioned briefly was this Scala
platform process so this is a this is
how we determine what should this call
the platform so these these libraries
that we would ship to users in general
so we're doing a bunch of this business
process that tries to help people to get
their libraries into this discolour
platform thing once once the community
has decided the certain libraries is a
good excuse me a good a good fit for the
Scala platform and we provide lots of
things we provide help with governance
help with project governance and help
with infrastructure for building and
continuous integration and making it
easier to release to release your
projects so the idea is to make it
easier at platform library authors to
ensure that the may need to the releases
of their libraries could scale the odd
just one person alone so we kind of do
some of this this overhead for them so
that they could focus on helping do
contributors and are the help on new
features basically we do all the other
stuff that's sort of difficult and
time-consuming so this is some of the
obstruction we provide so I don't want
to get into it right now it's maybe a
little too detailed but we have plugins
for writing automatic nightly builds and
releasing stable versions automatically
for you we have continuous integration
that we provide for user for members of
the scala platform on
CEL is the structure so you don't have
to worry about memory and other
constraints like this and then release
manager for automatically staging
changes and on the government side
mentioned that we did infrastructure and
governance that was the infrastructure
on the governance side we have project
governance based on Peters Agency for
contract so the idea is to desexualize
decision-making and come up with a set
of processes that are aimed at growing a
community of contributors we really want
to the edges is a happy contributor
community that feels good about
contributing back to this thing that
everybody has equal stake in and Peter
Hitchens has has a lot of experience
doing exactly that so Jorge Quintero is
is the guy who is doing all of this he
if you have any questions about it or if
you stick all bad this is crazy I would
do this instead he is the guy that is
collecting all of that feedback so if
you'd like to participate in this
discussion we at the end of November
December 2016 we released this SVP and
we're currently necessities it's called
hop or process we're currently
discussing it on a discourse which is
our so it's uh oh the the link is here
on the bottom bottom right-hand corner
of the page share contributor stuff
Scotland org expectant we're replacing
the mailing lists with this course
because this course is far more
convenient to use so if you're
interested in arguing about these things
or getting involved in the the Scala
core with Scala platform separation go
to contributor step scalawag that or
good be like hey guys I want to
participate or guys this is the worst
idea ever
here's the reasons why this is the place
where we work through all these details
together so yeah this course I don't
know why I have another screenshot but
hooray okay finally we're doing these
equal system hackathons as a kid 2d
building exercise the idea behind these
figs is to help library officers figure
out how to interact with contributors
and people who would like to contribute
to open source but ever have to help
them figure out how to participate in
open source projects so what we're
trying to do
us try to set up a structure to bring
these two groups of people together and
to help them both be productive in terms
of making changes to open-source
projects so the structure of these
things is as follows so we do pair
programming the library authors is
always the rule that's the rule
so to two people who are attending will
sit with each other and try to fix a bug
or add a feature to an open-source
library and library authors of the room
you know he or she can answer any
questions that these newcomers have the
library author of course begins by
trading a list of two dudes that are
accomplishable in a few hours
buy new covers you know before the for
the hackathon and typically these this
group of this pair of people who are
pair programming would choose one of
these two deuce and the goal of
everybody is to have at least you know
one PR merged
poerty by the end of the hackathon so
the library author should be able to
well you know while in the room review
the pull request and merge them
hopefully and people who manage to make
these pull requests get these really
awesome Scala contributor shirts so you
know we're going around to different
events usually at reading these
hackathons and we've read them so far at
least three times and so far they've all
been pretty successful we're going to
run some more at Scala days in Chicago
and Copenhagen so if you're there
perhaps you'd like to join and the idea
just to summarize the goal is to come up
with a process that we will eventually
process or a structure that we could
eventually export to meetup group
organizers at Eddie City and yep
everybody is participating and develop a
good writing news so yep here's a
picture of the people who have
participated in one of these a croissant
and finally the skylight provement
process this is just a list of things
that were already
iterating on we've accepted
have words Tralee kaaba's and we're
currently working on a number of of
scala preferred proposals were being
iterated on improved work dodd we've
rejected a few as well so just so you
have a quick lips we're kind of trying
to develop a language collectively in
this oklets colin approval process and
again if you'd like to discuss any of
these language changes if you think
trey'll acabas is the craziest thing
ever we should not have it so tell us of
this discourse distillation its
contributors that scalawag that org
again so for example we have public
discussions on individual sips okay few
so that's that's a mouthful and i'm
running over time so i will leave you
with that i but okay I lied I'm going to
give you one more quote okay I'm so
sorry if you remember anything from this
talk please remember this quote from da
da eggball in the last five years open
source infrastructure has become an
essential layer of our social fabric but
much like startup the technology itself
would work for the first 30 years of
open source history will work moving
forward in order to maintain our pace of
progress we need to invest back into the
tools that are helping us build bigger
and better things so what she's saying
here ultimately is that for the last 30
years we've been trying to promote open
source as a viable a viable thing to
depend on but that that's already open
source is already what we have to change
what what we're promoting though we have
to now change people's mindset to say
don't just use hope it's to give back to
it because we're going to have a huge
societal problem we don't start doing
that soon okay
that's all I have to say and is yet but
the TLDR of this whole talk is as an
open source programming language we
don't watch your money we watch your
pull requests and like I said for
everybody not just to Scala core repose
so with that I'm going to say thank you
and if you have any questions I I'm
happy to answer
I think so it look can you can you hear
me
I will repeat okay okay and I just
wanted to ask what do you think about
all these projects like get deeper or
similar that kind of gives money
directly to contributors so the question
was about GDP its tip oh yeah yeah so
that's a good question
so actually I am no expert on this
gifted thing but it was treated in quite
some detail it just this report and the
consensus made Partners report and also
my personal feeling you know independent
of report just like observing how
successful gets things yet seems like
what's happened with tips and like two
people are actually making a little bit
of money on it and most people basically
don't make any money on it at least not
enough to survive it for more than a
month or two and really that the main
issue is that the money that people are
earning with things like its it it's not
sustained it usually very short-term so
the problem that not just you know I
have this I you know I have this opinion
in the sense about it but which was
detailed in this report is that you know
while this works for just a feature here
or there or a little project here or
there
it's not something that could support
OpenSSH for example I mean
hypothetically it could but you know
it's just the way that it works with
people it's not like people are making
regular contributions it's like there
are a little bursts of income and it's
not something that you can depend on
long term so it's better than nothing
but it's not it's not really a long-term
stable sustained enough to really
support especially important projects
like open at the cellar or things like
this any any other questions
all right that is one up there
you have to turn right now and throw up
what are the reasons for making for
companies to make software open-source
what are the reasons or companies to
make software open-source the question
is what are the reasons for the
companies to make open-source oh yeah
okay that's a good question so I I don't
know so much that it's important to have
companies making open-source period I
think there are already lots of
companies doing it and the companies
that are doing it are she talked to
talking about why they are doing it
that's the tourism are typically hiring
it's you typically find better
developers if they're it's you know via
open source projects people who are like
really motivated and excited and so
people find that having open source
products is it's good for recruiting I
think that's what I would have spoken to
a lot of companies that's kind of one of
the main reasons they open source their
software but another reason is because
you know it's something that that's
important that other companies maybe
might need or use or depend on and
contribute work back so it's like that
you have one pool of code that both of
you are going to use maybe you're the
the company that kind of controls what
goes into it but if some other company
down the street who does something
totally different than you find yourself
or useful they contribute to success
back to it you know that's free
engineering efforts that you get right
they got some free things that you
develops right so it can save on develop
the time for some people that's what
some people have told me at least that's
the hope but I don't know about whether
or not that's kind of predominantly the
trend but whatever that's that's what
people have said to me but I think that
you know if you really a bigger argument
so it's not that we should open source
software but instead in hey did you guys
make a ton of money this year on the
students offer that you develop an OS 60
percent of these things is if your code
base that you're shipping us have open
source thing that has a nice license you
know maybe you should learn a little bit
about some of the things that you're
depending on so cases ever you know
truck factors decrease a lot of these
things that you're you're depending on
so so so much you know you could you you
somebody in your company could increase
that truck practice somebody somebody
you know in-house could become a
contributor to this thing that you use a
deed all the time you can then you know
if you ever run into a bug somebody in
house can fix it merge it upstream
themselves and it's good for everybody
so I think a bigger argument is is to
try and I mean it you know should be
something like that like if you guys are
all depending on something that's very
important that has a low trust factor
increase the truck factor by having him
and this person I'm sorry an in-house
engineer learning learning and becoming
a committer to the codebase
that thing will stay around blogger as
you guys could you know merge changes up
streams and have control over the
projects that you depend on as well so I
think that's a bigger argument but maybe
that was maybe I just feel strongly
about this but I mean uh just a thought
to conclude I think that's a bigger
issue than trying to convince more
people to open source software we have
room for one more question if there is
any okay I think we are done so thank
you and give a round of applause for
either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
