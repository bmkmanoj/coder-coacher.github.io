I'm not entirely sure why I was asked to
do a keynote and at a conference about a
language that I'm actually never used is
that the time I was invited this is
going to be interesting and you
shouldn't expect me to reveal any any
grand secrets about airline or present
any exciting new technology is written
in our bank and all that because
honestly I haven't done much yelling at
all so I'm no idea how this talk is
going to go if you're going to find it
interesting if you're going to find it
offensive quite possibly British oj well
ah I've been told though that long as
you start off with it with a standard
routine you're going to be fine so I'm
going to just go through the the
preliminaries here i'm going to say
hello Jane and you respond how about it
excellently works hello Mike it's all
good it's all good hello audience can't
go wrong from here right so I wasn't
quite sure how to approach the topic of
this talk I wanted to present to you a
perspective of a line from the outside
what is like coming into airline trying
to learn it but doing research which
means googling around I found this posed
by Gordon go free I was behind this
picture by the way from 2002 Gordon's
political and this is this is a picture
from when he defected from scottish
labour in 2002 to join the scottish
national party if you've been following
UK politics that's a very ill Nicola
Sturgeon over there who's now the leader
of the S&amp;amp;P and there's our friend Gordon
were 13 years ago and it looks exactly
the same it's quite startling anyway he
asked this question why is an erlang
more popular and I thought yeah that's
interesting approach to take
I'd like to actually examine the
theories predominant in the airline
community about why is not more popular
and I'd like to offer some perspectives
on my own I'm going to be talking about
what it was like for me learning the
basics of airline and at the end of it
I'm going to try and offer some opinions
and how we can improve the situation
because we all know that and I isn't
very popular so what can we do to fix
that anyway the the predominant theory
is that gives today prefer Ruby and AJ
ass this is it seems like the Allen
communities hung up on why to go young
people today go to ruby and oj s
actually i don't think they do well
there's a node but ruby is sort of
becoming an enterprise language almost
and the Ruby community is all abuzz
about what's happening why isn't really
quite as popular animal why aren't
people doing more raves and they too
have the same thing then going to opt
for no Jas instead so the rivets are
panicking about about people defecting
from Ruby tonight and subsea that's
exactly what's going on nuttin just
innate but there's sort of an exodus
from Ruby I think the kids aren't really
doing Ruby anymore whereas a big company
so I'm actually adopting it more and
more they're all going to note though
and of course why not node is
asynchronous it's got callbacks which is
actually the perfect concurrency model
and oh you scoff what it's a it's an
interesting approach actually to solving
the problem of concurrency by not having
any so
there is that it works and actually does
but I think well there's the mush with
the language but I think mostly the
reason note is so popular is the tooling
and and chief among the tools is NPM and
PM is the package manager essentially
and sort of the build system to they
sent that that note needs a bit system
at all because javascript is an
interpreted language for the most part
you don't there's no compilation step so
what mpm does really it takes care of
the whole process of building
applications by giving you the project
fight when you start the project
managing your dependencies along
allowing you to install them quickly and
easily and that's all there is to it and
it works marvelously that's the thing
about it the experience is fantastic
it's just there's there's nothing quite
really like it I mean I've been all over
the place and I always come back to NPM
I sort of the that the leading example
of how package manager should be it's
not perfect we haven't solved the
problem of how to make package managers
perfect yet I think Joe is working on it
they make see annex I don't know if that
really counts but it's it is such a
broader in scope but NPM is outstanding
in its field I know that's hard to
believe but it's honestly the truth
there's a an enormous community note and
of course that means that the community
has a lot of momentum there's somebody
has probably solved almost every
conceivable problem that you might
encounter while programming it's not
necessarily given that they've served us
in a good way but there's bound to be an
NPM package there for just about
everything and of course it's a natural
choice for web apps this is obvious
because note runs java script and so in
the browser
you don't have a choice you have to run
JavaScript there's a friend no other
option you have compiled a judgment
languages but essentially you need to be
aware of JavaScript as a platform on the
browser and so having the same thing on
the back end is very compelling to
people we have this thing that date well
I wonder if I can actually make the mac
yeah I can't okay say imagine that the
last letters haven't wrapped there's
this thing called isomorphic JavaScript
which is a horrible expression for one
thing you have to be isomorphic to
something mathematicians go insane when
the drug free community to talk it this
way you can't you can't use this
expression but what it means is
essentially isomorphic means that
something is is essentially similar to
to another thing and what this is
similar to is itself essentially you can
reuse the code on the server and on the
client so I've seen a lot of products
and also of languish is trying to
achieve this like you had quit for java
i think was one of the first attempt at
this and you've got a million projects
and in various languages to compile the
server-side language into JavaScript now
you go closer scrape you got scholar jas
you go whatever ah what I find in these
cases and is having done a bit of
closure script is that there's not much
code reuse between server and client you
might have something like formatted
Asian but that's about it in JavaScript
day in between late and and the browser
it's different which surprised me but
nowadays we build for instance we've
built applications using react jes with
which is the cool new UI framework from
from facebook which runs marvelous in
the browser but you can also make it run
on the server and there's pre-render
your HTML if say you are on a browser
that doesn't support javascript
or if you're just in a slow connection
and and you can even just have the
client site react component take over
the bit that's been rendered on the
server and and carry on as if it were a
single page web app it's actually quite
ingenious so there's a very compelling
argument for no right there especially
if you're writing web applications of
course if you're writing highly
concurrent data processing systems mmm
maybe no it isn't so cool but what's
cool two kids today speaking as a kid
today and don't ask how old I am its web
apps obviously it doesn't do concurrence
nearly as well as having as I mentioned
I mean technically it doesn't really do
concurrency at all you can fire up
multiple new processes part and you can
make them talk to each other usually use
something like a message bus so you
can't scale need apps but it doesn't
really have a very compelling
concurrency model in that sense but you
know what nobody cares they're writing
web apps well as I mostly just talking
to databases databases might move so
concurrency on the rain that's fine but
things usually just work it it's decent
enough you get the job done and there's
not much trouble doing it and that's why
people use need so looking at this
popularity contest if you look at the
most popular languages on github
counting number of repositories
javascript is on top and I think part of
this is because as I mentioned on the
browser you don't have a choice and you
got Ruby down on number three but what's
this thing in the middle I'm pretty sure
the cool kids today don't use that thing
in the middle actually let's look at
this from a different perspective are
the tie OB index the tob enterprise
programming index I believe it's called
has slightly different numbers from from
github you have to remember that github
is for essentially
it's project or projects that have been
open source by marios company so it's
very skewed towards the kids essentially
whereas tob I'm it's a controversial
data source and how they arrive at the
numbers exactly nobody's quite sure but
it presents an interesting perspective
Java is I think it's about seventeen
percent old programmers use Java
according to tie OB and the second
language is something called see where
it is just behind drama as I think 16
percentage and then there's this thing
called c++ and something called C sharp
I something called objective-c now this
looks slightly different from from the
user perspective in fact I daresay that
perhaps apart from objective-c this
isn't what the kids today are using 22
right there were maps this is something
else this is the enterprise and I know
it's it's so amazingly creepy is the
enterprise for you yeah so kids today
like JavaScript but kids today aren't
really representative of the entire
programming community what most people
do and certainly most people who do
programming for a living do it's this
sort of thing we're not the way it dawns
going on in the background but you know
what i mean like enterprise programming
in Java C sharp c++ what have you
actually let's look at this list from a
slightly different perspective Oracle on
top AT&amp;amp;T made c and c++ well it was both
of them were created at bell labs which
well mostly owned by AT&amp;amp;T is owned by
how could tell now i think soo shop is
microsoft an objective-c is apple what
you're seeing here is a lot of very
a large companies and I think that's the
reason for the popularity these big
companies have been pushing yes
languages is Dykstra I have to have a
daughter equator my talk Dykstra
actually when came right out and said it
look the only reason java's popular is
because son has been pushing for it it's
run an enormous advertising campaign to
make sure of a popular and he said
essentially about that nobody in their
right mind will be using java if not for
this I station was want to say ah so
Alan has a big company behind it
Ericsson right well the sad truth is
that why Java was launched by Sun as a
flagship product AXA never really wanted
adding in the first place in fact
ericsson band a Lang months you know
this took way too dark suddenly some
depressing perspective but it's not
really all bad because what this led to
of course is that well as Joe tells the
story and I'm paraphrasing it's likely
hit Felix he's me Jay this led to the
simple fact that Jay was able to
heroically come in and sort of Steel a
Lang away from the clutches of Ericsson
and make it make it open source so it is
now available to all of us it's a very
heroic story of freedom sorry ass in
touch myself in a Photoshop 40 I feel
like we don't have enough Alec than
maybe parody patience a is my country
contribution so on the bright side
Erickson didn't want an hang essentially
but this led to the fact that Eiling is
now available to everybody and I think
that's at least a huge bonus so I would
now like to talk about my journey into
which is possible because of this fight
for freedom essentially what I do for a
living is JavaScript usually it is front
and back in JavaScript it's the
ecosystem that I definitely know best
I'm not going to call myself an expert
now actually I am an expert i'm totally
next but in JavaScript for whatever
that's worth in fact that means that I
know where all the skeletons are buried
I'm not a fan of JavaScript it's an
awful language it's got a huge number of
defects and and I'm stuck with this
growing codebase written in a language
that is barely suited for writing tiny
little scripts in web pages and it's
getting social unmaintained ball or
rather it's actually fairly small at
this point and we're sort of managing
and it's all written a note it's
essentially what to do for a living is I
hate to admit it but its advertising and
this node code base is how we serve the
adds to the clients and it's not all
that complicated but it's it's growing
in complexity some of this is because of
JavaScript but some of this is because
of news concurrency model and so I've
been looking into alternatives because
at least the way we've architected this
it's easy to replace gradually it's not
a micro service architecture sort of a
milli service thing so you can take
parts of it and replace it with any any
other language and see if it works and
essentially well it's staying with
JavaScript weight and well I think at my
company we know this so they've
essentially sent me out to try and
figure out the replacement and obviously
the replacement is ere long because I've
had a drink or two with Joe and he keeps
telling me how amazing this thing is
and essentially this is all all the
words problems at least with regards to
concurrent systems 25 years ago it is
recurring theme this 25 years ago thing
but it is actually a compelling argument
so I started looking into howling and
this is my story or how that went down
actually this is my story over how it
wasn't such a great experience this is
where I start yelling at you essentially
actually finishing this talk last night
I realized I had completely omitted the
good pups of learning a lang so I'm just
going to shout at you for a bit and then
i'm going to start suggesting solutions
so bear with me there's no introductory
material apart from books fortunately I
had a book i see you lying around but
usually when i approached a language
because i tend to learn a lot of
languages and i tend to be very
impatient about it so what I want to do
when I learn a language is I want to sit
down with a brief tutorial and get him a
good overview and then I like to go
through like more or less a bullet point
list of how to do things in terms of the
language if not the idiom that's not an
option for airline you how does this
sound and you have to read a book and
that takes a lot of time and kids today
don't have the patience for that
essentially you also have to buy them
for the most part some books are online
and I very much appreciate that but
they're still books and they still take
a lot of time and once you've read the
books and you want to start looking into
some seriously advanced topics there's
not much information on that like
written down there a blog posts and the
blog post what I was looking for
information on how to essentially start
applying a lange systems over several
machines just more than one so I started
googling for how to scale a lange
systems and i found a lot of information
about like things like how to tune the
lending
Colonel optimally 44 what is that was
the thing that did two million
connections at the same time on one
computer that wasn't helpful at the
point that I was it was insanely cool
that you can do that but yeah not
helping learning some airline of course
is available on the internet and I also
had a hard copy of this actually and
it's an amazing book very much
appreciate it it exists but it's like so
learning so Malik is based on this other
book on learning some Haskell don't you
a house call for very good and the
Haskell book now Haskell is a very
complicated language we're having is not
but the Haskell book is half the size or
the annenberg mentally because in
earnest manner Fred actually goes into
detail about things like concurrent
programming models whereas a lying as a
language it is easy and quick to learn
best once you get into OTP it gets a lot
more complicated but yeah the books are
long and now I shouldn't be a
complicated language at least Robert
keep selling like this it's like a tiny
elegant little core language so can we
have some tutorials for that please Alex
there incidentally has a very decent
tutorial it's just the right size for me
I'll get back to an exhibit first I want
to use so I mean I can't really talk
about airline without talking about the
syntax I'm sure you saw this coming now
I used to be a lisp ah and I know that
airline takes a lot of crap for the
syntax and I can easily sympathize
because well the first thing people
notice about Lisp is look at all those
crazy brenth is this some sort of joke
and once you get into Lisp you stop
noticing the parentheses edges you sort
of develop a lisp sense where you can
immediately tell whether
this program has balanced parentheses
and it's all good it's all starts to
make sense eventually as you approach
Lisp enlightenment and all that stuff so
I can really sympathize about this thing
where people won't use the language
because of the syntax but I can't get
over it I'm sorry I can't I mean there's
no such thing as objectively good about
syntax but honestly adding syntax I
can't i mean i could probably get used
to it but i don't think i could ever
actually like it i'm sorry but i'm not
going to belabor this point it ray
syntax shouldn't matter so let's jump
into the tooling there should be a cool
sorry i talked about NP amalia and npm
is an amazing experience whereas turning
from for allowing a sort of the complete
opposite I think the user experience
particularly really really matters and
where's the standard bill too I think
I've heard rumors that most people just
use make fires because yeah there's no
story for the standard built-in where's
the sound of package manager package
manager who needs that we got my files
it's it's not good it's not good at all
at least for the kids with no patients
coming in used to things like NPM and
I'm not going to pretend that the Ruby
tooling for this is good but at least
it's there and it's sort of consistent
and this is just not a good story for
people coming to hurling make fine sont
ok ok well actually a good build system
I think it should get you ninety five
percent of the way or rather four
ninety-five percent of the things that
you will need to do a build system
should just a bill to sorry should just
be that and
do it for you and for the rest of it go
ahead and use make fire I mean in a note
when just using NPM isn't enough they've
created things like grunt and gulp I'm
broccoli and God knows what else now
which I just insanely complicated really
really poor versions of make files and I
think the no community would benefit
from learning about make files for those
fine and five percent but for the rest
of it we shouldn't need to bother with
that sort of thing I mean make fighting
in and of themselves the fine but it
leads to more horrible things than that
I used to do see and the way the way you
do things will see you want just the
basic make fights aren't enough is
kenyatta tools and yeah I can't even
talk about it it's too awful I'm sorry a
little soothing by the way is quite
nifty shredder really punished does the
job Barry sticker empty just mentioning
this no reason at all
I'm also going to I mean thanks Tony
sorry used to be awful but we're seeing
certain developments right now with
rebar free which is essentially the bill
two of the a Lang should have and hacks
which is a package manager incidentally
the hugs package manager i believe comes
from elixir but also contain selling
packages and rebirth three is starting
to use hacks as a package manager to
provide a consistent story and i think
this is amazing this is what needs to
happen in a 90 let's talk about the
community you people because if you
don't hate me already you know so i
mention i used to be a lisp are actually
the expression is smugly Sweeney ah this
place are fairly sure that what they're
doing is exactly the right thing I mean
how could it not be I mean how many
parentheses are in your language not
enough we know Lisp is fantastic and the
list community what the closure
community is sort of an exception it's
rather well behaved but mostly the
lesbian community has a reputation for
insufferable smugness and I admit it I'm
really slow madness I'm also doing a lot
of haskell and if you think smugglers
plane is us mark you have not seen
smoking Haskell weenies they're
absolutely insufferable they don't just
believe that what they're doing is the
right thing they are mathematical proof
of it oh yeah it's the quarry Howard's
correspondence you can't argue with that
if I haske program compiles it is the
correct program provably mathematically
it might not be the actual program that
you needed to serve the problem at hand
but it will be correct
yeah I like Haskell but you know adding
something has the same problem you guys
are rather smug about about the ailing
ecosystem I'm not going to argue the
point about whether you have a right to
be I'm just saying you are in sort of as
a first impression I mean I'm used to
this sort of thing but most people they
would appreciate a bit more you know
modesty perhaps I know that jay
armstrong is went to the moon and all
but i don't think that makes him
automatically an infallible expert on
distributed systems ah this is attitude
that everything is but was invented here
in Erlang and everything invented here
is exactly right in fact Joe told me
this specifically in last night and yeah
I mean I'm no reason to doubt him but
come on guys this this is being smug
it's like a slightly unwelcome attitude
foreign for a newbie to to be to have to
face on the other hand and I'm just
singling out Fred's randomly here Fred
about the the author of learning smiling
because there are a lot of great people
in the Allen community and Fred happens
to be one of them the one that I've got
the most help from myself going in
essentially uh I mentioned previously I
was asking questions about how to to
scaling Allen cluster and I asked on the
internets get a couple of smaug on says
yeah that's the wrong question to ask
and all that and then Fred just shows up
and says look I write I write a book
about it here's the link that's that's
amazing so there there are a lot of
great people I'm singling him out
randomly he deserves it it's not all bad
in there but let's
turn to the question of why adding isn't
more popular and I actually like to quit
to ask just that matter going back to my
various perspective as a lisp weenie why
do you want to be popular anyway and it
gives you an edge just like Lisp gives
everybody an obvious hedge why do you
want to share that why won't you just
let that be a secret weapon just hold
tight on all the amazing features of our
lang keep it sort of a secret and let
the people who think java is better make
the stupid mistakes what is it that
making money or whatever instead i don't
see the point of being popular you can
be successful instead the Haskell
weenies perspective of course ah that's
Phillip Woodleigh by the way hunting the
great white might not the house
convenience perspective is is well this
is actually a Haskell's official more so
I think avoid success at all costs at
least according to Simon Peyton James
who should know being sort of the
leading light of article and what this
means is if everyone uses it you can't
change anything and Haskell's an
academic language well it's used in
industry now the sort of failing at
avoiding success ah but it's essentially
an academic language and what that means
is they would like to experiment with
computer science on language and if
everybody's using it what happens when
you want to make a breaking change to
make them to make part of it over
language better people start complaining
because you broke the production systems
and that's not good at all so avoid
success at all costs because that will
make a language better and more
importantly if everybody's using Haskell
what are you going to feel smug about
you can't you can't sit there anymore
and go you don't know what a co freako
monaco algebra is you stupid person if
everybody knows what that is there's no
fun in that so why would you want to be
popular when he can be smug about how
much smarter than everybody else doesn't
make sense now myself or the the node
weenies perspective because node is
popular no it is insanely popular I mean
it's not spoken in the end reply sense
but I think by far it is the most
popular language among the moment the
non Enterprise crowd at this point and
they've embraced that the more people
use it the better it gets it's simply a
matter of numbers really there's
literally an NPM package for everything
as I mentioned at the start whatever you
can dream of somebody has probably
already implemented it and put it on NPM
and that's because everybody's using it
that's because node is so madly popular
there's an NPM package for everything
even even a lying well not really
certain part of our line doesn't have
been replicated actually made a package
myself called hello Joe seemed like a
good name at the time which essentially
just him implements the the idea of
supervises and you got various
implementations of messaging and whatnot
of course what node will never have is
like why processes and that sort of i
think the heart of a line that's just
not technically feasible given what nate
is but just about everything there's
going to be an NPM package for it and
that's why popularity's is a good thing
because that saves you from implementing
absolutely everything yourself and it
makes you just so much more productive
because limit so yeah popularity is cool
so what can we do to actually get that
I think you should stop resting on your
laurels I mean I Lang is great but it's
not that great there's so much more room
for improvement there is a future for a
lang definitely I think it's called a
lick sir I thinks it does everything
right the onboarding is perfect you've
got this great tutorials very well
written very readable very concise and
it gets you started with the lecture in
a matter of minutes it's amazing the
tooling is modern it does the job no
fuss not a steep learning curve at all
it's even highway the OTP bits which are
still quite nasty um you essentially get
all the power to pee and we're not null
never had a cake but certainly
diminishes the headache that is now it
is a modern language with a modern
workflow and this what airline has a lot
of compelling arguments for itself as a
language I think it sort of lagging
behind the state-of-the-art things like
closure for instance which incidentally
Alex it reminds me a lot of the way you
work with it I think Alexa might be the
way to go I think there's a future
failing yourself too though because
adding remains the call but everything
else is built on top of you can't have a
liquid without a lang and it's not like
adding it's an awful language it
certainly gets the job done you have to
struggle with the way it syntax but
that's fine we can do that but you have
to step up your game seriously along the
way it's been going for the past 25
years since since all the problems of
the world with some with it it's not
been a huge success story I know about
what's out but that doesn't matter if
you don't step up your game I'm afraid
you're going to be the bcp out to an
ecstasy essentially the precursor
language that nobody remembers anymore
but I think you are stepping up your
game I think
good things are happening in the island
community right now I think you're all
realizing which I've just been telling
you for the past good lord 55 minutes
there's free why free you need to
embrace that you need a compelling
turning story honestly Bang itself is
amazing but it's not enough put
everything in hacks please you need to
have the package repository you need to
to make all these dependencies easy to
use if you don't people are just not
going to interested I think I think the
future is going to look a lot different
from the adding that that you have been
used it for the past 25 years whether
it's alexa or whether it's a modern
airline i think it's going to be amazing
even so though really whatever happens
that I think we're going to see a huge
improvement and I'm going to think we're
going to see an upswing in the
popularity of a light at least as a
platform maybe even a sign language so
we really did solve this problems 25
years ago that's the thing Alex
concurrency model is amazing the first
thing that struck me when I started
learning anything about at laing apart
from the core language this these are
concurrency primitives there's this
concurrency model that that they form
it's brilliant it works it works
beautifully works to the center you get
what 99 some up time and all that this
should be widely available so you have
some of the problems now go house and
tell everybody that you have and make
them believe it you need to do that
thank you
so glad the video worked at the end
anyway if you want to check out this
lines they're already online I've
actually been running them from this URL
ah I don't know you do with new
questions we should have a few questions
they'll feel like they are quoting be
honest or you know there are two types
of programming languages those people
complain about and those no one uses so
sorry does anyone have mean this is yet
a good insight and I think a good 3 cap
and I agree to a lot of what you've been
saying I'm wonder if others have
questions or thoughts they might want to
contribute no I think there's it hello
Joe indeed this is very true I'll repeat
the question or rather the comment
because Joe Joe rightly points out the
node package manager the backend
database for that ramzan kashti be it
literally runs entirely on cash to be
this not really much of a server
component because couch happens to run
JavaScript as well but couch chuckles is
written in Erlang and that's why I'm
p.m. is obviously so amazing yeah Joe
sold em p.m. 25 years ago too hey yeah
i'm just adding a little comment why get
hubs javascript popularity is so high
because for example if you make a small
web application like few pages little
airline script and you include the
jquery and you include amber or New York
then you get ninety-seven percent
JavaScript and three percent their own
exactly I tried to point this out see I
mean the reason there's so much
javascript is because when you write a
web application there's going to be when
they want to or not say the actual
popularity of drug abuse probably
slightly less but is still probably very
very large even so but yeah people
commit
Jastrow that's been compiled from
compile to JavaScript languages people
commit things like jQuery dependencies
there's just a lot of JavaScript out
there and there's nothing we can do
about it this is true I said thing is
more popular than Ruby at least give me
that Thank You Buddha Robert had a
question yeah one second okay just a
comment four we know of for we who love
parenthesis LFE and I think that's the
best of both sorry i forgot of like LFE
yeah so if you like a lying and you like
parentheses then obviously Roberts
written this thing called let's play
with a lang which I feel like it's it's
still a long actually even though it's
very obviously also a lisp it's good
it's home iconic it's got macro Cisco
all you need from a lisp essentially
even even even the smugness yeah and and
you can combine that with our like
smugness and you're essentially all in
so check out LFE can put the bus with
the best true is that it thanks boo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
