I guess you know we're just a July we do
retrospectives at the start which is
kind of cool you'll also notice how
agile we are because we've actually
renamed the talk I think it's called
something about climbing in yours in
your schedule but that's okay so to do a
retrospective it really helps to know
where you're starting off from so what
we'd like to do to start with is do the
boring part and that is to talk a little
bit about ourselves because it kind of
helps motivate what we saw going forward
so this is my part and then Bruce gets
to do his part so I actually got into
computers fairly young this is me and my
friend Toby Bailey about where are we
now 45 years ago I think so everyone
sitting there going like that you
programming a an analog computer which
is kind of fun if you don't know what an
analog computer is ask your parents but
we had a whole bunch of fun doing like
damn sine waves all sorts of cool stuff
with that and at that time I was going
to go do math or as we called it mass at
University and I decided after this and
that I was going to go and do software
instead so I went to a local technical
college and started programming we
programmed using sr 33 and a 300 baud
modem or as we say that's 30 characters
per second top we used to program
because telephones were expensive to use
in the UK you'd pay for it so we used to
program offline by pitch punching paper
tape and then we'd feed the paper tape
back into the system when it was online
and it would run and then would quickly
disconnect if you got even less than a
minute you didn't have to pay for the
call so we were pretty good at that
one of my first program we programmed
basic up on the local councils mainframe
nicl computer and we were allowed to
store five files up on their machine so
the very first very first but pretty
much the first program I wrote was a
basic program that would store other
basic programs inside itself and then
extract them out so you can run them so
it's kind of like my first piece of
Metro programming was in basic which is
kind of fun got my first summer job
programming language called nickel which
is a bit like RPG which is a bit like
hell and we were programming it using
these kind of hand punches so you would
sit there and you'd punch the cards by
using corded combinations with your
fingers right you learn not to make
mistakes very early on the compiler were
using is kind of fun the compiler came
in a card deck and it was about that
long and it had different colors
different color cards and what you did
is you took your program cards and you
stick them between the blue and the
green all right you stick your cards in
there and you feed it into the card
reader to all those who the card reader
begin to end and then a minute later the
card punch would wake up and it would
punch out some cards and you would take
those cards and you put them between the
second and the third sections in the
compiler deck and feed it through again
and you keep doing that until your
program was compiled it was a multipass
compiler is literally it was fantastic
so we had a whole bunch of fun doing
that where she got paid for it which was
rather nice when I went to college we
graduated from that to this the old IBM
029 card punch I got really good at
these and we would take there and we
punch out deck of cards and we take it
and put it outside the computer center
and every like hour the operators to
come take our card decks and stick him
in and then we get the printouts out a
bit later on after a while I actually
got to work inside the center so I got a
job actually helping you know run the
the mainframes and we used to give tours
to schools and stuff and
I'm infamous because the old IBM
mainframes the 370 smaller series were
micro programmed all right and so when
they first start off they load the
microcode into memory and that then
turns them into an IBM 370 and they
start executing a code and so there's a
light on the front it actually had two
bulbs behind it had a white bulb and a
red bulb and when you did the is called
the impl the initial microprogram load
you push that button it goes red and
then as its loading it goes pink and
then when it's loaded it goes white
right and I was like all three thought
was really cool and you could pull the
button off and you could see the two
bulbs right so your school parties would
come along and I shay and this is the
thing that does that look how it does it
I pull the thing off and they go whoo we
just pulled something out of the
computer and they see the two bulbs and
then I put it back on again except the
one time I put it on just a little bit
too hard and I hard booted the computer
and I had 30 people in the lab next door
oh come scream at me because I just lost
all of their work so don't ever hire me
to do operations please so I've been one
of these people as always love languages
computer languages I'm lousy at human
languages but I've loved computer
languages and i've i've programmed quite
a few there's some really quite fun ones
that should be bcpl I'm not bcp sorry
about that one of my favorite on that
list is apt is anybody ever done any
numerical control programming ah apt
it's a really old fashioned your
vertical control you sit there you write
the program and it produces a paper tape
that you feed into a you know a milling
machine and it will sit there it will
make them those shapes for you and the
cool thing is that at you it's
constraint-based so you can define like
control points and say I want to line
between here and here and then I won't
go around here and it knows about the
radius of the tool and it can adjust the
points and everything else what it
cannot do is work out you're about to
cut its own arm off and so you have to
be really really careful when you're
using it not to actually have the thing
backtrack over but yeah we all have
great fun like carving our initials and
blocks of Steel so that was kind of fun
does anybody remember comp lang misc yay
all the old farts are on this side right
so back in the back when computers were
computers you know we didn't have any of
this fancy you know sort of web stuff we
had complained misc which was one of the
usenet newsgroups and people who
published or created languages would
post op the comp plan miskin says hey I
got this brand new language and you
would download the source code to build
it downloading the source code meant
getting 20 or 30 messages that contained
the UU encoded source code and
concatenate them all together then
decoding it and then spending four days
trying to work out how to get the
dependencies right so it would build
yeah but I used to do that used to love
doing that so once twice a week I'd be
downloading one of these languages and I
would play around with it and most of
the time I would just throw it away
after a little while but as you'll learn
in a second I came across one that made
really a fundamental difference to my
life and I'll talk about that after
Bruce's embarrassed himself
a little bit more interesting so I'll
make well make up with that by making
mine longer so or just make it just
seems longer yeah they days right so
Dave loves languages I've had a
love-hate relationship with languages
until very recently my first programming
experience was a birthday present this
puppy was a trs-80 color computer 4k of
ran 4k right yet 16 rows of 32
characters across this baby was tricked
out didn't even have to buy a monitor
you just plug it into the TV right same
thing at our high school boomba down
level these were black and white but I
got to tell you I really loved basic
it's not a manly thing to say at a
conference like that but i really love
basic and all good things have to happen
have to come to an end i graduated high
school and went to mississippi state for
undergrad university of texas for
graduate work mostly we use pascal do
you guys remember the old UCSD Pascal
compilers so Pascal is not a sexy
language it's a very wise language so I
I like Pascal all good things must come
to an end so i graduated from from
Mississippi State went to went to work
at IBM where I kind of saw in the museum
some of the things that Dave's been
working on and so I used mostly to see
family of languages C C++ and later Java
probably more Java than anything else
and I had a relationship with Java so
after a little while at IBM you reach a
point in your career where you could
either you get that last technical
promotion and you can either shipped
over to the management track or you can
leave or just kind of top out at your
career so
I decided to leave I joined a start-up
which blew up immediately write some i'm
in my solo career now so that's another
word of saying another way of saying
consultant which is another way of
saying independent or I'm sorry
unemployed with business cards right I
still had this love-hate relationship
with languages wrote books and even in
my books I had a love-hate relationship
with languages bitter and better right
you know this one was first this
actually at one point it struck a nerve
with people not based on the content of
the book but based on the title and so I
got slashdot it and this thing started
rising the Amazon rankings and and for
one hour I was between Hawking's and
Grissom just one hour right number eight
on Amazon not eight and computer boats
bday for all books on amazon so I was
kind of cool but this was the better
book and it went a jolt and so I was
kind of feeling full of myself and I met
Dave Thomas at a conference and we were
on a shuttle back to back to the airport
you remember this shuttle Dave in
Atlanta I do yeah so I once he formally
accuse you for wrecking my java career
hey you know you're one of many well
played sir so we had this conversation
and for those of you who have met Dave
he's a consummate Willet bridge
gentleman always polite but I hit him
with some pretty aggressive questions
you know about Java and Ruby and they
got and the answers were not what I
expected them to be so I did what any
southern gentleman would do I got more
aggressive more to religion and finally
I ticked Dave off which is the only time
that I've ever heard it happened before
since he said shut up go do something
non trivial and Ruby and then we can
talk and that's the piece of advice that
wrecked my java program
this was a book I wrote because I didn't
want to code job anymore and I didn't
believe that i could sell ruby to a
manager but I believed that at the time
we were writing applications big fat web
UI's to babysit a relational database
over and over and Ruby could do that and
it could do that very well and we could
train a ruby developer a Java developer
to right Ruby more quickly than we could
train a Java developer on the new java
stuff which is kind of a scary thing for
me so this quote had another important
impact this word non-trivial eventually
became an idea that will gosh I kind of
see Ruby as this beautiful language to
me that I love love probably more than I
should and I don't think that this will
scale into the architectures and
business problems we're going to be need
to be throwing at it so I was afraid and
I started coding I started looking at
languages and I couldn't really see
where the future was going and that was
an unusual experience to me so I just
started coding non-trivial program
problems in different languages and I
thought that my audience might like to
share the experience with me so it was
kind of a book that was born by accident
but there was another guy who was having
the same doubts about Ruby and right
after I published the book he picked up
the book I didn't know anything about
about it at the time but we were both
looking for something different for some
quality that was missing in Ruby that we
weren't really finding it didn't really
match the way that we thought in the
languages in this book but of course you
know that this guy's name was jose a
gotland the greater of elixir yep cool
alright so that's history now we're
going to have a nice bit of soft
touchy-feely stuff all right so we
talked about
loving languages and we talked about
being excited by languages but I mean
how can you do that right a language is
just a tool it's just a bit of software
how can you possibly love a language how
can you possibly fall in love with a
language and it's something I think
about a lot because I often say that I
do you know I often tell people do
things that you love but I mean what
does that really mean in terms of
Technology and casting around for you
know some kind of explanation of this I
used to put up pictures of people and
say anybody know who this is right in
the old days it used to be easy you know
it would be a guy's deal or something
now it's like you know sort of more more
obscure original even bother so this is
Christopher Alexander and here are a
number of books on architecture the
morning a reference is called the
timeless way of building he is a darling
of the patterns movement in fact the
entire concept of software patents comes
from him because he created
architectural patterns to describe the
process by which buildings were could be
designed it turns out that the software
patents people totally misunderstood
what Alexander was talking about and
there's actually a famous oopsla I think
2003 when he actually gives a keynote
and basically says you're away d it
which is well well worth watching but he
talks about there is a central quality
which is the root criterium of life and
spirit in a man see I told you it's
going to be touchy feely a town a
building or a wilderness this quality is
objective and precise but it cannot be
named and he's talking here about the
things that are important when you're
thinking about building something and
this became known as the quality without
a name or as it's commonly abbreviated
in the patents movement Kwang all right
Q W a.m. what does Quan actually mean
well it kind of means whatever you want
it to mean it's one of these I know it
when I see it things Alexander himself
has come to call this completeness the
idea that something is is self-contained
and wrapped up this morning John
actually gave a really nice quote which
I guess stolen and added into this
presentation few minutes ago it seems
there's a positive correlation between
the simplicity of the rules and the
quality of the algebra is a description
tool that is that quality without a name
you might even call it the soul of
something right the the essence of
something it's one of those things where
you really can't describe it that easily
but you know it when you see it for
example which of these two do you say
would illustrate that quality it's a
trick question most people most people
will go here but there are some people
for whom that holds the quality and
that's perfectly reasonable but one of
them does have a quality the other one
doesn't have just to be topical here
which of these two would you say had the
quality without a name well this guy is
cheaper it's engineered you can see all
the triangles and stuff so it must be
engineered right this guy's clearly
wasteful it's got like non optimal
structure there but I think most people
would say this is the more elegant this
is the more humane of the two this is
the one that has the quality bring you a
background a bit which has the quality
it depends but I think probably most
people would say this is more expressive
this captures what I want to do so there
is this element of quality without a
name which I could call soul in just
about everything everything that we use
and I want to talk just quickly about
what I think might be this quality in
Ruby and in elixir and these are just
random thoughts right so when I first
came to Ruby I downloaded it off comp
lang misc and I put it all together I
got us compile it was Ruby 1.4
in 1997 I think anyway and it was
actually recognizable as we were we have
today I downloaded it not long ago and
it's yeah you can still code on it quite
nicely and I fell in love with it I fell
in love with it so much that I know
download in the morning got it working
by midday I was playing in the afternoon
normally a language would last about
half an hour before I throw it away and
get on with my real job I was still
using Ruby that evening the next day I
called Andy and said hey you going to
try this this is pretty cool and
basically at that point forward ruby was
my go-to language for small tasks I
loved it it just worked for me so let me
tell you some of the things that
attracted me to it and these are
superficial there's a whole bunch of
other things that people will like one
of the cool things to me is it doesn't
have separate compilation phase right
it's not that it's interpreted it looks
like it's a compiled language but
actually execute code the whole time so
here I can do like useful things like
initialize a constant in a class with
code that i execute during compilation
and that could be arbitrary complex code
so for example I me or my classic
anagram solver builds the list of
signatures as a constant which is kind
of nice not a big deal but it just felt
nice after I came from see it's got
really nice net meta programming which
is I know a bit controversial in some
circles but for me again it was really
nice so here's an example of a web
server written in Sinatra if you're
interested I will take offers an IPO but
it's not exactly phenomenal you can do
cool things with Sinatra I didn't
realize you could do this but here we
can have a web server which is
non-deterministic on the URL that you go
to so 110 to the time it will say you
want a car otherwise it will say sorry
you lost which is kind of fun Ruby also
has duck typing which means that the
objects and classes are all open at
runtime so here for example I need
a server a web server or something that
would respond with a 404 during a unit
test and run go to all the trouble of
going and getting a mock object library
or somehow doing that I just created an
object in this case is a string and I
added the query method to that string
that would always return a 404 and then
I just passed that string into my
application as if it was a regular web
server and it returns the 404 structure
to me that is just so sweet all right it
just it's lovely just being able to do
that kind of simple thing it just means
my languages it get out of my way and
let me do what I want to do of course I
don't care I mean there are cat people
there are dog people right there are
Ruby people there python people there
are people who like one thing like
another thing that's wonderful
aesthetics changes and everybody is
different but I think everybody can have
things that trigger warm feelings when
you're using something let's do the same
thing for a lick sir but just really
quickly so here's an example of you know
code that we have all written in C like
languages and the problem with this code
is that explaining it to your
grandmother is not trivial right how do
you pause it well what you actually have
to do is you first of all work out that
this is an assignment so the cool thing
is over here now we're going to skip
forward until we hit the innermost
nesting right yes grandma there isn't in
the most nesting word right so now we're
going to apply this to that and
effectively substitute in that there
then apply that to that and then that to
that and then finally we get our result
it sounds a really trivial syntactic
thing and by elixir is not the only
language that has this by a long way but
this idea of being ought to pipe the
result of one function in as the
parameter to the next makes a
significant difference it is not just a
syntactic nicety because what this does
is it changes the way you think about
programming because once you start
writing code in a language such as a
lick sir or Haskell or whatever else you
are no longer thinking about programs as
being objects as being you know clumps
of data and clumps of functions that
work on everything else no programming
is now nothing more than transformation
all you're doing is transforming stuff
you start at the top you get to the end
and along the way you go through all of
these nested transformations but when
you're starting off it's actually quite
hard to think about things in terms of
transformations for example a web
application actually it's nothing more
than the transformation it takes a
request and transforms it into a
response and that sounds glib but the
entire basis of the Phoenix framework is
a set of these nested transformations
and the cool thing is you can get
yourself injected anywhere you want in
that chain so thinking about things in
terms of transformations changes the way
i think about programming so that one
simple little operator there changes the
way i thought about programming and that
made a big difference to me because
functions transform data and that's all
we have to do now speaking about
functions you know that elixir kind of
looks a little bit like a sea like
language so for example i have like a
case statement here i'm going to open a
file and that's going to return the
tuple either okay or error and i had to
do things depending right and suddenly
we seem to have lost our functional
pneus all right suddenly we seem to be
back in C or Java or whatever else and
increasingly I'm trying to find myself
doing things without writing code this
way i want to write code purely as
transformations and it turns out in the
elixir I can do that because my case is
simply a function and so I can I can
here's my farm name I pass it through
open the result comes back if it matches
that then I'm going to process it
otherwise I'm going to do the report
again it's not a major deal
it's not like you know earth
shatteringly different but it does make
a difference to the way I think and the
way I code and the way I perceive the
world okay so when we're talking about
functions quick pop quiz and it's kind
of helped by the fact we have a syntax
highlighter on here how many keywords
are there in this piece of code yeah
unique unique yes unique three four five
three four or five well it depends what
you mean a risk of doing a bill it
depends what you mean by keyword
arguably there are 0 but very most there
are two and those two actually are
merely syntactic sugar and that's due
and end right you don't actually need
any keywords because I could have
written this as a comma do colon and
then expression right so let's see all
that's doing is it's simply replacing
that block as a parameter on a keyword
list into the deafening so actually
technically not but in terms of the
lexer too and the reason for that is
that just about everything in elixir is
defined in elixir so this is just from
the kernel module there's a whole bunch
of other ones that do this as well but
these are the things that are defined as
macros or functions directly in elixir
so here's our case that we use
previously death is there def module is
somewhere somewhere yet if is over there
all of this lot is defined in elixir
itself so you can say that the language
is the language
the cool thing about that is that all of
these things that means they're all soft
I can redefine them yeah or I can call
them so if i wanted to generate a method
on the fly i can just call that def
macro and passing the necessary
parameters and it defines a method for
me if I wanted to change the meaning of
assignment or binding I guess more
accurately going to change the meaning I
can do that and in fact the test the
test framework that comes with elixir
does exactly that so that when you write
a pattern match that fails in an
assertion it actually is going through a
altered version of equals because then
it can actually report the left hand
side the right hand side and why they're
different pretty damn cool do you want
to go in there and change absolutely all
of the syntax of language course not
this is one of those great power great
responsibility things right but to me it
makes me happy knowing that I can do
that that if I needed to I can get in
there if i want to write a version of
death that actually logs its parameters
because i got some debugging issue i can
do it and i can do it cleanly using sat
safe macros in the language it's just
it's a small thing and it makes me
comfortable it makes me kind of fall and
love that little bit more this is really
pedestrian but really important I love
love love the fact that an elixir I've
got great documentation out of the gate
so I've got the elixir guides which are
a fantastic introduction to the language
obviously not as good as a certain book
but not a bad introduction to the
language
all right we have a documentation on all
of the api's nice looking with lots of
examples I mean phenomenal number of
examples if you are inside the shell you
can get help on individual functions and
again you get the full the full stuff
it's really fantastic one last thing
that I really like about elixir is this
kind of empathy that I can feel this
kind of love I feel from the team that
created it to me as a developer and one
of the cool ways that that's exhibited
is this is the suggested template for an
emacs gin server it's not cool i can
actually scroll inside the slide like
that so that's the code it's 128 lines
long of which 22 lines of code so now
yay documentation the equivalent code an
elixir would be there not a big deal not
slam on or a leg but the fact that
someone said you know what it would be
really nice if we could take that
boilerplate away because it gets in the
way of the code you know and so use gin
server actually stubs out all of those
methods but allows me to override them
when I need to so that's an important
important thing important idea here's an
example of agents written an actual gin
server actually used using that and with
elixir the Quan goes on alright there's
all sorts of things everybody who uses
it will have their own list I don't care
they're just fantastic things that make
the language just feel nice feel good
and so that's why I'm really keen to
spread the word about elixir because I
would like people to feel good when they
code and the important thing is that
Quan is two-way right we are inspired in
the presence of quality we behave
differently in the presence
quality we will treat this building way
better than we treat some rundown
warehouse room because we respect it so
inner lick sir pipelines and protocols
inspire us to code in terms of
transformations behaviors and macros
inspire us to code in the domain and not
in the implementation great
documentation inspires us to write more
than code and by doing that it makes us
think about the code that we're writing
a little bit more modularity and the
release manager inspires to write tiny
apps and deploy more often and great
leaders inspire us to emulate them but
this is difficult over 8,000 meters it's
hard climbing is not the hardest
mountain in the world to climb but it's
it's close it wasn't summit until the
first time until nineteen fifty three by
this man the guy on the left for you sir
edmund hillary and i want to make a
suggestion that mountain climbers and
language makers are in some ways the
same language making at its core is
seeking Kwan if you think about it a
language maker provides a way to do
something that you could do before you
had the language but the improvements
are some in the experience are sometimes
hard to quantify language making is also
hard nobody is going to just mount an
assault on well only the most elite
climbers can just mount an assault and
fly up Mount Everest the problem is that
there's this thing at the top called the
death zone and and that's the area over
8,000 feet and over 8,000 feet you've
got about thirty percent of the air that
you do down at sea level and that makes
the brain do crazy things and
most of the deaths on Everest happened
over that over that line and what that
means is that rather than racing to the
top you have to establish a lot of
intermediate camps and the logistics
kill you right and so the same thing
happens when you're creating the
language you're not just building a
language you're building also the
ecosystem you're building you have to
bring the individual user is a law
language making is also messy on Everest
it's becoming famous that the places
that people go have a lot of garbage
have water bottles bottles that have
oxygen bottles any kind of trash that
you can imagine language makers often
experience the fact that that some of
the aspects of creating the language are
messy sometimes you have to say no and
some people don't respond to the word no
the way that you might expect them to I
recently got to spend some time with
josee in Poland and we were on a train
and we were talking about productivity
and he was asking me Bruce how does make
how does elixir make your life more
productive and I told him and I asked
him what makes you more productive and
he said well I'd like to answer that
question a little differently i'd like
to talk about what makes me not as
productive and the answer really
surprised me he said you know we have a
great technical team i spend a lot of
time with Chris McCord on Phoenix I
spent a lot of time with with james
fisher on OTP we've got a great
technical team the hard thing is when
some people respond in hostile ways to
this thing that I built that brings me
down and I find it hard to goats fast
and I thought about it and I'm very much
the same way and i bet you guys are too
but language making is sometimes a messy
endeavor so with all of these things
stacked up against a climber or a
language maker how do you ever reach the
top Hugh Serpas of course
so Sherpas are an ethnic group living on
near the border between Nepal and Tibet
to live at a higher altitude and they
can function higher on Everest they can
do things high on Everest that we would
struggle to do it's the level I don't
want to talk about a few of those things
the Sherpas help build camps the base
camp and the bottom at the bottom and
the intermediate camps that go up the
mountain what happens is that when
you're climbing Everest all but the most
lead climbers they have to climb up
higher to acclimate themselves and then
down lower to actually let their bodies
recover so the Sherpas are the ones that
make the camp and in fact we experience
the base camps every day that Joe
Armstrong and in Robert and bike created
in the form of the Erlang language
that's more than just a base camp for
our day-to-day jobs it formed the
foundation for a lot of the messaging
traffic in the world for a lot of the
world's economy with the with the
acquisition of the whatsapp and all of
the software that's built on top but it
also built the foundation for look sir
so this is the early early commit story
for the elixir programming language now
what are you that this period right here
represents Joe's A's great decision so
Chris do you remember what he called
this this period of like helplessness
when not many commits were happen
happening yeah so so we were at a we
witnessed two keynote together in Austin
he said I called this the valley of
despair I was trying to build a language
myself that was on the beam right and
the beam was going to be everything that
he needed to establish this new language
but after thinking about it he said no
that's not enough I need to carry a lot
of the early
goodness with me it needs to be a
hundred percent compatible we need OTP
we need the concurrency constructs in
the current concurrency story I also
need to lean on other communities well
as well like the closure community that
enables the meta programming that
enables the macro that enable elixir to
be built in the language itself Jose's
great decision happen right here and
then you saw elixir explode and the
commits never back off to that level
again Sherpas carry the heaviest loads
hey what do you need I need somebody to
bring up kitchen up to base camp well
I'll take the two water basins in the
chimney and and my friend here will
carry the cast-iron stove how many do
you need just two right sherco scary the
heaviest loads so there was a time when
I decided to build to actually commit to
a lick sir for my company there wasn't a
web server yet and my boss asked me hey
what web server do you want to use that
said well there's not one that exists
yet and then he said well okay so we
can't use the liquor right side note I
have a plan so josee had this thing
called dynamo but it was very clear that
that was too much of a load for one
person you can't build a language had a
web server at the same time not even if
here's Jose so I said look this is
madness he said I don't have anybody
that I can lean on to build a web server
I said okay that's okay let's build a
web server kit let's build a lego kit so
that somebody else can come along and
build the web server he said who's going
to build that I said I don't know let's
go fishing and we kind of sharper chris
mccoy becker that built phoenix using
that framework sure Prez prepared the
way this is the computing barrier on the
path up to and this other route up
Everest sometimes there are chasms that
are too wide for
right like the chasm between Phoenix and
elm the keynote that you saw we need a
Sherpa that understands better than we
do to help bridge the gap between the
areas so you guys might be looking at me
and saying Bruce I'm really really
uncomfortable with this analogy I know
the history of Sherpas and Mount Everest
has been climbed on the back of an
oppressed people I'm not saying to climb
on the back of an oppressed people what
I'm saying is that we are all Sherpas
this is our ecosystem you can write a
test you can write code you can start a
conference you can tell other people
what you saw at this conference we are
all Sherpas and we define what happens
in this ecosystem everything that you do
affects what's going to happen with the
people that come after you but we can
share the load not because we have to
but because we're blessed and that
should make you happy and that's what
language you should do any questions
stunned they'll stung so let me set
something up that we probably should
have set up at the beginning so it's
really this is a great moment for me to
be able to share the stage with Dave and
the reason is that he's got a sense of
of Quan and he's able to see it before
the rest of us can and the reason that
we should listen to him in this context
is that he he kind of discovered he was
the first one to to see what was
happening with Ruby and wrote the
pickaxe book and helped write the book
for the web servers and also notice what
was happening with the Phoenix language
and that's kind of why this this talk
was put together so that we could kind
of see
from the perspective of a user in the
community and from the perspective is
somebody who's actually identified
what's happening early before the
explosion of language yeah I can believe
that so yeah any other questions okay
that's all God thank you so very much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
