to say if you think how we introduced
closure into our companion stack it will
be about the closure or example because
it will be also how you can introduce
any new different context neurology into
your stack so maybe i will start with
some context because i don't think
presentation like that will be good
without context this is a very very
white industry and we need some
introduction okay like was said i was
i'm working this mud recruiters we are
not recruiters I want to try to recruit
you all later after presentation we are
making soft for the HR industry and
during our drink our beginning we
started as a java ee manal it but
portfolio of our creams growth we also
have more feature requests we needed to
grow also our development team and with
bigger development team we changed our
architecture now we have something we
can call Micro services and majority of
these micro services are in Java EE yeah
there are companies we are making
microservices in Java EE but we don't
like that approach we start with Java EE
because we have a lot of code in it a
lot of tooling to work with javi but
unfortunately this approach has
drawbacks and this drawbacks our
application servers because they are
really resource intensive they are real
waste for the analytic approach their
way quite good unfortunately or rather
fortunately now we live in a different
world we are using a mazal for skies
storing our infrastructure and small
instances on Amazon are far less cost
effective for better cover fective that
bigger one what's more we are getting
into docker I think like a majority of
the South companies and if you have Java
in the docker it's already quite big
image if you also have application
server
your daughter becomes obese so we were
looking for something different a first
try was like rice warm it's quite
interesting project which goal is to
wrap whole staff of java ee to single
executable jar it was looking promising
unfortunately for two years of developer
development it didn't produce anything
that is production value it's not ready
for anything so we decided that we will
go out of our comfort zone in
compounding we have something which is
called hackerspace it's one hour drink a
week where sound hall when Southall
company is meeting together and we are
watching presentation could be internal
it will be external it must be
interesting and one of them was
presentation of guy from wound released
Duncan Davidson about how they make Dave
stack the polyglot 'ok and we decided
that if they could do that we also can
and amount of ideas flourished everybody
had hanging on every girl you had idea
one of them was closed and we decided
that we want to go that way but with
technology that it's a third leg closure
for java guys there is a problem there
is matrix which is called bass fact you
can have really great developers in her
company but if you for example have a
master of clutter in your company and he
will do your application and he will be
heated by a bus there is a problem maybe
not for a developer under the bus
because he don't get any problems
anymore but for the management and
people who decide which technology we
can use it something they need to think
about we need to do something with that
I'm a big fan of TED talks and I think
my favorite is direct about how to start
the movement I don't have time to
show it all but the main pin point of
this presentation is that when someone
is coming with strange idea and he's
alone he is considered just a crazy
person but where he starts to having
first follower first per hour is
bringing validation and it really is yet
to find another one but like we said
before closure is hard it's not readable
when you first time read it so you need
to take as much burden from the back of
your fellow developers as possible and
now context strikes again in our company
we have small teams which consists the
back end developers front-end developers
and testers and they are working in a
single business domain they are can be
considered domain specialist we have a
few things like that and in idea Lord if
you want to change something in
someone's other domain you would just
made a feature request for them but we
are not living in the perfect world
because sometimes the team you need to
have something changed have no time and
you are inherited so you need to do it
yourself and we are doing that using
poor requests and you know what when you
just need to read in some order cut it
sometimes frustrating if you don't know
how to even start the project it's
frustrating even more because someone is
saying that you need just needs our
depth at that and you just don't know
don't won't know what to do later so for
me it's really really important to make
a good impression if you don't want
people to hate technology truth in this
example closure because with closure you
need JVM and as a Java is developed
we have the vm on our computers but you
also have mortal ink and you need to
provide an easy way to install it it can
be just read me MD but it needs to be
good to get me MD or i would suggest to
some kind of the installation script to
make this pain easier if you are crazy
and you like new ideas you can track
something like that it's during this
dark mark on the guy from google is
proposing and showing event how to rap
full closure stack even ide into a
docker container so it's crazy idea but
really were to take a look it's option
to provide a truly repeatable
independent environment for every
developer but what you know you are
moved the only other program is on the
entities that need to build a code of
your company this guy also needs to do
that and in our technology stack we are
using Gradle to run our continuous
integration and like you have seen
before we are also using for example
note and for note as this is not java
technology we've needed to make a rapper
what we talked last that if we are using
closure which is java in the internal of
course we wouldn't have problems like
that oh you know grayble don't have
third-party support to closure there are
2 3rd party plugins but 3rd party
plugins of the market have had problems
with our 3rd party plugins and through a
years of development we have a lot of
them unfortunately we ended up with just
making a greater rapper / lane and when
you will be trying to introduce new
technology
you will have em you will have a more
more problems like that they will be
helping from any direction so i think
it's crucial to choose small target
because bigger one can kill you you can
be the best closure programming the
market but you are not just writing
closure you are writing closure in the
context or you're off your company and
it's totally different lists because if
you have even great side projects you
probably don't have problem with
different databases active you are just
using the database you like a lot you
don't need to connect for something
different you don't have complex
security reier layer that probably like
in our case was working on proper sherry
liar like interceptors in Java EE and
you don't need to provide java client
because because you don't need to
cooperate with a Java Lord in a job
award in your companion it everything
like that took time and your project
project probably will be late and you
know who will be where the hability for
the project that you are lay that it's
rate probably you but also your
technology and its words you can do to
make bad first impression because if
first impression will be bad probably
there will be no second so I suggest
that you should start small meet your
enemy and start use it as a framework to
start thinking about something bigger
because even a small victory is better
than biggest deal being defeated by the
biggest enemy because this small victory
build trust and that trust that change
at toys for developers into market a sec
and still you know what's even more
important than having trust in your
technology stack that your clients have
draft in software you are developing for
them and problem can come from a
direction you can't expect that they
will be possible to that you will know
them before a project they can happen to
the biggest player on the market so you
need monitoring because they will happen
also for you it's our outer space and we
are seeing it sometimes and when it is
we want to overcome problems as fast as
possible that's why we need monitoring
for that we know we need to know what's
inside our application in the case of
closure we are already in a good
position because we have JVM and as a
java developers we love JVM we love gvm
a lot because we know how to scale it we
know how to debug it we have tools to
monitor it we also have a lot of
technology agnostic to link which for
example makes wonderful graphs for our
DevOps but those graphs needs to be
provided with some data in our case that
our help text and every one application
needs to provide information that is
alive on the simple endpoint and for the
java application we had another
dependency it was CDI expand extension
that was doing that just plug and play
and you have something up your
application done by like that but we
were thinking how to port it to the
closure but after a moment of
impressions we recognize that we don't
need because that is just stupid
endpoint
and need to provide information if
something is life or not why made
another dependency for something like
that so just making an end point and
there are a lot situations like that for
example we are using custom rappers over
java / apache HTTP clients and those
rapper providers throttling providers
custom headers inside that and if you
would like to we can use in enclosure
because closure is can interoperate with
java but unfortunately it don't look
good because it's 4-inch body in your
code and this code is maybe not bad but
definitely not a dramatic and we also
were thinking about using this client
may be porting something maybe making
another rapper of it but then we took a
strict step back while we are using
closure because closure is expressive
and something that is dependency in a
java ee we can make in 20 lines of code
so you need to remember about it you are
choosing your tools on purpose and use
them wisely concluding if you want to
have a seamless see adding something to
your technology stack you need to have a
grasp of power we need to control
application I would also suggest you to
choose your target wisely and without a
fellow colleagues who helped you you
shouldn't even start because it's not
worth it but it's worth it if you have
all the ingredients you know what I
cannot show you a code but remember when
I was talking about the health checks
this one is from our first closure
application on production it's not
something complex
it's not something fancy but it's waving
to us and saying hello I'm there on your
production and making work for you and
that is a glorious feeling thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
