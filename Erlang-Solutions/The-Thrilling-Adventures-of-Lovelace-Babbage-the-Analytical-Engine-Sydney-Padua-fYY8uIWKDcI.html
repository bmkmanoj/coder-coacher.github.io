here's thinking uh I'm speaking actually
about the opposite of an emerging
technology my knowledge of programming
actually ends in about 1860 and speaking
about this machine the analytical engine
today I don't I'm not a programmer have
any kind I'm a cartoonist and an
animator normally I work in visual
effects films so this sort of thing a
jungle book most recently and so I work
with computers and often against
computers but normally I would not be
asked to speak at a programming
conference but the the reason I'm here
is because of these two guys if you
don't recognize them they you might have
come across them in computer history 101
Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage Babbage
was the occasion professor of
mathematics in the 1830s and Ada
Lovelace was often known as the first
programmer I first met them in 2009
myself a friend of mine sue Sharman
started a thing called Ada Lovelace day
which you might be familiar with it's an
online festival to celebrate women in
computing and she named it after Ada and
asked me if I would do a little comic
introduction to who she was I didn't
know who she was so I looked her up in
Wikipedia and drooler fallen comic
online so Ada Lovelace was the daughter
of Lord Byron famous poet she never met
her father's her mother left him when
she was about a year old um Byron if you
don't know who he is was a very great
poet but also very crazy womanizer slept
around went mad and it is weather was
very worried that she would inherit this
wild blood of her father's so she
actually had her trained in mathematics
and logic from a very young age as this
was the opposite of poetry and it should
balance her out she met so Charles
Babbage was very famous at the time not
only is a big mathematical genius but
also is the inventor of something called
the difference engine which you might
have heard of
it was a basically an adding machine it
was called Babbage's calculating machine
or Babbage's engine and it's its sole
purpose was to add very large numbers to
produce logarithmic tables at the time
tables of logarithms were computed by
human beings they were often full of
mistakes so rather took this task of
inventing a machine that would do
addition automatically and print out the
results as well he took a very large
government grant to do this 17,000
pounds at the time which is always
measured as the cost of two worships but
Babbage was a difficult personality and
never actually succeeded in building the
difference engine she met a debate
Babbage at a party in 1833 the thing
he's leaning on here is the only part of
the difference engine he ever built a
small piece about this big Anna became
fascinated with the concept of this
machine she immediately asked him for
the blueprints for it and studied it to
see how it worked but she was more
fascinated sorry this is from the comics
so I was making jokes lovely sort of
undertook to become an expert on this
machine but more specifically on
Babbage's second machine the analytical
engine one of the reasons Babbage never
finished the difference engine is about
the same year he met ADA he became he
had a vision of a more complete machine
for arithmetic that could add subtract
multiply and divide as opposed to the
difference engine which was just an
adder he called it the analytical engine
he abandoned the plans for the
difference engine and began working
exclusively on this machine but she also
never finished but he left quite
thorough plans and this machine is
famous as the first design for computer
it had a memory was programmed with
punch cards
basically a CPU
and this is the machine that ada
lovelace also became obsessed with and
she wrote programs for it and also the
only published paper on the machine and
how it worked
Babbage himself never published anything
under this machine he was always trying
to perfect it before he actually took it
to the public so ada wrote a translation
of a french paper in the machine and
began adding footnotes her footnotes are
three times longer than the paper that
she was translating and in those
footnotes are some of the more complex
programs so this is the Bernoulli
numbers program it's more of a state
table it's obviously it's a little fuzzy
to call something a program for a
machine like this but so this was
published in 1843
unfortunately ada died a few years later
and Babbage never finished any of his
machines this was the comic I drew
initially in 2009 it's quite short and
it was just a way of explaining who they
were but for the comic I thought this
was a very stupid ending with everybody
dies and nothing happens so I added the
following panel if you're familiar with
steampunk you know that there's this
whole science fiction sort of retro
futurist concept of Babbage actually
building this machine so I thought I'd
added this joke about them I think I was
thinking of the Avengers this joke
sometimes works if this joke were spent
on the United Kingdom's and it does you
know maybe it's a very nice show but I
thought they sort of looked like them
say it was just a joke but when I put
the comic online it turned up in white
blog a few days later saying this person
is going to do a comic about Ada
Lovelace and Charles Babbage fighting
crime which I hadn't any intention of
doing at the time the comic was it was
just a one shot and that panel was a
joke but I'd become very interested in
these guys in the subject and I was in
search of a project to put off working
on other projects so I began drawing
comics online very rough webcomic this
comic I worked on for about five years
eventually turned into a book which won
the British Society for history
mathematics prize last year which was a
very nice and very strange event for an
animator like me the reason the comic
got a lot of attention from mathematics
historians sorry I should first say the
comic itself is pretty silly they fight
crime they fight it badly because
otherwise it wouldn't be funny and it's
also good in character for them to to be
a bit silly and that's part of the comic
when I was just drawing episodes I'd
start adding footnotes at the bottom of
each comic explaining the history and
what I was reading about it at the time
I'm not a historian of any kind and
certainly not a mathematician or a
computer scientist I really just became
fascinated with the people and the
history and the thing that really made
this work was actually google books I
was very fortunate in that the Euro
started the comic was the year that
Google books really started putting huge
volumes of 19th century material online
and that meant that some random clown
like me could just put in Babbage or
Lovelace into the search terms and get
this incredible amount of
never-before-seen historical material on
them because both of these people were
very very famous in their own time
anyone who met Charles Babbage would
write a journal entry or write to their
local paper about it and it's a lot of
really fun stuff I loved the Babbage the
log-log Ruth medical Frankenstein
here's ada lovelace describing her
family as an alternate stratification of
poetry in mathematics Babbage thought if
he was blind he could write poetry I
don't know why he thought he had to be
blind to write poetry this has never
explained one thing that these documents
really help to do is make them concrete
as human beings both Babbage and
Lovelace very charming very strange very
difficult people with very big
personalities which made them excellent
for comic books the average in
particular
he wrote an autobiography which I highly
recommend everyone read it's it's very
very idiosyncratic
and from reading about who he was I was
trying to get a sense of his body
language and as fortunately after I drew
this I found out that I was fairly
accurate about it this is from punch
magazine 1851 this is Babbage very angry
about having his engine not be featured
in the great exhibition
it is a more difficult character if
you're familiar with the history you
know she's a lot more ambiguous and a
lot more controversial figure than
Babbage's but I was very pleased to find
some stuff about her as well which
really set her up as a personality this
is the New York mirror 1833 if you can't
read it it says Oh fine it is said that
ADA Byron sole daughter of the noble
Bard is the most coarse and vulgar woman
in England and this is a sort of
material I would use in the comic just
to give you an example of the comic and
how it worked I would take something
like this and also something from the
engine itself so this is Babbage's error
pop-up which he actually designed for
the analytical engine as you can see if
you put in the wrong logarithm it would
pop up a little plate that said wrong on
it he then adds the continually ringing
loud Bell so with these two together I
would make following joke so this is a
de debugging the engine this is during
the Queen Victoria's visiting the engine
at the time so she says lady lovely
speaks so many languages were not
familiar with that one that's the
special language we're developing just
for the analytical engine so the comic
is full of jokes with footnotes at the
bottom describing the real history and
one of the things I was very pleased to
find is a plenty of proof that Babbage
and Lovelace were very close friends
this I thought was very nice this is a
letter where Babbage says he knew her
intimately and spoke highly of her
mathematical powers and her peculiar
capability higher he said than that of
anyone he knew to prepare I believe it
was the descriptions connected with his
calculating machine so this is one of
the first examples of someone having a
conversation about programming
and so that's Babbage and Lovelace and
most of the work that I did was on their
history and them as people but when I
had to well I didn't have to but when I
was asked to sit down and write a book
about them
I had a third character that was a bit
more mysterious and that's the
analytical engine and as I said earlier
I'm not a computer person I started as
an animator with hand-drawn animation
and moved quite reluctantly over to
computer animation so I'd always a
actually
I'd always drawn the engine like this as
this enormous cavern of labyrinth scene
corridors of cogs and wheels that people
are continually getting lost in this is
the author George Eliot getting her
manuscript spell-checked
so she gets a bit swallowed up by the
machine so this is the machine in the
comic it's just this mysterious and
incomprehensible space and that's the
impression that a God of the analytical
engine I always seem very fuzzy when
people introduce the machine in even
quite serious secondary sources it
tended to be described as it's it had a
memory it was basically a computer it's
too complicated to explain when I had
when I was sitting down to write a book
and I had all this secondary sources and
documentation on Babbage and Lovelace I
felt I had to also include a description
of the analytical engine and how it
worked
I was hoping at the time that I could
just steal it from some existing image
of the analytical engine and then I
found out that there wasn't one and no
one had ever sat down oh sorry no one
had ever sat down to actually visualize
the machine before
one of the reasons being that all of
beverages plans are a lot more ambiguous
than they look so this seems very solid
but for one thing there's no elevation
existing damage tended not to do
elevations of his plans and there's all
sorts of questions marks here these are
the punch cards but are they to scale
where do they go are they at the top of
the machine at the bottom of machine how
do they connect to the rest of the
mechanism and this is true for almost
every aspect of the engine there's all
these beautiful plans and then you start
looking at them more closely and you
realize there's a lot of gaps in there
another difficulty is that much of
Babbage's work he wrote in this
mechanical language that he invented so
these are each of these letters
represents one of the gears and all the
little dots and arrows and everything
are representing what it's connected to
and what it's doing Davidge did leave an
explanation of his mechanical language
unfortunately he changed his own rules
several times in the course of his
papers which makes them extremely
difficult to decipher every once in a
while you got lucky and you get a very
beautiful plan like this so sitting down
with all these various things and also
secondary sources and I should say none
of my work would have been possible
without the late Allan Bromley's work in
going over Babbage's plans and
explaining their logic behind them I was
able to produce there we go
this in so that's just scale I'm gonna
back up a little bit here
and show you this little work uh I won't
have sound this is the difference engine
beverages engines were not built in his
lifetime this was a project of Doron
Swade at the Science Museum in about the
year 2000 they set out to build the
Difference Engine from Babbage's plans
the differents engine plans are a lot
more solid than the analytical engine
ones so you can see the beautiful carry
arms these are for carrying the ones
those spiraling arms at the back and
also the printer all of these machines
both of Babbage's machines were designed
with a single purpose in mind and that
was printing books of tables neither
these machines were devised to produce a
single result for a problem they were
all devised to run through iterations of
a complex problem and print them out
because the intention was that you would
print out a set of books and then those
books would go to the university to the
actuarial you know the life insurance
office or especially in shipping where
they needed very complex mathematical
tables for navigation
so the fortunate thing is that um for me
as someone undertaking this project even
though I'm completely ignorant of
everything regarding computers and
mostly mechanical engineering as an
animator I'm used to figuring out the
logic of strange creatures and how they
work and I also have software which is
very useful for that sort of thing this
is the image I finally produced this is
something of what it would have looked
like the machine was run by a steam
engine I'm fairly sure there would have
been cats around it because it would
have been warmed I should say the the
structure that I have invented to hold
it up probably would have had to be much
much bigger and thicker the machine is
designed so that if any single part of
it is out of alignment the whole thing
stops and these are tens of thousands of
tiny gears so I have a feeling the
actual cage would have had to be almost
completely solid to hold the machine
together
the difficulty in explaining how it
works I really met when I had to do it
in a book form need like like Babbage
the reason you designed this mechanical
language is that finding a static way to
convey motion is extremely difficult
fortunately we live in the 21st century
so a much better way
all right so um this is a model I made
for myself to try to understand at least
just for my own understanding how the
machine worked I should say when I
started to make these models I made them
for the purpose of covering up my
ignorance because I assumed that there
would be all these people out there who
knew how the engine worked and would
immediately send me angry emails and
letters to explain how wrong I was and
as it turned out very very very few
people in the world actually knew how
the engine worked at all so I actually
didn't have to do all this I could have
said almost anything and people would
have said oh yes of course and I'll just
show you for a sec this is just one
slice so to get a handle on how the
machine works
it's my helpful whole thing so take a
set there you go so to understand this
machine you have to bear in mind the
purpose which is arithmetic with very
large numbers this is designed
completely to do quite simple operations
it could add subtract multiply and
divide and the reason it is so tall is
that each of these columns is a number
and you write the number on the column
by turning each of these skiers to 3 to
5 1 all the way down so you can do a 50
digit number
you know 3512 just by setting all the
gears up that way so the only reason
it's so tall is because it's Babbage
designed it to deal with numbers with
many many digits but each of these
layers does the exact same thing so it's
just replicating up it's too heavy to
move when I have it all on so you just
have to look at one slice of one digit
to get a sense of the machine so
I just thought I'd run through the
machine because I think what are the
things that computer people find so
fascinating about this machine is how
exactly it is a computer considering
this is a completely theoretical machine
designed in the 1840s Marya Li amazingly
intricate there is no comparable
Victorian machine of this level of
complexity so this is the CPU basically
processing and this is the memory so
each of these columns just going back
stores one number I have has just left
actually you can see on the plan back it
up a little bit you can see on the plan
he just lets the memory trail off the
page because everyone wants more memory
so maybe 100 maybe a thousand places
it's only limited by the racks as you'll
see in a sec and that's a mechanical
limitation it takes three different
types of punch cards to run a program
the number cards variable cards
operations cards as Babbage called them
this principle is based on the jacquard
loom if you're not familiar with this
loom it's it's got a series of punch
holes in order to read a pattern on and
the way you read patterns off a punch
card is you would have the card with so
that you'd have a card for a 50 digit
number so you'd have 50 columns of 10
rows each you put punch holes in all of
the columns and oliver rows except for
the ones with the number that you wanted
and if there's not a hole then it pushes
the lever that's the whole principle of
a punch card as you can see there's a
big blank at the bottom as to what the
levers do this is because Babbage left a
lot of that blank and a lot of it is in
a mechanical notation that we're still
trying to figure out but what it is
meant to do is read the number into the
memory and it reads it with these racks
so if you have say a 3 unpunched it
transfers that 3 to the rack and the
rack will turn three places
and the the place in the memory will
turn three places so you just duplicate
that up 50 times and now you've
transferred your 50 digit number in a
single motion the variable cards I tend
to refer them to myself as the
addressing cards I find it a bit easier
to understand so this is an addressing
system this just holds the address in
this store and you have however many
holes in those cards as you have places
in the store and whichever place you
want to read it into you just put that
on the variable card so the variable
card would say read the number on punch
card number one into location 27 say so
it would read a couple of numbers into
the storage
and the next thing that happens is
that's how you want to run an operation
so operations run with operations cards
you'll see that there's far fewer holes
in these these are quite a small card
add subtract multiply and divide and the
way these work is actually incredibly
beautiful the cards themselves are only
giving the instruction to the machine
so what the card does is it tells the
barrel to go to say the addition section
and the barrels as you can see so this
is this by the way is a sort of a
cartoon version of the engine the engine
is much bigger and more complex so each
of these barrels had I believe 50
columns and 80 rows around so they're
they're very very huge and intricate
amount of commands here and the barrels
actually operate dozens and dozens of
these levers and it's the levers that
are them she the machine language of the
engine so the operations car just says
run this operation and the barrel will
run through a wedge of instructions and
the wedge would the instruction set
would be something like fetch
the number from memory place number one
which would come from the variable card
the programmer has to set up all these
three cards themselves presumably off in
another room and a separate machine the
the program has to run through whatever
sequence of cars the programmer has set
up so fetch whatever variable whatever
the variable card says fetch it so it
runs into the ingress axis and then the
ingress axis goes over this is giant
these data bus wheels basically that
feed it into this section the way the
CPU works basically is each of these
wedges of gears is specialized gearing
to do a specific function division or
carrying of the ones or there's a thing
to figure out which is the shorter
number to do multiplication faster it's
all these very very specialized earrings
that Babbage devised
and what the levers do is send it stream
it to various sections of the machine to
do these specific jobs but let's say
we're just asking it to add so it just
feeds the machine into the addition
section feeds number one feeds number
two and then the barrels just run
through a wedge of operations one after
the other there's several dozen steps
that need to be done even for the
simplest operation Beveridge had devised
his own language for talking about these
on the barrel he called everything that
happens at the same time a vertical
because that's the vertical of pegs
that's happening simultaneously and the
sequence of operations is a train
so verticals and trains is was Babbage's
language for describing how his system
worked once the operation was done so
the barrels are just running through
their operation now feeds the number
back into the data bus spits it into the
output and then the addressing system
selects the address that it wants to
read out to and reads out so it's um
this is just very simple overview of how
this machine works I've made a few
models of various parts of the machine
but it's it's no picnic mostly because
the plans are difficult to find or they
were they have been difficult to find
and they are quite difficult to read
fortunately there is now a very exciting
year's 2017 should be for the analytical
engine the Science Museum in London has
begun to put Babbage's papers digitized
online at a high enough resolution that
we can start to crowdsource some of this
stuff so if you want to keep an eye on
what's going on with the analytical
engine or hopefully take part plan
twenty eight org
group of nerds who are trying to make
this happen and figure it out so you
might have a look at the website to come
back to the slides here so the question
is so after you've seen all this
beautiful machine and Babbage spent
about 20 years of his life obsessively
making these plans most of this stuff he
had a few assistants most of this he
paid for himself he was the classic
Victorian gentleman scientist he was
independently wealthy and the government
grant was basically wasted on the
difference engine which was never built
the analytical engine was Babbage's own
particular obsession
and you might be asking yourself what's
ADA Lovelace's part in this one of the
things that's striking about the
analytical engine is how in a ways and
it's the opposite of a Turing machine
Turing machine is a completely
theoretical
Turing didn't work out the mechanics of
the machine
he was completely absorbed in the
mathematics and the theory of what this
machine could do Babbage was completely
absorbed with the mechanics of the
machine and didn't spend much time
thinking about what then what the
potentialities of the machine was for
Babbage this was purely a completely a
device for very large arithmetic in
printing out tables it was actually
Lovelace who said in her footnotes when
you think about it this machine is not
bound by arithmetic it's significant
this is Augustus de Morgan it's
significant that he tutored ADA in her
20s right about the same time that de
Morgan was working on mathematize a
logic this is before bull Lovelace was
working about 10 years before laws of
thought so there was no very consistent
system of mathematize logic in this
period but de Morgan was taking steps
towards it so he had a he was starting
to develop a notation and a strict
system of logic as we're familiar with
it today but this is very early but it's
very clear that from her first
encounters with the analytical engine
her mind was going in this direction
that this was not an arithmetic machine
that this was a logic machine she I
should just a little side note here de
Morgan actually tried to this is a
letter that he wrote to love Lisa's
mother saying that she should probably
stop with mathematics because she was a
woman he says the reason is obvious the
very great tension of mind which they
requires beyond the strength of a
woman's physical power lady L has as
much powers required all the strength of
a man's constitution to bear the fatigue
of thought at the time the Victorians
thought that application on heavily
intellectual subjects such as
mathematics would actually damage a
woman's health
particularly the reproductive organs for
some reason they thought would be
deranged by studying mathematics
unfortunately it did die of reproductive
cancer so but yeah de Morgan Brasil
actually always quite ambivalent about
teaching a de mathematics but this is
the section in her paper where she first
introduces the idea of general computing
it's very long because she is a
Victorian shows she writes this enormous
sentence but an enabling mechanism to
combine together general Tsin symbols in
a successions of unlimited variety and
extent a uniting link is established
between the operations of matter and the
abstract mental processes of the most
abstract mathematical science later in
the paper see suggests that if you could
find a way to make a logical system of
composing music for example you could
teach the machine to write music if you
had the right system to feed it so this
is the reason why Ada Lovelace is
thought of as the mother of programming
and I think I have about five minutes
left for questions if anyone has any
questions you need a whole lot of
research I was wondering if it is online
somewhere if you ever compile it in a
bibliography if someone wants to read
everything about this also the models
yeah relations the models are on my
youtube channel so I have what I just
showed you and also some of the other
parts of the engine and I think it's
just YouTube Sydney Padua and the
documents found on my website they're a
bit hard to find if you go to 2d goggles
which is the comic site under extras
there's all the primary documents linked
up to Google Books and they're really
wonderful reading because I think
something that you know hopefully the
book conveys is is that Babbage and
Lovelace is people were in
fascinating funny people and even the
the raw primary documents are extremely
entertaining of them you still have some
time for questions do we have any okay I
think that's all
so let's thanks Sydney
