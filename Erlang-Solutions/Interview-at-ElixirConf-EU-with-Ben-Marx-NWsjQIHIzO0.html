interested in functional programming and
I tried two different different flavors
like closures felt nothing like clicked
and then I fell loose earth and because
you know I respected the head waters
like for Tuesday with his book in the
oil community and it was so the cup
looks really nice it looks really
approachable and so there was a veteran
hmm your talk was on writing consistent
code could you tell me a little bit
about how your company Bleacher Report
writes consistent code so we have self
scheduled a couple of years of using
elixir one of the things we've done is
at more than one generic levels having
service reviews for new services
deployed so you've met the service we
have these various checklists like
monitoring components resending database
observations and then application level
we have we use create out at the mission
in the talked about so all the absolute
the same documentation some apps use
type specs and they all have test
coverage so those gilt sort of good
frames for application that move forward
and not have the same problems you would
have a more inconsistent state a it so
in your time I personally didn't get to
catch it but I'm definitely gonna be
checking it out once the videos are
released
how did you translate what you learned
in your company to something that be
attacked me to beacuse I mean similar
things that similar things that we've
found over the past couple years might
show some of my early would suppose it
was really terrible and sure the housing
the senator was built I became less
terrible and how it became a much more
readable composable functions doing
simple things so in although you've
already kind of
to this question how the one motivated
you to specifically choose the subject
and I think it's probably the thing is
that a lot of interests no instead they
want to know you know how is it
successful the company's thing is I
think bleach reporters on the biggest
companies in terms of traffic using it
and we really committed to employing
we've done that notice that for a while
now and so it's good for the community
to see that it successful and hopefully
this old approach other community other
companies and developers to give it a
language a shot and hopefully we'll see
higher adoption rates and extra voltage
so what we're going to hear a product
you're a complete report what are the
statistics are learning how well it runs
compared to your previous
implementations and different languages
I mean our average spawn five pillars
around or less than 100 milliseconds
which is great in that basically traffic
independent so in the past you know what
was it you're a content provider you
have like news people with what your
site in the past competitive passion
these other thing to scale up scaling I
was getting started you and even those
it more because you know caching caching
and you have lots of problems of caching
you know what can only had so many
servers you know and what elixir has
been able to handle it really really for
the most part and we're still find
claims finding ways to improve but the
NFS app was our biggest and worst
parents ever and that response time was
under 100 all day so it's definitely
with the language and through the hard
work that we put it extremely impressive
and that's probably motivated you to
price your book that's coming up soon
itself looks yes it was sort of a
serendipitous sort of because a member
state that and that's the
here and after a is not about and
similar theme I said I know maybe you
should write about this and no and then
it turned out that survey was also like
we needed sort of book and lieutenant
and we sort of bloke named Anna at the
same time and then we you know we
chatted in it like this could be really
good and its course excellent it's
fantastic to work with both survey
interest so and just like the top
hopefully you'll get a spoke to your
team leaders if you go or mess my face
here's everything need to know other
than the language itself but this is how
this is why you use it and just how to
do it so hopefully that will also drive
production and you know he speaks quite
a bit on the subject and clear to your
your goal of encouraging his option of a
lick sir
what are your opinions on the
significance of conferences from the
perspective of frequent speaker I mean
it's I mean it so incredibly fortunate
things because I had to do what I love
every day and then I get to travel
around and I get to meet people mean up
you know I'm not a very introverted
extroverted person so speaking it's sort
of nerve-wracking right but it's been
great because I've been able to meet
people all around the world and we all
share the same passion for the language
and we want to see the doctors and I
guess that it's interesting too because
it's you know the years go on more
advanced topics or more like nerve
related topics are hearing which is
really cool so I think you know it's
three five seven years time from now it
will be a very different place but it'll
be you know it'll be really amazing to
be able to live with the language you
know it's like I mean you say
nerve-wracking I really can't tell no I
don't seem like you're very experienced
and speaking like this I want to ask in
future conferences what would you like
to see compared to what you've seen that
means it's sort of an interesting time
because those people come to the
language we need to have beginner class
or like or something you know
more than beginner and media cups
because you don't exclude we don't dare
to be Hugh hi so you want to have a trek
but as I learn more about the language
Margot even occur laying in the virtual
machine I want to get more into the
internals of the language and you know
stuff like Jodi was talking about and
you know Jake's dishes topless great
because yeah he's one of the experts in
our language and to be able to spend
time with with the scorpion to see what
scissoring that's the kind of stuff that
I want to be going forward but you have
to be careful about the shona alienate
people so you have two tracks it's more
like be an intermediate and one with a
deck check see and final question I
guess what else is coming from a
seasoned vocal monster speaker and
seasoned Hilliker developer what is the
one thing that you wish you knew before
starting in the winter hmm me I can't
really think of anything bad
maybe that we should separate oh yeah
that done that's a cheating answer right
there I guess we can uh we can expand it
a little bit and maybe anything what's
one thing that you would want to tell
somebody who's going to come to language
with interested in language what would
you tell them it means that this will be
setbacks would like anything else you
learning something diría that I
especially one of things because it does
have there would be some syntax that you
expect these idioms to work from reviews
to work in a listen it don't so you know
in really do you have an instance
variable with the effortless at sign see
ahead then in me and looser at times
attributes are different for like an
atom versus symbol yeah so you know be
wearable for the fall friends so you
don't don't look at it
assemble and ruthian elixir and I don't
think of different atoms of distinct
thing
false cognate and yes I think so much
over my budget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
