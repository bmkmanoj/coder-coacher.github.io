architect of our largest Erland project
at Motorola and the Martin is the guy of
my team who's smarter than me and we
would like to talk about something that
well a lot of people supposedly know
about but it's always nice to maybe
repeat it a little bit so we'll be
talking about anti-patterns in the wild
so mostly what do we want to say is the
reasons why these things happen because
it's not always that obvious why people
write bad code and then we're going to
suggest a few ways of dealing with these
problems and then some kind of methods
of how to ensure that if you refactor
code it's still working and you don't
have to spend hours and weeks on
repairing what you've just done so just
before we go into it a little background
so you know a little bit about the
product we're making Motorola is mostly
associated with mobile phones but that's
not really what we do anymore
we do these public safety radio systems
for police and firemen and all kinds of
public services we have if you are in
telecom world you probably know what
tetra is if you're American then you
will know what p25 is instead those are
just public safety radio communication
standards that we have implementations
off and recently we also get went into a
little more about LTE and Android apps
and this kind of stuff ourselves us too
what we do is we do a little part of a
Tetris system that allows you to connect
your huge nationwide system to another
nationwide system of another country not
necessarily by the same manufacturer and
here's a clip of a Swedish news page
that describes an exercise that was run
last year late last year where Norwegian
and Swedish police officers were able to
operate together and speak together
across two systems even though Sweden
has our competitions system to give you
a little perspective on the product it's
about a 183 thousand lines of Erlin code
in about 531 modules there is about 89
Genesis M mode
and about 100 for gem servers and a
bunch of a lot of other stuff we have 71
thousand lines of Erlang headers because
we have a lot of protocols and a lot of
PD use that need to be defined there and
additionally we have seven thousand
lines of C code because we have to
operate with certain hardware components
that you just simply cannot operate with
within CareerLink so there's this two
sea ports that allow us to talk to these
parts and the whole thing is split into
five Erlang applications however there
excited was three releasable which we
sell together as one product you can't
really get one of them only but but it's
split up into these three servers that
we're running alright so the way Ireland
came in it started with the prototype
many many years ago some of you may know
this guy over there he actually started
Motorola even though he won't admit it
today and he was the one that brought
her link so the prototype was run very
quickly was made working but it was kind
of like a like a rush job to get
something to show then we wanted to do a
real product out of this and we got a
bunch of C developers who have never
seen Erlang before to work on that
product and the result is perhaps you
can see here that we have variables
named pointer and offset in our Erlang
code and now the product has moved a
little bit more into maintenance mode
where we're not really developing any
huge new things however this time we
changed the team again but this time
instead of getting some C developers and
telling them you do this now now we
actually asked who would like to do
something new exciting and try something
different so we got a little people who
are maybe not as experienced in their
links but are definitely enthusiastic
about it and want to try it and want to
learn so moving on the common specimens
of anti-patterns so we've identified we
have quite a lot of these or we've had
quite a lot of these places and we've
identified some common patterns that
kind of repeat themselves over and over
over in various places of the code so
the main one that many maybe many of you
have already seen is what we call the
shifting state
where we have one function where we have
a lot of state transitions and state
manipulations within the same function
clause so we have to change the state a
little bit then use that in the next
function then change it also again a
little bit then move it on to the next
one and again and again and this is I
think this is the most we found which is
six different versions of the state
variable of the gen FSM until it finally
gets out to the next state so why does
this happen well I think the biggest
thing is that immutability of Ehrlich
variables is very surprising to people
if you had a C function you would just
have one object that you would just
switch contained continuously over the
course of the function and then it would
exit and it would be the final state
here you can't really do that and you
have to keep changing the variable names
so you end up with state new state newer
state even newer state my latest state
version 5 and also our systems are quite
complicated and there's a lot of things
that can happen in a single function
clause when you receive one message
sometimes you need to do a lot of things
that manipulate the state a lot of data
that you have to remember and save for
later and the conflict that the
protocols are overcomplicated and the
state machines sometimes only compile
the problem and the other problem is
that there's just a lot of data to
remember it's a complicated system with
thousands of users doing a lot of
different things and all of these things
have to be saved for later so what can
we do about that
mmm oh yeah okay so let's let me send
here then it maybe doesn't mean oh so
now we're going to look at how can we
actually solve this so one thing that we
would like to do is to give processes
less responsibility so to get it less
responsibility we look at here one
example so one of the things we had is
we have a state machine and this state
machine was handling call controller so
this this is some protocol that comes in
and some other protocol that goes out
again
what if state machine also did was it
had some counters to send loud messages
to remote monitor so to this disc made a
lot of this new state where you just
increase counters and in the solution
there is quite simple because you create
a dedicated process that keeps track of
this counter and that way you eliminate
some states however it's not always that
easy so the complexity might be enhanced
because protocol is quite complex and
also contending can be non-trivial and
and and this might introduce new defects
and this is something that we worry a
lot about when we when we are making our
code nicer and we are refactoring we do
not want to introduce new defects we
will talk a little bit about like that
later
so one other thing is what we can try to
do is not on a process level but when we
go down to to the function level there
are many functions that take a state in
do something with a very small part of
the state and then return the state
should take you see here on the left so
we see sometimes in absence of G and
both of them are just manipulating the
state so what one thing you can do to
prevent having many versions of the
state is to rewrite these functions to
actually take in exactly what they
demand and return only that what they
changed it can be hard to track down
what what exactly and needs to be
changed because these functions might
apply other functions that also take the
state so you kind of need to find the
bottom of your call tree and then start
working your way up
and sometimes after you spend a lot of
work it will only reveal the real state
that is military in the example on the
right we so we went from here passing
some kind of big state with many things
in it and we don't actually know what
each function is changing it and we now
went here to a more specific problem
where we see that there was some some
elements of the state that is actually
used in many functions maybe some kind
of counter so even though this makes our
code clear it's maybe not the final
solution because sometimes you just have
something that is used that is demanded
and changed by many functions so those
of you that are s co programmers you
probably know about moments and and a
monitor and a nice way I won't go too
deep in tomorrow I see some people
looking very I won't go too deep into
into this but monitor a very nice way to
construct computations that change some
state so what what we did at some point
is we we introduced some kind of
homebrew State moment so what you see
here that this is a very simple two line
function so basically what it does it it
takes some stake and then it takes a
list of actions and then it simply Maps
these actions over the state and and
here we we give an example of how our
used is a reality to to make the passing
of a state implicit and and the benefit
of this is that you always know that the
state you get is actually free from the
previous action so we have a few cases
in in our code where in the beginning is
our state one two or three
all five we're at some point state three
was introduced but then actually not
used so some information was lost then
and and closer to death okay so the
information was was not used now so it
was the the new state so for example
state three was not used but instead
state two was passed in and in that kind
of mistakes you can eliminate with this
the problem is you only have one kind of
operation so you take one state in in
your eternal state so some people
actually thought a little bit more about
the system than we and that's a land of
state valid from their RabbitMQ project
and they not only wrote a library but
they also wrote a parse transform so
that allows you to write a tool where
you have some manipulations but it also
replaces on a right hand Centex
expression you can put in an underscore
which are automatically result in the
whole expression being wrapped in a film
that maps from the states to another
state so this is just a little bit
syntactic sugar that that makes the code
easier to read less boilerplate what's
also nice about this library is that it
actually has different kind of
operations so for example here you see a
put where you only put something in you
don't read something but only you only
write and they have a modified which is
the same as before which you can also
return things
so let's have a case study now of some
real-world problem we were facing so
this was the first version is s UCF here
s1 s2 s3 s4 and then we also we also
here have some function which uses the
state but returns nothing rather it uses
the state for some side effect which can
be sending a message or logging
something then we also have some
operations that might use the state to
compute some value which is not the
state but rather something else so here
you see party is being computed using
the state and then the later we use
party again in some other computations
so here here we don't need the function
maps from state to state but rather
stores this in a separate variable and
yeah so it means easy to mix up all
these state as well as tourist info and
we had some real defects on this as well
and you might think you might think yeah
we immediately notice it but sometimes
sometimes these operations only change
something in specific cases so most of
the time it might work but then in some
corner cases it doesn't work so only
when you des try it early you will find
these ones so here I applied to the L
end of statement to this problem to the
use case I just showed before so here we
do a put again and the modify which uses
state returns the state and then here
using this arrow to the left notation we
take the state compute something from it
maybe use your mother input like this
macro and then store it into another
variable in this case party and then it
can also be demanded later on and used
so to the benefit of doing this is that
the state is managed by the moment and
that way we eliminate mistakes it's also
easier to delete something in it or
maybe add a new line that there's some
extra manipulation of the state so the
next one the long case which is
something probably everybody has seen at
least once in their life and probably
the first time you try to write an
Erlang piece of code that had to check
for multiple conditions you ended up
with this little monster here there's
two problems in this one the first one
is that the case is deeply nested and
deeply deeply nested sometimes even
worse than that the second problem is
that there's sequential cases so first
you do this super deeply 5 cases in and
then is returned something which you use
in the next five cases deep case this
causes issues when you have a clause
here for example then you have no idea
how we got there it's really difficult
to figure out how did you actually get
there under which conditions we get
there and then you have a real-world
problem where there is a defect in a
certain scenario when it happens and
then you have to go through all these
case clauses and try to figure out where
the hell is that place so that of course
again is a see left over a lot this was
too I'll gonna repeat that that sentence
a lot here a lot of these are C
leftovers from from people who are used
to some kind of if-then statements where
you can maybe do this a little nicer and
the other thing is that from C in C when
you write a function you don't really
split it up into small sub functions
unless there is actually reusability of
that function between different places
the code in Erlang in order in general
in functional programming languages this
is maybe not really the case you want to
split this up into as many functions
little ones as you can
and the other thing is sometimes these
cases do certain validation and they
would really like to exit early because
then you realize oK we've failed the
validation we should stop right now in C
it's very easy just right return even
though maybe you shouldn't but here in
Erlanger nor in any functional language
you really can't do that and once you
get into these very nested cases
sometimes you'll have to duplicate the
same checks because it regardless of
what it is that you're checking then
then you need to check the other things
as well so how do we fix this well there
is one way that was attempted however it
also made this list so obviously it's
maybe not the best way to do it this one
is kind of funny what it does is it does
a bunch of sequential cases and in case
you don't like what you got then you
throw an exception and then there is a
function one layer above that catches
these exceptions and does something
based on type of the thrown exception it
works but maybe it's not the most Erlang
way of doing things it also kind of
makes it difficult to to figure out
what's going on so this was a nice
attempt good attempt but of somebody who
really really wanted to have a return
but couldn't get one and it seemed like
a good idea at the time until you need
to start changing things in it and you
know you try to make it a little nicer
so we had to find another solution okay
so here we have a case study of how this
can go wrong we have here a throw used
to emulate a see like return statement
then some expressions some case
expressions might just be a sanity check
that that are checking if something is
as expected
or it might store some value to evaluate
that's needed to to find later
evaluation like the H yet variable here
so how are we going to solve this how
are we going to make this nice we can of
course trying to rewrite it completely
from scratch but but you shall how much
code we have and we don't want to
introduce new defects
so one thing we tried is there is a
homebrew error moment again we have one
type of operation it takes a state and
returns a new state and also a lendo at
an error mode so what we do here is we
have here we start evaluation and we
have a case and when this expression
evaluates to error reason then the rest
here is not evaluated and when it when
when the result of this case is okay in
some value it will be assigned to this
variable and then the computation
continues so when we look at the
comparison we we see that as a as a
side-effect of actually making this
nicer also the code gets much more
compact so here here we have a lot of
throws and here on the right instead we
made sure to return ok and some value or
error and some reason for not continuing
so I showed you now some examples of why
we maybe want to use a Lando it has some
some it really gives us some clear coat
and this coat helps to reduce the chance
of introducing defects however it is it
is not part of the Erlang rings and
especially it contains some
transformation of your culture it's not
only a library but the transformation is
tricky because it depends on the
abstract syntax tree that did you get
from the Erlang compiler so what what if
that is changed at some point it will
also use some besides the bar stands
from it it uses some other undocumented
language features so this means that
that in production via quite scared of
using and Lando so I showed you a lender
and showed you the homebrew mounted so
at the moment in production we actually
still using the homebrew long it's
because it gives us some of the nice
things of being able to abstract away
from using numbered states away from
using throws but at the same time they
are very simple and easy to maintain
so so basically what I'm saying is we
are a little bit afraid of taking in
such a big dependency of as a Lando when
it's not part of Erlang and and when
there's a risk that at some point in
time is all of our code and then they'll
end of teams stops maintaining it and
then we need to take it on - this is a
big consideration for for production
systems I think basically what Martin is
saying that somebody should implement
bonus for Alex
all right the next one is the mysterious
API this is the one that probably
everybody has seen and this is the one
that gets mentioned every single time
and there's a chi you see there's at
least two presentations that talk about
this so we have this very nice piece of
code that at some point does genesis M
sent event somewhere to some module you
have no idea which mode sure sure so
when I had to change something in this
code I had to actually what I had to do
is basically search all the files for
this pattern here luckily whoever
implemented this kept the same variable
name so it was really easy to find which
process actually handling this message
but normally it's not that simple
also there's like this mysterious macro
that does something and you have no idea
what well actually this macro only
expands into an atom which is exactly
spelled the same as this macro but that
is actually smart why is that smart
that's because you you can make a typo
in an atom and you won't know until your
process crashes but if you make it a
macro it won't compile if you got it
wrong but it's still yeah it looks
pretty terrible and it's little scary
and I think what I mean the way the
reason is it happens is of course the
genesis um kind of looks like an api
already right why would I need to define
any extra api's when there's already one
that's it and I also noticed that
especially when people who are starting
on retraining in Erlang is that people
get really confused who executes what
which process actually executes which
part of the code which is the server and
which is the client it's not so simple
to grasp immediately but the solution is
also very simple define your API so the
next one is a little less of a code
problem this one is a little more of a
design problem or architecture problem
so we have this process aptly named
coordinator that does well maybe you
guessed it two coordinates things it
serves as the process because we have
multiple calls going on or multiple
transactions going on at the same time
in parallel in the system right however
it's very likely there is only one end
point at some point so they all go
through the same interface but they're
different transactions so you have to
kind of figure out which message coming
from that end point is for which of the
processes of which of the transactions
so the way this was solved
is that we have a G proc that's already
nice could be worse
that doesn't look up for a key with the
transaction ID and then it gets a PID of
the process and sends the message to
that process I mean it's not a bad
solution right it's it's quite except it
does that for every single message
within the transaction so even though
you have two processes for each
transaction talking to each other
instead of talking directly to each
other they all go through the
coordinator as long as you don't have
too many parallel transactions it's fine
doesn't matter but as soon as you start
scaling up suddenly coordinator gets
really really busy but it is this why it
happens well it is the simplest
architecture and it's really easy to
implement and it kind of frees you don't
have to really think about it and when
the performance requirements put on your
product are not so high at the beginning
then you just go I will fix it later
but then you maybe have to redesign the
whole thing so it's not actually an easy
problem to solve
not fully I mean scalability of course
not a simple thing to do I mean at the
end of the day we only have one socket
at the endpoint right so at some point
there has to be something that there
will be one process if you only use one
socket for for all these transactions
you will have to multiply your sockets
if you want to paralyze more but
coordinator can be limited it's easy to
do that at least or you limit the
responsibility of the coordinator
process that may be only the only
negotiates between these two stage
machines to talk together and then I can
just carry on and talk to each other
they don't need to they don't need to go
through the coordinator every single
time
gee Brock is nice to fix it
helps a lot but it has its issues we are
a little unhappy with Shiprock we don't
like the
wait throws exceptions all the time and
then catches them inside there its own
api's and we also have seen problems
where sometimes a process dies but still
lingers in deep rock for a couple
milliseconds and then you try to look it
up and it's there but it's not so this
actually adds more complexity to what
you're doing you have to be very careful
all right and then we have a few smaller
issues which we group together we have
the big module and the big function this
module I can't see it but it's six
thousand six hundred seventy five lines
long which is what 15 times more than
recommended by all encoding standards
and then we have a function that is
about three hundred twenty one lines
long so those are hard to read and
they're difficult to modify but I mean
you can live with those then we have
this funny thing where we have three
modules with exactly the same name I
mentioned at the beginning that we
release three products which are all
part of the same thing of course but
they're three distinct products and each
of them has a module with the same name
and then there's a generic module that
always calls an API from that module
disk it's called nm so depending on
which of the machines this process is
running it will have a different effect
so this is like a funny approach to
c-sharp interfaces or virtual functions
in C and then we have this one which we
ran onto very recently is that we have a
lot of these catch-all clauses
everywhere all over the code just in
case because maybe maybe maybe something
will return something else
so these usually just come from you know
a lot of C habits again because as I
said before and C you like these big
functions that enclose a certain
functionality you don't need to split
them up because what for but also our
state machines are very complicated
because they're pro
very complicated we have a lot of
messages of the state machines in
general even design stage not even
Nurlan yet they are very complicated
with a lot of states and a lot of state
transitions so the state machine just
grows and grows and grows until it
reaches five thousand lines and it is
easier to make one process than to split
it up right because maybe it starts easy
it starts small you implement the basic
functionality and then you start adding
the corner cases and grows and grows and
grows and grows and once it's grown now
we have a hard time splitting up and the
ones then the the desire for interfaces
right so it some sometimes it would be
nice actually to have some kind of a
generic way of calling the same function
in different modules or something that
to do different things depending on
which one is running over there it's
called gen event I guess but not used
not always and this very nice habit of
defending against everything so
solutions to these are well there's a
lot of different solutions you can try
to split it up you you can do a lot of
things dialyzer actually helps a lot
against the last one I've removed
hundreds of clauses like this because
dialyzer said this is never going to
happen
so it's very nice to use that but okay
so we have all these problems and we
have some solutions but that's not
everything so if you're from Denmark
maybe you know these two guys we have to
have some tools so that we can use to
somehow fix the problems and help us
maintain what we already have because
the main problem is we are running a
public-safety business and we cannot we
cannot just refactor things for fun we
can't just go in and rewrite half the
codebase because then everybody will get
a heart attack
you can't just release this to a
customer that expects you know we can
have a fireman trying to press a button
on the radio and then nothing happens
because we just refactor this little
function it was not a big deal so we
need a way to really validate of course
test coverage we have a lot of tests we
have unit tests we have component tests
we have all kinds of testing but things
always can flip through
so we would like to have a method to
kind of ensure that what we had is still
what well I mean what we have now is
what we had before or better hopefully
so what we did is we created this funny
quick check model that lets us kind of
validate small components of the code
that we're refactoring doesn't help
against huge refactorings but it does
help with like single functions or two
functions or some like that so what you
do is you take your code which you had
the terrible huge function for example
and then you do some refactoring on it
but then you write you use our quick
check model with with some mocking
included you mark everything out
basically everything that's not the
function you refactoring you mark it out
and then you make sure to generate all
the outputs or other inputs that will
make the code branch off into all
possible places and then you run it and
compare so it looks something like this
we wrote it in this funny thing called a
quiver F and you provided the pre
refactoring function the post
refactoring function a generator that
will generate all these possible code
paths then there's some C set up
function where you can prepare we use
MEK for mocking so you need to start a
few things there right and specify some
things and then there's some dynamic
things that you also mock out because
they depend on what was generated
sometimes so we have this 214 lines of a
single class function that was
everything was in a single class in one
function it kind of looked like this in
UML when we try to draw it once this is
actually also an earlier version of it
so it's actually a little simpler than
it really was but this function is
called in like five different states in
the state machine and it is one of the
parameters it gets it's a state name and
it then does different things depending
on which state it was called in very
nice and then it can do a lot of things
internally but after we refactored it we
got it down to well 212 lines so that's
not maybe much of an improvement but
that's okay but now it's three different
functions and there's ten clauses and
each distinct scenario
in reality actually has its own clothes
so if you only need to fix that scenario
you only fix one plus and you don't
break the rest of the code and known
your defense nothing went wrong okay so
now we know how we can test that that
what you made is still right but maybe
we can already try when when refactoring
to make sure that we don't introduce any
new defects
so there's several several tools to help
with that and the most well-known one is
probably called regular - this is a
semi-automated refactoring so so what
you basically do is you tell the tool I
want to apply this refactoring to this
part of the code the nice things that
the tool can be extended and and that is
also necessary because maybe not all
designs refactorings are supported by
the tool the bra means it is kind of
hard to define how to do this and yeah
results in some learning curve and
there's also the question is to
transformation correct so I have here a
little cartoon from xkcd that probably
shows our our issue with regular and so
we would like to use it but could be
kind of afraid we get here in the in the
bottom so we will spend some time
writing code and then the ideas that the
code to make refactoring easier will
afterwards
save us a lot of time but as far as our
experience goes we actually write
something and then maybe it's not quite
right and we spend more time and then
there we actually say so so in practice
we have to admit we don't use ringlet
that much and maybe that's just because
we don't have enough experience with it
yet but as it currently looks like is is
that all our temps ended here in the
bottom half rather than in the top part
and also we don't use Emacs yes yes so
but by not using I mean as long as
you're not a Renny only supports only
really supports Emacs I mean there's
some other plugins but if you really
want to use the power wrangly you should
use image so so those who don't write
the immediate have a learning curve
before they start using Remy
and then there's the little tool called
Elvis some of you probably heard about
it that does automated code quality
checks where you define some rules and
say oh I want my code to kind of look
like this it's nice it can check for
like obvious things but it doesn't
really prevent bad code for example the
throwing the throwing case exit that
would not be caught in it by any style
tool because that's not a style problem
so it's okay the problem is when you
have a lot of old code that probably
does not match your style qualities then
you will spend first a couple of weeks
fixing it all up so the style matches
and then you can start using it so that
was it
yeah I guess if you have any questions
now I mean it's always the oh yeah so
the question was that there are no good
tools wasn't really a question was a
statement that's kind of true I think
the best thing you can do is to prevent
issues rather than I mean it's really
hard to fix issues once you have them
the best thing is to use tools that lets
you prevent these issues so if you have
a small codebase and you don't have a
lot of issues then you can start using
elvis and wrangler and and all these
kind of things you won't need the
refactoring quick check because there's
nothing to refactor and then these tools
will help you keep it in line and I
think the most importantly the most
important tool is code reviews we didn't
used to do that a long time ago now we
do it every time you cannot make a pull
request without at least two people you
know looking at it and making sure ok
that's actually that's good and we've
seen a lot of discussions a lot of
arguments in the pull requests but they
all end up actually really well
yeah so this is a little more of a white
box testing outside because you need to
understand sorry so the question is how
do we generate inputs for the for the
quick Chek test so yeah that's not so
simple but we have for example when you
have a case that can go either way what
we do is we mark out the function that
is in the in the case and then generate
either or output for example right so
you have one off each of possible
outputs of the case you need to know the
code you refactoring really well
unfortunately to use it right it's not
that simple but it's also because our
code is quite complicated and if you
just generate the first input parameters
on top that may not be enough so what I
would like to add to that is that when
you don't know your code that well and
we didn't in some cases that profiling
really helps and that can either be
buying real profiling tool or buy some
more specific implementation where you
make sure that the inputs you generate
go for all paths in your case statement
so you know you can you can quite easily
infer from a function what it can return
so when you make sure that that all
those values are returned you know that
your cases are covered and this really
helped maybe one thing we forgot to add
is it doesn't only check for the output
of the function but also the side
effects so we compare that all the cost
external modules are the same in the new
code as in the old code which means it
limits our refactoring because maybe we
could have skipped some of these calls
but it's safer because that way we
ensure that when we are actually sending
for example messages to external
entities that they are kept in the same
order as they were because sometimes
that's very important to meet seems like
you don't trust your test Suites and
test cases
maybe you should improve them and that
would enable the refactoring much easier
you got us it goes right there now the
truth is we have a lot of tests and it's
really hard to measure coverage of our
tests um so yes we don't fully 100%
trust our test
No so I think I think when you're when
you're talking about tests you also need
to think about timing
so the corner cases I usually buy that
by the pickup box tests they are not
covered right where you just take your
whole application put something in and
get something out so to get the the
corner case and the corner cases is
often where right where these things get
a little bit more tricky where
especially the things that you want to
refactor where may be added there to
cover some corner case and that is why
more on a on a unit test level this
quick checking this really helps because
when you have timing issues you you just
also mock a timer and that way you know
exactly that the function matches so
that that's why a quick check comparing
all the new code is very helpful even
when you have a lot of tests that cover
that your your big application works as
expected
yeah yes it reminds us that the common
test and unit tests in general I think
are quite helpful to do also to test
these kind of things
you
yes so the question was how do you find
concurrency errors I mean that there are
many different ways and for example with
with quick check you can do a lot of
things right fine
and so what we focus on here is where we
have them component that works in a
specific way and we just want to make it
work in the same way but nicer I mean I
think in general we we haven't
encountered that many concurrency
problems in our particular application
maybe that's because the application is
a little it doesn't actually handle you
know millions of transactions or
anything like that in our case it's a
more focus that each transaction really
works
because you can't really I mean it's
maybe little counterintuitive to Erlang
but we need to make sure that calls go
through in the system like that it's
maybe not an important that we have a
lot of them but it's more important that
each of them doesn't fail and that's why
we also see a lot of these defensive
programming's and all of these things
because we need to ensure that this
process continues and the call goes on
and somebody's in stuck in the burning
building yelling for help however we
have actually quite extensive test
Suites that test between the component
parts that you mentioned and normally
the problems we find are more of a
domain knowledge problems in regards to
that to understanding our protocols and
interacting with other components of the
system but that's a little bit outside I
would say so where we would like to
refactor things internally so we have a
little clearer picture and then we can
find were these problems in the code are
because when things don't work as as we
want them to between the components we
need to find where to fix it in one of
the components and when the code looks
like this it's sometimes really
difficult and takes a long time to find
these problems
