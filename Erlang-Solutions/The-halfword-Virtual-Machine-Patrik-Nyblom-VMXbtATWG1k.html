virtual machine and give you a little
insight in how other virtual machine
works so the hawk will heap emulator or
the Horford virtual machine is variant
of the usual bean machine and beam
virtual machine you heard about plenty
of times it's beyond or Borden's Alan
abstract machine and it works in way it
has done since bogdan solitary
implemented I don't know before i
started at mtv which is a long time ago
and has evolved over the years it's a
virtual register machine it's not a
stack machine which people tend to think
it's a little bit strange but that's the
way it is and it has garbage collection
purposes you know all these things and
constant pools are added to the motive
machine like two or three or two
releases ago so on and one of the things
with wood beam is that you have this
heap or the generational garbage
collector with two heaps and some some
extra nurseries and then you have these
large binaries which are binary star
this is very loud of data miners that
are larger than 64 words and they are
stored elsewhere so to say not on the
heat so they are stored in separate
Malik areas with reference counting and
shared among processes
ok
so if you look at the virtual machine
code or if you look at the the sub
director beaming in in the source code
you will find a lot of source files of
course and if you look into them you
will see one data type that's like
everywhere and that's the etern and the
knee term is the sea view of an hour
long term and it's like word large the
size of the void point or something and
everything is like an array of e terms
so the heap of a process of the heaps of
a process is just an array of e terms
and the stack is an array of Ed terms
and so on the registers re terms in in
the virtual machine the code is not eat
terms but everything else is so if you
come and construct a complex term in a
line you have for example to put you
allocate like a tuple of two elements
you locate 3e terms on the heap one for
the size of the tuple into four elements
and then on the stack you will have a
pointer to the heap where the actual to
police and the pointer is an eater and
the contents of the two plates Anita so
if you look at the code it's like I'm
tight and so if you look at a beef for
example contrary to knit which has these
structured types and things like that if
you look at a beef it takes like a
couple of arguments or a ray of
arguments which is the parameters to the
function when you call it and then and
they are all eater manned their it does
all these things with e terms it has
macros there's things to advocate data
from the heap and so on but it's oval
eater manned then you decode these e
terms into normal variables in the
sequel
so so the actual virtual machine loop if
you were here when when Lucas spoke
earlier he talked a little bit about how
it schedules things I'll talk a little
about what's happening when when you
actually have a process that you've
scheduled and you're trying to run it so
the loop it's a normal forever loop
going around and finding processes so
it's called a function that's called
schedule which gives you a process to
execute and the process well I the
current process is a pointer in the loop
to a structure which is not all that
Lodge actually but it contains some
things it contains a reference to the
beam code to execute either you have
like just started the process then you
tell it which module which function and
arity or you're executing so you have
some other way but usually when you
schedule in you always start at the
beginning of a function so it's not
really a pointer to the beam code in
this state it's a reference but it also
has pointed to the stack of course it
has a pointer to the beginning of the
sack or the end of the stack whatever
you want to call it and to the stack top
so the virtual machine loop digs up the
process structure it digs up the stack
top to start executing and on the stack
there are terms and that's the variables
in your program that's always there on
the stack or in the registers so in all
these terms they refer to the heap where
the actual data is stored so you have
the stack top which the vm loop gets and
it hang you have the heap which the vm
keeps in some way and you have this
reference to beam code and the vm loop
picks that up as an instruction pointer
where to run
and then you have the registers which
also is an array of e terms which is
pointers into the heap also you have on
the stack have this really lousy removed
control oh you also have those binaries
then they are outside of the heat so on
the heap you will find structures that
point to these binaries but actually
from the stack you don't point directly
to the binaries you point to the heap
where it's the structure telling you
this is a binary and it's of heap
there's also binaries that only happens
among it could be aah yeah there's a lot
of binary stuff and on the stack you
will also have and this is a little bit
problematic you might have or you of
course have return addresses so when you
execute it you usually want to go back
somewhere so and so you have those
return addresses and they are pointers
to code and code is not align terms as
it is constructed there's another time
pointer see you from the stack you have
to be able to point out code you have to
be able to point to the heat but not
directly to the binaries okay that's how
it looks but of course it's a dynamic
language so OS data forget about it
okay it's a dynamic language so its data
is no problem in this context because
it's tables are like elsewhere and the
reference by numbers not pointers or
anything so they they're like a database
stored some other place so we have this
dynamic language and contrary to see for
example where which is a little bit
dynamic because you can do like anything
but but you don't know what data if you
take like one word from deceased I can
look at it you have no idea what it is
it could be like part of a string or it
could be an integer or a floating point
off of a floating point number whatever
but in our long everything is tagged so
every item on the heap or on the stack
has a tag telling you what this is so if
you if you have variable and asks have a
god thing it is this an integer is
integral you only look at look at the
exact the variable is itself the world
with the integer anytime you see this is
an integer and this is done by a little
trickery each each pointer I have shown
here points to a word boundary so in a
32-bit machine that means you have to
see rose at the end of the pounder the
least significant bits are always 0 they
are used to point two characters inside
word so we use those bits for primary
tag and if those bits are 0 this is like
a normal pointer and that means its
return address a continuation pointer
it's called in the code but return
address if it's a one it's a console
that means the beginning of a list and
if it's 10 it's boxed and that means the
data is stored on the heat but
you don't really know what it is yet
it's not a list but it's a tuple a
floating point number a big number
that's numbers that are too large to
store in the world word and so on so and
if it's one wonder lost its it's an
immediate so that means it's not a
pointer we have stored the value
directly into this world the ETA were so
on the stack you might find all these
types of things either if it's a
counselor or a tuple or something it's
pointer with a tag on it or it could be
immediate like local pits or immediate
number small numbers or immediate and so
on atoms are of course immediate so then
you go the next step is to have even
more tag bits for the immediate and here
we can use more bits because this is not
pointers so we limit the amount of
values we can have in the world but by
using more bits so we have the tags of
four bits all ending into ones of course
because that means in the primary tag
that it's an immediate so we have a here
or key where we have immediate Slyke
pits and port they have only four tag
bits and then we have immediate to tag
which means it's even more tag bits and
so on and small numbers only have four
tag which would which or once and then
makes it easier to we actually use
automatics instead of shifting to get
the value from it which is faster
so and then on the heat the boxed has a
head of word with a tag once again
telling you which type of boxed value
disease so it could if it's all serious
it's the tuple and that's the most usual
type of course and then you have these
26 bits if it's a 32 bit machine 26 bits
for the era tea and arity is how many
words will follow it's not actually I
mean a floating point number two words
will follow in a 32-bit machine and so
on it's not like always the area of a
tuple but for two bullets exactly that
number and these boxed values and they
are always more stranger data types but
if you're if you're in your code right
is to pull for example you look at the
stack if a is on the sac capital A and
you're right god when is to pull a the
virtual machine has to look first to see
if a which is on the stack if this is a
boxed if it isn't then it fails is
obvious but if succeeds this is boxed
then it has to follow the pointer untag
the pointer follow the point down to the
heap and look at the header word on the
heap to see if this is to pull so God
tests for tuples or live more expensive
than God has for lists for example so if
we create a term then a little first
example we have this capital a and we a
match we don't assign we match it to
this tuple of two elements with a list
of two atoms and then a number a small
number then if you wrote this in your
code you will get a constant and nothing
would happen but but imagine
that you actually would have to build
this then what you do is on the heap you
start from inside out on the heap you
would put the first the last council
consisting of the atom B which has this
tag you can I could go back if I had a
good remote control tutorial that
serious air 10 11 is the tag for an atom
and what would be in the rest of the
world word is the atom number which then
refers to table where the atom names are
so but they are unique I mean the atom B
would always have the same atom number
for as long as the system lips and the
second part of the council is Neil here
because it's the end of the list and
then we build the first part of the list
which is the atom a followed by the tail
which is the next console beginning with
B and ending we need so this is just
like Lisp car encoder lists this is how
all functional language is having lists
will it not all actually some building
with tuples or other things but ok so
then to build the tuple around this we
put a header word with a charity to the
tuple tack on the heap which is all see
rose and then the next two elements the
net the following two words will contain
the elements of the tuple so the first
element is a console icons pointer to
the a and the second one is the
immediate number three and then on the
stack we put the actual a which is a
boxed pointer so whenever you fall of
these pointers you remove the tags of
course but but it's just masking them
away you don't need to shift anything
so that's how we work so so when when
you shift from a 32-bit virtual machine
to a 64-bit version machine you have to
change the size of the eater and because
it's pointers so everything then grows
to twice the size and and if you run a
program on a 32-bit word machine and
then moved it to 64 bit because you had
oh I need more than four gigs of memory
so I'm 02 64-bit architecture and I need
more than eight gigs of memory that's
what happens more or less because every
data every every piece of data in your
program blows up to twice the size and
and the horrid thing is like strings
they're already really memory consuming
and now they're twice the size so a
string a string encoded in a binary say
it is a Latin one string and it takes as
many bytes as a number of characters but
in in the 64-bit button machine it
tastes like what is 16 times more with
that won't make you happy and but that's
the way it works so the this is
obviously a problem I mean the problem
of strings is is large and what this
machine can do but but the problem of
using I mean like okay I had the money
to buy this 64-bit architecture I also
have the money to buy it exim wrong
because I can also buy a hundred gigs of
ram and still wrong okay but but the
problem is the bandwidth problem I mean
CPU so you get faster and faster and
faster and memory gets a little bit
faster but not as much as the CPUs and
if you so cause this presentation here
we
is 64 core machine and and my analysis
of his graph there when when he tried to
run dialyzer in parallel and so on
dialysis memory intensive and he has
these small caches he has a memory
bandwidth problem and almost every
application I've seen running on on
machines like that especially on opteron
sand and so on have this memory
bandwidth problem it's a new machine to
sew the memory can be a long way away
and yeah so twice the amount of memory
means more or less twice the amount of
memory bandwidth problems so if you run
you have this this cpu the x86 64 and
run it in 32-bit mode you will in an
online application get half the amount
of memory access it's half the amount of
memory going over the memory bus and
actually of course you have caches and
things like that but if you blow up the
memory usage to twice the size you also
you will exhaust the caches much faster
so you actually get a lot of memory
going through and forth proving the
memory bus and the memory bus is slow
and the i7 has a much faster memory bus
and then the detected a core two
architecture but this is like what into
tells you if you ask until they say oh
that's a one-time gift that won't happen
again so so what will happen is that I
ate or whatever well will be even faster
and the memory will still be like not
keeping up so
so actually running in 32-bit mode is
faster looking at the el nvm doing some
benchmarks which is partly the same gun
 as Costas has round but now we're
not looking at SMP performance it's
actually SMP a virtual machine but ok
and and the blue one is 32-bit and
except for East owns hair more is better
more is worse okay less is better yeah
except for Easterns so the 32-bit
virtual machine is faster on the big
benchmark which has a lot of big
integers on the codec encode the code
benchmark the hack bench the random
benchmark the storage benchmark ok the
64-bit virtual machine is a little bit
faster on life which is more of a
number-crunching application and you
have twice the amount of general-purpose
registers and so on so because when you
run it 32-bit leakage mode you only have
the old x86 registers so you can benefit
a little from more registers and so on
ani stones which is also actually a
little bit of number-crunching
application and also an application
doesn't consume a lot of memory the
64-bit what your machine is a little
better because more is better on that
that one so so changing from from a
32-bit to 64-bit machine means losing
performance and that's not what you
wanted probably but you may have to do
it anyway because you need a memory or
the memory like the address space
ok so the alternatives are of course to
stick to 32-bit machine rewrite your
application so you split it over several
nodes of something and and that might be
the fastest way it the fastest so the
best performance solution as long as
they do take into account the hassle of
rewriting your application so yeah and
you can also buy a lot more memory and
under really fast cpu and don't mind
that it's actually slower than it would
be if you can run in the 32-bit mode but
it's not often it's not even possible
Union I mean if you have an embedded
device you can just like you put a lot
of money into development of this custom
hard-wearing you you can't just cram in
more memory or more and the memory of a
lot of the embedded devices is quite
expensive actually and wired to the
board so soviets order and and we're not
the only ones have the java people have
looked into this problem too and they
have a type of solution in the gay
rocket which is more elaborate they lack
have more money and they're a lot cooler
than we are but a lot of people are
looked into this and the memory
bandwidth is actually a very easily
identified problem for the virtual
machines so so we looked at a couple of
solutions ourselves and anna and the
solution that we've heard before in
other contexts is why if this is an
array the heap is an array of what why
don't you just index into it why do you
have to have pointers everywhere
and the that's a good point but the
thing is it's not only one here so it's
not one array it's like several race so
you have to know which array and the
index into that and so on so that will
require a yew tree right and possibly a
performance degradation that we wouldn't
want and an another idea and which was
my first idea when I looked at is is if
we have this humongous address space we
could give like four gigabytes of
virtual address space to each process
and then could we have like segmented
memory like in the dose world so so this
process lives in this segment this four
gigabytes and so on and some elaborate
fiddling with about your memory and we
would be good to go and that would have
worked or it might work in the future
but right now a 64-bit process processor
has 48 address bits not 64 so the part
in between is non addressable so there's
a lot of bits you can use so you have 48
bits but you actually have four to seven
bits and then you pull out 32 bits and
you have 15 bits and that's less than
you need for an hour-long system you
can't have only 15 bits for processes I
don't know how many that would be but
when I counted it was for less than then
you could have today that would live in
the number of processes but we could do
things with that like share segments and
then move processes and so on and and
that might be a future solution but the
simplest solution and and one that fits
a lot of situations is to simply say ok
let's let's pretend this is the 32 bit
machine when it comes to processes so
all process data like heaps stacks and
actually code because of the pointer
from the stack
the code we put them in the lower part
of the virtual memory of the address
space and everything else like ETS
tables and binaries shared binaries and
so on we put them elsewhere in the upper
part so to say of the system and and
this is it sounds complicated but it was
really easy to do simple to do actually
so what we did was well ETS was was not
all that simple because because we had
to do something else with ETS tables
because the data in ETS tables is also a
long terms so so in that case we
actually use this array view of things
so ETS objects or raised over a long
terms and the tagged pointers or
actually offsets from the beginning of
the ETS object so so we changed the
implementation for ets for this virtual
machine and then we wrote a little
wrapper around a map that use map new
reserve which is like saying i want this
piece of address space but i don't want
the memory and allocated the lowest
eight gigabytes of memory address space
and then whenever someone tries to
allocate heap which is easy to identify
because this arts Alec macro is where
where you allocate memory and you
actually tell that it's the type heap
I'm I'm allocating so we could just
route that to the am map wrapper which
had this address space and then just
mapped memory pages in that outer space
and gave it back so a memory allocation
to solve that was like implementing the
really naive one page
time memory allocator and we needed to
truncate the pointers of course and you
add tags you have a pointer to date and
then you add the tag in them it's an
hour long term what you did now what we
do now is you add attack and throw away
the most significant 32 bits which all
zeros and then you have an hour long
term and that costs almost nothing and
and when I say almost nothing I mean it
it's like it I couldn't measure any any
impact and then you expand when you
remove the tag you expand it to 64 bits
which is I can move so no problem so how
it looks and when you run this virtual
machine you have the lower part of the
memory deliver four gigabytes of memory
and there we have all the code the
stacks and the heaps of the processes
binaries etas data and whatever else we
need is up there and ETS data usually in
in telecom systems consist they make up
like 80-90 up to ninety five percent of
the memory in the system and it's like
call ongoing calls things like that a
lot of data in ETS tables and you have
minisha tables well that's ETS tables so
so a lot of the memory in a lot of
applications is actually outside of the
process heaps so we a lot of
applications not a wall of course have
no problem fitting their processes in in
this lower area so processes and code
and actually have more more than for the
32-bit virtual machine and you have all
these other funky stuff in that memory
change a 64-bit process in Linux has
most of the funky stuff up there where
the Tigers are on the on the picture
it's actually targets and and there you
have some data sections down there so
you'd need to be a little bit careful I
sound like you just allocate the memory
and you're okay you be you have to be a
little bit careful so so ETS resolved by
by this array approach so we have a
special copy function that goes from the
array approach to the lower part of the
memory approach when it copy from the
ETS table 2 to the process he turns on
some operations like matching in ETS
tables like match specs and so on they
were a little bit more tricky but but it
was solvable so if we compare this half
work machine which is what we call it
the yellow one here where less is better
it's less than the green one at least
almost yeah everywhere and it's almost
as fast or sometimes even faster than
the 32-bit machine so it's better than
the 32-bit machine when it comes to
number crunching for example but not as
good as the 64-bit machine I don't know
why for example life is not better here
is something else it doesn't have to
anything to do with bandwidth obviously
but if you look at the codec for example
where the 64-bit the memory bandwidth
was really a problem for the 64-bit
virtual machine the half world working
machine is as fast as this a little bit
it's nearly as fast as as the 64-bit
virtual machine on Eastern so all things
considered is like the fastest vacuum
machine we have and it can break the
four gig barrier as long as you
ETS tables and things like that of
course you shouldn't use these days yes
it was all the time but but I mean a lot
of of the data is data store oriented so
then it's ok to use hash tables so it's
fall and also what you don't see in
these shots is it takes no more memory
than than the 32-bit virtual machine so
the ETS data that is stored elsewhere is
also as small as for for for the 32-bit
word with machine so you can actually
store vast amounts of ETS data with this
machine and and you won't waste memory
in the same way as with the 64-bit to
eternity
okay what's lost them and we gained a
fast machine but if you compare 32-bit
virtual machine you of course lose the
possibility to ground on anything else
than Linux and last time I said I will
put this to Mac OS for example but maybe
I'll put it to freebsd but mac OS is a
little trickier it might take some some
time to do that yeah but of course you
can't run it on a 32-bit linux either
it's a 64-bit executable and high is
still not ported to this one it's not
like really hard to do because it's just
the same back end as for the 64 bit
machine but you have to take into
consideration that you don't have full
pointers things like that so but for now
hype it is not working and if you
compare it to 64-bit virtual machine you
can't break the four gigabytes but
barrier for four processes of course so
if you have an application with with
like eight gigabytes of proces heaps
there's no way you can use this
implementation actually there are
products out there which couldn't live
with one process being limited to four
gigabyte memory that's a little bit
terrifying thing about that but that's
true so those applications they can use
this and of course you lose hope but
yeah for all other applications and even
for application that does not have a
problem with with four gigabytes as it
is now but run on a 64-bit machine they
can use this half world machine and you
might gain use and performance and it's
like easy to try you just configure
minus minus enable half
word emulator I think it's there and
unfortunately disabled art and and then
build on Linux 64-bit linux and then you
run you do nothing else to your code or
anything else and it probably works but
of course there's application where this
doesn't work but but it is an option and
it would we have like a couple of people
using this now but it would be nice if
more people cried and if there are bugs
it's tested like everything every other
virtual machine so it's tested like them
on four different machines each night
and and we ran all the tests sweets and
and so on but of course more uses means
more testing and if a lot of people like
this and can use this we can also
improve it maybe by by doing what I've
talked about earlier having segments for
processes so we can break the four
gigawatt barrier for the processes as a
whole at least so
so please try it out it's in the main
distribution it's actually supported
internally at Ericsson and then so it's
as supportive as any other linux windows
salaries or what else do we support
that's it i think linux powerpc thing
where we distribute binary stood to
erics on so this is quite a stable
machine so i will please try it and give
me feedback if you find anything strange
any questions yeah yeah they're like
this 64bit you have to really compare
that's not a problem because because
even if you use like external libraries
these the low four gigabytes I reserve
them so other app memory allocators will
jump to higher memory but you have to
recompile the nibs with because of the e
term size changes but it's a completely
normal 64 bit dll or shared library yeah
now you're free to do to use the rest of
the memory okay anymore
okay and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
