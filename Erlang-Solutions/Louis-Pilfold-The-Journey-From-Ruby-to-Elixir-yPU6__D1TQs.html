filter stuffers that was in rumors like
oh wow where does all this come from and
it's I said oh that's functional
programming ok cool how do I learn
functional programming with that came to
Haskell and just blew my mind
knew that for half a year and didn't
successfully write one program but it
was really fun and then someone showed
me like so I was like oh well I can
actually write stuff in this and now I'm
looping back around to haskell again
yeah short attention span um
so prior to writing Alexa the languages
that I was commenting with was sort of
dynamic scripting languages like Ruby
and JavaScript and Python and VBA and
when you come to lick see you now have
like the problems that the problems that
people are tackling elixir is so far
beyond the problems that people have
people to try and secondly in Ruby and
Python so in the Ruby world we're just
we're saying how can we do concurrency
which is tricky maybe in a few years but
have like some good mechanisms for the
rudeness but in in the elixir world
because of the early heritage currencies
done ages ago and then so it's
parallelism and it's also questions like
okay how does how does distributed
computing work and it's amazing because
now now that I have these concepts and I
have these tools I can I can decide how
I would build something that before I
could even possibly imagine how we do
like I would no idea how I do a parallel
program how I do a program to parallel
processes something in parallel but now
it makes sense to me and that's that's
really cool it's like a whole new way of
solving problems and you know kind of to
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
