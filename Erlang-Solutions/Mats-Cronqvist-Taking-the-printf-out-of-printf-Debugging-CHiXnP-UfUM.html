debugging and my experience is with it
I'll talk a little bit but debugging in
general the trace line trace beef and
its role in the bugging and some
indubitably boring war stories related
to that if I can get this this is me I
work at clarinha I used to work at
Ericsson so I spent 10 years of
Derrickson trying to find bugs in other
people's code it's a very interesting
experience now work at Lauren and here's
the story of clora 9 1 graph so that
this is the number of purchases per
month since well the company was founded
I started working at Kelowna here when
like five pixels of the x-axis there we
thought that was pretty impressive
anyways so we've had some some
interesting scalability problems over
the years inspired to give this talk by
looking at this parody account on
Twitter as a pretty small font here but
says here that go programmers doesn't
like syntax highlighting because it's
childish many stupid things like that
but this thing in the middle here says
I'm a firm believer in printing stuff to
the screen is the programmers the best
debugging tool that's actually true I
think which is kind of sad this was
equally true 60 years ago so if you want
to debug stuff in general speaking then
you have some options right you can just
look at the code
which is difficult because you have no
context you don't know what the values
of the variables and stuff like that you
can look at the post-mortems and that's
probably not gonna help you either
because you always dump the wrong thing
you can look at the log same thing there
you're always logging wrong thing and
you can run the debugger but that
doesn't work in production of course so
writing stuff to the screen printf is
the way to go obviously so you get the
right context and you're printing from
the right place in the code obviously
you not you don't have to print an
interesting stuff it doesn't impact
timing but much probably the problem of
course is that it's it's pretty long
cycle you have to edit the code think
about it for a while compile loader blah
blah especially if you work in embedded
system we load modules or something like
that takes hours so the feedback loop is
too long so of course if you're working
in Erlang you don't have to suffer all
those it indignities you just do the
right thing right away and the right
thing is cross tracing it's a feature in
the in the emulator it's always there
so you get all these all the good good
bits here and none of the bad bits it's
pretty amazing
so how does it work so essentially the
the emulator is instrumented with a
system that emits messages through some
process when it's triggered and you can
tell it when when to trigger by calling
some building functions it's to to
Biff's
the phone is the trace beef and it turns
on the trait the tracing per process you
tell the
emulator which process you're interested
in and there's a bunch of different
types of traces for example the garbage
collector or the scheduler you can trace
and if you trace on the scheduler you
will get an event to Erlang program
every time the emulator does the
scheduling event so you can build a
profiler on this for example and today
I'm just going to talk about call
tracing which is trigger points that
trigger when you call certain functions
with certain arguments actually the
value of this slide especially few
people in the back there but here I'm
trying to illustrate how the trace which
works but just by writing some stuff in
this shell the interesting bit is here
of course where I called trace all right
I say tell it to send a trace on the
shell process which is process through I
want running flag which is the scheduler
as I spawn this and so now I'm gonna get
messages to the to the shell itself and
these are the trace messages so I've
cooked so every time the scheduler does
something whether the in and out there
is when you schedule in and out you get
an event that's pretty pretty awesome
but not real convenient to write this
stuff in the in the shell but anyways we
were going to talk about printf today
and then you want to instrument your
code right you want to say if I this
function triggers send me an event and
that shouldn't be of course
awesome emulator so that's the second
beef that does this trace pattern and
that you call that with an MFA and the
emulator when you call this win MFA the
emulator instrument that bean code beam
code belongs to MFA and this is what's
called a match specification much
specification system like a little
emulator inside the real emulator the
runs a special language not not a real
language but some kind of pattern
matching language is language and the
match passively that's right show an
example this is the documentation for
the match match specs but this is what
it looks like so imagine you trying to
set up a trigger point on a function so
you decided process you want to trace on
and MFA that you want to trace on and
you also want a match specification
which tells you more and more
fine-grained about what when this thing
should trigger so this is can trigger
when the two you call a function with
two arguments that are equal that's what
this peak means so the first list there
is the argument list to your function so
they have to be equal and you bind it to
dollar one here inside a match
specification engine then you have a
guard here which and that tells you that
something should be less than it's the
head of the argument dollar one so the
head of the argument should be less than
three and then the last bit here is the
action you should take when this happens
so three things has to happen here for
for us to get an a trace of event and
that is we're in the right process we're
calling this function
we set up the trace pattern on and this
pattern is matched so here again I'll be
doing this in the shell just for
illustration how you can use this so
here's my my MFA leasts append much
specifications the one is talked about
and then I need some I need a process to
actually runs the tray so I make a fun
here and set up the my tracing and this
is the result I spawned a tracer fun
there I just defined
I call this tube and twice and I should
get one hit here right because the
argument should be identical and they
the head or the argument should be less
than three right so the first call
shouldn't trigger in the second one
should and that worked
we got one message all of this is a bit
yeah so so how does this actually works
then so this is the world text here's my
yeah my attempt at the illustration here
I'm not really very good at using
kittens and and unicorns and stuff like
that I spent like three days and this
anyway so this is trying to illustrate a
piece of beam code here right so this is
a memory area this gray box and the
orange things here is beam instructions
and the red arrow here is the program
counter so we move down like this in the
beam as we exited when the interpreter
run it runs the program it goes through
the beam instructions here right so
here's the entry point to the function
for
traction the second instruction etc when
we've instrumented this looks like this
instead so we have an entry point under
the first instruction is switched out so
we jump down to the trace pattern engine
thing that's it's tracing magic there
and then we go back and on the way we
run the first instruction then we get
back here to where we're supposed to be
so this is very quick when we don't hit
anything if the function is not called
there's no overhead at all right so if
we're tracing this function and we it's
never called good zero overhead if it is
called it's very little overhead because
of running this trace patterns is very
quick that's why the language is so
cryptic you can turn it into something
really fast
something executes really fast it's my
first first time I ran into tracing this
back in hooty pr5 we still call our five
and not not just this fancy new five and
so tracing was really new so in those
days or lang was only used inside
ericsson and with a lot of people old
telecoms people who were had input in it
and they want it tracing because in the
old Erickson switches you could do this
kind of tracing at this time there was
no other system really that could do
this magic anyway so I was working on
this this system embedded system that
didn't have any real debugging
facilities and the problem was that
after 90 days of the continuous traffic
it suddenly started going much faster
slower so we're talking about like a
factor of 10 slower
we had not noticed this in our testing
because we never ran the test for 90
days so the in true telecom fashion the
Danish Telecom people just sent a guy
out there every 89 days and rebooted it
so they never experienced this but they
were unhappy with this because like I
probably doubled his workload had to go
out there 89 days so I was tasked with
debugging this so I've just read about
the tracing stuff in OTP then so I
figured out that if I could run a trace
on the whole system but yeah back in
those days you could only run tracing on
beefs no it was two different kinds of
tracing there's a beef trace and a
normal trace they didn't work very well
but anyways I wrote a piece of code I
couldn't log on to the system of course
but I could be mailed this guy so he
pasted this so they waited until the 90
day so the the system was misbehaving
then he ran the trace would be booted
ran the trace again and then he got two
files and he emailed them to me pretty
fancy back in the day email mostly we
used pigeons that took took those two
fouls and brought a profiler very small
it only had to compare these two files
right and it turns out that X it's
lookup ID suddenly become a hundred
times slower and it turned out that a
hash function the function was one there
was a table and the table was keyed on
an integer and when integer became a big
num the hash function would always hash
it to the same value so all the data
wound up in the same bucket and in table
so the linear sold millions
objects there yeah so that was pretty
impressive I'm not sure I'm I am sure
that we would have never found that bug
if we hadn't been for the all I'm
tracing so I was pretty impressed then I
worked in this for years doing different
kinds of tracing and here's another war
story I'm gonna get it filled out the
time here I'm not gonna let you go
before my time is up so here we have a
live network in Germany this is a a
pretty big one the Danish one was pretty
small switch but this one had millions
of people connected to it and 10,000
ongoing calls at all times
pretty much beside my head shell I had a
shell in the rolling shell so I wrote
this I couldn't I couldn't upload code
on it I could only run stuff in the
shell so this is one line of code but
the red bits here calls it a trace piece
so it's a little program that basically
profiles so random for a while and I
kill the switch
so I was annoying and especially since
it turned out that the original problem
was a hardware error so I would have
never found it anyways so what do we
learn from this tracing is
super-powerful
you can do really amazing stuff with but
it's difficult to use right so obviously
I wrote my own there is of course
something called DB G as you say it's
polar with DT this is a user-friendly
layer on top of the trace beefs
unfortunately I've crashed many many
machines using that too so it's it's
pretty complicated you still have to use
those match specifications which are
difficult to wrap your brain around or
at least mine and it's it's dangerous
because it's easy to write a trace that
will kill your machine so I figured I'd
write something that was more user
friendly and was pretty much guaranteed
not to take down the system by being
defensive about how it worked
so it's a program called red bug and it
basically has one function it takes two
arguments the first one is a trace and
trace specification the second one to
some options so the idea is omits but
instead of writing the this match
specification this is a pretty one I
showed you earlier I'll write something
like this so it looks like a whole line
it's not actually Erlang but it's
something it looks like an automatic
compiles too much specification so this
bit compiles to this exact same match
back it's a lot easier to to see what's
going on though please I think this and
everything I talk about here is stuff
that you can do in
with the Tres beefs and probably with
dbg as well I'm just gonna use red bug
here to illustrate this works so you can
you can match in the in the function
head and bind variables like we bind X
here and you can use guards it's a
subset of all land guards but not
everything can be run in a match spec
and be some subset of functions so
here's the same example again so I run a
trace on lists append some conditions
there and only the one of them triggers
like you'd expect it's another problem
that you sometimes encounter is that you
you have a function that takes up all
your CPU time and it's maybe there's a
function it get called with stupid
argument and when you get called with
stupid argument it'll do all kinds of
work and lock up your whole system but
this function gets called from thousand
different places so who called the
function in this particular instance so
say somebody calls our lists append
function here with these particular
arguments and something bad happens when
we use these exact arguments so then
we'd like to know whether that call come
from so here we can use the stack action
here so when this triggers will get the
normal message here so we call this to
pend
to two but we'll also see here a call
stack I'll give up so in this case it
was the kind of boring because we call
it from the shell if you're running on a
real system this can be super useful
you can also specify that you want to
see the return value so here
that's pretty very dull of course so we
call this append we now really so we use
this with all action here it tells the
the emulator we won't see the return
value so here we get the normal one we
call this function and here we get a
second trace message where we can see
what return values another one this is a
pretty new feature in in OTP I think it
came in in our 15 you can do a very fast
cold counting if the only thing you want
to know is how often is this function
called so it has the emulator has
supportive keeping track of how often or
how many times you call a certain
function so so here we run a trace over
for three seconds and we just want to
count this thing is called twice which
is interesting because I'm we call it
once but it's it's a bit tricky to run
this particular call count trace as it's
called in in the shell because the shell
does all kinds of stuff right and that
also gets included in in this tracing if
you do this call count racing it's very
lightweight but you can't specify which
process you want to call you want to
become from strictly to sort of process
it's just instruments that call this is
also new called the call time tracing
which is I haven't used this much but
it's pretty it looks very fancy so what
do we do here we we're tracing enlists
so everything in the lists module and
I'll tell it that I want
see the times with which is how much
time it spends in each individual
function in lists in this case and since
I don't have to actually call anything
lists because the shell will call lists
all the time so I get tons of hits here
and at the end I get this little summary
here so it's called four different
functions in lists and the first or the
first number here is first column is how
many times so flat length got called
seven times
he's probably rehearsing but he only
took seven milliseconds is pretty fast
yeah so flat length one probably calls
flat length to here this is a pretty
pretty fancy stuff you could presumably
build a profiler on this if it wasn't
for this fact so here's a some knowledge
that you might be interested in having
if you try to to run this run the this
trace twice I'm just tracing lists for
three seconds and if you compare the
numbers here so it's the same functions
and they get same call the same number
of times but the execution times are
different and you of course you'd expect
them to vary a bit but lists fold there
so in one run it took 12 milliseconds
and in microseconds and in one run we
took one point seven thousand
milliseconds so looks a bit strange that
it suddenly got 150 times slower so
what's happened here is that the entire
emulator has been scheduled out by the
unix scheduler right so the way this
instrumentation works it takes a
timestamp when it enters the function
and then
another one when it exits the function
it takes the difference there updates
the register but if the whole emulator
gets scheduled out it's not going to
notice that so it takes a second time
Stamper
a long time has passed and there are in
modern hardware you can you have support
in the hardware for for only ticking
timers when a process is scheduling but
for my particular system that wasn't
supportive so that's a pitfall I think
on Linux it's a problem you can't really
work around yet so you should be aware
of this if you try to check out this
this functionality and run it in your
own code that sometimes you can't just
trust this you have to run this many
times and see if the numbers change I'm
gonna talk a little bit about the
options here to my program this is just
to give some sort of idea of what you
can do with the tracing here the read
buggy is has some safety features that
the normal tracer doesn't have so it'll
quit by default it will quit after a
while you quit after a certain time or
if it goit gets enough messages so by
default it quits after 15 seconds or 10
messages whichever comes first but we
will also quit if the message queue gets
long or it gets a message that's too big
so the idea here is that it shouldn't
take down you know no matter what so
it'll prefer not to give you a trace
than to block you for too long
so you can do remote tracing so you
don't have to run your your local node
you can specify a remote node you can
tell it to cache the trace messages
sometimes so the tracing will impact the
the way the system works right so if you
run a trace you're not you're disturbing
the system and depending on what your
tracing I know what kind of bug you're
looking for you want you can you want to
be able to trade off how how the tracer
works so sometimes it's convenient to to
block for example so if you do read
Bobby right back start normally it just
exits directly and it prints through the
terminal when it's done but sometimes
you want to block instead and and get a
list of Trey's messages as a return
sometimes you want to buffer the trace
messages on the remote node you might
want to not see the arguments by default
it will get arguments of the function is
called with in the trace message where
you can turn it off that's convenient if
you get very big messages again it's
gonna fill up your screen you can also
discard all the messages if if all you
want is the to count how many how many
times the function that call for example
you don't want to see any of the
messages you can just discard them and
you can specify which processes you want
to to trace on
yeah I have a bunch of stuff so you can
also specify how this is printed right
so once you've collected all these trace
messages it will print them out by
default to screen or file you can affect
how the printing is done here it's not
very interesting there's another this is
two ways that he can print to file
normally or the normal cases that you
just print to the text to a text file
but you can and that has certain impacts
and you have to use the file system and
blah blah blah and you have to do some
work in Erlanger you might not want to
disturb the system like that so there is
another way to to get the emulator to
write the trace messages straight to
file you don't have to go through turn
them into Erlang messages and handle I
mean in your own code you can just tell
the emulator right they straight to disk
and that's built into the emulator and
you can specify this using these options
and that's I was referring to here that
locality so yeah so that's another
masterpiece so if this is the the
tracing here is the the red thing here
is when you trigger the tracing system
and okay so trace message is generated
there's three different ways you can you
can deal with this you can either you
can write it straight to the local file
system here at often if the the thing
that has the least impact on the way the
system works it's pretty quick
you just flushes it out to a file cache
somewhere you can send it to an all in
process that so this is little egg here
is no process to trace message gets sent
to a little
process or you can send it to a remote
process you can of course also have it
go like this so it goes to the local
process and then gets transferred to the
remote process but the tracing framework
itself can can do three different things
here and which one is the best depends
on what you're doing so the purple thing
here will stress the network the blue
thing will stress the the defi driver
and the green thing we'll has more CPU
overhead because there you have to turn
the trace message into an OL and Tom
send it up to online world and have the
old Lancope do something with so that's
something you need to decide on yeah I
guess I was it oops something missing
here my conclusion so first one is not
opinion you can I don't know why I said
C++ here it's it's easy it's there's
this support is raising tracing stuff it
really enables you to create reliable
code and it's it's it's pretty awesome
stuff
and I think that I'm not sure the debug
abilities are really worried but if it
isn't I think it should be because the
the debug ability of rolling is very
very high especially and if used is
tracing stuff you can really very
quickly find even very complicated
problems and I think it's a shame that
it's not so well known I think this
feature it's hidden somewhere in page
257 rolling manual that's really why I'm
giving this talk so you all can go out
and spread the word to your lang friends
use tracing that's it yeah well the code
is available here of course it's been
open source since 90s yes we are waiting
for the questions if no questions then
thank you for the presentation
