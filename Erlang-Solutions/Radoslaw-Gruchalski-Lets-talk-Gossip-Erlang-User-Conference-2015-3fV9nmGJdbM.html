key I work for ver data and I do a
little bit of distributed computing I
write in a lot of different programming
languages and I like to do tools just a
little disclaimer it's my first time so
there could be some hiccups but just
bear with me I'll try to get back on
track as quickly as possible so this
talk will be about gossip gossip is
machine-to-machine communication
protocol it is called an epidemic
protocol and what it means is that the
information within the system is being
spread between machines in a unified
manner which means that the data that
every machine holds is exactly the same
and yeah the data that every machine
holds is the same and the purpose of
that is to have an overall view of the
other complete system on every single
node the other way of the other term
sometimes used to describe the system is
biased protocol in a biased protocol the
data the data the the way the data is
being shared between the machines there
is a little algorithm involved which
basically chooses which members the data
is shared with computer science
distinguishes three major types of
gossip Oracle's there is a dissemination
protocol which basically spreads the
data across the note those are events or
background data and there are
anti-entropic protocols which are used
for
repairing a replicated data some
databases use it for finding the
failures within the data set and
replicas and fixing them and third type
of protocol is an aggregate protocol
those ones calculate some take some
snapshots of the data on the notes and
then calculate the overall the overall
view of the system how does the gossip
work why is it important to have why is
it important no one gossip is there is a
lot of products out there on the market
and in open source that actually use
this technology people don't necessarily
know that this technology is there they
just assume that those things work but
yeah things like react things like
Cassandra things like console they all
use gossip under the hood and yeah
people just don't necessarily realize
but about that in a gossip system we
have seeds and members so those are
machines or computers trying to talk to
each other and there is no structural
difference between those two the only
difference is the role so we have some
machines and some of them will be like a
first point of contact for other
machines to come into the system and
start to talk together so those are the
seeds and will everybody else within
that so-called overlay will be a member
the way we elect the seed is we choose a
member that we know will be there for a
bit longer will be available there for a
bit longer so for example if we was to
use a DNS to pick
number of those seeds we need to make
sure that they are available for at
least the time to live for the DNS to be
available or we can use configuration
management systems for example chef
puppet to store some metadata and allow
the members to do look it up usually we
use UDP for for gossip protocols I
mentioned that there is in the
dissemination protocol which is the most
easy to find for a gossip system we pass
events or bagging on data the order of
those events is not really that
important and losing some of those
events because the nature of how gossip
works and we will go through that in a
moment basically we we can afford losing
some data it's not really that important
to receive every single event the
latency needs to be acceptable for
somebody who's trying to build a system
based on gossip the data not necessarily
will be real-time the core gossip
communication pattern is there are
usually three steps involved but we can
get away with two that is digest and
okay so there is a digest there is a
digest ack every member in the
dissemination protocol stores a
membership list of everybody who is
available on that overlay and that is
the the data that is being disseminated
within that system the messages that
digest and the digest ack are being sent
in so called gossip rounds and this will
be explained shortly as well
so here we have the basic pattern we
have two members they want to talk
together so the digest is basically like
hello then the member be upon receiving
hello we'll send the digest act which is
yeah I've seen you and optionally the
system may choose to send the digest ack
ack but it doesn't have to those names
come from implementation of Cassandra
they're not necessarily the names that
you would see in a gossip implementation
somewhere and quick rundown I hope that
everybody can see the seed at the bottom
so when we want to build a gossip
overlay the first thing we do is we
elect the seed in this case we have a
seat somewhere available under this
address and and then we want to join a
member into that overlay so the member
will come in and he knows because he for
example looked it up with the DNS that
the address of the cedar is that he will
connect to him send the digest and
receive the digest ACK now both of those
members the seed and the member a will
know that there is two of them available
they will exchange the information about
themselves and they will store the
membership list of each other on those
nodes on those two nodes now if we want
to join a member be the member be will
come in he will go to the seed he is not
aware of the member a at this stage and
he will receive a digest AG from the
seed and this digest stack will contain
three entries for member be because when
the seed already knows about membrane
and himself and he knows about number be
upon the next round gossip round which
we will explain in a short moment
the member a will also send another
digest to the seed and in response he
will receive the list of three members
which is member a the seed and number B
so at this stage all of them can
communicate together because they know
each other's addresses and yeah they can
just directly talk to each other and
what if something goes wrong because
that was a question actually somebody
asked me yesterday what if you have a
net split or what if just something goes
wrong the nature of the gossip system is
such that if something disappears it's
not really such a problem because the
membership list that the members hold
they are already aware of who the other
members in that overlay are so if one of
the members goes away it doesn't impact
the system as such no new members can
join when the seat goes away because
it's the first point of contact and but
the others the other guys can still talk
to each other so the membership what
what it basically is it's just a list of
names addresses or paths to get to those
members and to other members in that
overlay gossip around which I mentioned
is basically an interval at which those
messages are sent by the members so this
is something that an implementation of
the system that uses gossip will just
choose a random or defined by business
requirement but say it's every two
seconds so every two seconds a member
will send a digest to one of the
available seeds it will just pick one
seed and send it
and then it will send another digest the
same digest we're different by the 21
other reachable member of that overlay
and if he received the response he sees
the digest back from those members he
will update the membership list that he
holds with a time stamp which basically
means this guy is still available in
that overlay if there is no response for
a certain amount of time the member will
go into a state which is called a
quarantined in this state if there is an
information coming in regarding the
member who just left who just was put as
a quarantined that the information will
discard it this is to avoid false
positives hearing about members that the
member just considered they are
quarantined if there is no further
communication for why amount of time the
member will be put as unreachable and
that means that that member is most
likely gone from the overlay so what the
system can do in such case is take an
action to for example make a decision
for replacing that that member by doing
some some software action there is a
fourth state which I will get to it's
important to do too just remember about
it and some implementations don't do it
but there is a fourth state which would
be basically dropped so if there is no
further communication when the member
went unreachable the system may decide
that he will drop that member completely
from the membership list and he will not
expect further communication from that
from that number if we was to choose a
database like Cassandra or react what
usually would have is say you have a
cluster of six nodes and they are
available with some names so you have 0
1 2 3 4 5 when third member goes away
the system will still expect that the
third member will come back so he will
not drop it at some point a manual
action will be taken the member comes
back and he comes back with with ID 3
which probably reflects the data that
was sitting on that note but if he was
to use gossip for a different purpose
for example for reactive system
configuration on in the cloud and if you
was doing that say in the public cloud
your members will come back always with
different IP addresses which means that
whatever has been become unreachable if
it became dropped will never come back
so you just don't want it you don't want
to keep that in memory and I will come
back to that example a bit later when it
comes to security in a gossip system so
we say that a members contact the seed /
UDP they send some data they get some
data back it is important to provide
some security but there is no formal
specification for that gossip as such is
not a formal specification protocol it's
just a pattern of communication so
implementation has to be done by
yourself when when you build such system
for example yeah we'll get back to that
as well I'm sorry so there are you real
world products I mentioned so we have
apache cassandra we have basher react we
have a product called netflix dynamite i
assume that everybody knows what those
two first ones are I'm not sure if
everybody is aware of what the third one
is so the netflix dynamite is a gossip
system that you can use to make any
relational database turn it into a
distributed database so you take a mysql
server you take another mysql server you
set up dynamite on those two nodes or
more and the transaction log from one of
those nodes will be gossiped to other
servers and it will be basically turned
into something like a distributed
database where you can do partitioning
and stuff like that so that's the
principle of gossip and if there are any
questions just ask okay or if something
is not really clear so I'm gonna talk
about something that I've been working
on but I give you just a little bit of
background what it came from so I said I
work for ver data and ver data is a big
data ingestion platform and analytics
platform and we have a quite a unique
requirement maybe not such not so unique
we run in different cloud environments
we run on easy to we run on software we
run on OpenStack we are doing some
experiments with docker we run the
platform either in a VPC or we run it in
a public
love when we run it in a public cloud we
need to be able to tell the platform
what is allowed to talk to different
components so our platform is a number
of different components right we have
some broker that receives the data from
some devices we have Kafka we have
Cassandra we have Samsa spark a lot of
different things we try to be clad
agnostic as much as we can so we can
take the same code that we deploy on
amazon to software and just run it
without too many modifications there
without trying to support too many
platforms the the need for the need for
gossip came because of that requirement
for configuring the platform so what we
do is every machine running within the
set up and the setup is about 70 boxes
with the simulation boxes runs a gossip
diamond and they talked together over
gossip protocol the information that
they share is the chef information we
use chef for bootstrapping our nodes and
every machine exchanges over the overlay
its role so he he says I'm a Cassandra
and I'm number zero I'm Kafka and the
number one zookeeper and a number two
when we launched the platform we want to
launch it as quickly as we can and we
don't necessarily want to launch the
components in a in a specific order so
for example Kafka requires zookeeper to
run but we don't want to launch
zookeeper and wait for zookeeper until
we launch Kafka so we launched them all
at once and we let gossip trigger
actions on the nodes when the members
come in
so we don't want to be we don't want to
be proactive we want to react to what's
happening within our setup so every node
will basically fire off a message you
know the note comes up it knows its role
because it has a first type of boot JSON
file which contains what it is and the
other nodes will receive it they will
get a member in event and they will
introspect what data was on it and they
will figure out okay this is a mizzou
keeper and I see another zoo keeper came
in and I'm going to trigger some action
and make sure that both both of those
zookeepers can talk together it will
also configure firewall this is our own
implementation of security groups
security groups are only available on
Amazon and an OpenStack but for example
software than not available and we may
want to launch the platform in different
environments as well so we will
basically figure out okay zookeeper one
has this address zookeeper too has this
address we just make them talk together
and open only the necessary parts for
those two notes because we know their IP
addresses so that's basically what we
need for gossip came into the platform
at their data the problem with the first
implementation was that it was written
it is written in Ruby it's still in
production there it it is a it's it's a
library so you cannot use it from any
other software and I started working on
something different which is called
gossiper oh this is my little project
that I've been doing for about a year
now and I actually learned along with
with this so it's a gossip demon it's
not a library it runs on the box the
purpose is to have a number of apps
talking
to the diamond and have it as a common
platform its content independent there
is a number of digests there that make
the basic patterns work and it's all
based on Apache thrift as a
serialization mechanism so the reasoning
yeah explain that the previous one was a
library this one is a demon that's it
that's a major difference here the
features that I managed to implement so
far in this is its language agnostic
because it uses thrift as a
serialization for 14 messages multiple
overlays so I mentioned that when the
members come in they when they talk
together they establish this so-called
overlay which is basically the other
nodes talking together but what if you
have an application that says it's only
on Kafka or on only on zookeeper to
monitor a specific aspect of that
platform would you like to have all the
nodes 70 notes within that set up
talking on that overlay and not
necessarily so the application that
wants to build an overlay will tell the
gossip real diamond hey I want to have
an overlay and here is the port here is
the security details that I want to use
for that and it just start me one of
those and then another node another
zookeeper node will do the same so the
application will start it will pass the
same details and those two nodes will
establish an overlay over the gossiper
infrastructure and some other
applications made should may do exactly
the same thing over the same gossiper
infrastructure so on one damon you can
run multiple overlays the double
security layer and as I said the
security has to be implemented
on your own here at the moment the only
security layer security available for
the for the overlay is the aes 256
encryption so all the data that is being
sent on the overlay is actually
encrypted but I mentioned that there are
the members that connect to the diamond
so if I have two applications on the
same host that would like to talk on the
same overlay I would like to make sure
that i cannot spoof application be from
application a so that every application
will choose another secret when it will
connect to the overlay it will pass that
secret and then the data will be not
interpreted if somebody else claims that
he is that member it's all managed via
the rest api it supports multicast
overlays it has ipv6 support there is a
very simple pub/sub mechanism built in
it's not for high volumes of data really
and i'll show a very very little demo of
that and the multi dent data center
support is coming the reason why this is
a separate feature is because when you
have multiple data centers the latency
between the machine sitting within those
different data centers will be higher so
what you want to avoid is that the
members from so you have two one in
Singapore and another one somewhere in
Europe you don't want the members from
Singapore talking directly to the seeds
in Europe because the latency is higher
so what you want to do is you want to
elect the seeds in Singapore and I like
the Seas in Europe and have the members
from those regions talking only to the
seeds in that region
and then have a mechanism that
dispatches the data between the data
centers only by the seeds so for that
i'm working on the raft support to add
raft to go super all so people can build
multi then multi data center support
with that so i've got this this little
demo here which is the pub sub demo i
tried it a number of times so i hope it
will work so what we have here is those
are three vagrant boxes on running on
this computer here and IP address is
visible and there and we will start the
diamond so we'll start go signal and
then we can see at the bottom that it
came up we will start another one and it
came up
let's start the third one I'm in go
sleep it all start so the third one came
up as well so what happens now is there
is no overlays yet so there's only the
diamond running on every of those boxes
and we will turn we will create an
overlay and so I have a few shortcuts
here I'm or a few snippets that i use
for building them um so let's try so as
I said it's all managed by at the rest
api so we have a curl command here and
what this is going to do is going to
create an overlay it's going to create
an overlay called gossip gossip or
overlay remote on port 6666 with some
rack details and in this case we have
only one seed sitting within the rack
the racks is what would be managed by a
raft which is not implemented yet
completely and we have one seed on 50
100 which is the first box saying here
first one on the left so let's try to
bring up novel a so that it is um it's
running on that note um let's spin up
another one on the second node
and we have a member added as new so
this guy figured out that you know 100
is available and we received the
membrane event and then when we do
exactly the same thing for the third one
we see that there is another member
joining so we have an overlay of three
of three machines built and what we're
going to do is I have a little client
written in Ruby using the Ruby client
library for gossip girl I will start it
and i will send a message from the first
node to the third node the client will
be running on the third node the clients
can only talk to the overlay on
localhost so they cannot receive events
directly from another member it always
has to go through the overlay so I'm
going to start the client is running and
it also subscribed to an event digest
forwardable test so now with another
curl command we will send a digest
it's a bit unfortunate with those
windows
so that's a command it's going to send a
digest forwardable test with some data
which is a JSON data it will be also
realized to thrift and it will send it
to through the 100-member to the overlay
and what we should see is we should see
that the message arrives on number three
and it didn't can I make the font bigger
that's a good question I never practice
that okay good thank you is it good the
reason why I didn't work is um okay the
reason why he didn't work is because
what happens is when we create an
overlay and we get a response from from
the gossiper diamond and that response
is a token we need to use this token as
authentication for what we want to send
in this case the token is different
obviously let's do it
don't can
ok
it's a remember ok let's try through
this yes so I've sent it through one or
one and not 100 but we see that the
message arrived so what is interesting
to notice is that the message has been
sent from 101 2 102 was my cruiser and
the member 101 received the confirmation
that the message was delivered to 102
and then if we was to check the log of
102 we will see that the message has
been delivered to the Ruby demo client
but the message never appeared on 100 so
it's clever enough to figure out that
the subscriptions exists only on certain
members and it will only deliver those
messages to those members that that we
want to deliver to so that was the first
little demo um so and that's basically
what gospel does um the core of it so
I'm the client the client libraries we
have air lang-java Skala aerobie
javascript there is a chrome support
because in chrome you can run extensions
written in javascript and they have
access to UDP ports and the c-sharp
should work with F sharp and there's
more of them to come so I only have
seven minutes so I'll try to really do
it quicker now so use cases I mentioned
that there is a product called console
so the reason why I started working on
this and haven't used console was
because the the first version that I
talked about we actually finished it
about two months before council came out
and just wanted to carry on on the
experience that I had and just build my
own stuff so I built my own stuff so the
service discovery is a perfect example
for for a gossip system where the
applications can just post whatever data
they need to share with others and they
can be consumed by the by the cluster
and distributed state for example not
only sharing the membership of the
overlay itself but sharing members of
something that connects to your system
can be done with that as well for
example if you have a system that needs
to deliver some messages over
distributed messaging bus where you have
say three brokers and you have member a
connecting to broker a and you have
member be connecting to broker see when
the message from a arrives to be you
don't want to send it to every broker
you just want to make sure that it goes
directly from broker a to broker see so
that would be an example for that where
the what is connected on which broker is
stored in another gossip state which is
then shared across the nose so then so
you know where a subscription is and I
said that there is a multicast support
so I've got those little raspberry PI's
running here there's three of them so it
won't be a subscription demo it will be
just a simple joining demo but I need to
find my terminal
not this one so it's gonna be this one
ok so again three raspberry PI's there
is multi cast enable them on them on so
I will start because with Sulu here
salut opt gossip Aldean possible start
it's going to take a little bit longer
to launch um just because it's a slower
machine and yeah we just basically take
life on the log and obviously I've been
trying that before so so there there are
already some entries and the errors that
are visible there I remember when he
leaves is handled by a separate process
in that line so the thing is written
completely in Erlang so when the member
leaves the process will crash and we
will catch that so that's why we see the
error in the log but it's not really an
error as such and again with a little
curl command which I have someone here
um yeah that's the one we will bring up
term you um I think I remembered IP
addresses of this so it's 0 2 3 and 4 so
we started one here
Casa pro console it's running there
hello
in the command we can see that well
there is a seed but the seed is
completely somewhere else and we use
multicast settings with the multicast
address there so they talk over
multicast so let's bring up three it
should come up hello it's um yeah wrong
window underneath so that we are and we
have the third one which is a tail f VAR
log joseph rock and soul which is
running but not a member yet so we will
make him a member and there we go so we
have three raspberry PI's talking over
multicast with gossip so that's what it
is
the code is available on github is fully
open source this is all available under
MIT license clients and the diamond
itself and if anybody has any questions
I'll be happy to answer questions then
is there any documentation included with
the Gita repository yes there is a there
is a wiki the documentation may not be
the best quality but there is
documentation so there is the
description of all the rest commands and
how to configure it it's under a
gossiper organization github so there's
a number of different projects there are
projects for setting this up for
building this and creating the release
all its all there any other questions um
one of the slides and in the beginning I
saw Gossip for m2m applications but most
of the of your examples where and
service discovery including ryokan
Cassandra dynamite so do you think it's
applicable in it's possible to do gossip
for m2m devices or use it in real-time
messaging ephemeral real-time messaging
like fire chat to deliver messages there
are applications for which that there
are applications for gossip or you get
whether we could use it directly for
machines there is a little project that
i started working on which if you want i
can discuss um when outside of that
anything else i have one last question
then so my intuition from what you share
with us is that what you gain from using
this instead of incorporating in the
logic of your applique
of the of the logic ready to finding
which notes are alive and when they come
back and is that you say that effort
from every time you have to implement
that logic have you can you share any
even if it's an intuition of how shorter
your code base gets when you use
something like this that is already
there as a demo nor I can only refer to
the example from the real world where we
have applied that at a big scale when we
launch the platform at their data we
don't really look at whenever things
does this game up we just launched them
and they will become available so we cut
out a lot of code that would generally
check if the instances a that's one of
the applications how much code hasn't
saved us difficult to say because we
never written that killed and you can
compare the original library is about
three hundred lines of robocode so
that's that's the very nice trick with
gossip is that not many people really
know that it's there but in principle it
is a very very simple protocol which is
not very complex to write and to handle
that's the outcome of this dog thank you
well then let's tank thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
