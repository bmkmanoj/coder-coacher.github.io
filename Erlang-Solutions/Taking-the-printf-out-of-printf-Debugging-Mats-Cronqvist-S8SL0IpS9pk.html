now we're gonna show this marketing this
is the classic hope you speak this is
where I saw work
that's not when we people so it's to be
tracing things to your one except that
you can multiply this number by 5 and
then you get the number of euros so
flexible has increased by a factor of a
hundred is ISIL so we're having yen I
mean Christi but totally different talk
I gave this many years ago very fun and
this is my conclusion this time and
ability
I refer to it and talk to my bosses
America they're all right so I was
thinking about that when I saw this the
thing is that this is a joke they kind
of look weaker sheep age ancestors like
stupid quotes from a hacker news many
stupid things here but this is actually
not so stupid printing stuff discrete is
propensity function yeah exactly
savithri
course earlier than the Silver Bullet
racing but basically what it was
praising is about this as you can on the
fly east Metro don't like that's done
with something called
it's race you just some longer process
you can you have some different types of
crazy to do the most interesting ones
for as it is the message passing
to give you an advance and they call
tracing which is you need cement your
your troll it slowly you develop
instrument they're going to lecture in
the scheduler but that's more
interesting for programmers that's other
stuff too but these so every time in and
free or something and by default it's
you have to setup a moment
right know if you can see this I'm going
to practice show some code here
all right so I'm setting up an
environment here a simple fear itself is
a function of your home it's jammed
itself is of course the process and I
write the function here in the tracer
process so tell the emulator to give me
an event every time this process then
until it's are waiting for three seconds
and then I okay
you don't see that any of that but miss
pieces make a pumpkin that saltiness
right so once I do this on here nothing
will happen
here are a few presents amount of fluff
and what do you know we got a bunch of
messages here grace man is this is the
people know it's scheduled out three
times
this explanation but when the house is
helpful we want the preset right but so
we need to eat when you surrender and
the whole prayer function without you
how long does that happen tell this
function this innovate and what the
functionality of the function trades on
then my opponents to this view these
instruments every function at least okay
then
you have to code that does something if
you can
that's very very the condition which is
my keyboard and there's body it with me
yeah because of the specification of
this match you a heads but here's an
example so play I want to problem is on
prejudice who do something wrong
function only the functions are two
organism that are known increasing
events once there to each other and the
authorities have an asset of this both
be tears there are two arguments they
should be the same
that's matching here my whole life I
want to find the variable of one the two
are what you did I want to be less than
headache morning there to be less than
run to my shelter began to take freebies
I find this matchstick variable here
intimidation tracing this function
pieces and but only if the two arguments
are equal and greater than 3 and then I
do this dominance recession before I
find these variable appears upon the
customs so now I fold in both trace and
trace paths
my tracer not all these and twice the
only good one message was called this is
actually often it is only when something
special happens we have the functions
four million times a second but
sometimes is called by some carefully go
see that everything goes bad your only
interesting this is
but the operation instructions nuts
no I needed something to that job right
so these are world's worst P so this
dissent supposed to be the V code this
loading simulator and there's a buck
instructions properly well and the
program and then there's enough and
that's all this stuff that's normal wait
normally works execute these when you
set up tracing of his function here you
change the nothing to jump that jump
jumps you to this bit of code which is
about mass spec thing yes only moves on
running some especially loop emulator
which run sets stuff to match that
coconut jumps back here so the cost of
racing it very little pressure
there is suppose to Walsall takes the
war story here emulator it was like that
morphine traffic Maury that the
operators tools the only way to get to
it was invited to write to eat and
comment and the problem was that every
three months it would there was the load
on this machine was pretty low but every
other ninety days alone became very high
nobody nasty so it's like phone company
do they this Center guy out there
innovation so this never happened but
they were unhappy especially there are
many machines and
which is of course also unusual things
Louis asks us to pieces and run that
race one minute done right so it's very
similar to the program is show so puppet
racer each other then I made this Danish
guy this rotted liner so he's broke the
machine that he waited like 91 Brandon
my code and then we do the branch one
more time an email list approximately
this is pretty high
not happy - 5-1 win over the decision
he's happy wrong with the system was not
happy so it was that my food right
profiler and compared excuse me that
breach you talk about that the it was
comfortable
- mom so once it's is a dictionary
condition but hashes piece and this
exists one table that integers is a key
but was the easier to be that hash
function stopped working so if it has
everything percent but the one that one
and the point of this process help think
of anyway
yeah I suppose it wasn't Denmark Germany
and this which had this I understand
inconvenience people connect
but the other day baby
go take something that looks like if I
was a bright great some lists attend it
said went along with recall and there
well I think pretty complicated to match
this is what I wanted and this will pray
about this so basically only one
function it's great luck storm and then
you put in a string like these right to
phrase and there you go
one other feature often you have homes
in functionally crash perhaps to do
something better than to take the base
but it did something bad because was
cold like that with a bad arguments but
you didn't know who called it so you
have this functioning he made called
from hundred different places who is it
that false function that's a question
same trace again except this time I want
to see the stuff instead I get this gold
this depends with the two big arm is
here but here at now I can see where it
came from
this is for me
in the shell I mean always do you see
that here as well that's the same system
razzuma one little distinctiveness is
that he would always tell myself either
it solves itself after some time like 15
seconds in the fall it is not the
phrasing or after tennis it will also
give itself if it gets into problems
many messages consulted we're running on
time yeah I knew against it I wish
processes you wanna pray time and also
it's distributed for so you can do
questions
it's
yeah it actually has a furniture that it
doesn't have to be available to the
Machine they want appraisal because it
loads itself the first thing it does is
it checks if it the target machine has
some latest emotional brand and if it
doesn't it load itself machines where at
present that's actually something I had
to do because of the land
but that's so that I can actually spot
the red bike trace from the top batch
there's a sweet better that wrong right
oh my gosh and it's also machine
and they can do is not language all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
