dirigible Manila which is in
collaborative he worked in Eastern
attics which is mostly factor using he
has experience with Java PHP Python one
for certain something in our an elixir
today infinite talk about pyramid I have
removed your thinking parameters were
running which i think is a very
interesting topic like what about
fingering for me in city level developer
materiality and kilos comes out of entry
how our body are people coming up with
ego my simians mean already a middle or
a good intuition about me
I will complement this a picture of the
city where led which has these other
landmarks and maybe a storage have like
120 meters or something yet how to
determine it is a Cathedral and I want
for a complete conscious on leaders we
do our most it would be a stop on the
front end and we started and growing our
elixir
apps and also lipid hotel and expand on
Budapest under it so it's quite a
distance as you can see there's a star
for a twin life so I'm work I work
remotely for them so here's a picture of
my dog that gives company so yeah you
know this leaving T be part of interval
and a half thousand half-japanese is a
little quirk in Missouri motive for our
company Universal different kind of
feature but let's talk about elixir and
is talking about how I got into elixir
and if how I taught me a lesson there
are valid valuable and the benefits of
them either
it's unfortunate unfortunate that I use
this thing attempting that sounded very
weak it is so before talking about extra
time I need to talk with all of this
so who here know what my preserves means
yeah pretty much everybody
so if it's all it's working it's working
all began for me when I started writing
my teens about it and you can see my
facility the buzzword of photography and
started growing and it didn't stop still
pretty relevant and it is also a
controversial and hyping up topic
because you can sense it famous people
and company talking about it so people
still don't sit pretty well and spirit
relevant in jabber jabber would like I
just started studied I will jump in on
and I trained and taught it a lot and
I'm not gonna talk about it as you can
see the introduction in short it's not
short
it's not a mistake you know has read it
so spirit is not simple it's complicated
overall a lot of aspects so instead I'm
gonna talk about the problems that
supposed to party intense sort in power
so probably models comes at
in women gross pollen systems are gross
sabbaticals fast those too large and
start starts having problems and
especially in companies that get that
that will be four against Google Amazon
and it's probably a lot of public models
and there's that's where like micro
sources related stuff came from so I
will briefly explain probably start with
Molly's overall first one is
availability when working fields are
everything comes down because everything
is connected in their collective it
takes too long to bring up analysis so
my granular releases for hard and it
seems it's hard to get covered up every
time and it becomes a big relief and
usually the systems the popular ones
that happened with hard coded remote
support and usually has a single
database for the identification come
down with them second problem is a well
ability technical debt is something that
that happens that that's a lot that's a
broader term for being like fragile
modules that code to be critical and not
take it or different versions of free
world and he gets really it comes up
really fast when you have a monolithic
system especially in the echo system we
have today with startups where we get
the department gets funded you have like
a deadline and a bunch art and you have
delivered a little deliver and techno
that gets quickly also there's a
environment differences I think that
works on the machining and doesn't work
on another staging or production it can
be reducible so you can pretend there's
a future cycle part with this kind of
solute and availability the releases
take too long
to put into production so so class for
the people and also because of that they
are robots are people you can't repay a
single feature that had a problem yes
kind of over the whole Jewish beliefs so
that's also problem and eternal that
means your ability so this has through
perspective the technical skill ability
which is kinda like scaling my copy
pushing putting a load balancer and
smuggling trailer so you have copied the
whole model ISM and absolute I'm going
to talk about later in organizational as
elevator below when you grow systems
ability your team it gets harder to
manage over time so we do those problems
I believe microservices column and and
refine would use my services practice
and to Samba call Mohammed which one
should I start so I start come on we're
desperate for it most of the most people
do it and find and most of the building
grow up to the point that they have
those problems that be super book and I
actually I expected someone first hand
project adding micro sources and that
was really that idea there was chaos
chaos machine there was a community
overhead there was a sibling learning
proof for new tools there was too many
too many tools being used necessary so
it was really awful to me and also the
daughter's room and that's also a bad
idea because it costs too much and how
about migration had is easy to thrive
you can just be another new service but
it also kind of also kind of had less
impact on the one with itself but what
without war profits implement excuse me
the biggest much planning in should be
clearly motivated
otherwise it's who wanted to happen it's
not very effective and after the end I
was like that they were really helps
truth because microsurgery not seen
before for the for everybody's just pay
taxes to do air by burning on Tucker the
team on organizational so I was looking
for alternatives so coming from from
Java absolutely first language Scala
Clojure suits to Rundle JVM so what
exactly my choice and to like a taka
taka and load balancers with health
check is also part of the master system
and I was trying to move into a new kind
of fresh perspective when I came to
actor model Kathleen and I came to
Berlin so it was basically managing
telephone system near zero downtime and
and use network partitions and really
like a good idea
so I attend for 101 and this might put
reaction upon these four right numbers
because I have personal messages with
pro so yeah long story short I hated and
I look at a big sit back like now
do I have this in okay so I was also
there were like a completion of my
vision without really a cultural other
time again if you like so
and seems like a kind of kind of like an
issue
we everything is like I guess another
time so that was kind of like a naive of
me but doesn't elixir so get all the
benefits from lnx systems and ever time
and I love it so a little bit about that
experience handle if time runs impacts
I really like the elixir syntax I don't
know why the terrible movies I don't
like Ruby syntax and until you complete
the rebel here really accessible and
it's plates powerful dots inside is
really have a really cool candy type
station module or functionally just
comes all the horrible is just easy
pretty solid and and they around there
is the elegance of pattern matching
already mostly I have by advice by my
side on here and portal maps as well
there's this compression features they
are mostly with markers insider language
my phone my favorite the tight operator
and we can also define your own which is
really awesome for the language and
general functional problem is due to a
package like MapReduce
please confirmation notification miss
our predictions so when I came from us
during these events become not only the
alixus language but the being long time
are the what are the produce to the
modeling problems because I part
connected you should not between
certainly to the Microsystems and it
kind of solves a lot of problems in a
different way so a little availability
resolves through our four colors because
it has general address with hearts and
since our minds are large it is tangible
trans Engelberg every starts folks at
restart music works
or when you have a problem for desktop
and mobile apps of the resulting words
the semantic low speeds could be state
action speed is corrupted so getting for
a fresh start either an eligible and the
granular app we start you can use tax
part just parts of your application
about the both so availability is less
effective and it also depends on each
other you can kind of start with this
provision tree as well so it's
application will approach and process
memory regulation because each state in
this case share of works properly a
process kinda like makes the state
corrupt and a lot of process excessive
as well insulin spike through the whole
system so it kind of encourages like
drinking water from the same well if you
point in the water every everyone
sanitizer if everyone has like its own
research you don't have that problem so
the second is not easy to control
programming I will put their scientists
especially about usability and
computability music music entities as
allowing transpiration represent
referential transparency so data doesn't
sense
changement analogies like the video will
also make it easy to read different
testable because means you can either
rate size X more morally
so a function that doesn't have a side
effect is worth more as it could be so
tests are more consistent its composable
because the function are first class
citizens where you can more easily
compose make smaller pieces and put
together in a higher distraction and
these reusable twelve because you came
back around sorry there's no implicit
are
contest so you can pass around and I'm
going to be affected by the common
desire news and these are low
productivity problem solving by function
of revenue was also recently mentioned
by our to the money elixir property node
so it's a really good thing to know is
accelerating serve in a really different
experience program and also master
ability to distribution it is like it
more not exactly to this solution but
it's more of a broader perspective about
the bottle a leader but he has an only
be absent scale each individually law
allows location to spicy
and similarly connected nodes are when
you collect other element node into
another and the third one is connects to
the whole culture and for for
scalability that is the really good one
and also I also rented scheduling allow
long running an instructor process get
on everyone so most of the concepts I
mentioned until now is kind of related
to this principle which is a
synchronicity so the core of this form
of early learning little mouse or
aligning itself and it's a really hard
movie hard with different thing to learn
and in a surly Harris on your daily life
depending on what's working you do so
there are a few benefits of learning is
this concept actually not practical
matter using a language or runtime now
first that each message orientation
because message our coffee from process
process so you are kind of how we need
data you
at only what's necessary and also miss
you define clear interference when you
receiving a message to another process
and there is joy not necessarily we
force you to define a clear interest to
be able to to do what's what your view
could be happy so if n second allows to
object orientation so when small talk
more development by a few couple of
great minds including our talents okay
for educational purposes they define
like object orientation idols and
depending the language and the mostly
functional message the object just just
an abstraction to the whole space but
there other language the team after it
actually just folks in object and kind
of followed about a message and there's
a recent quote kids of receive could
quote biology of love this fine
gentleman as a recent but it's written
compared small problems with ageism and
so he other will use early messaging
local retention and protection and kind
of state process which is basically just
describing profits of being which is
often and concentrate a parallel about
biological cells are being biological
cells or computers in a network terminus
and then execution not bothered for too
long so when a process is waiting for a
message you just leave a building with
CPU time you can fire forgetting without
fear and you can you can accuse alone
running also great learning process
without hassle so in salute additions
your blog to your toolbox and also you
can just spin much process early one
because about memory of wood good flow
of course morning you can't but you know
easier and less prone to problems
what is this scary event marking time
adventure it will be been sittin around
in years so it's hard to do in a
synchronous melons
we have think secretly because data is
coming from those who are with four
places and go into also most places in
broadcasting for example and
subscription and introduces alternatives
where general request response workflow
so kind of changes everything and you
also observe it's a good fit around the
group of WebSocket and updated
applications on the web
it is really a brief seems and also
using figuration external systems from
biologists what don't database it's
easier when you have like just a service
subscription a component and you know
deliver of the workflow and also the
random business curriculum is your easy
Spanish you're eventually consistent and
you don't want to let me walk caching so
another might be anything
and Canada second topic of my talk is
and is a synchronous city in the
organizational perspective i before our
husbands talked about this one was
learning about singles change me change
the way I think is that not only in the
technical manner but also in the
organizational understands for people
that make software so before for
explaining this I will quote up a common
law which is states that organizations
which design systems are constraints
produced enzymes which are copies of the
communication structures of these
organizations so when you when you not
know how to manage people but live
around people that they software this is
the question can be relevant and we can
think about it as if it has reflective
reflecting system design also incredibly
interesting to learn about
so first going about is expecting
increasing condo fees in remote rivers
ah we have people that work remotely
intercom yeah big answer so when you are
working remotely it's hard it's hard to
talk equals people not not only like of
course you're you're remotely but in a
call for example and and as an
organization of Rose which she was at
first animation the problem of with
monolith in a tease role as well so
things after when they grown and up
there there that they are speak to teams
and put into another room other floor
other buildings city countries and
continents well so what happened is that
putting some everyone in one room that
anymore gets hard so and even if you put
it you know I think most of developers
don't like meetings especially because
of them so at the time the
organizational growth synchronous
communication gets harder and harder
so think about thinking about a
simplicity in organizational
communication is a really interested way
I'm going to show up fully Illustrated
technical offer of this yes this is
until the thing is we need to converse
in a tree and this triangle is kind of
management because I don't know people
like intelligent things growth so they
put people on top of others and it has
been likely in fact for the people also
talk about other people there's a
tentative like on middle management
because it's between management and
everyone else and this is this this
pretty much clinical examples are
communication overhead because what
happened is instead of people talking to
you exactly the person that they need to
talk and talk how in the hierarchy and
that's something that happened pretty
much there was that I think it was an
interview with the CEO in the early 2000
about how they solve the problems of
soon people sitting by screaming eating
but so-called to dissidents so if there
are teams with people management
overhead and speaking small teams which
kind of like a class hierarchy you want
exactly like nemesis because you have
like foolish pattern of hierarchy but
it's kind of like me until
organizational change type solver and
design problem and I think they marching
forward pointless absurd for that but I
don't know exactly how tribunal work
together the resignation so there is
that kind of like a condition from this
traditional high rise companies to the
form of society the on company were not
too big but we already has a flat
hierarchy because the teams are
autonomous and that's really empowering
and you have we have people to help to
do also the anything you want so it'll
be recouped for developing any kind of
projects or problems
and you can choose a parallel system
designs where you have sympathetic layer
beep and get speaking to kind of model
this even so those people work along
exams compute you so it's like angler
and react their dislike use mostly
layered architecture and also you change
the way you think and similarly another
also a one mention a few after you the
more elaborate extreme example this is
this Japanese partition Qaeda which is
vertical society get bad it's kind of
like country acceptance for the society
be hierarchical so if you have a
supervisor or something someone that is
supposed to take care of you you have
fully respected Authority and this
involves a unified organizations outside
any fine are more stricter because you
kind of like can I have to because
otherwise you can use this area but what
happened is when you can't remember the
two teams and you're limiting if needs
talk to another guy on the other team
you can talk to him directly you have to
go your supervisor to talk to his
supervisor which is weird but actually
happened until today that way Nigeria
was improved for a Japanese kind and the
first meeting we talked to guy and we're
supposed to make an integration refused
at him fight and said ok we sort of and
revealed later
right technically he wasn't there and we
were like now the started ugly facts
about intubation we'll talk to you later
no no you can talk how to make and one
talks to his supervisor into supervisor
result delegate someone they are people
like white desert it was kind of like a
cruise or plan could relax in a sense
because these formal hierarchy students
stupid it's pretty common and company's
not as high-tech companies but the way
he was stricter you weren't interested
because there was we could come like
five top of communications to get into
the garden
could we have who has ADD on skype so it
was religious or we couldn't couldn't
this you are really a per minute or just
as we was either not by others for me
and most religiously is trying to come
with something like this which is like I
think that it Oklahoma's end and iconic
a twist with each other but also what
happens with this is that there are so
many people to talk about and sometimes
there's a project or product or
something Colonel that health care
anyone's talk about it the more teams
you have the more people have that one
room is talked about as well so we as
not synchronicity to this communication
person it gets kind of like easier so
for example there's simple story is
horrified about interrupt blogs
presentation on Fridays and using the
dollars on that is more different ways
of complications rather than just going
to the responsible person talk directly
to the night so they take away these
understand a synchronous communication
not only in the technical sense but in
the organizational sense as well
of course there are two drawbacks of
understanding of these kind of new
houses and the person is functional
programming it's hard to learn because
it's something hard transition actually
if you are in youth you are already 200
people for example I see I can see Java
in Germany there was an introduction of
something like a lambda function it just
kind of just one feature of fortunately
and people were like either freaking out
because it looks weird Nicole or just
not using at all and it's really hard
because it's not involves new concept
involves our recursion sometimes math
advanced advanced math conference one of
the things that panel mentioned is the
Combinator project X Y Combinator that
is allows and almost recursive functions
and you don't be able to be programming
the language but when you study
it's like mention a few times and kind
of on graph graph it and also I think
like immutability which sounds like it
by the ways of processing your memory or
which which is when you when commercial
programming doesn't click so easily and
also a synchronous operation with
relational data is hard and when I said
additionally edit because we use sequel
database most of the time and if you
want to program in a Nazi
Mandor in english productions hard and
also these securities transactions are
doing this kind of piece it's a bad idea
so when you think like elixir and like
all right and we have like a database of
postman you don't have operational and
the freedom to just do things secretly
as you is because you've got a kind of
loose consistency so these are also a
hurdle I think branches of workflow so
when you want try to accomplish
accomplished a balloonist and a
synchronous manner it's hard kind of
described Viking epics and stories and
workflows when we are playing systems
because we kind of add like primal
constraints so tart out throughout time
in a Latino table when you're discussing
and you eventually eventually
synchronize and synchronization of data
in state is comfortable and usually turn
to the first because you landed the
operational guarantee like an order of
quality the garbage of order sorry and
also rope pulling back a synchronous
operations are are always others all of
the questions because usually we don't
fill on the context of the caller and in
conclusion I would like to state there's
two main conclusions and one of these is
of functional programming so it is like
a building applications level where you
can build your own species or own own
pieces we kind of marked with pieces
with side effects and putting like a
boundaries and you base all visas to
maybe sprint or then you combine them so
it's pretty nice
you can define the top of the interface
as well so the big speak it's pretty
awful to build English
and security is like saying both these
instead of talking to your colleagues so
all seems like paper
resize and you can't put so much on it
so you just put what it needed and maybe
sign up your message and sometimes these
are not going to be there another answer
so you have to change the way you think
about about how even community stuff and
also you when you come back your neck
there's going to be a lot importance or
stuff to do so this is using pattern the
main takeaway that that I expect working
this is Facebook
