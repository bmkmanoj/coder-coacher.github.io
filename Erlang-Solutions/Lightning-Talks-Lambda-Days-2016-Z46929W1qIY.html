were going to have five lightning talks
now and then right straight to the after
party so our first the lightning talk
speaker is just offended please welcome
to stop hello so I want to talk about
developing elixir with Adam so at first
I will make some survey how many of you
are developing actively elixir okay how
many of you has considered developing
elixir that's great okay so not right
now for active developers what tools are
you using I guess most of you are using
Emacs who is using Emacs not so many
I've been really ok no worse a sublime
ok quite a few and who did use Adam for
just one not two people ok so it's quite
good so I'm the creator of Adam
autocomplete elixir plugging and I would
like to show it that because right now
and I've checked all of the plugins and
right now Adam is most suitable it has
most features to develop elixir in I
know some of you probably are religious
about Emacs or vin I'm using Emacs
myself so I know that kind of stuff
emacs right now is missing few features
like you can't have really syntax
checking in alex year you can have
underlying of errors and warnings which
autumn right now actually has and all of
you know that some of those editors has
their flaws emacs is really hard to
learn vim is not a full pledge eid e
sublime is not open source so there is
also intellij idea which I know how many
of you are using IntelliJ IDEA for
sir that talking actually pretty sucks
right now but I guess they will develop
it so I would want to show you what can
you do with my plug in right now in Adam
so if I put it here right now you can
we've got intelligent Auto completion of
all models you can you can see the
functions of the of each model you can
see the Iridium functions you can see
returned types of all the functions you
can see taken types of the arguments
which is pretty nice you can also expand
mark all the snippets it's hard to use
with one hand and like I said it has
error checking which is pretty good
because it's missing in most of the yeah
in most of the editors you've got all
the errors of the computation in here
and the electric community is growing
Adam is also pretty popular editor is
getting much more people are so I guess
it's worth trying especially for people
not really knowing more advanced editors
like Emacs and vim so I invite you to
check it out and to finish I would like
to brag with some numbers right now this
one week ago this plug-in hit 10,000
downloads which makes it third most
popular tool for elixir 1000 less than
Emacs plug in the alchemist and only
three thousand less than IntelliJ IDEA
plugin and it's twice the number of vim
plugin so
so thank you for your attention thank
you now we would like to welcome back
okay thank you we'll talk about
object-oriented programming in elixir
all right so my name is vitek and I'd
like to talk about object-oriented
program kinetics here and before doing
that let's take a look at some example
extra code so here we just have a module
and with a name field and on the bottom
you can see how we can interact with it
and we can also define a function say
hello to that accepts just two arguments
and when we pass in Joe and Robert it
would output hello robert which I always
wanted to wanted to say all right so now
that we have basics you know here we can
just see some simple modules and
functions and immutable data that we
pass around so let's make some mess
let's do some o P so I wrote a library
called opie and this is how we can use
it so you import the open Jule and now
you can start to define classes in a
next year so you can have a name field
here as well and you can instantiate
objects of these classes and you can
call methods on these objects as you
would expect and you can also define
methods on these classes so we we have
the say hello to again but now it only
accepts one argument and there is a DS
keyword because that's what you would
expect in RP language and finally we
have mutation that's something that you
often have as well in an Opie language
okay so perhaps you are wondering well
how does it work this is all valid alexr
code which also means it compiles to
beam which can run
everywhere everyone groans so how does
it work the answer is you don't want to
know and the real answer is it uses
macros pretty heavily okay well so maybe
that's not that bad of that I showed you
maybe that's not maybe it's not that bad
so what's worse so what's worse than LP
and my answer is is a Hopi with
inheritance and this library supports
that as well so we maybe have a human
and maybe there's a doctor with a name
and you know we can do what what you
would expect okay so maybe that's still
not that bad so what words the nopee
with inheritance yes yes so this library
supports multiple inheritance so again
maybe you have a human class and we have
a spider class so maybe we want to have
a spider-man which inherits from a human
and spider and yeah you can have as many
classes as you want you may run into
some interesting diamond problems and
such okay so a couple of guidelines
perhaps you have heard some of them so
what's the first rule of writing macros
as I mentioned it uses macros the first
rule is don't write macros so I'd like
to propose a new row which is was the
first row of doing open elixir and don't
develop in elixir okay so maybe you are
wondering well I wrote this library and
I just told you not to use it so like
what's the deal so the reason is that i
wrote it is that i wanted to show you
how alex how powerful alex series that
you can with macros and some other
facilities you can create some dsl's and
abstractions and new semantics that's
also true for many other programming
languages but with these constructs you
increase complexity and you make your
systems harder to understand and to
maintain instead we should strive for
simplicity and for those just modules
and factions are usually all you need
thank you
hello my name is Peter and I will show
you something completely drift different
from anything you have ever done with
your computer's it's quantum computing
and I'm not sure if I can show you
anything you and I will understand and
i'm not sure is the most important
phrase you have i will use today okay
with normal computers everything you
write your fancy objects functions
macros etc are basically sets of beats
zeros and ones but if i have quantum
computer every bit let's say cube it
it's not either 0 or 1 because it can be
0 and 1 in the same time it's important
that we could track that our cubed R
let's say we zero with forty percent
probability 0 fifty percent probability
what does it mean it means that we could
conduct our computation on all possible
values at once let's say we could throw
in cubit two values either 0 or 1 and
then we can pass this cubed to a gate
gate it's quite simple simple thing
let's say it's something like that and
this will be negation okay we could pass
their accurate and get another quit if
it will be a classic negation
we pass the 0 and get one with us one
and get 0 if we have cubits we can chill
values let's say our final beta and
there are probabilities of 0 of 0 and 1
let's say in person what we could get
after negation with we had sixty percent
chance 40 then after negation we could
get one with sixty percent probability
and with forty percent probability we
could get 0 okay why we do that yeah
yeah it's quite stupid example but we
could do something more let's say we
could do silkroad quantum circuit we
could compose guys into three ways and
we could create something that adds two
numbers and I did something like that if
I would like to add two sick two numbers
and code that in six bits each mm I run
out of from 8 gigabytes of RAM so it's
quite hard to implement and compute but
if we do that in quantum way we could
add all possible six bits numbers at
once so here we could negate either 0
and 1 it was but there is another
problem we should check
what we get in real quantum computers we
cannot tell ok we have 0 &amp;amp; 1 advance in
the same moment with some probabilities
we cannot measure these probabilities so
we could we could pull this one and say
okay it's 0 but why I'm not sure but if
we conduct some computation 10 times 100
times we could get results let's say
similar to these probabilities what
could we achieve with dots we could we
could crack NSA this is a famous example
that if we could conduct as many
computations advance and check let's say
which number is prime mmm we could find
out quite fast how to get their own
mailbox ok but it's not real quantum
computer something I rise to my
university subject in Python and it's
horrible slow but what's important I
could use it not in the ok I could show
in this library computation in that way
it is described in papers and there's
another problem let's say I implemented
quantum Fourier transform there was
three papers each of them describe
describes other algorithm and i had to
guess which one is
which one should i use and i'm not sure
but i think i use the proper one and
okay there's no time yeah okay i have i
will show i show you this code because
mmm i i'm not able to write all of its
myself so I hope somebody will have
helped me with it it's it's fun it's
very fun but frustrated also so maybe
maybe someone would like to help me so
my name is kuba and I'm gonna tell you
also about quantum computing but from a
bit different perspective because what's
a qubit ain't nobody got time for that
we're not going to talk about it but I'm
gonna tell you just a very basic so just
like Peter said before me classical bits
can be 0 or 1 at the same time which
isn't kind of Revelation now Cupid's are
like Schrodinger's cats which means
they're both dead and alive at the same
time and also that doesn't probably give
you much but if you think about it if
you had like a string of end classical
bits you can only represent and won a
single and bit number right well it
doesn't surprise anyone at least it
shouldn't but if you have n qubits and
every single one of them is both 0 and 1
it means that in some way some magical
way we describe 2 to the power of n
numbers at the same time but who'd care
about that why does it why should it
interest you well what if I tell you
that we could or we should efficiently
may do integer factorization to break
our essay or any other stuff or minimize
global functions which means we could
train like huge neural networks and
simulate human brains probably or
simulate social processes and actually
sent help somewhere before it's actually
necessary out there because we simulated
it before
or if we could simulate complex
biological systems like folding of the
protein and all that stuff to find
cancer cures and all that stuff and
finally simulate quantum systems because
our world is all quantum physics whether
you like it or not and we would like to
simulate that thing but even with the
most powerful computers we have today
it's like nah it's it's just not going
to happen no well we're not going to do
it but if we have quantum computing yes
we can to all of that so basically when
I tell most people what I do with
quantum computing is like I don't really
know what is that well for real quantum
coupling or at least the way we see it
scientifically is pretty simple and it's
like that so it's probably not the most
sexy thing you can think about but at
the same time it's like a function and
it's really easy to represent it using
functional dependencies this is another
way of describing it and if you think
about it like every line represents a
single qubit and you have only like
transformations applied to every one of
those and while it may not appear like
directly easy to you we have two ways of
writing that kind of stuff into real
computers right a machine language good
luck with that or we can just use any
functional language we have today to
describe those proper functional
dependencies of qubits to program a real
quantum computer now why should you
still care about that well just because
functional programming languages are the
future of quantum computing if we ever
going to have it then functional
languages are going to be the languages
of quantum computing which going to be
so super powerful and co unfortunately
building a real quantum computer is like
another story and it's quite far from
today the good news is that there's a
huge amount of research on it even if
you never heard about it it's like many
companies including Microsoft and Google
and NASA and American governmental that
stuff
just huge amounts of money into quantum
computing may mostly because they would
like to break the NSA but there are
other cool usages that I can think about
and it's kind of worth it we could do so
many cool things not only like break the
RSA but we could really improve the
world if we had quantum computing so
it's at all well damn know it's there is
a lot to talk about you really would
need to understand the complex math
behind it probably to start your wealth
stuff dealing with quantum computing but
hopefully it's going to be much easier
in the future just like today you don't
need to understand how electrons fly
inside of your processor to write code
right but as I'm running out of time I
would like to thank you all for your
patience invite you to more I get cup if
you're interested in any like
theoretical and practical things about
how to build a quantum computer if I can
say that you can find it all on my
github and yell at me at twitter and
that's all thank you very much for your
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
