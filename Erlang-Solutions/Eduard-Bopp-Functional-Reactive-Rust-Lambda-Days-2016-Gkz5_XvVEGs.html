in the rust programming language I show
how many of you have been at the
previous table but I saw there's always
lots of talk going on about function
reactive programming so I kind of hope
that this context is already there the
rasp roaring language maybe not so much
because it's good kind of well it's not
a functional programming language and
it's also kind of a new thing that's
getting a bit of popularity now though
okay so there's two kind of angles that
you come can come to this topic I guess
the first one which I kind of come from
is you're doing some kind of systems
programming in my case that was game
development and you have a lot of
trouble with event handling because the
way you do it and in imperative language
is no obviously going to languages
usually this model-view-controller
pattern that has a lot of issues that
that can get troublesome in larger
applications and so I looked into FRP as
an alternative and found that solved
quite a lot of these problems there was
found that I found there's also another
angle that you can get to this I guess
which is pretty much your only sold on
f4p
because you have a function programming
background or whatever but now you get
to an application domain where you maybe
can't use all the nice things like
Haskell or closure or alexey or elm or
whatever you want to use and so yeah you
look for other alternatives and I think
rust is an interesting alternative
solver what I've done is pretty much
write a library in rust in safe rust
Adam I'm going to spend later what that
means and it was originally built for
game demand but it's very fairly generic
implementation of FRP you can get it on
github under my username and also
increase IO which is rusts package
repository it's a zero point something
thing so it's not like production ready
yet
but I'm just going to talk a little bit
by what it looks like at the moment
first of all I would like to say a few
words about rust because I'm I would
assume that it's not familiar to
everybody here
so rust basically is a systems
programming language that has a very
much focus in performance and it's near
see I say
near because it's not it does quite a
few things at run time for safety
reasons such as array bounce checks so
it's not entirely the same that you can
get if you write C or R or assembler or
something but it's pretty close and the
nice thing about rust as compared with
the language like C though is that it
statically prevents all these kind of
memory corruption issues that you get
when doing programming in these
languages and it does this using a
static type system to figure out at
compile time whether what you're doing
with all your memory allocated resources
is actually develop and doesn't lead
well it and doesn't lead to these kinds
of violations it also on top of this
mechanism guarantees thread safety so
you it pretty much follows the single
writer principle so you can never have
to write writing handles to the same
resource and given all these this these
constraints it focuses on building
abstractions that are zero cost so
pretty much everything that the compiler
can just annihilate when building your
application so that at runtime you're
doing pretty much the same thing that
you would have done with a C program but
you have done all these checks before
that it's actually safe to do so and it
also has quite a lot of functional
programming features like has
first-class functions it uses a lot of
generics and algebraic data types which
are really nice to build functional
semantics with it now let's look at the
bar for us code is the obligatory has a
word program nothing too fancy here I
guess it's just a main function that
prints hello world
yeah this is what let bindings look like
in rust yeah you just have this first of
all everything is immutable by default
which is pretty nice property to work
with
and you declare that you can annotate
the type that also has type inference so
you don't need to if it can be inferred
from the context you can also it's not a
function programming image so you can
just declare a variable as mutable and
assign another value to it but you have
to explicitly say so and there are some
limitations on when you make something
mutable it will not be usable in certain
contexts to guarantee the properties
that I talked about before then is the
concept of ownership so this is pretty
much what a function looks like so the
upper four lines there you have a vector
and you pretty much just want to look at
so it's a vector of integers 32-bit
integers and on this program you're
pretty much very precise about what kind
of type you have there and if you want
to calculate the sum of that vector we
can convert that into an iterator and
fold over it so we have kind of this
nice function API with a little bit of
conversion between a vector and iterate
over there but the interesting part here
is that when I pass the vector like
initialize some vector with one two
three in it and pass that to the
function it will compute the result but
afterwards I can't use that anymore so I
if I wanted to do anything else with a
vector I couldn't because I've consumed
the vector and it's gone so that's kind
of inconvenient but this is how just
make sure that you don't share certain
things now of course you can't really
work with something I just works like
that so you have to sort of introduce a
way of sharing things and this is called
borrowing and rust so you pretty much
can just instead of giving ownership of
the vector to the function you can just
borrow it by giving it a slice of the
vector in this case and then you use
this funny ampersand symbol to indicate
okay I have a reference to this thing
and then you can use the vector
afterwards because after the function is
done computing the sum it sort of
returns or gives the ownership
leases ownership of that value so the
surrounding scope has ownership of it
again
so right there are also mutable boroughs
so these are boroughs into resources
where you can actually mutate the
contents so this is how you yeah just
define some variable and then in a scope
that I note by these curly braces you
can take a mutable borrow and modify
that you can also think doing this in a
function too but this thing so for a
given resource you can only ever have
one mutable borrow you can't create
multiple of them and the otherwise the
compiler will yell at you this is to
ensure these single writer principle
okay um just a bit more of course we
have structs and enums in amps were
pretty much like algebraic data types
and starts are the same thing as in C so
these are the fundamental building about
how you build more complicated types in
rust and they have very efficient the
representation on the machine in the end
okay that's it so far about rust so
let's continue a little bit about
furniture active programming I've
noticed that a lot of has been talked
about that at this conference already so
but I'm just going to wrap up the basic
idea so you have essentially this
function approach to event handling and
how this affects your application state
and you want to build these time varying
data structures like signals and streams
or observables or however you want to
call them and then you have these high
level operators on them and this way you
sort of have an immutable way of talking
about application stage and events that
you can manipulate with purely
functional functions right that's set
FRP comes in a million different flavors
and amelia is probably a bit too much
but there are a lot of varieties and
this is where I was sort of want to talk
a little bit what carboxyls are my
library's flavor particular is of
function active programming so
in contrast to what many popular 4p
libraries do at the moment
cabassa listing which is two different
types so the first type is a stream and
this is just a sequence of discrete
events so this is really this does not
contain any state whatsoever it just
says essentially okay at five o'clock a
happened and at seven o'clock B happened
and then at half-past seven C happened
and so forth so there's no it doesn't
doesn't really persist the state of
these events as its current value for
that you have a signal and that is a
value that varies continuously over time
so it might be just an event stream held
essentially so you just persist the
state of a given event stream and just
take the last one so you have a stepwise
function so from 5 to 7 o'clock ima and
from 7 to 1/2 + 7 MB and after that I'm
C but it could also be something that
really changes continuously like a sine
wave or some cubic interpolation between
two values if you want to do animation
or computer graphics and I find this
notion of continuous time pretty useful
especially if you do things well I've
been doing video game development so
there were quite usefulness to model
these things that just sort of
continuously change from one thing to
another or where you know the the exact
shape of the time dependency of the
value that being said time in carboxyl
is also implicit rather than explicit
which means that yeah you don't really
write down these functions as functions
of time but you just evaluate something
at a certain point and that it will be
the value that is the current value of
it so if you want you can of course use
some library to bring in explicit time
but the implementation doesn't really
deal with that ok so let me just give
you a quick overview over all the
features this is what it looks like to
just
old streams and signals so because we
are in an imperative language we sort of
have to somehow tie the concept of a
stream to or a signal to the surrounding
context and all these imperative calls
and to do that first of all you have
something called a sink which is
basically just a place to dump events
into so you can have some kind of driver
that reads from a network resource or
something that fetches keyboard events
from your windowing library and then you
can create a stream from that that
pretty much has this definition okay I
contain all the events that somebody at
some point dumps into the sink and with
this you can pretty much work and just
do the all the function transformations
a signal then you can for instance
create from a stream by holding the
stream and giving it some initial value
and then it will change from that
initial value that whenever an event
occurs you can also create I'm showing
this here yet single from just a
function that you might might take I
have some side effects with some input
resource so but okay so in the lower
part of this code you can sort of see
what happens if I just sample the signal
which just means get its current value
in an imperative way then it's going to
be three and once I send something into
this thing it's going to be five so this
is sort of imperatively inspecting
what's going on there if we don't want
to do that much but I'm just going to
show the framework in which this ties
into the rest of the language okay you
can also iterate over a stream so R Us
has mutable iterators that carry the
state of in this case what kind of event
are mapped and then I can just call next
and go to the next event
if there is one there's kind of another
way to just directly communicants
treatment instead of sampling a signal
which might be interesting in some cases
right and now let's go on to the purely
functional stuff we can map so this is a
closure in rust so you just
take a stream and a function and get
another stream in this case the squares
of whatever you put in you can filter
there are a couple of different ways of
doing that using rust optional type so
you can either just use a bully and
predicate and filter everything out that
doesn't satisfy the predicate or you can
return the an option type and if yeah so
only take the some values and open non
values or you can just directly operate
on the option stream so just different
kinds of filtering you can merge two
streams and get a stream that contains
all the events from both you can fold
over a stream and get a signal that
contains so so it contains a state it
has some initial state and whenever you
send an event into it will call the
function with current state and whatever
event you get in and should get out a
new state essentially so this is very
very important to sort of persist
application state in some way right then
a snapshot is pretty interesting because
it takes a signal and a stream and
combines these with a function so in
this example I have a function that
takes the time and some events some
value of a particular event type and
gets out some new thing whatever that is
and so this pretty much takes so this
creates a stream and that stream will
have will occur every time the the
original stream fires and it will sort
of combine the current value of the time
at the point this event has happened
with using the function with the event
that came in all right right another
useful thing is also that you can sort
of lift an ordinary function to a
function on signals and then get a new
signal out of that that sort of just
combines what you've got by using that
function this yeah works for arity up to
four can't do this
generically in rust entirely because
macros are not quite powerful enough I
think
please I haven't succeeded so far but I
don't think you actually need something
more than four because otherwise you
should probably think about researching
your function but anyway right there are
a couple of more things couple more
things that might be interesting for
instance I have also dynamic switching
of streams and signals which is kind of
debatable because it isn't entirely
referentially transparent so this is a
complex discussion I'm kind of thinking
about switch is throwing it out actually
because you might get along without it
and there's also a way to coalesce
events that occur in the same
transaction so if one thing that you
send in will result in two events that
simultaneous there are simultaneous and
are merged at a certain point you may
not want to merge them right away
because then you have no control over
what the sequences so instead you have
some function that takes care of getting
rid of that ambiguity right so far about
the know what Jerry looks like now I
won't talk about how to actually build
applications with it and there are a lot
of libraries available in the rust
ecosystem a great ecosystem so created
Russ is just a library basically and
there are a few that belong to carboxyl
directly that I sort of made into
separate modules to sort of keep these
separate these concerns separate that
help you interface using a streaming API
for command line interface and for
system time and also for windowing so
that includes like getting keyboard and
mouse events from a given window and
drawing to it what's also been very
helpful in that context is L mask which
is a port of graphics API to rust
it's very nice purely functional 2d
graphics API and that helped a lot in
just getting some basic applications set
up and then in general there's also a
lot of infrastructure around game
development that's the Piston game
engine which is primordial R and there
are GFX and clean for doing 3d graphics
and there's gluten which provides a
purist implementation of a windowing
context so that's a lot and I'm probably
mentioning
of this I'm not mentioning half of
things that are actually worth
mentioning here the point is though that
sometimes it's a bit hard to interface
these with carboxyl because they pretty
much just use mutable state wherever
they can for event handling and that
sometimes makes it a bit tricky because
you sort of have to write some driver
that and and and your own declarative
API to feed that into something that
will then make the according side-effect
phone calls based on your purely
functional description but in principle
there's a lot to work with it's just a
bit tricky to integrate yeah so demo
times little slightly problematic
because we have some technical issues so
I can't actually show this right now
which is a bit annoying but it wasn't
this much of an application so the
application that I wanted to show pretty
much was really just a button that you
would click and it would change its
color so effectively a toggle button
it's really nothing too fancy and I'm
still sad that I can't show it but I'm
yeah I wanted to talk about a little bit
more how to build this anyway so I hope
you can forgive me for that right so
looking at the application structure
generally how this how you get from
inputs to outputs you have a couple of
steps to take and this is sort of the
framework that wraps up how this all
works so in my case I'm talking about
the entire application I'm starting out
with a window which contains all these
events that yeah that describe what your
keyboard what you user does essentially
and there are two aspects that I were
several aspects that I can derive from
that first of all get something that I
call context it's pretty much this
signal part of the input so the
continuous part so this is like where is
the mouse currently or yeah I don't know
what is the current size
of my window these things and in my case
I model this context just as something
okay am i hovering my button or am I not
doing that which yeah which pretty much
describes what you want from my context
now you have to sort of derive that from
the window that you get so yeah there
are a couple of functions that that I
can delegate this to but essentially I
take the window size and the current
position of the mouse cursor and
determine okay is this make some
coordinate transformation based on the
window size and then say okay does that
hover over my button and if so I'm in
the hovering context otherwise I'm free
of the cursor that's pretty much it then
there's also a discrete part to the
input the part that we are interested in
in this case pretty much only clicks
with say the left mouse button and so we
filter out everything with a function
that gives the raw event that contains
all possible things that could happen to
an optional event that yeah that only
contains one variant here right know
that we have these two things we can
sort of think about interpreting and so
the next step would be to think about
okay what was the intention behind all
this input that I've seen and so and
interpret the events that the input
events that come in in a given context
and it figure out okay did I want to do
anything with that
like what did what I want to achieve or
did use I want to achieve anything with
that and in this case the implementation
is pretty trivial so we just say okay if
I'm hovering currently and an event
occurs which in our case can only be
that one click that we defined then I
want to toggle the button otherwise I'm
not going to do anything because a click
outside the button doesn't do anything
right and if we look again back to the
original wrapper function that put all
the logic together we'll see that how
this ties together is that we take the
context and snapshot it with events
and the intent function and what they
get out of is it is a stream of optional
actions and we just filter the some
variants out of and take these alright
the next thing is that given these
actions I want to have some state in my
application and there's two aspects of
it so first I want to define what's the
initial state before anything has
happened which is in this case false I
mean just monitors as a boolean and then
there's also an update function which
pretty much tells you okay given the
current state when an action occurs I
want to change my state to that new
state in our case there's only one
action that can occur and when it occurs
we went just to negate our current state
and that's it and this is where fold
comes in I talked about earlier so we
just yeah full the action stream with
these two items that pretty much satisfy
the type signature of fold okay then we
have a stream of states now we just want
to transform our state stream into a
view and we also do this given a certain
context because in this case the view
depends on the context because I want
when I hover I also want it to be a
little bit highlighted so I'm seeing
okay I'm hovering and the state and so I
just map these things accordingly so
when it's hovering it is a light blue or
light orange and when it's not it's
either blue or orange blue and orange
sort of represents they've cut off the
button that's really sad that I couldn't
show you okay right and the way how we
transform this to the stream level again
is that the output which is just a
stream of views essentially it's just
lifting this view function over the
input signals of context and the state
they go right yeah that's pretty much it
um how you will at least one component
with it what's missing from this is I
guess how to compose these components so
and I drew a lot of inspiration from
both the EM architecture and also cycle
Jas that's been mentioned in this
context before so mostly
front end stuff and I think it's pretty
easy once you have these functions to
just compose them in a certain way two
new sets of functions that will act as a
as a bigger thing so this really like
composed pretty nicely and another part
that you also should think about when
doing these things is how you manage the
effects so effects are effectively so we
can say in some sense we already have an
effect by having a signal of views so
that affects how our renderer uses
OpenGL and the window it contacts and
everything to to actually show us
something but there might be other
things that you also want to have like a
stream of network messages sent or
something like that right now I want to
talk a little bit about implementation
details of the library so my original
inspiration for this was the sodium set
of library so that's pretty much a an
implementation of FRP that is done in
variety of languages Java and c-sharp
and originally came from Haskell I think
and this was pretty interesting because
it already started out with the
separation of streams and signals which
I found pretty helpful but later I also
looked at a paper by Cornell yet about
push-pull FRP which gave rise to this
continuous notion of signals which was
good to do animations and things like
that so the idea behind that is sort of
so the current the discrete part of the
of the streams pretty much pushed
through the system so I have a network
of of streams in a way and when
something occurs somewhere it's just
going to go forward to through this
network of streams and an update
whatever state might be affected by this
event occurrence whereas when you have
something continues such as an
transition between a certain state given
a certain interpolation function it kind
of depends how often you want to update
and
pretty much depends on how many frames
per second you want so if so for
instance you may want to only create a
video and then you might be fine with
either 30 or 60 FPS whatever format you
use are you're doing something with some
virtual reality however you need more
than 20 frames per second but you don't
really want your application code to
depend on that and so it's in this case
you would just like at the consuming
side so when you've given it you're
given a signal you will just pull for
the current state of this signal inside
the system and and go backwards so to
say and that way you'd pretty much like
how often you need to evaluate that
function that describes the signal
depends really on how much demand there
is how often you need to do that and you
can you don't have to worry about that
in your application logic in that
particular paper the the Boston in
Haskell originally and it was a very
nice and elegant purely functional
implementation I could not possibly
reproduce that in rust because there was
strict evaluation and there was also the
point with resource and lifetimes and it
was just getting too complicated to to
do something similar to that so looking
at that essentially internally it uses
the observer pattern and a very simple
implementation of the observer pattern
and sort of automatically ties that
together when you're create streams and
signals in the way it's supposed to be
um well and there are some discreet
changes in the system whenever an event
occurs and these have to be atomic using
some form of transactions and the
signals are already glanced over this
before are essentially impure functions
so you have some function which just
gives you the system time for instance
typical system call they can see or you
might also measure analog instruments or
whatever kind of kind of resource you
want to pull data from and you can just
create the signals from that that is the
content
is part of the singles they also have a
discrete component if you just have a
stepwise thing that it was created from
stream right there are a couple of yeah
problems with the current implementation
so while it's done in Ruston I guess I
pretty much had to do this with our
garbage collection which which work
pretty nicely but it still does a lot of
atomic reference counting and weak
references and also a lot of heap
allocation pointer interactions so it's
not as fast as it could possibly be I
think so it's probably some still some
room for improvement and it's probably
not useful yet for say I use in embedded
systems or something like that and yeah
another issue is also that transactions
are pretty dumb so far so the way it's
done is essentially there's a global
lock on the entire graph of events
whenever you want to do something and
after you're done we release that so
there's not really any parallelism they
have been thinking about ways to improve
that but so far just try to get at the
correct semantics okay yeah that's
pretty much it thank you for your
intention and yeah I take some questions
now
hello yeah you started out with an
example where you put something into a
sink and then assert that something
comes out and off the stream mm-hmm but
this implies that it's single threaded
and you said it was thread safe so are
you always in a single threat or can you
do give the stream to someone in another
threat and then you only hear the timing
issues you can't just start like that
it's so the way the send function works
is actually synchronous but it's thread
safe so if you were to you you there's
also an asynchronous variant of it so
you could put in a thread and just send
it through the system the way it's done
is thread safe but in this example if I
had sent the event and asserted
afterwards I wouldn't even sure that it
had propagated through the system yet so
this is just why I made it synchronous
in this case
there is also implementation of Eric's
rust so the reactive extension which are
used by cycle did you look at that
before writing cargo I did look at that
I think it actually existed longer than
my implementation but what I found was
there was not well first of all it it
was written at a time I think before us
was really stable and wasn't actively
maintained and looking at the
implementation ie yeah it was really
pretty complex and so yeah I started
from scratch basically because I didn't
want to touch an existing code base that
I didn't know what kind of problems
there weren't in it but I think it's not
really usable at the moment as far as I
know
hi so actually I have two questions I
didn't quite get what is the nature of
streams right now is it pool based or
pooja based because I saw the Nexus
functions okay then the next function is
really just a matter to satisfy rusts
iterator semantics so essentially what
happens if you if you attach an iterator
to a stream it just registers sort of a
callback that puts something into a
channel that has a queue and if you have
the iterator you can just take from that
queue so that's just a intermediary
mechanism to to have something like a
rust iterator but it doesn't really have
to do anything with how the stream
itself is implemented yep okay and
second it's actually a thought
because in react some time ago there was
this thing called pure render mixing
where you could explicitly say that the
component of a function is pure so
wouldn't it be possible here to do the
same thing so - you mean to actually
have the type system say okay this
function is supposed to be pure or so
not necessarily the type system reacted
was just a function or a mixin so you
could just say that this component is
pure so then the behavior would be
different and optimized just for that
okay see I pretty much rely on the
implementation on the fact that it is
pure if you would put something impure
in there it would break the semantics
and I don't know things would happen
that that I couldn't predict so all the
functions should be pure that being said
though I mean that can't be enforced by
Russ because inherently it's still an
imperative language and while it has so
I can enforce immutability formally it's
still possible for you to in a given
function to construct something that has
inner mutability such as a mutex and
just locally produce some in temporary
immutable immutable state and access
that so it's not really possible to to
constrain that but but the implantation
