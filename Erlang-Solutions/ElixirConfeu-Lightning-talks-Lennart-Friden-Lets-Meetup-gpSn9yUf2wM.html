you have been intrigued and you have
been inspired elixir is clearly a thing
and you want to do your best on helping
this language of this community to
thrive and grow or maybe you just don't
want to learn it all of your own so what
can you do well you can join your local
meetup and you know you can get involved
and help to help its drive but what if
there is none well that's easy start one
go to meetup com and starting on being
registered as an organizer now that's
the first easy step thankfully all the
subsequent steps are equally easy as
long as you have a little bit of
foresight you need a plan who are coming
to your first meetup do you know them do
they know each other if you might
probably far from one from everyone
expects unfamiliar faces and how are you
going to make them feel welcome well for
example you can have them introduce
themselves tell a little bit about who
they are and make sure that you start
off the meet up with everyone getting to
know each other if everyone is seen
heard and acknowledged well that makes
them so much more inclined to become
active participants going forward that's
great now what are they going to do well
unless you already have a solid speaker
line-up booked for for the next few
meetups try a hack nights instead how
guys are really good starting off like
this because their hands on and you
learn by doing people can pair up they
can pair up on you bring their own
projects pair up on them working on them
have one product though their own but
they can always tag along someone else
and what if though if they don't
actually have one of these projects well
exorcism exorcism is a brilliant place
of where you can download a few
exercises in a multitude of languages
including elixir you do these exercises
upload them and get critique from your
fellows you can do a hack light on this
theme have people pair up work on nexus
exercises critique each other and and
that way starting learn how how do you
program elixir there's another really
good benefit of doing hack nights and
that's the fact that it's so much easier
to get someone to say a few words few
five minutes talking about what they
actually been doing that night instead
of a have a saying well week I'm going
to start a meetup and I want you to be
the first speaker you don't know anyone
who is coming much easier to have a hack
night and have them create present what
they've been doing doing about night now
another way if you don't do the exorcism
you can do something different we topple
you can bring your own project or you
can have a have a task for the attendees
to perform and you get bonus points if
you do it with a twist during our first
hack light I facilitated a mob
programming session I which we split the
grouping to and each month Bob got one
computer hooked up to a TV or a beamer
and they got a problem build a key value
store and these are the requirements
here are a few properties of the system
that is supposed to have and those teams
they typical more programming style the
switchdriver every five minutes or so so
everyone got some time some hands-on
time and when they want in possession of
the cable they were navigating at the
end of the evening they demoed they
want to demo their solutions and to my
delight both had completed the task
within within just a few hours work
really are nicely and keeping in touch
between meetups IRC channels or slack is
excellent for this so this is whim set
up on our own little satchel I recommend
you try it the same also be visible
register an official Twitter account for
your meetup group and if you do if your
problem with outreach if you can't
really get to get our student and know
if you not everyone is for already
following me on Twitter tweet at the liq
selangor like central or other
well-known to your twitter account and
you'll be sure to help you out among
with this regard also this is me I'm
organizing the stock on the links amita
now remember what they said and you
don't have to contribute by submitting
pull requests there are a lot of ways
that you can have a huge impact on your
local tech community so thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
