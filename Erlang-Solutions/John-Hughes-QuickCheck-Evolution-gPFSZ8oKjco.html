everybody a question who really really
loves testing that's a higher proportion
than usual but it's still way less than
half so testing isn't terribly popular
lots of people generally see it as more
of a chore than the pleasure why is that
what's hard about it well suppose you're
developing tests for some software that
has maybe n features then you're gonna
write what three or four tests per
feature something like that
that sounds okay that's a linear amount
of work but we all know you won't find
all the bugs by doing that because some
of the bugs only appear when you use two
features together okay suppose you're
going to try and test for all of those
how many test cases do you need to write
a quadratic number hmm okay but you know
what you won't find all the bugs doing
that either because some bugs only
appear with a bit rare perhaps but some
one may appear when you use three
features together if you want to test
for all of those bugs you've got to do a
cubic amount of work and this is
starting to sound really like a lot of
work that we don't want to do and just
the very worst of all is race conditions
which
by definition our interactions between
different features and what's more don't
even appear every time you run a test so
these are the reasons why testing is
hard
you can never write enough tests so when
should you stop what's the answer
don't write tests generate them so I've
been doing this for quite a few years
now with a test generation tool called
quick check which dates back to 1999 15
years when kun class on that I came up
with the first version in Haskell and
then in 2006 Thomas and I founded cubic
and we've been working with an outline
version since then we've made lots and
lots of extensions and we found lots and
lots of very entertaining bugs but I'm
not going to mostly talk about that
today I'm going to give you a little
example just to introduce what quick
check does if you're not familiar with
it and I'm going to take some code that
works with binary trees it's just a
simple example that we're all familiar
with so let's suppose I implement
ordered binary trees and a tree might be
a leaf over on the left or a node over
on the right with a left subtree an
element in the node and a right subtree
so here's a couple of functions that I
might want to define on binary trees so
first of all two lists will convert a
tree to the list of values in it so a
leaf empty list a node we convert the
left subtree and the right subtree and
combine them and member is supposed to
test whether or not an element appears
in a tree well if the tree is a leaf
that if the answer's false otherwise
if x equals y its true if X is less than
Y we look in the right subtree it's
greater than we look in the left and so
on so there's the code that I'm going to
test and when we test this code with
quick check we'll do it by rock defining
a property of the code and here's a
property of the member function it's an
airline function definition and what
does it say it says that well for all X
and
II thought I generated like this so X is
a natural natural number t is a tree
then this condition should be true so in
other words the member function on trees
should return the same result as the
member function on lists if we convert
the tree to its list of elements the
member function on trees should behave
like the member function on lists so
we'll take the lists as a kind of model
of correct behavior okay let me run some
tests so here I have an airline shell
let me just compile my trees code and
then I can run quick check and give it
that property it's called as an argument
and Oh quick check will generate random
tests and then in the end it feels
things that a test failed and quick
check
first of all displays a random test here
it is so there's a tree it's got three
nodes and the test failed for this tree
and then it will shrink the test case
and report a minimal failing test so
this test case is the smallest one that
fails and we can see that it has two
nodes so shrinking has removed an
irrelevant node from the test case let's
run this a few more times
there we are in that case drinking
didn't really do much there we shrank
from three nodes or two nodes and so on
that there's a bigger one so as you can
see this process of shrinking ends up
with a simpler test case that we can
debug okay can we see what's wrong well
here X is zero and this is my tree so
I'm trying to test where the zero is a
member of this tree that contains both 0
and 1 and the member function is
returning false of course it should
return true so something's wrong I need
to fix the bug
okay and that's the wrong shell I'm
gonna fix the bug like this I'm going to
copy trees fix Earl the trees dot Earl
yes let's overwrite recompile and now my
test pass okay
so I've given many talks of this sort
before and I've more or less done this
without the copying perhaps and I've
argued that this kind of shrunk test
case makes it very easy to debug the
code because you have a very small
example that shows you what's gone wrong
but now okay my code is working but oh
what's that example again
so I've debug my code okay we like to
think of this shrinking process which
you saw working there as extracting the
signal from the noise of random tests
random tests contain a lot of junk a lot
of irrelevant rubbish a lot of noise
that's their purpose the shrinking
process reduces the test down to a
mineral example that you can't remove
anything from without making the test
pass that's the signal which is quite
easy to debug so shrinking is invaluable
for understanding what went wrong in a
test but now we've lost that example now
of course I could have thought about
this in advance and I could have saved
my example for reuse I might want to
preserve it and build up a regression
suite of tests perhaps and in reality we
don't always find failing tests as
quickly as in my little demo in reality
it may have taken a long time to find
that failing test and in that case we
don't want to lose it we want to save it
so there's several reasons why we might
want to save Fame
test so we can rerun them and that's
what I'm talking about today a
continuous integration tool that we're
building that is based on quick check so
let me do the same thing again but this
time using the continuous integration
tool so to do this
I will find it in my browser here it is
so when we go to the corresponding web
page it has a web interface and there's
some stuff there and that I can register
a project so let me add my project which
is in users John Desktop trees there we
go the project has not yet been built
can you read that okay let's queue a
build okay and now in the background I
hope it's compiling my code yes oh and
now you can see that my project contains
one module trees and it's colored red
and that indicates that there's a
failing test in there if I click on
trees I can open that up and I can see
that there are two properties in this
module two I only showed you one before
the ordered property just says that all
the trees I generators test data are
ordered otherwise they wouldn't be good
tests but the member property is the
interesting one if I click on this now
you can see that I actually have three
examples listed and let's make this
slightly larger still in fact there's a
carrot here if I click on that we can
see that there's one example that the CI
system has found that it doesn't bother
to show us because it's very similar to
the one above so why is this one similar
to this one well it's the same except
that where this one has a one this one
has a two so let's not bother with the
similar examples so we can see now a
number of examples we can see the
coverage of the code if I look at the
coverage of trees on Earl we have a
hundred percent coverage excellent
and if we look at it we quite like this
coverage display up here we've got a
scroll bar and you can see the shades of
green show you how much each part of the
code has been executed and if I hover
the mouse over this stuff we can see
let's see here's my ordered property
that's been executed a hundred times his
proper member that was only that was
called 13 times you can see the darker
shade shows 202 calls of that code
inside the property 13 calls of the
generators and we can even hover over
the clauses of member and see that here
42 calls of when X was less than y 64
when they were equal 57 when they were
greater so we can visualize the degree
of execution of each part of the code
okay but let's go back to these examples
we can also take an example it's look at
this first one for example so here we're
trying to test with a zero as a member
of this tree if I click on the example
ID then I can look at the coverage of
the example well this example only
covers 45% of the code let's have a look
at it
okay so we didn't cover this code which
is generating test data because when we
run one example we don't need to
generate anything we didn't cover prop
ordered because we were testing from
member look at the code for member look
at that now here the colors are maybe
the wrong way around
green shows we executed something in
this test and red shows we didn't but
this is a failed test so the bug is
somewhere in what we executed so green
means danger and red means safe
okay so if we look at the green code
here well we tested whether something
was a member of a leaf okay that's not
very interesting but here when I'm
testing if X was a member of a node this
is the case we landed in if X is less
than Y we tested if X was a member of
the right subtree but that's wrong isn't
it
I should have tested if it was a member
of the left subtree okay now I know what
to fix let me go back to if I can figure
out how my editor okay so here really
edit the buffer no yes thank you I'm
glad you're awake okay so I should look
in the left subtree of course save
anyway yes do it okay what
you think so let's find out okay so now
I need to because this ci2 was working
with repositories I need to commit those
changes there we are
that's that go back to the interface and
cue another build at this point no you
have to click that button okay oh look
something still failed let's have a look
the same property failed oh but now one
of my tests at least passed
oh that's progress that was the one that
I was looking at but we can see there
are other tests that failed so let me
look at the coverage of one of those
that wasn't a good one to look at I
covered all of the code that's a
surprise maybe I should look at the
other ones no okay that happened I've
done something wrong well in that case
let's use Costas intuition that I might
need to change the other one as well
okay and if I do the same thing
not that window equal : equal yes I know
I'm a bit naughty that way unless cue
another build and this time they all
passed and we can see that the test
cases are still there so that should I
ever introduce those bumps again then
the test is still run and they would
still be caught okay
the code is buggy okay but I'm not
testing for that particular kind of book
because that's not the point of the
example yes I have know I've chosen my
test data and I've chosen to use that as
the test data and then I won't discover
problems caused by a floating point
because it makes a good example yes so
if I'd use term I would also have to be
very careful about the choice of terms
so that I sometimes generated the same
term twice otherwise it wouldn't be
interesting and with that I don't need
to worry about that so it makes a very
simple example to present and also it's
often a good way of testing but let me
go on and show the continue with my
slides so what do we think we've seen
that as we run tests this way then we
collect the test cases and we build up a
regression test suite automatically and
that's
nice partly because it just lets you see
progress in terms of tests that did fail
and now pass otherwise one of the
frustrating things about using quick
check is you you find a bug you fix it
you run quick check it's still buggy but
you have actually fixed some of your
tests and that becomes more visible with
this framework and the other thing as I
said earlier is that if there are test
cases which were very hard to generate
now they're automatically saved so that
you don't have to manually save the
things and the other thing that I hope
you've seen is that by presenting this
coverage information in a lot of depth
so we can see coverage by all of your
tests coverage by a single property
coverage by a single example then that
not only makes it easy to see at a
glance what's being tested it lets you
see what the distribution of tests was
if you see one branch was testing only a
few times and another branch many times
you can ask yourself why and it even
helps to localize bugs when you run an
example you see the code just the code
that that example covered then that's
where the bug must be now I want to show
you another example I'm going to do the
same kind of testing but this time I'll
set some stateful code and I'm going to
use the process registry which has
already appeared in several talks in
this session I'm going to test really
just two operations the register
function and the unregister function but
in order to generate tests for these
functions I'm going to need to create
pizzas test data so my test cases are
also going to contain calls to spawn so
what's different about register and
unregister from the simple tree example
well these functions change the state of
the registry and we have to reflect that
in the tests that we write I just want
to emphasize that I'm not expecting to
find bugs in the Erlang process registry
it's been around for a long time and
it's very heavily tested so not it's
been used a lot I'm not expecting to
find any problems so what I'm going to
do instead is I'm going to reverse
engineer so
the preconditions on those calls I'm
going to generate tests in which
register and unregister don't raise
exceptions now maybe you all know
exactly when they raise exceptions and
when they don't but if you don't know
then this is a way to find out how do we
test this kind of thing well we use a
state machine model so we generate test
cases that do sequences of API calls in
order to model what's happening inside
the system we pick a model state and we
define state transitions for each
function and then we write post
conditions that compare the result from
the actual call to what the model says
should happen and then what shrinking is
going to do when we get a failing test
is just discard some of the commands
that are not relevant to the failure how
can i model the registry state I'm going
to do it with an airline record that
looks like this in which I'll track a
list of pids that have been spawned so
they're available as test data for
registering going to add to that list by
calling spawn and I'm going to track
which names have been registered and
what pits they've been registered with
so that part of the model is going to be
changed by register and unregister I
want to show you what the model looks
like here's the specification of the
register function so we can give a
precondition here the precondition for
register says there must be a pit for
you to register obviously if there are
no pits
you can't call register the next
function says here's how to generate the
arguments for register you need a random
name and a random paid an element of the
pizza in the state in the model here's
how you do a call of register or how you
execute a call of register in the test
case you just call air Lang register
with the same parameters and here's what
register does to the model state
when we call register the next state is
just the one before with a list of
registered processes updated by adding
the name and paid to the end so this is
how we specify operations and the reason
that all of these functions have names
beginning with register is that quick
check picks those up and interprets them
as a precondition argument generator
state transition function and so on you
are asking why I append name and pit to
the end of the list there in some cases
it leads to better shrinking and it
doesn't matter because there's never
going to be more than maybe a dozen
things in that list it doesn't matter it
really doesn't matter it's much more
important for test cases shrink well
then you know a few microseconds when
you execute them okay so let me demo
this so I will need to select a
different project okay I haven't added
this one yet so let me add it users John
desktop registry queue a build this
takes slightly longer not because it's
quadratic Kostis okay and indeed my
property failed so let's have a look if
I click on the property we can see there
is actually two tests that failed in the
first one here then I called unregister
and it raised an exception a bad aaaghhh
exception okay why might unregister a
raise an exception
well a wasn't registered of course so
that's one problem if I scroll down here
there's another one what happened here I
spawned a process and then I registered
it with the name a that returned true
and then I registered it again with a
name a and that raised an exception why
did that one raise an exception I can't
do that I use the same name twice so we
can see that there are two way two ways
in which I can violate the precondition
here and I found them both in one run so
let me go back to my editor and I have
to switch the other project okay so here
we have the code and what I will do here
is I'll add a precondition for register
that says it must not be the case that
the name is in the list of rigs and
correspondingly for unregister not a
precondition when you unregister a name
it must be the case that the name is in
the list of regs actually there's a
precondition up here on the stage okay
different number of arguments this one
says don't even think about doing
register unless you have some pits
and this one says don't do this
particular call of register unless the
name is absent from the list
okay now I'm sure I'm going to forget to
do this sooner or later but come back no
okay
nothing to commit because I'm in the
wrong folder there we are that's
committed that and now if I run my test
remember I've got two failed examples
let's queue a build oh it still fails
the prop registry fails but look my
first two examples pass now the test
case is excluded by my precondition but
there's more cases that fail well let's
have a look at this one for example what
happened here can you read this okay so
oh I spawned a pig I registered it with
the name a that worked I registered it
with the name B and I got a bad dog
exception ah you can't register the same
name twice but more than that you can't
register the same kid twice and my
precondition doesn't say that yet
okay let's fix that here's my editor I'm
gonna need a stricter precondition here
and also it must not be true that paid
is there as the second element of
something in state regs okay let's see
how many of those cases this fixes
um no I don't need it for unregister so
this this should do okay
get commit QA build oh it still doesn't
work but I fixed almost all of my bugs
so this is progress however here at the
bottom we have a property that is still
you know an example that still fails and
actually we've got three similar ones so
let's have a look at the failed one what
are we doing
oh I'm spawning a process and
registering it actually let me just look
at there this is a bit he's read I'm
spawning a process I'm registering it
under the name be i'm unregistering it
that worked
I'm registering it again that raised the
bad aaaghhh well of course it raised a
bad arc well why was i unregistering it
again unregister says doesn't it that um
you know i shouldn't call them register
unless it's in the model let's just look
at the similar examples okay
what's this oh it's the same except the
name was see what's this
the name was d okay it could anybody
guess what this one's gonna be that
one's a so let's look at the code which
I can do just looking at the coverage
information this is actually the code of
the spec unregister removes remove
something from the registry but where is
the next date function
it's not there haha now we know what the
problem is so let me just add an
unregistered next
okay state when you unregister a name
the effect of that is to replace the
list of registered processes with lists
to delete the name that should work
shouldn't it get commit
back to the CI do you another build all
my tests are green that's great and let
me look at the coverage again okay I
just want to show you one more thing
here's my property it says for all
command sequences first of all we have
to unregister all the names to get into
a known state then if we run the
commands and check the Quinns everything
should pass but look at this check
commands will run a hundred times I run
a hundred tests look at that list
comprehension that unregister was run
four hundred times what does that tell
me it tells me on average well in fact
in every case the list of names had four
elements so you can see that the body
here and the list comprehension was run
more times than the surrounding code and
that tells you how long the lists where
on average in this case that's obvious
because there are four names in my list
you've seen them a b c and d but in
other cases it's really interesting to
be able to look and see are this list
comprehension you know on average they
were not point to elements in the list
or whatever and this is the kind of
information that the cover tool you get
with our lang just doesn't show you so
it's a much more refined level of
coverage information okay
I think that is enough demo okay so you
you seen the state machine models we
find them a very convenient way to
specify the intended behavior of
stateful systems even in much larger
cases we write the specifications just
with a collection and small function
definitions like those ones I showed you
this is a small example but it's a
realistic example and it doesn't really
get much harder than that
Grichuk ci now gathers a variety of
interesting test cases it groups them
sensibly I think you would probably be
quite glad not to see all those similar
examples that I showed you in great
detail if you were working in practice
and the little exercise I've gone
through here it's more realistic than
you might think and you might think Oh
reverse engineering preconditions who
needs to do that who needs to reverse
engineer the specification of our code
we know that so you may think we found
in practice the specification of the
code that we started from is never
correct why should it be it's a complex
document that has not been tested of
course specifications are wrong so
testing in practice involves partly
reverse engineering what the spec really
should be and at the same time finding
and correcting bugs in the code so it's
only the latter part that you haven't
seen in this demo you might be forgiven
for wondering well will this really
scale up over the last few years we've
been doing it for Volvo cars and we've
been testing part of the outer saw basic
software so in a modern car there are 50
to 100 processors and they run off a lot
of code there's one estimate that the
modern car contains a hundred million
lines of code why but but still they do
all of those processes run some basic
software that enables them to talk to
each other and here's a diagram that
shows this stuff
you recognize an Ethernet stack yes
processing cars have Ethernet stacks on
them the canvas is a communication bus
that's used very heavily in cars Lynn
and flex array or other communication
protocols the comm services up the top
they provide routing between various
networks the diagnostic cluster it's a
very fancy name for the software that
remembers that a cylinder misfired and
tells your service station when you take
your car in for a service so this is a
picture of the software each of these
boxes is a component which is specified
by by a hundred pages of PDF so each of
the black boxes that contains software
whose specification will be many
hundreds of pages and though the cars
wanted to be sure that when they bought
components the software that they
contained actually conformed to the spec
and luckily there is a standard which
all the suppliers follow so that
guarantees of course that they're all
consistent well in practice putting
together a car from systems from
different suppliers with software from
different suppliers is a nightmare you
put it together you can't even boot the
car so that's why Volvo cars were
interested in having very extensive
testing we wrote we read 3,000 pages of
PDF specifications we wrote 20,000 lines
of quick Chek code it's not a whole lot
for 3,000 pages of specs and it's 20,000
lines of quite simple code like the code
I showed you we could use that to test a
million lines of C from six different
suppliers and we found more than 200
problems of which more than 100 were
problems in the standard but suppliers
were supposed to follow so we think this
is something that we're very very proud
of and many of these problems we've fed
back into the standardization process
so a lot of those problems are fixed now
we were able to compare our test code to
existing test code for some of these
modules and we found our test code was
ten times shorter so does the approach
scale up yes it does
would you like to try it out go to this
URL hands aren't SV that's example
proton get up should we do it now where
is my browser come back
Oh browser always be given here it is
this is a an example project that we've
put up and look it's quick check tests
past click on that and you come to the
system that I showed you except instead
of running locally on my laptop it's
running on quick check CI comm so if
you'd like to try this out take your
project register it a quick check CI
calm and we will run your tests for you
and somewhere here
I have my picture on that so right now
no it's not in the latest release yet
but of course our plan is to release it
so that it can be run locally our
customer sites and you know talk to us
about what you would like from a local
version good so we have focused here on
doing the best we can knowing that we're
running quick Chek properties hence
we're you know collecting the test cases
that are generating this kind of stuff
and that's our focus at the moment
rather than trying to integrate with for
example Travis CI I suppose we might
think about that later but for now we
just try to do the best job we can with
good cheap properties oh yeah sure I
didn't demonstrate that it would take me
a little bit longer but if I go back to
oh which one is a local one this one
okay so here are the examples for the
registry property and you can see on the
right here that some of them are they're
all marked as active now what typically
happens is either you change your API or
you change your property or for one
reason or another your example becomes
no longer relevant and then you don't
want it sitting there turning your tests
red the whole time so you just
inactivated and now they won't run in
future builds unless of course you come
back to this build and marking active
again so you can disable examples that
you no longer want it's necessary to be
able to do that
do you think Wrangler could help to
inactivate irrelevant counter-examples
now if only we had a EU project together
Simon we might be able to do some work
on that
so I have a very scientific answer to
the question have you tested enough no
and it's very hard to say more than that
isn't it so we're not aiming with this
work or in general we're not really
aiming to answer that question rather
we're aiming to help you know test as
well as you can will it be enough not
always when we write properties we are
deciding which test we want to run and
there may be some boats that cannot be
revealed by those tests and you know
that's I didn't hear across this
and which one do you have mind I'm
missing at least two oh sure
yes so if I were to talk about this
example for much longer I would add
killing processes as an operation
appearing in tests and then we could
extend the preconditions to capture the
behavior of the registry when processes
die so I could do that it's not in these
tests because these tests don't include
process death but you know when we
define quick check properties we choose
a set of tests that we want to run and
you still have to use your skill and
judgment in making that choice if you
were to try to choose every possible you
know call every possible event you might
have a very wide range of possible tests
but your chances are running any
interesting ones that would detect real
bugs will become very low so you know
there's there's a design choice for
tests as well all we're trying to do is
make those choices easy to make so that
instead of designing you know one test
case at a time you can design a whole
set of test cases at a time but you
still have to think about what set of
test cases you want I think we've
reached the end of my slot so if there
are no more questions maybe our Chairman
