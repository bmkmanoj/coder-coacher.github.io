alert logic I do think that people are
not using dtrace enough there's probably
a pretty good reason for that of all the
people in the room how many people
deploy their Erlang applications on
Linux okay how many of you deploy things
on not linux freebsd solaris of the
people that pic not linux which is it
freebsd or limit or solaris or something
else anyone bueller paris what yes
hilarious okay cool so we'll talk about
DTrace on linux the story for that with
with erling is sadly not good but if
you're using a Mac for your workstation
as I think most people are or at least a
majority of people are not that there's
anything with a wrong with a linux
workstation then your options for using
DTrace improve quite dramatically so
today I'm really going to try to
introduce everyone to what DTrace is to
get familiar with what it can do and
really the goal for this talk is to
introduce DTrace as a technology for
understanding application behavior and
for working on debugging your
application so it's not really so
focused on ringing like every last juicy
drop of performance from your hardware
there is going to be a talk later today
by rick reed from whatsapp and he's
going to give a taste of what DTrace can
do to help you profile your hardware and
help you to nor lang and do all sorts of
things like that if that's your interest
it's interesting to note that whatsapp
deploys there erling on freebsd which is
a supported dtrace operating system but
in any case let's move on and so the
best place to start with is you know
what is d trace it's a stands for
dynamic tracing it's an observability
technology and what that really means is
that it tries to give you a holistic
view of your of your operating system
and that means from the top down and all
the way back out again how many of you
have written code like
this where you writing a function and
maybe you take a fun or you take an mfa
and you basically try to time how long
it takes for that function to complete
or something like that this is a really
typical way for people to you know kind
of do some inline profiling or figure
out like okay we have a bottleneck in
this part of our code and we really want
to kind of try to get some more
examination what it's doing or how it's
behaving you know so this is a really
common approach and DTrace lets you do
this kind of profiling without actually
instrumenting your code so X journal to
your Erlang program and built into the
Erlang vm are a lot of DTrace probes
that provide this kind of timing
information and we're going to get into
that in some depth hopefully is the top
proceeds you guys all read this OTP life
right this is a tumblr that's that's out
there it's really pretty funny if you
haven't checked it out you should
definitely go see it it has this really
hilarious slide which I just lost
unfortunately yeah I don't know what
happened but uh pmu PowerPoint ok that
was awesome everyone like that is this
gonna work play yes so this is how this
is how dynamic trace can make you feel I
work at alert logic we write a lot of
airline code and what I like to use
DTrace for is exactly what I told you we
use it as a tool to profile behavior
that's emergent from your system so this
is behavior that maybe you didn't
anticipate or maybe that you're
surprised by and you want to figure out
exactly what's happening you can get
direct trace from you know your input
all the way through the system and back
out again when I've given this talk in
the past a lot of people say well you
know dtrace is really nice but I like
profiler technology acts right I already
have this way that I do it and it's fine
and that's perfectly suitable for our
needs and my response to that is yeah
that's great and continue to use your
profiler what you should look at DTrace
is another tool in your toolbox so maybe
it's not the end all be all for your
particular situation or your environment
but it is a great tool that can help
expand your understanding of your
applications behavior and how it
actually interacts with other parts of
your system for example if you have a
database sitting outside of your
application it's really nice to be able
to look at and see what kind of network
connections that you're having from your
application to that database in a way
that you don't have to instrument inside
of your application itself so this is an
external way for you to get visibility
into things that are somewhat external
to your actual application like a data
store or you know like another
downstream web service or some other
client you know that you're talking to
out there maybe not part of your
director Lang application same thing
with the debugger a lot of people try to
make this either/or thing I really look
at as a DTrace and other thing whether
it's a profiler or a debugger that you
particularly like you know erlang comes
with some really nice tools to help you
profile process trees and let you look
at supervision trees even graphically
that are really neat don't give up using
them right I'm not saying that this is a
much better way to do it what I'm
telling you is is that dtrace is a
technology which you can add to your
tool tool belt and then get interesting
interesting information out of your
application I talked about how this is
an observed ability technology most of
us have applications that sit up at the
very top and they talk to libraries
whether those things are written in
Erlang or written in C at some level
they hit the colonel right through
system calls and then they go into the
kernel layer and magic happens and then
all things start from the bottom go back
to the top and what you find out is it's
Turtles all the way down which isn't a
surprise to anyone in this room I'm sure
but for a lot of people it is somewhat
of a surprise unfortunately all right so
I told you there's some dtrace enable
operating systems solaris 10 there's a
loo MOS which is a fork of open solaris
which sadly no longer exists there's a
couple of distributions of illumos which
are slightly more popular one is smart
OS from Joyent another is Omni OS x Omni
TI and then there's freebsd and mac OS
10 and mac OS 10 and freebsd have had
DTrace probes for a pretty long time
Apple's had it since 10.5 and probably
most of you are ten point eight or ten
point nine so if you have a Mac right
now or you're running freebsd right now
you can use DTrace right now all right
so what if you're not yeah they're there
are other observability technologies
what I have found is that generally
speaking they're not as reliable and
they're not as safe and that's been a
big problem in testing that I have done
I don't feel comfortable running a
technology like system tab and also I
don't develop on Linux so as far as my
personal workstation is concerned I
focus exclusively on DTrace so that's
why I'm focusing on d trays only not
system tab so deep so system tap
compiles its code into a kernel module
which is compiled by a cc c++ compiler
and then it's loaded into the kernel and
the quality of that is completely
determined by automatic code generation
so it's quite possible that you can have
system tap taps that crash your server
crash your development environment do
all sorts of bad things I personally
don't think that that's a risk that I
want to take obviously other people have
other risk tolerances that's that's fine
so is that not been your experience okay
well good that's nice to know yeah yes
yes okay well good so there's a report
that system tap is as reliable in
functional as DTrace which is good to
know okay okay so he's saying that the
problem is that generally speaking
system tap requires newer kernels that
people aren't running in production good
to know so maybe next year there can be
to talk about system tap and Linux so as
far as Linux is concerned with dtrace
there are some dtrace technologies that
are available in Linux there's an open
source loadable kernel module that you
can that you can do in development and
it's probably got about sixty percent
coverage it doesn't include support for
application languages and when I speak
of application languages I'm talking not
just about Erlang but other languages
like Ruby you know Java a JavaScript you
know python stuff like that sorry also
instrumented with DTrace probes so for
linux it's it's complicated and i'm
sorry for that i hope that someday there
will be a nice story for DTrace there is
a DTrace implementation supported by
oracle that's available in oracle linux
but you know quick show of hands how
many people in the room run oracle linux
said in production yeah no one so it's
not at all clear that oracle is going to
contribute that to open source Linux and
even if they do that it would be
accepted so it's not at all clear that
the path for DTrace on Linux is clear
which is a real shame so I wanted to
cover some of the glossary terminology
that's the DTrace provides there's if
you go and read the literature about
dtrace there's a lot of talk about a
DTrace provider and a provider is really
just a word that means it manages probes
in the particular case of this talk of
provider is the application language
itself I think it's really important to
understand that there are a lot of
providers if you go ahead and ask DTrace
how many providers you have on a dtrace
enabled laptop you
do that by using sudo dtrace minus l and
then you pipe that to WC minus l usually
it's you know 50,000 on solaris it's up
to like a hundred to 110,000 dtrace
probes that are available across a huge
actually mind-boggling number of areas
of the operating system that you might
be interested in there's also probes
these are the observables that keep
talking about we'll get more into what
the structure of those look like in a
second and then there's the consumer the
consumer in this case is actually a d
script d trace has its own scripting
language and it's it's somewhat akhlagh
queer going to get into what it looks
like in just a minute in fact right now
so the way that you do this is you
essentially define a probe there's an
optional predicate and there's also an
optional action and the actions are
embraced clauses dtrace support to begin
an in block so that you can do things
like initialize global variables you can
do aggregation functions you can do a
sort and truncations at the end of your
DC a script it also supports local
variables it has kind of a baroque
syntax for doing that there's the this
this arrow foo equals some you know
whatever value you want integer float
and string it also does aggregate and
associative variables those are prefixed
with a nap or sand sorry a nap sign I
actually don't know what the type
graphic name for that is and it also has
one liner support you can do dtrace
minus N and then probe predicate action
so an example of what that looks like is
this you know it's pretty
straightforward in this particular case
we're using the ER Lane providers that's
what the Erlang star means that mean the
star means anything that starts with
Erlang and then matches some arbitrary
string the colons that that are in the
middle here allow you to sort of zoom in
on specific things that you care about
in this particular case we're leaving
them out because we want them to be wild
cards and the things that we're
interested interested in instrumenting
our process spawns process exits and
exit signals so these are all the things
that we want DTrace to collect for us
and this is a really what it looks like
inside of a program just to dig into
this a little bit more you can see that
there's these
copy in stir things at the end of the
print f's DTrace runs in an area of
kernel memory and the probes have these
arguments that they provide in the
particular case of Erlang the probes
have not been well documented so at the
at the as an appendix to this talk in
the slides I have gone through all of
the source code for erling and pulled
out all of the DTrace probes and
documented what their arguments are what
format there in like if their strings or
integers or whatever so that people can
consume them more easily in this
particular case you can see that app it
is represented as a string and that the
mfa is also represented as a string at
least for dtrace purposes so there's not
like you know true erling terms here or
whatever and then same thing for the
other things here copy and stir I kind
of got on digression their copy and
stare means take this argument value and
stuff it into the special kernel memory
space that DTrace has to use to consume
I'm going to go ahead and try my
parallels live demo as you know things
haven't worked out super well for that
yet but we'll try it one more time and
maybe we'll get lucky all right so um
okay all right
I guess that's too big there this is
really hard because it's not mirrored on
my screen all right can everyone kind of
see that from the back is that
sufficiently large enough cool all right
so I have a I have a version of Erlang
that I compiled and you can see over
here that it says dtrace just so you
know that it's actually DTrace enabled I
can also do this if I programmatically
want to find out if DTrace is available
there's a module called I'm trace and if
it is available it returns true if it's
not available it returns false I'm sure
that shocks everyone but that's how it
works and then I'm already running a
version of react back here in the
background and just to give you a quick
flavor for what kind of things we've
been doing or at least what I did for
the demo is I have the spawn exit dtrace
probe and DTrace requires root
privileges because you can actually spy
on terminal sessions with it you can
actually connect to other people's
process space and collect out their
information from it which means you can
steal their cryptographic tokens and
their passwords and their SSH keys and
all sorts of other nasty things so for
that reason when you invoke DTrace it
requires root and in this case I'm going
to invoke this through soo do so you can
see here that we have quite a lot of
processes being spawned and being killed
off they're exiting 44 reason normal and
if we were to quiet this down a little
bit more there's my pointer I want to
quiet this down a little bit more I'm
going to go ahead and kill that react
process
okay and over on the D tray side of
things we should see quiet okay you guys
saw there was like this giant flood of
stuff that was going across the screen
with all these pigs being spawned and
things being applied and stuff exiting
because of normal and now what I want to
do is just show you real quick like you
can see just starting the shell actually
causes quite a bit of spawns it shows
you the whole startup sequence what all
the pits are doing you know what they
return as their exit value what em FAS
they're executing what signals are being
what messages are being sent from the
sender back to the pits so you can see
that kid 28 sent a message to pit 6 that
said I exited because of reason normal
and here we have some reason no ends
right some file or something doesn't
exist we cover that in the keynote this
morning I I didn't show it in the script
but you can actually use DTrace to find
out why you're getting file system
errors and we'll cover like some of the
interaction with other subsystems of
this of the of the operating system a
little bit later on in the talk when I
do a more complicated perilous live demo
what I wanted to do here was just like
you know do a spawn real quick like it
just really type really hard to type
when you can't really easily see what
you're doing okay so i'm just going to
spawn a fun that you know sleeps 4 2000
milliseconds and then ends and you can
see that spawn into pit 33 and then if i
go over here you guys can see let me
make sure that's scrolled down at the
bottom you can see down here we had pity
to do some parsing right we did spawn
and then inside the spawn we had our
remote call timer sleep we had our
argument 2000 and then we got a message
back to pitt 25 and there's actually
some kind of bug in the spawn exit
collection tool you can see over here it
kind of got chopped off a little bit I
don't know why that happens there's it's
probably a bug in the copying the copy
and stir argument so that needs to be
looked into at some point but in any
case you can see the whole life cycle
history of that function and how it
lived and how it died and what messages
at sin and whom it sent it to and that's
all good stuff and I didn't have to
instrument my spawn at all I just kind
of get it gratuitous Lee for free you
know and and that's really neat you guys
can probably imagine that there are a
lot of cases where having that kind of
observability would be really handy and
useful and that is in fact the case so
I'm going to go ahead and start react
again just so I don't forget to later on
what is it I have react
Ben react start
alright well react won't be happy anyway
because there's a cluster of one so it's
a very sad camper right now but that's
fine we'll just let it be sad for a
while we'll come back and look at this a
little bit more closely in a little
while see if I can leave this over on
that screen and go back to the slides
see how that works there hey cool that
worked fairly well alright how much time
do I have left 20 minutes less than that
really alright I know I stand between
you and lunch so I hate that but you
know just bear with me I'm going to skip
over this those were in case my perilous
live demo didn't work right so dtrace
also has a lot of common aggregation
functions super useful that lets you do
all sorts of interesting aggregation and
historic is de graham type operations on
them there's average and count those do
kind of what's advertised on the tin
there's el quantized which is a linear
histogram that it will generate there's
quantized inserted a log power of two a
histogram that you can generate there's
some min max there's actually about 10
other ones I didn't put on the slide
these are the most common ones that I
see in far as enabling DTrace in your
own build of Erlang probably the easiest
way to do it is to use something like
curl you guys are all familiar with curl
right Yes No if you're not curl is a
really nice tool for building Erlang
releases its kind of modeled on you know
python brew or rvm or something like
that virtual end for python is another
one that that you know is a good analog
to what curl provides to you all you
have to do basically is do the dynamic
trace with dtrace if you want system tap
which we talked about a little bit
earlier you can do dynamic tray system
tap and it will build the Erlang vm with
those probes enabled once you get your
thing built you have to install it so
you just run the install come in and
then you activate it I also wrote a tool
called Earl brew and since I'm here I'm
gonna toot my own horn a little bit
because you know
I'm your captive audience I guess but I
wrote Earl brew which is a much simpler
version of curl doesn't have all the
bells and whistles it also takes
configure options and lets you install
arbitrary versions of Erlang and use
them you know switch between them for a
lot of you know convenience factor so
for example at my work we're kind of
stuck on our 1404 which does not have
DTrace support and then if you want
DTrace support and erling you need to
build with AR 15 b 01 or later and you
have to pass it that option all right so
there's also a really interesting
project called trace that I wanted to
talk about for just a minute this is
running DTrace from inside of Erlang so
it allows you to actually create DTrace
scripts inside of Erlang and then post
process the results inside of Erlang it
sounds crazy it is a little crazy but
there is actually some good reasons why
you might be interested in doing that
for example you can push them into
Folsom which is you know useful you can
also send an alert if you want you could
have some sort of messaging mechanism to
say that you know that things happening
and that you care about and you can kind
of go and investigate a little more
closely you know this is not necessarily
a cheap thing if you don't have Headroom
on your system to do this obviously it's
not a good idea but it is an interesting
project and it's it's modeled on some
capabilities that came out of Python in
the node you know environment but it's
nice to know that we have that same sort
of capability inner line two all right I
just wanted to spend a minute on
interpreting output you guys saw the the
screenshot from before i glossed over
this is basically the same sort of demo
here I just wanted to talk in more
detail about what's going on here in
case it wasn't super obvious because I
know that there's a lot of stuff on this
screen and it's not necessarily
understandable what's going on but you
can see pretty clearly that you have
pigs getting created that MF ASR being
called and that you know those pigs are
exiting in the next this next line down
here with the full message that you can
see the sender is noted
the receivers noted and the reason is
truncated because I mentioned it has a
problem but you can see all of these
spawns occurring you can see what their
kids are again they're treated as
strings and DTrace and then what
messages go to which other actor which
other process and that's really
straightforward if you look at this
spawn exit script again you know it kind
of describes okay here's all the things
I care about spawning exit signals you
know senders and receivers and what the
arguments for all those things are so
just real quick like this is a the
things that are in the appendix there's
a process spawn probe right it has a pin
MFA there's a process exit pig reason
you guys have already seen this there's
a sender pity receiver pit and a reason
so all of these things are documented
erling has 41 probes and I didn't want
to talk about the mall because that's
all we would talk about if if that's
what we were going to do so it's you
know it's a little bit ridiculous all
right so I've reached the point in the
demo where I probably should ask for any
questions before I go ahead and proceed
with the perilous live demo yeah go
ahead
sure yeah that's a great question the
question was I don't really care about
the time ordering of the of the dtrace
output can you group them by pit
unfortunately the answer is not very
easily you generally are going to have
to do some sort of post-processing the
way that DTrace is written is that it
basically dumps everything to standard
out for better or worse now you do have
very much control over what format it
actually comes out in in the perilous
live demo that I'm about to undertake
I've actually tab-delimited all of the
lines so that they're super easy to
parse you know in some other language or
you can do it in Erlang if you really
want to but you know doing something
doing the post-processing ETL operations
in Python or Ruby or pearl or whatever
your favorite thing is probably not bash
but you know one of those other
languages is certainly appropriate to do
yes you can definitely say I don't care
about the time ordering I want all the
pigs to always be identified and then
you'd have to do that yourself as far as
aggregating them things like that is
that not accurate okay all right another
question
since since I don't actually get to run
dtrace in production I can't really give
you a good answer to that what I can
tell you is that on my laptop running a
DTrace enabled Erlang as my day to day
early I haven't noticed any problems
with that at all I'm sure that there's a
potential for you know problems that
were not envisioned that's probably why
it's not you know on by default it's
because the OTP team doesn't want to
take responsibility for it but you know
as a daily driver I haven't noticed any
problems with it as far as like overhead
in terms of running probes on stuff if
you have super busy systems you know you
probably don't want to let it run for a
long time but running it for 30 seconds
or 10 seconds just to get a good sample
it's probably going to be fine again you
know your mileage may vary but that's
been my experience are there any other
questions that i can answer before i try
this again ok all right i'll give it
another shot here I think this is it yep
there's my mouse pointer ok so so I have
react running over here hopefully we'll
make sure that i'll just do PS real
quick or not I guess mm-hmm all right
we'll do this you limit or 96
that's better cool all right so on
that's running and then over here I want
to show you the script I'm going to want
to do actually have two scripts and I
wanted to show you over here the I don't
remember what I call this one now I have
a probe right so i want to show you act
probe okay so there's a lot of stuff
going on in here in this slide I read
this vim d'etre script really what I'm
doing here just to break this down for
you guys is I want to replace all of
these you know sort of standard UNIX II
error messages with actual strings that
make sense to humans and then here's a
note you can see that this is all
documented in the V node and then over
here the things that I care about it we
so we want an OP create so what this is
going to do is go ahead and tell me any
time that the process that's named BSP
is going to create or delete a file and
then it's going to go ahead and tell me
the time stamp and the UID and the pig
and the name of the process the
operation whether to create or remove
and then it will go ahead and give me
the directory in the file name so it'll
tell me what files got written where
they got written to whether it was
created or whether it was deleted and it
will also give me a time stamp of that
operation okay so the next thing I want
to do is actually look at some systolic
steps and this is for networking
operations what I want to do here in
this case is collect the information
about this calls into and out of sockets
that are available through react so
anytime there's socket connections for
react I want to measure the latency of
that socket connection and that's what
this all this code does so we have
except entry and accept return and when
we do the return that's actually when we
compute the Delta you can see down here
we're computing a delta and that's in
milliseconds
because dtrace comes with nano second
resolution or at least it's pretty close
to nano second resolution and this is
all basically low-level kernel level
stuff unfortunately DTrace does require
kind of that level of understanding the
internal systems I will tell you as a
person that doesn't have like super low
level kernel level understanding a lot
of these scripts are available for
Google searches you know if you're
interested in finding out about that
there's really good collection of sites
and I'm gonna talk about at the end of
the talk where a lot of the stuff can be
found so I'm only interested in internet
in in ipv4 connections I don't care
about ipv6 connections that's basically
what that's doing and then we're doing
this NT ohs which basically takes the
binary representation of a IP address
and turns it into a dotted quad I get to
the port number there's the address
translation same deal and then down here
we're out putting our information again
we have a time stamp bid process name
the address family the address this the
port number and so on and so on right
and then down here at the bottom we're
resetting our local variables so that as
things get reset we reset our internal
variables to zero so we can calculate
nool agencies so that's what that does
I'm combining both of virtual file
system operation here and also a network
level operation here so that's one
script ok so I'm going to go ahead and
run this act true
alright so that's running and then over
here I have another script I think it's
called it a trace d and this one does a
lot of other interesting stuff so in
this case what I interested in doing is
calculating the latency of process
scheduling so as react as this internal
Erlang scheduler throws new react
processes how long does it take for
those processes to get scheduled how
long do they run for and then calculate
the Delta so tell me how long it took
for a process once it's scheduled to
execute all of its reductions and then
go ahead and tell me how long that took
in in microseconds and then it so we're
calculating up here we're grabbing the
process start time stamp and then
process unscheduled when it gets thrown
off the scheduler or calculating the
elapsed time and then down here we're
printing that out and we're also telling
you that we unscheduled pit XYZ whatever
that is I'm also interested in knowing
when local functions get called and what
I'm doing here in this particular case
is I'm aggregating them so I'm doing a
variable called el funk and I'm copying
arg1 which is the mfa and I'm just
keeping a count of each one of those
things ok and then same thing for global
function entries there's also one for
Biff's there's one for nifs so if you
care about that stuff you can get that
and then at the bottom i have n block
where I'm truncating the top 10 so it
sorts it and then truncates them prints
them out top 10 local and top 10 global
so that's what this script does you guys
can see that you know you can get as
arbitrarily complicated complex with
this stuff as you want with you know no
additional instrumentation work on your
part alright so you can see here that
that react is you know scheduling quite
a lot of stuff and what's really
interesting to me is you'll see numbers
over here that you know vary between
something as Louis like you know 30 and
something as high as like 4000 which is
pretty cool to really get a sense for
what
is we're not printing out what the top
10 functions are but when i hit ctrl-c
to end the script we're actually going
to get that as far as the other thing
goes there is a there's a react admin
function here well that just runs some
some basic Diagnostics it runs a basic
test and it kind of tells you what stuff
is broken and how you can fix things
like that looks like I typed the wrong
thing in but that's fine let's see yeah
maybe you can just run a diag or
whatever this is really hard to type
this way but so we'll run another test
and we'll collect some more information
about this
see if we got any output over here okay
so stuff's going on you can see we're
having quite a bit of connections like
for example we're writing a test called
react Gnostic in this directory called
bit cask there was a creating a delete
we also had two socket connections here
through family too and they were
successes and it took eight milliseconds
at nine microseconds to connect it tells
you what their pigs are you got the
timestamps over here and these are all
tab delimited so you know it's pretty
easy to post-process them and then
correlate them together meanwhile over
here we have the Erlang side of things
which is very very busy and we're
collecting and aggregating all this
information I'm go ahead and show you
what it looks like now when I'm finished
and I hit control C and what I actually
does is it it goes ahead and tells me
the top 10 local functions you can see
there's some inline funds they're kind
of at the top those are the number one
number one two and three they're all
react core functions we have lists you
flatten we have prop let's get value
which is interesting list in is another
one that's high you know filename do
flatten these are all areas where you
have these are all sort of on the hot
code path you know that's what this is
telling you basically you know and then
we have the global function so these are
the ones that are external to to the
react application they're part of the
core library again they're on the hot
path so if you were to look at this as
an optimization opportunity you know
these would be places where you'd want
to investigate how often how frequently
them calling these functions and how
long do they take to process the data
okay are there any questions so far all
right so I'm going to go ahead and wrap
up I think all right here I am
alright so Erlang DTrace resources
there's the Earl install runtimes tools
dtrace comes packaged with a bunch of
sample DTrace trips that come with OTP
release their gratuitous their part of
their part of the the library so that
would be a good place to look so
wherever you put your installation in
the runtimes tools and the version
string there's a directory called
examples there's a bunch of DTrace
scripts in there the spawn exit dtrace
thing that I showed you came out of that
directory and then a lot of the other
things kind of mashed up together
there's also a readme that's available
if you're interested on the Erlanger
website and then there's a there's a
pretty good but somewhat brief talk that
Andy gross did a while ago for bash
eotech talk about running DTrace on a
Mac specifically with Erlang but just
short showed some of the specific Mac
os10 visualization tools that come out
of the box that are kind of neat that's
a really neat talk it's pretty short
it's like 25 minutes so if you really
are interested in this that would be a
good thing to go see as far as DTrace
resources themselves there's a really
great lab that you can that you can play
around with from Oracle they have this
website called dtrace hol calm the hol
stands for hands-on lab it has a virtual
box instance that you can download and
then you can spin up a solaris box and
there's like 13 exercises that you can
run it gives you a really nice overview
and flexibility of all the different
kinds of dtrace probe that are available
in Solaris most of them are available in
apple products most of them are
available in freebsd not all of them but
most of them are there's a dtrace book
that has a website called DTrace book
calm surprisingly there's also a
language repository unfortunately
there's no Erlang chapter here which is
an oversight but that's fine as I said
did the DTrace distribution in early
comes with quite a bit of sample scripts
that are pretty good and tackle many of
the same areas that you'd be interested
in the D trace book if you really want
to get sort of the DTrace Bible is that
this link on Amazon and then if you want
to go to github and see what they are
there that's the URL for that I wanted
to throw out a plug again for Rick Reed
stock he's going to he's talking at two
o'clock this afternoon and he's going to
kind of give a taste of DTrace from the
perspective of performance tuning and
that's I think going to be really
interesting talk so if you're interested
in learning how dtrace can help you tune
your vm and tune your application that
would be great and then that's that's
what i have so are there any other
questions at this time yeah in the back
yeah
yeah they're all right here on the
others uh there's 92 slides in this deck
and you guys have only seen 40 of them
so yeah if you want to learn about all
the probes here they all are we'll just
go through them really fast
yeah so there you go are there any other
questions all right thank you very much
for for listening about betrayed thank
you appreciated
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
