confidence and hopefully somebody broker
think pieced on medium recently which
summarized some of my thoughts so I can
just say hey what this person said so
hopefully some of you might have seen
this it did the rounds a few weeks ago
so software development at one Hertz and
the general theme of this article is
about getting a feedback cycle that is
approximately one second long or less
ideally so some people say like oh yeah
twenty second build and they're like
yeah that's fine but like twenty seconds
is a gap like one second isn't quite
long enough to be a gap like you hit the
thing you get feedback in a second that
doesn't feel like a pause obviously you
notice it but it doesn't it's not long
enough for your mind to wonder it's not
long enough for you to do something else
and so what I want to talked about today
is how do we get feedback within one
Hertz while doing front-end developments
and so I mostly work in the world of
JavaScript and as I'm sure many of you
know there's lots of it sister forgot to
check on something okay so we have a
bunch of existing tools that are in
fairly common use in JavaScript
forgetting like fast feedback and
hopefully some of you are using these
today though not everyone is so I'm just
gonna mention a couple of the most
importance so one of the common tools
you can get is a linter so I have
emitted a semicolon there which is a
very sort of fatal error in JavaScript
it's important to always type your
semicolons and so I've set up some
software to tell me as I type a make
sure you you put those semicolons in and
I get very quick feedback so you should
be able to see as I remove that
semicolon I get a little like red box
there and that's useful and it also
tells me about actual useful errors so
if I say for instance
a variable doesn't exist it will tell me
about this and this is very simple so I
just set up a linter integrate with
meditating quick feedback about a
certain type of error I've also got
tests so this code here is my tests if I
were to say change aligned in my tests
then I should get a failure and what
you'll notice is over on the Left I get
some failures and if you are watching
closely you've seen in your peripheral
vision up in the top corner there's a
little flash of color which is whether
or not my test passed or failed now this
particular test suite runs in a round so
a few milliseconds so I get extremely
quick feedback about whether or not my
previous test run was successful and on
the hall and you've got a project I'm
working on I try and keep the test suite
to take around about one second so that
I can run my entire test suite every
time I make a change and I can get that
feedback and there are some tools that
can take advantage of your dependency
graph in your system so it knows that
when I make a change only these tests
could possibly be affected assuming
we're not leaking some global states
somewhere and that can manage to give us
a much larger test suite but still give
us that one second of feedback and in
JavaScript now we can also get things
like tight jackers flow or typescript
and or even compile to JavaScript
languages will give us those abilities
and again this is all about giving us
feedback quickly into a code and these
are things which is this today are in
fairly common use and hopefully most of
you have at least heard of these things
but I want to talk about for the rest of
talk is something a bit different so the
three things I've shown you so far so or
talked about limiting unit tests and
type checking how useful is that when
building a user interface and what do I
mean by user interface I mean like a
rich interactive application so here is
my rich interactive application I built
for today so this is it's a little
multi-page app that you interact with
it's a single page JavaScript app rich
Internet application this particular one
I can't use that term anymore this
particular one doesn't talk to a server
but often these things do so I've
written a bunch of applications like
this and I've used linting and I've used
unit tests and I've written components
with heavily heavy unit tests on them
but I still always felt the need to go
and open up the
and look at my component to make sure it
looks right and actually behaved
correctly like I'm not getting enough
confidence from my tests or my types or
my linting to make meters
allow me to say I'm gonna make a change
and I know this works I don't need to go
like view the code in the browser now if
I'm working with say an API for example
often I can get enough confidence from
just the test that yes this rot this
will run correctly because the input
output is data structures but the input
output for something like this is much
more complicated so what I want to talk
about today is an approach which I think
works reasonably well for getting
effective feedback when you're building
a user interface like this but before I
go into that I just want to take a brief
detour into sort of an area in
JavaScript land called hot module
reloading now in this particular system
this is powered by a tool called web
pack and there's a few other ways of
doing this it's a web pack itself is
just a really flexible compiler toolkit
that can do anything it's often used in
practice as a JavaScript module bundler
but anyway so this should feel familiar
to you what I'm about to do so I have my
application I'm on page one so I get to
pick a character anyone want a shout out
shout out choice berry berry berry good
choice okay so we've got berry bear so
we've chosen very bear and now the
second choice is we get to choosing like
a weapon that berry bear gets to wear so
if I want to pick a weapon via ok the
beer is the choice okay there you go
so as you can clearly see yeah ok that's
that doesn't oh very good does it okay
hang on so if I so I load up my web
inspector and I've got ya okay so this
Rose selectors and there's a color here
so let's try to show that 50% better
it's a bit I don't it's a bit garish for
my taste I'm gonna try 70 80 90 so this
very clearly passes our one Hertz test
so I'm interacting with the page and I'm
seeing feedback immediately so I think
80 is actually the nicest of those so we
go so now we've got a nice sort of pale
orange so that's good but I'm not
actually made that change I've just
interacts with the page so I've got to
go actually make it so here we go this
is my code so let's make that eight
percent and then hit save and then I
need to make sure that worked so refresh
the page okay and I'm gonna put the bear
and the beer okay yeah so good so that's
looking right and what you might have
noticed was that failed the one Hertz
test so when I made the change in my
editor
it took me slightly more than a second
to get back to this because it was on
the second page which was mildly
annoying anyway that's that wasn't
terrible that was okay like I managed to
figure out what change I wanted pretty
quickly and then applying it I just did
double-check it actually applied
correctly so that's fine
I know topic the beer and I move on to
the next step so this is actually a
betting game so I've got 100 credits up
here and I get to enter my stake so I'm
going to bet 30 credits I'm going to
begin my fight so I get little anime at
fight and I lost 30 credits and that
message feels a little bit impersonal
actually so let's let's make the message
a bit nicer so let's say sorry you lost
end credits so I'm using react over here
on the right but it basically just looks
like HTML at this point so anyway so I
hit save and then I hit refresh and then
I have the bear and I've got beer and
they go next and into my steak and I
begin my fight and there we go you can
see that you see the message so that's
kind of annoying so hopefully this is
familiar to you this is how we all build
web pages every day you make a change
you reload the page you click a bunch of
stuff to get back into state you're in
and if you're lucky you do get back into
state you're in or in my case if I'm
unlucky or if I've done something to rig
it so it always does this
then then you get a different message
okay so what's the solution so the
solution is something called hot module
reloading so if I reload this page now
in hot module mode what I've done is
I've enabled a connection live to the
server and when the server recompiles
the JavaScript it will send like a patch
down to the client which gets applied
directly so we can see that here with
the CSS so this in this respect is
similar to like CSS live reload so I hit
save on the on my editor on the side and
then it immediately changes the code on
my left so I can say okay that's got me
back down under that one hurts barrier
but I'm now actually editing my actual
code in my actual editor using whatever
tools I feel like and it's
getting applied so that's pretty good so
we go over here and then we have our
fight we bring in our fight and then
okay we did get the lost message this
time but actually I want to see what the
the other message is like or I want to
change this message so now I'm just
going to modify my JavaScript and that's
going to take effect immediately
so I can do whatever I want and actually
I say well okay I want to say the wind
message so I could play around with the
state and make it react differently so
there's some tools in reactor I continue
to state or actually I've got the code
right here so I can just put like true
or at the start of this and then
actually I'm gonna see both messages at
once with this change and I'm not
because of operator precedence yeah
there we go oh yeah he bugs message at
once so let's make that a bit nicer as
well hit save yeah okay that's fine and
then make sure I put my code back so de
end up with both message on the page
that's kind of nice and actually what I
might want to do is I've rerun the
flight animation so I've hopefully just
dropped something useful onto the window
object so what I've done here now is I
sort of changed my code and written it
in a way that's a little bit different
so that I can interact with it more
directly onto the page so I I'm not just
using a system that allows me to make
changes easier I'm then say no actually
now that I've got this system I want to
make my code write my code slightly
differently so I can take advantage of
these changes and so that's hot module
reloading and that dramatically reduces
this feedback cycle hopefully down to
under this sort of magic one Hertz
barrier that someone on medium decided
was a thing so that's good
this is nice and that works so hot
module reloading so one thing I like to
say is it so it turns this into like
almost a conversation with my
applications I know what fer did this
what if I did this and I'm trying out
and I'm getting that feedback really
really quickly and that's great but this
isn't necessarily a panacea it does
leave us with some problems so one thing
you could spot here when I said okay I
can either show you normally it would
either show you the win message or the
lose message any one time
and if I wanted to show both how to like
modify the
and this is basically because a given
user interface component has a number of
possible states that can be in possibly
a large number of possible states it can
be in and in my actual application
generally there is only one so my
application is running and it's in one
state at a time so if as soon as I have
a conditional logic in my code then I
need some way to exercise it in both
scenarios and the way I do that
generally is by clicking something or
typing something but we think about when
we're not working in user interface code
how do we approach this if we've got a
bunch of functions then we write unit
tests and the unit tests will exercise
our function under a number of different
scenarios or we could even get a bit
fancier and do property based testing
and generate the scenarios I hope you're
feeling particularly fun so we can prove
things but I'm not necessarily what you
would prove about does this page look
nice that's it's a difficult property to
to a certain and I'm still not convinced
it does this is the extent of my design
skills are large font size emoji so
what's next a couple of years ago I sort
of talked by a guy called Bruce Hammond
so this is if you've ever done any
closure or closure script work this is
the author of fig wheel which is the hot
code reloading tool that works with
closure scripts and he did talk at
Strange Loop I think is actually just
over a year ago entitled dev cards
so basically dev cards is a closure
script library that sort of builds on
these concepts that we had around hot
code reloading and around sort of having
in user interface components and sort of
embedding them into the page and sort of
giving us a way to interact with them
and I really like this and this is great
that's aa brilliant I want to use this
but I don't do closure to get to my day
job unfortunately and though maybe some
people in this audience do it so I
couldn't just switch over to closure
script I thought well actually this this
idea seems pretty relatively Universal
like can I just force it to JavaScript
and the general answer is yes yes I
could just post it to JavaScript so this
is the same thing but ported to
JavaScript so this builds on the things
we've seen so far so these ideas of like
iterative you
testing type approaches this idea of
components and now what we've got is the
dev board so dev board is it's really
just a bunch of functions and
conventions that give you an easy way to
build pages that will give you there for
you to give yourself better feedback and
so I'm still I've been working on this
for a little over a year now
a little Andreea and I'm still
struggling to find a shorter sentence
that says that same thing but this is
this is where I am so a 45-minute talk
is is the approach at this point so what
I've got here is this function to find
card and it has a bunch of properties
and things so I can give it a title
which you can see appears over here so
this is the title unless I change it so
I've got the hot reloading stuff enabled
so when I hit save on the side then I
should get a rebuild and I get an update
there and that took slightly longer than
I wanted to but that's fine it's still
close to a second the second document
here is actually marked down so I can
type it mark down in here that's not
valid markdown but that is and I get
like a sort of nicely rendered bit of
text there's a horizontal line there you
can't see because of contrast reasons
but yeah I can type things
I hope yeah I can type things and so the
idea is this gives you like an almost
sort of literate programming type
interactive luke way you can put things
over here and they appear on this side
so this in itself isn't particularly
interesting and the interesting thing is
actually the third argument so the third
argument is the body of the cards so
generally I've got a title I've got some
documentation and then I've got a body
and the body is effectively extremely
polymorphic so I can put anything in
there and the card attempts to render it
in a useful way
so for instance if I give it a number it
says hey here's the number if I give it
like a data structure then it will give
me a sort of a pretty printed version of
that data structure that I can see if I
give it a date it'll say okay you know
here's what date looks like and these
are pretty boring examples so far so if
I want to do something interesting so if
I gave it a regular expression then it
will give me an interactive regular
pression editor type thing that will
tell me whether
something matches so this is just a sort
of result of me thinking okay given a
particular type like what is this what
is a useful thing I can give you on a
page to give you feedback but the most
useful thing you can do with these
things is to put a react component in
there so here I'm just going to type a
little bit react code and that will
render and this also works with custom
components which is when it starts to
get actually actually useful so the idea
is what I'm going to do is sort walk you
through the experience of trying to
build a component using a system like
this so the component I've decided to
build today is going to be a thermometer
so I've got a second card here just down
here so this is my card and if I just
focus it let me go just this card only
this is going to be a thermometer if I
currently is a thermometer it's not very
interesting one and it's telling you
it's quite warm in here which is so what
we want to do to make this more like a
thermometer is sort of visualize this
temperature so let's so we've got a
number and as well as a number we're
gonna get a visual representation of our
monetary thing yep that's right so we
can put the number below and then above
the number let's put something slightly
more interesting
so let's have background of red for now
let's just hard code that so that should
now start to look a bit more like a
thermometer okay yeah so obviously that
doesn't look like a thermometer so
that's no idea let's make it look more
like a thermometer so with this being
like this sort of a live coding part of
the talk specifically about like
iterative software developments all
there as you see are intentional
obviously you see there that's
everything sort of inter playing
together so I actually got a lint
warning they're telling me I typed
height twice which helped me though yeah
so that now looks like a thermometer so
that's quite useful so what we'll see
now is when we change the temperature
the thermometer obviously doesn't get
smaller because we're not written that
code so we should probably write that
code so let's set the height to be the
temperature there we go okay so now we
have it every thumbs up tada clap now
it's great so that's what that's a
thermometer and that's it's kind of a
boring timorous that's not very
interesting but the sort of thing we can
start to do with the system like this is
say well actually that's not very useful
just just see one at a time so let's see
more than one wants so what would a
thermometer look like it's got a variety
of different temperatures so you say oh
okay right and then we can start to spot
some issues with our implementation so
far so thermometers generally don't get
like bigger on the bottom they stay the
same height and fill up so we'll make
that change so we'll say the height is
now always that's a hundred pixels and
then the so I actually need two elements
now I think to make this work so I need
to set the style there
right yep so that should look a bit more
like okay so we can see they are now all
the same height but the mercury is
floating which mercury doesn't so what
we need to do is then put the margin top
there we go that's sort of right it's
still not right but I don't know why
that's fine yeah and so if you can't
think about if we weren't using like a
system like this where we get some
feedback like what would it have taken
for us to get these sorts of things and
in particular example so we can see this
one looks about right but this one looks
wrong but I can only tell that because I
can see three at once and I don't
normally see three at once so this you
can start to see how this becomes quite
useful them can anyone spot one that's
not right no actually I don't need this
high tier because the margin makes it
work yeah there we go they're all the
same height yeah so you can start to see
how this sort of thing can become quite
useful so I actually built a much better
looking for monitor than this in the
actual door kind of a time I'll see if I
can do the next bit so now we've got
these so we start to think again with
all sort of unit testing try pattern or
what if we put like different numbers in
like what if we put minus 10 what does
that look like well that kind of all
right that work yep okay what if we put
200 so the barometer is now say too hot
that's not great but least we can see it
and we can sort of see okay so what if
we say right let's keep the temperature
within a range so let's say we're gonna
calculate the percentage you know
restrict yeah so we're gonna restrict
our temperature to beam between minus 50
and 200 or 150 actually it's like say if
we had like an actual physical mercury
thermometer and it went up to 150 and it
was hotter than that then it would just
be full I think well maybe would explode
I don't know I don't know how see the
CSS CSS animation for exploding so I can
do that so that has not worked oh so
okay so the problem is yeah my margin
not bigger so I've said the biggest is
150 so if I set that to 150 now this
should also have line up there we go
but my negative one is still dropping
off the bottom a bit which is not ideal
so actually if we think about like zero
shouldn't be zero we want to sort of
shift the scale a little bit so we can
modify that again so if we do the temp
equals so this so if we figure out what
is the percentage between sort of our
bottom number and our top number then
that will give us a number there we go
ah but we've actually we've changed
these numbers and as well as the size so
really that should be called a different
variable so let's do size and then these
two becomes size so that should start to
look a little bit about now yeah there
we go but that's kind of weird because
like the minus ten is sort of here and
the 10 so you can't really see where the
zero is so this is the point where I try
and like draw a line around the outside
and try and make it look more like a
thermometer and in a previous iteration
the talk I did try and do that live and
it went terribly so hopefully I've got a
Blue Peter number here so here's one I
made earlier so I said that's two there
we go okay I'm in focus mode at the
moment if I click on here there we go
okay yep so I'm actually start to look
like Robert so now see we can start to
feel at 25 so if I look down change this
number to say like 10 yeah so we can see
that zero is about here and this
particular implantation goes down so I
think about minus 30 so I said it to
minus 35
this is Celsius of course cuz Rimland
I'm not starting to look okay but it's
still pretty difficult to read so I have
hopefully managed to put some numbers on
the sides and there we go so now now
actually looks like a thermometer you
might be able to read and I can probably
bump the size up a notch
okay and now we can say yeah all right
let's play around with this bit more so
it's a 50 and I can sort of visually
inspect that yes when I put this 250
then it does line up with the 50 number
now trying to write a test for that sort
of thing would be potentially quite
difficult I don't really know what sort
of test I would write to say that yes
visually when I have when my thermometer
is 50 full then the the red bit lines up
to the 50 mark on the side that sounds
like something that could be quite
tricky to do but my eyes are pretty good
at this like I can look at languor yes
that's correct so as long as I remember
to look at this page then I can have
confidence and the sort of component
approach that react promotes means that
it's unlikely certainly with this
implementation that any other component
can mess with this particular component
in a way that would break this sort of
constraint so that's quite nice
so let's increment our Blue Peter number
and have a look at step three so I've
put the multiple possible States back in
and then we can start to see that yeah
okay so that's looking like a physical
thermometer in a reasonable amount that
artefact there is to do with the browser
zoom it's not it's not really there
because zoom is apparently awkward but
what we can spot here and now we're
looking at our component in multiple
different states at once is that it's
not apps they're not particularly
visually very distinct from each other
so yeah if I go and read the dial I can
see which one's bigger which on top turn
yeah if I look closely I can see the
exact temperature and I can get a rough
idea of relative temperature from them
but I still have to go read it figure
out the number and that in my head
decide whether that's hot or cold so
let's introduce a bit more color to it
so what I've done here is I've taken a
function which basically lets me
interpolate the value across a range of
colors and now if I hit that I should be
able to see that the colder one goes a
bit bluer and then the hostile ones stay
a bit redder so that's quite nice and I
can play around with the colors if I
want to so I can say let's make the cut
the blue a little bit colder maybe feels
a little cold I guess / - 30 that's
right or I can make it a bit more garish
if I want say let's try interpolate
those together yeah
it doesn't really like mercury anymore
it's not start to look like a
thermometer as much but maybe that's
okay maybe nobody wants a an old-school
thermometer maybe want to really play
around the I've no idea what its gonna
look like now that's gonna borrow
actually I quite like that yeah so these
are the sort of things you can play
around with interactivity program see
what it looks like and I think the key
thing for this there's a few other
similar systems I've seen that people
have done talks about and experimented
with but showing a single component in
multiple states at once is like the real
like aha this is useful to me moments
and I'm not necessarily saying you
should use this tool which I wrote or
any of the other tools exist but the
general approach of or what if we just
build our components in isolation and
then add them to our application
afterwards like what sort of approaches
does that enable so what's next okay
yeah so this is still a little bit
static like it's it's on the page we can
see a bunch at once so let's make it a
little bit more interesting let's
increment up lupito number again and we
get here's one I made earlier number
four so what I've done this time is I've
added a form input into this page so the
form input code has been added to the
card itself you can see that here so
I've got an input in the so I defined my
card I've said I'm gonna have a rower
thermometers and at the end of the row
under the last thermometer I'm just
going to throw an extra input and then
I've bound that to the state of a card
so what I can enable for example is I
can so in this particular case it's not
very useful but I can turn on inspection
and now my number should appear at the
bottom of the card so I can see that
when this changes my state changes over
here so I'm recording that information
and then we can see yeah okay so as well
as our predefined scenarios we can
interact with the page and see what it
looks like in all the other scenarios so
for instance you might notice that once
the temperature goes above a certain
point it stays the same amount of red
basically it's just a multiplier in
somewhere just because it seemed weird
to be like it slightly a slight hint of
blue when it was like 70 degrees what
you still has so yeah we can start to
get interactive and make these things
but we've kind of almost gone back to
the original problem we had if we do
this too much so the original problem we
had was we couldn't see what our
component would be
unless we interacted with it and then we
said okay let's see it in loads of
states and now I said okay maybe you
want to interact with it as well so it's
kind of useful that yes you can interact
with it but if you just make them
interactive then it's easy to forget
like what are the interactions I'm
supposed to do so in this case he has
the text box we just change the number
but what if there's like three or four
different buttons like and if you press
them in a certain order it does
something like do I need to remember
that so what I'm using this page when I
could put like a little hint sheet at
the bottom and say like okay don't
forget to click on the thing and then if
like future me coming back to this can
read this thing oh yeah don't forget to
click on the thing like the kind of
thing clicking on the thing doesn't do
anything so there is another thing so
important are blue Peter again so this
time in case we forget to interact we
can sort of pre script a animation we
can say okay on a timer do this and then
because time is really annoying if they
all play at once on a big screen then
it's off by default so I can turn on the
ticking and now this particular
component over here like just every few
hundred milliseconds just ticks this in
so now I don't need to remember what the
interaction is I can pre arrange the
interaction on the page so my current
project at work which I don't think I
can show so I probably won't but it's
like an interactive canvas and what I've
done is I've written in like a little
DSL in sort of layers on top of this
card system to fire in a series of Mouse
events so it says okay weapons if I
click here and then move the mouse over
here and then click here and then move
the mouse over here and click here and
then for a different component I
pre-scripted a bunch of scenarios and
then when I make a change I can see the
reaction on all of those at the same
time so that's a little jerky actually
so now that I'm can see it moving I've
decided actually is let's make it bit
smoother and we'll play a CSS animation
and then what's to say there we go so
now actually feels like again warmer
it's good
and then obviously we can check that yes
what does that do the right thing when
we're going over here and actually maybe
it's kind of annoying that it could move
slower when it's more so we can play
around a little bit more or we could
have a second animation next to it that
did another thing and the code to do
that animation is really tiny so I've
got like a callback down here that says
what to do when you tick I've got my
initial States gotten into War whether
or not to auto play and then the actual
code for the the main body of the
component is pretty much the same yeah
so that's the sort of the thermometer
data so when I first did this tour
people's @r okay well this is working
really well with react like does it only
work well with react the answer is sort
of yes so when you use react or a system
like it you build user interface
components that generally take external
data as like well defined inputs and
render it give it so given particular
data here's what my page will look like
and this approach general approach to
building components or templates or
whatever lends itself really really well
to hot reloading because I've separated
my data from my behavior so I can change
my behavior but keep my data the same
and then see the results like this but
as long as you do actually sort of
separate your data in your behavior in
some sort of way then you can still do
useful things so here I've got a
mustache template over here on the left
and then over here on the right so this
is the HTML that powers this template
and I can definitely say okay I'm just
gonna change this HTML I'm gonna hit
save and then that's going to have an
effect on the left-hand side and
basically the way to do things like this
so in this case in this imaginary
scenario my real application doesn't use
react but when I plug it into a dev
cards type system then it does use react
and so what I've done is I basically
just defined a function that can take a
template and some data and then that in
itself then does a little bit of react
to just glue the two things together but
I can use this same function for any
interactive components that's using
whatever and that all just works so the
main difference between doing an actual
react component using this approach is
that when I do change the state I have
to throw away all of my like in progress
part
the components so when I change this
file here I end up like re rendering the
whole like Dom elements it just gets
thrown away and put back so I lose that
nice thing where I knew what the exact
value was so you could build that sort
of thing on top of it but generally a
system you like react system react or a
system like it is sort of the best way
to get benefits of something like this
yeah so that that was confident user
interface programming I hope you'll
agree and yeah that's me so I went a
little faster than I thought it would
but means I've got time for questions is
yes at the back
yes so if I try and summarize a question
it's like if I'm building if you're
building these components in isolation
how do you then put them into the
application or share them across
multiple applications okay and how do
you take them out of an application and
put them into a system like this okay
yeah so this particular demo doesn't I
think but in the cases where I've used
this in an actual app generally I've got
the exact same webpack build config and
there's just an additional entry point
for the dev card so it sits in the same
software project it's just a sub folder
which contains the cards and then the so
in this case I've written the components
in line but in practice I would usually
import the component from its relocation
and then use it in this case so it's
it's sort of in the same way you might
have a subfolder called tests I also
have a subfolder called dev board and
then all this stuff goes in there yeah
okay cool and then you can also do
things like so if you're thinking about
what components benefit motion this
so I've got an example here of doing say
bootstrap so you could see how this is
similar ish to having like a visual
style guide only it's also your scratch
board for when you're actually making
changes to that and you can say okay
here's so for example say progress bars
is a nice demo of this sort of thing
using so if you or say that you've got
like a sub team in your company that
builds the user interface components for
the rest of the company then this sort
of thing might be really powerful for
that yes
it's my github the same as my Twitter no
it's not and it's really annoying so my
yeah so if you if you google for glen
mailer there aren't many of them and
none of the others are programmers but
basically yeah so my github is glen
german which is like benjamin but with
Glenn yeah so I will try and put
together so I don't actually have any
slides I can share really but I will put
to try and put together a little summary
of what I said today and share that with
the Kurdish organizers yep so dev board
is on github and it is installable
through npm and the docs a sort of there
so doesn't talk a few times and people
like yeah that's great and then I don't
know if anyone's ever used it but like I
said before I'm not particularly
Precious about using my implementation
but I'd really like more people to use
this idea and especially in other
languages as well any other questions
no okay that thing feels like we might
be first for lunch then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
