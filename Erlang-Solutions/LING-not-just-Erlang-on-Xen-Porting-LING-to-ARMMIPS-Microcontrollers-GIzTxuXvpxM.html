Tov
I'm chief executive at cordosa LLP it's
a company behind lean new urban cream
which is also known as our 1 concern
today I will talk about Porton lean to
raspberry pie first of all a few words
about lean itself
Lyn is essentially a different
segmentation of Erin Korea it was
created totally from scratch so it
shares no covered with Standard Arabic
we are written by Erickson sting we try
to create this new VM as small and as
fast as possible we also decided to not
use SMB so if we want to deploy a lean
on multi-core configuration we just
start as many instances as banette also
our VM is optimized for very austere top
latency it usually starts in tens of
milliseconds and we paid a lot of
attention to minimise the jitter caused
by garbage collection lean doesn't need
to have access to disk it may start
without access to block device this is
another big difference if you want to
know more about lean you're very welcome
to visit our community website Arabic
insane dot org today we'll talk about
links port to raspberry pi but there are
other ports as well almost all of them
is under heavy development now so links
going to expand its ecosystem quite
significantly in the nearest future
original link the M was targeting Xen
x86 now there is a port to then arm also
were working with support the POSIX
systems such as Windows and Mac OS 10
and today we have announced the first
success of our attempt to get lean to
work on mix based microcontroller
which has only a health megabyte of RAM
there is also substantial for by our
partner - Portland - bigger 64-bit mixes
today I will focus on running lean and
are specifically on Raspberry Pi metric
computer so why it is important to run
lean on arm and what were our goals to
make the sport first of all we wanted to
create first bare metal port for our
platform which originally was intended
to work under them hypervisor
so it served only virtual by Aaron for
now I also think that we can continue to
embrace their arm 64 servers because
they seemed to be a perfect breaks for
energy efficient cloud services and even
replace into base servers for certain
types of applications for this port with
definitely things that Aaron will be a
convenient language for writing embedded
applications as well as Internet of
Things apps
everybody talks about Internet of Things
today and Lin seems to be just the right
platform for that now let me pass a word
virtually of course to our CTO and Link
Sauter Maxim harsh and go for a short
demo of very first drawing of Raspberry
Pi board early on the Raspberry Pi he
will get the Raspberry Pi connected
through this serial interface throw this
throw this converted to USB I'm starting
the screen which talks to this interface
and now I turn on the radio
two seconds
we got a prompt for early and then we
have this classic example two plus two
for war help so it works here we are so
what were the challenges for this port
there were quite a few porting almost
anything to bare metal is much harder
than writing and applications for
Windows or Linux or something else like
that the hardest part is to make
anything happen like to make a first
output to the console so doing that we
call hello world is really hardest part
we stay quite a bit with the serial
interface of Raspberry Pi which is
non-standard and we had to make couple
of converters to get up a serial
connection between Raspberry Pi and
laptop another challenge was to
determine PI's specific of doing boot
sequence to determine of how much memory
we've got there and we still do not sure
that we did it right and about this port
is definitely is not complete to be run
on Raspberry Pi 2 which well is much
fatter version suitable to run vinous or
even Windows 10 while we targeted much
smaller and simpler devices
well this pleasant young gentleman the
pigs of how we imagined typical and
better developer today and there is a
reason boy industry manager to make a
huge progress in high-level software
stack but it seems that embedded
software stack remains in seventies
set of languages in the Syria compiler
technology as well see still occupies
the major role in embedded development
and we want to change the situation by
introducing the very high level
functional languages such as Aaron to
this area and not only for writing
applications we also want to be able to
implement hardware drivers with using
the same stack ARINC is definitely a
perfect candidate for this area it has
mechanisms to provider ability it has
concurrency it has bid pattern matching
and hot cathode so well it looks like a
perfect toolbox for writing applications
which should run forever we should
restart itself predictably and all that
embedded stuff all of that is always
about possessing advanced and protocols
which always been a strong side affair
and if they go even deeper we should
think about how we could implement a
driver in high-level languages like
Aaron or similar languages and there is
definitely a need to attempt that
because right now when they look on a
piece of code set has to be simple like
well on an Internet card driver wish
well what do we see it's something like
hundred of thousands wines of almost
unreadable C code with the thing that
it's more than excessive also it's very
often situation when there is a single
reason to choose Linux because it's
simply a set of these drivers growing
like a snowball and nobody can improve
this code or even change it
cause well it's difficult to read and
understand such a huge amount of C code
and for our perspective there is much
better approach to make drivers which we
divide into portions the low-level
portion should be generated from a
hardware description itself from very
low core VHDL or something like that the
sole purpose of this part is to
transform all level events such speed
flips or memory rights into errant
messages then all further processing
will be logical for driver its state
should be done by a high-level portion
of a driver and Aaron all of that is
still a concept but we have got an
ongoing project for that cat named as
project L well project L up to date was
classified as a top secret being
described briefly it's Aaron piece trunk
types and we're trying to make type
inference developer friendly by not
forcing programmer to write any
additional type annotations compiler
should be able to derive all types
without having annotation even in
simplest form which Aaron provides
currently also the programs in l1 which
compile in binary code so it doesn't
require VM and its runtime is very
minimal no more than eight kilobytes
that always should fit to the trust
level cache in CPU and output of the
compiler is a unicorn also it's a binary
image runnable either inside the M or on
per metal so well there was a kind of
pronouncement of this new kind of
Ireland which we are going to introduce
maybe on the next conference right now
project
Elle is a bit more than a concept
compiler is able to determine and derive
recursive types and generate quite an
optimal code which runs pretty fast
faster than C actually the first working
example was a generator of Fibonacci
number sequence just a couple months ago
and yesterday Maxim got work an example
of dark Scholes option price and
algorithm size and performance of that
code is more than impressive so who
knows maybe it will be our future oh
well everybody is very welcome to join
us in our force to put arrington more
architectures and more platforms and
more hardware there are a lot of things
to do for anybody who wants to use our
link to program all those small things
please do not hesitate to keep in touch
with us through our community site
herman consented org where you can find
all our contacts we apologize for not
being able to address you all face to
face this time but we definitely meet in
person soon next event thank you for
attention bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
