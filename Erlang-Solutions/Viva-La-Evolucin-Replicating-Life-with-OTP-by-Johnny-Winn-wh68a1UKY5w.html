an evolution how's everybody doing it's
I'm sorry it's so quiet here I like you
know and I know I know I know I was told
I'm an American I'm used to all this
noise I come here it's like everybody's
quiet like everywhere I go it's like a
library so if I'm loud and things like
that then please bear with me so as
mentioned i am johnnie win on the
internet so i'm known as Johnny
underscore rugger i'm the host of the
elixir fountain podcast it's a weekly
show covering not only elixir but are
things from across the beam ecosystem by
day I'm a developer and I work on
production that looks for applications
I've been doing that now for quite some
time I've been working with the liquor
for going on I guess this is a little
over three years so Wow so I'm what they
call an old-timer no yeah we have badges
and everything it's great you get them
after a while but today I want to talk
to you about something a little
different i want to talk to you about
something I find interesting genetics
now this talk does come with a little
bit of a disclaimer I am NOT a
geneticist I don't know if you can tell
and really I don't even play one on TV
so you're probably wondering why I'm
giving this talk well I do know a little
bit about spawning child processes yes
there's seven of them for those of you
quick it mouth now my wife and I have a
unique situation and we actually stick
out an America pretty bad here we stick
out really bad I know that most people
don't have more than what one or two
kids over here is pretty much the norm
yeah walking around with when I only
brought four with us but it's still a
lot and yeah I think it kind of throws
people off a little bit but we have a
unique situation and what in the States
we call it yours mine and ours i don't
know if it's the same term that would be
over here where she had to from a
previous i had three from a previous and
soon we were really smart and decided up
to you more so people often assume that
they're all ours now i don't know if you
in the back can tell they we all do kind
of have a similar look and you can
probably tell which ones are which
if you're close to them my kids I feel
really bad for him I have four girls
than they all look very much like me we
have to shave the beards and everything
it's just ridiculous so now this is my
stepson he's what he's technically the
oldest so to make it even more fun we
have to 19 year olds to 17 year olds a
14 year old a nine-year-old the
six-year-old he's the oldest by about
two weeks so he's in college we go out
to college and everything like that I he
was florida state university go noles ya
see that doesn't go over well either
here so i hope you guys get my jokes cuz
a lot of them are like probably
Americanized i guess i would be a case
but so we're out there and we're at a
football game not what you consider
football we're at real football did you
play with your hands cuz that makes
sense it's exactly exactly makes sense
we call ours football you know but we
play with our hands so in any case we're
out there at the game and I and I meet
one of his friends and she's talking to
us and she goes oh you two look so much
alike okay um Whitney of course we got a
big laugh out of it now we also know
that genetics are fun and everything
like that but environment and mannerisms
you know I've been around him since he
was really young so he has a lot of
postures and things and movements that
are similar to me so even though maybe
physically he doesn't necessarily have
my traits he has my mannerisms we stand
the same we kind of hold ourselves to
say and when we talked we kind of talked
probably with the same sort of
inflections things like that although
he's much quieter than me I don't know
but one cool thing is is we all have
blue eyes now I don't know looking
around I'm looking how many blue eyed
people do we have here yes eventually
we'll all die off know when uh so just
real quick on the blue eyed thing so
when you see somebody with blue eyes
blue eyes are a recessive trait will get
into what that means in a little bit but
that basically what it means is that
it's not prominent if there's another
trait that's present it will be the
dominant trait so like brown eyes you
see a lot of
nine people well that's because that's a
dominant trait so the blue-eyed trait
technically will go away now my wife and
I both have blue eyes so it is
impossible that we carry that dominant
trait so any of our offspring will have
blue eyes so now there's a little bit of
a darker side to genetics and probably
one of the reasons why I kind of aside
from having all those child processes
got kind of really interested in a few
several years back now I guess so my
subs my stepson he's a type 1 diabetic I
don't know if you're familiar with type
1 diabetes but is actually considered to
be a genetic disease it affects kids for
no known reason other than genetics now
he got it in fourth grade and it's
actually kind of a interesting story so
it was shortly after my wife and I got
together we had been having a great
summer of fun and watching and taking
the kids to all sorts of places and
really enjoying ourselves and of course
the kids are drinking sodas and all the
stuff that they shouldn't be doing but
it was great it was a great fun but I
was noticing I was like something
doesn't seem right and right before
school started my wife took him to the
doctor to have him check to see if
anything was wrong her father is a type
1 diabetic and it's also known to kind
of skip generations which her brother
and she doesn't have our she and her
brother don't have diabetes but you
never know well the first day of school
and at the time she was still teaching
this is before we started homeschooling
she's sitting in her classroom preparing
for a day to teach kindergarten and she
gets a call from the doctor's office and
you gotta love when you get a call from
the doctor's office after you had
testing right like yeah can you bring
ricky into the to the doctor's office we
kind of need to talk to you about some
stuff and like my wife being my wife she
was like yeah no problem it's the first
day of school can we do it maybe like
friday or something no why don't you
come in today and by doctors office we
mean emergency room apparently his blood
sugar was well over 500 when he was
tested and I don't know if you know
about blood sugar ranges but 500 is not
good the average is right around 100 so
yeah anyway he spent the first we
school in the hospital now it is
hereditary they're not sure exactly what
triggers it but it brings up another
case we have a younger son that's six he
just turned six back in May and my wife
is concerned and it's funny now that we
have a meter we're constantly checking
the kid you know it's funny you don't
think of things until you actually have
somebody something happen to you then
all of a sudden Slyke right we got to
check our blood Sugar's all the time you
know things like that but she's worried
and of course if you meet my son you'll
realize that the thought of having to
give him an insulin shot multiple times
a day is going to be a nightmare so that
brings us to gametes and jeans and
through the shared reproductive process
and understanding the processes that we
need to do we need to build our petri
dish so by now you're probably all
asking what are we talking about the day
we do have a talk believe it or not I'm
not just going to sit and talk about my
kids although I can if you want I can
talk about them all day if you've
listened to the podcast you know I do so
what are we going to talk about today
well first we're going to start off with
a brief very brief history of the theory
of evolution you're going to probably
when we talked about this you're going
to say what is this I have to do with
the greater scheme of things but i'll
bring it around trust me i can loop
things around pretty easily we're going
to cover darwin and what he discovered
about evolutionary traits on his voyage
the Galapagos Islands then we're going
to hit a little simple genetics no I'm
not a geneticist but I'm going to do my
best to simplify things so that you
understand what we're going to be
talking about and what we're actually
going to be building last but not least
we're going to actually build things
because what would a talk at early user
conference be without some code right I
kind of feel a necessity to show some
code but i do want to take this one step
further and i want to show you my little
experiment and not just because of the
genetics piece but because of showing
the understanding OTP and how things
interact can actually change the way you
build web are what applications in
general and i think that this is a big
part that especially in the elixir
community right now is kind of being
overlooked erlanger zai
assume most of you earlier how many of
you just use a lick sir and are here and
can't figure out what's going on awesome
here with you now understanding OTP I
think is is pivotal to building better
systems and you know it's one thing to
talk about OTP and things like that but
you know until you actually start
building things with it you don't
necessarily understand it I think Martin
made a good point that he stole from
somebody else and I oh I'm going to
steal from him you know it's until we
actually start building things with it
you don't truly understand it so
evolution was discovered in 1831 the
world in 1831 of course was very
different than what we know now
especially in our understanding of
evolution up until this point scholars
mainly believed in divine design now
Darwin himself studied William Paley's
paper and I'm going to read this because
it's a minimal natural theology or the
evidence of the existence and attributes
of the deity he studied this at
Cambridge but of course as we all know
he had to pivot as most developers do in
1938 are in 1831 sorry Darwin actually
set out on a two-year journey on the HMS
Beagle he was actually self-funded most
people assume that he was a natural son
there but he was not actually the chief
naturalist Robert McCormick was the
chief naturalist now this two-year
journey turned in across to just chart
South America our South American
coastline ended up being five years long
in any Wednesday feature creep it also
sounds like another journey gone awry I
don't know how many of you are familiar
with Gilligan's Island did this totally
okay grab one yay him a round of
applause now the interesting part of the
voyage came when they got to the newly
discovered Galapagos Islands see Darwin
noted that mockingbirds on the islands
varied just slightly from one another
and they all varied slightly from the
same species that were found on mainland
chilly he also noted that tortoises had
different shell patterns / Island now
that's kind of interesting
but these little variations would
suggest that all those species may come
from a single species isolation and
natural selection caused variations for
for emerging species for survival in a
given environment of course this win
against all the commonly accepted
theories not and as we all know Darwin
would come on to publish the origin of
species and really become the father of
what we consider modern evolutional
evolutionary theory now I do kind of
want to pause on this quote for a second
if you've had a chance to read it it's
very interesting when we think about the
strongest species survived now early in
and of itself is very strong and it's
also very intelligent but if we want to
see erlang still being used in 20 years
it's going to have to adapt you're going
to have to bring new people in and
you're going to have to teach them how
to build these systems and use these
systems I think Fred made a good point
in his talk yesterday it's very it's
very different than the point that was
brought up a couple years ago at Erlang
factory in San Francisco where you know
Dave Thomas and Joe say got up and
mentioned it look to build the system to
keep a system alive you actually have to
bring new people in and teach them so
that it moves on and part of the thing
is to start with documentation and
indoctrination into it I think Fred made
a good point and maybe it's taken a
couple years to get there that these
things have to happen you have to be
able to provide documentation and it's
actually one of the things that's really
great several people have mentioned it
with elixir so on two simple genetics
now Gregor Mendel anybody familiar with
Gregor Mendel a few people yes well
you're in genetics talk you're going to
learn about him now he was a monk at st.
Thomas an hour st. Thomas Abby and he
experimented on pea plants and he did
this between 1856 and 1863 now YP plants
are asking does anybody know the answer
oh come on this is like interactive it's
their model organisms now what we mean
by a model organism is it's actually
something that
easy to study and you can reproduce in
laboratory settings other examples are
like fruit flies rats are pretty common
and fungi they're easy to actually study
the behavior in their life cycles are
nice and short so that you can see
things happen in a relatively short
amount of time now at the time Gregor
Mendel was was finding these things out
the common belief was that blended
inheritance is how we got our traits now
if we look at a very simple example of
blended inherence and just take height
for example assuming that each parent is
ones four foot tall 16 foot tall to six
foot tall and then a five foot in a
three foot well that's great if blended
inheritance it's an average of the two
well what happens over just one
generation well now we have 25 26 is two
fours and so on and so on until we
actually the population we would all
look about the same and be all about the
same height and anybody that's walked
the streets understands that no we're
all different so blended inheritance
probably is not well actually we know
it's not the way that we passed rates on
and but what's funny is is we can see
something that looks very similar when
we study small limited sample sizes when
we first run our experiment we're going
to actually only start with two
organisms now we'll have only a few
traits we're actually tracking but we'll
see in a relatively short amount of time
that the genetic makeup actually just
kind of levels out and they all end up
being the same now Mendel focused on
particular traits and that's similar to
what we're going to do where he our
phenotypes traits or phenotypes and he
looked at pod shape pod height and pod
color and he noticed that the variations
weren't always an average and in fact
some of the traits show dominant and
recessive dominant and set our dominant
and recessive inheritance we come up
with a punnett square anybody ever seen
the punnett square before all our
geneticists raising our hands all yeah
so and we can actually see how this is
so we start with our maternal on top and
paternal on the side and we have our
trade they're represented by the large
or big G in this case little why the big
G would be the dominant trait the little
why
would be the recessive trait and this
green and yellow now we have two ways of
looking at this so the when we have big
G big G or even little wide little while
we have homos I got traits and if we
have big G little why or you know I
guess in the case any other trait we
would have heteros a heterozygote traits
that being the reset our that one having
both dominant and recessive traits so in
this case assuming two parents two
parents that have heterozygote rates our
parent organisms the ratio of
heterozygous homozygous barents we would
have fifty percent of the time we would
have green plants or actually 75% of
time we would have true green plants and
then twenty-five percent of time we
would have yellow plans so based on
these two organisms offspring that's the
ratio would be now what happens if we
have a homozygote green and a
heterozygote as i got green yellow one
hundred percent of time we have we have
green plants now this goes back to what
we were talking about about blue eyes so
if you're with somebody that if you make
with somebody that has brown eyes and
you are blue eyed you will pass over a
recessive blue-eyed trait if they have
dominant brown eyes they're always going
to pass over dominant brown eyes if not
they might if they have a recessive
blue-eyed trait they might pass over
blue eyed tree so you have the
possibility of having a blue-eyed child
so we can also look use a Punnett Square
to look at multiple traits at a time and
in this case we're looking at both color
and height with the addition of the big
t little T in this scenario where we
have multiple parents with multiple
traits we actually run into a case where
our population starts to kind of
diversify a little bit but still we have
nine Green Green tall plants three
yellow I'll sum this up for you i'm not
going to make you all do the math or try
to read those yellow three yellow tall
plants three green short plants and only
one yell
short plant now what Mendel came up with
was woods though it's come to be known
as Mendel's laws of inheritance the
first being the law of segregation so
when gametes form that's the traits that
get passed on the gene is actually split
so that only one allele is passed on to
the offspring you don't pass on both you
only pass on one so if you carry a
dominant recessive you're either going
to pass over the dominant or recessive
now the other thing is is the law of
independent assortment just because you
pass over your dominant color doesn't
necessarily mean you're going to pass
over your dominant height it can it's
basically random selection now we also
have the law of dominance that came up
which means that some alleles are
dominant and some are recessive we've
talked about if the gene is dominant
allele that will be the visible trait
that you see now Mendel's experiments
went largely under undiscovered until
about 30 years later this sounds really
familiar story to me somebody did a lot
of work got something going and then 30
years later people like hey look at this
thing we just found nobody's getting the
reference okay so in any case now it's
time to build something so we have a
good understanding of genetics or at
least enough to skate by for right now
now we need to kind of look at this from
the standpoint of how do we want to
build this thing let's lay it all out
there on the table first so we know
we're going to have a petri dish and
that petri dish is going to be a
supervisor and we're going to have
organisms well each organism is going to
supervise several processes including a
biological clock we need a DNA store and
we need a process of reproduction now
we're also going to use handlers to
actually raise that first one we're
going to look at is death because as we
all know as soon as you're born you're
just waiting in line for death such a
bleak talk sometimes that I give this is
like you know depending on the room you
know that I so didn't go over so well
the old folks home it was like
so sorry all right so we're going to
start our petri dish now our petri dish
we go we're going to actually have
organisms we need to add workers for
those are those supervisors we're going
to restart these as transient why
transient well once an organism dies we
don't want it to restart that would be a
zombie so we're going to kind of get rid
of that we're just going to have
transient of transient workers and so
our petri dish is really just a way of
organizing those organisms in there now
let's look at our organisms they're
going to reproduce based on single gene
are single gene inheritance that meaning
the two gametes together are going to
make a new organism and of course this
is different than linked and here are
linked and hair x-linked inheritance
x-linked inheritance is based on whether
or not it's male some traits are passed
certain ways based on male that's way
too complicated for what we're going to
cover right now but we are going to use
a struct to define our organism now I
know in the several talks today you
probably heard about structs how many of
you are familiar with what struck is ok
it's basically children and named map
it's the elixir equivalent to a record I
guess would be what I would go with so
now when we actually start an organism
what we're going to do is we're going to
call a function called create organism
where we're going to pass the gametes
that did that were sent to us over and
we're going to actually start it up by
using the pipe pipe operator we're going
to say take these game mate so we're
going to pipe them through a series of
functions that we've outlined starting
with the define organism Nate we're
going to name our organism because you
know everything needs a name and then
we're going to combine our sizes combine
our colors because remember we're
passing in two sets of traits one from
the maternal one from the paternal now
in this this is where those things are
actually being done now what we do is we
define our organism there's our struct
or Darwin organism we're going to set
the gametes and we're going to give it a
birth time basically we're going to use
that to name our organism and everybody
please hold your tomatoes to throw at me
till the end we're going to actually
generate atoms on the fly
we're gonna put in production no I'm
just kidding so and then what we winter
want to do is we're going to want to
combine as you can see down towards the
lower part we're going to want to
combine those traits because remember
we're getting one one one allele from
each parent we're going to want to
combine those and so that we can
actually populate our DNA now we need
our biological clock because as soon as
you're born you want to know when you're
going to die right everybody does well
we're going to do a random time so that
each organism doesn't actually well I
guess technically it knows but it
doesn't know until this random time is
picked so what most it can live is a
finite amount of time this is going to
get really fun when we start talking
about the speed of reproduction because
yes it is possible that you can
reproduce and be born and not get a
chance to reproduce or only reproduce
once or multiple times depending on the
speed of reproduction of your genes and
then we're going to die as everything
has to happen an organism's life has to
come to an end we're going to actually
raise an event and just say hey I'm dead
you can clear my body from the petri
dish now in our handler we have a death
play annular that we're going to add one
note if anybody's used everybody's used
events notified events and things like
that one key thing to know when you're
doing this is if you're going to have
multiple events and you're just raising
them and letting something listen for it
you have to add that little extra blank
event so that it just keeps going
otherwise everything comes to a dead
stop at the first event handler you add
that's always fun to find out now what
happens here in our event is we're
actually going to tell the petri dish to
go kill this organism and we do that
over here where we just terminate the
child we give it the the organisms pin
and we say hey this one's dead remove it
from the list and you can also see where
we've added as far as down the bottom we
have our gen event or our handlers were
adding them to biological events all of
them are on here but death is the one
we're dealing with now there we have it
we have an organism that can now live
live a finite amount of time and then
die that's pretty boring life then you
get used early you know so next we need
to store our DNA
now agent how many people are familiar
with the what an agent is in a lick sir
anybody that's usually sir is probably
encountered them basically it's a
distraction around Jen server it's a
nice handy way to store data you want to
kind of persist over time there's also
task that we're not going to get into
which is more short-term sort of i've
got to run this one thing and i want to
run it in a process but they're
basically abstractions around jen server
at some level now the agent isn't only
going to what we're going to define is
our DNA store it's not going to only
define our genes for a particular reason
but it's also going to be responsible
for giving us our gametes when it's time
to reproduce so let's look at our DNA so
our DNA store we basically do agent
start link and we pass in the organism
and what ends up happening in this we're
going to set the name is going to be the
name of the the organism we're going to
process that so we can actually store
them we're going to add our DNA if you
look down a ride around here right
around there for you all we're actually
going to add that DNA record to the to
the to the agent and then when it's time
to retrieve the game mate we're actually
going to split pairs split hairs isn't a
thing over here so okay yeah I didn't
see some of my jokes just not going to
go over I just don't know what to do
what I need is it an interpreter I'll
bring Leonhard up and I'll say the joke
and then he'll come can say something
funny and Swedish it'll be awesome
doesn't necessarily have to be the same
joke it just has to be something in
Swedish that's funny the road names
they're awesome I don't know how y'all
come up with this they're like really
long you know it's like and my sorry
quick side story because you know what's
what good's a talk without a good side
story so you know my wife has never
actually traveled out of the country
other than to to Mexico to Cancun okay
come on it's not really Mexico it's the
tourist spot and so everybody pretty
much speaks English and everybody speaks
English here but she's trying to
navigate around the streets and we were
trying to look for a taxi or try to
figure out how to get to where we needed
to go and she's sitting there trying to
type the name of the street for one she
couldn't figure out which one was the
street and which one
they actually I guess his neighborhood
too so it's like street code
neighborhood and she's just typing away
frantically and trying to figure out
where the special characters are because
of course you know her phone is trying
to autocorrect her sorry fun story did
you guys want me to be serious the whole
time sorry I can't do it so anyway so
yeah here's our DNA store and the part
that we want to really focus on is when
we're retrieving our DNA now remember
our laws we need to split them and we
need to split them independently we
don't always give the same one so we're
going to use an enum random to grab one
of the two in the set and we're also
going to set or split them individually
so we're going to look at color speed
which is reproduction speed and size so
we definitely want to split those we
don't want them to be we want them
independent and we don't always want to
give the same one so we can use that and
so now it's on to reproduction we've
stored our DNA weave knit we've now been
born we know when we're going to die we
have our DNA stored logically next is
reproduction so now we're going to add
another biological event for a
reproduction handler and then we're
going to actually have and handle the
reproduction process so the first bit
we're going to do is we're going to take
our biological clock now we're going to
determine the speed of reproduction
based on the traits that are passed in
so the fastest reproductive organism
will be two dominant F's for fast I got
into trouble before when I was saying
they're like well yf2 saw our speed why
not and I was like well because the size
was the other one and so I was like you
know not using the SI use def it's meant
to be fast that's what it's intended to
be now the slowest reproductive organism
it would be two recessive ones so 2 f's
so now if you look what do we got 7.5
seconds or something like that so that's
very possible that you might not get a
chance to reproduce if you're slow
reproducing organism you're very likely
that you're going to get random time and
just never reproduce and then what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
send after reproduce reproduce
wait that's the the if if it's basically
it's a heterozygote meaning it's either
fast fast slow or what we're just going
to go ahead and have this kind of
catch-all that's just going to send
after a random or send after the five
seconds so what do we want to do when we
reproduce we want to raise an event so
we're going to actually send the event
over to our reproduction handler which
is going to tell the gene pool it's
going to add that that set of genes to
the gene pool remember we're using kind
of pea plants sort of thing here so it's
very much like plant reproduction where
we just kind of send the genes out there
we're going to add them to the gene pool
we're going to try to find a match if
not we're just going to kind of float
around in the air until we find a match
and then we'll will reproduce at that
point in time now here's what else
adding the handler to its we've already
gone over that okay so now the we would
need to discuss the gene pool just keep
in mind the gene pool is essentially all
of the environment our genes are kind of
we're plants we kind of throw our pollen
up in the air when the gene pool finds a
match it matches and spawns the handler
this is our gene pool now our gene pool
we're also going to use an agent for
just because it's a nice way to store
some some data more like long-term
storage but the other thing that I want
to know is I want to note at the top of
the screen I don't know if you can see
it there's a modular variable for
fitness this is the ideal organism that
C is supposed to be a G by the way a
green fast reproduction reproducing
small organism when you think about live
a lot of times especially in certain
systems smaller organisms are better off
than larger organisms because they would
need two they would actually need less
resources to stay alive so that gives us
and it gives us a nice little match so
we have we know we want green fast
reproducing small organisms and so what
we're going to actually do is we're
going to if you look down on the gene
pool we're going to win the winning
genes enter the system first we're going
to check for a mate and then we're going
to take action on that mate that's found
now what the take action
means is that the first thing is is if
we don't find a match in the system
meaning there's no other genes in the
gene pool we're just going to go ahead
and add our DNA to the gene pool it's
going to sit there and wait for a match
if there is a match based on the best
match so the first thing is going to try
to do is it's going to say is there one
that matches fitness if the one matches
fitness and that's the one I want to
reproduce what if not just grab one
that's that they're sitting there
floating around here's where we actually
are going to raise our event and we're
going to spawn the organism so we have
now got a match so we're going to take
action on that match we're going to
actually spawn the organism that's going
to raise the event for the spawn handler
which is actually going to tell the
petri dish there's a new organism go
ahead and kick start that process here
we go here's our new organism our new
organism function a function which is
going to start the child link and then
it's also going to raise a notify of a
new organism that one so now the
question is which you're all wondering
does it actually work what we're going
to do I've got this little example code
set up we're gonna actually run this and
so we're going to start with just a 10
set of parents and we're going to put
this it and we're going to see how it
runs so let's see let's see if I can do
this you can everybody see that kind of
good all right so the way this is set up
all right there's our first two
organisms now over time what's going to
happen is is the reproduction rate is
going to go up the more organisms that
enter the system so now I was seeing
actually wow that went quick see with
only two organisms keep in mind there's
different genes in the gene pool so over
time they're going to now they do end up
tend to flatten out at some point if you
notice some of them like the the f's are
almost always the FAFSA because they're
reproducing the fastest so regardless of
the amount of time that it has to live
that's going to reproduce really fast
where you see me I don't know my eyes
are getting old but it looks like we
have a lot of
green fast yeah I think f's have
bottomed out altogether it's just
they're going to be fast reproducing
organisms now before it crashes and I
have to start all over from the
beginning we're going to kill that now
the next step is we're going to and I'll
show you what I'm doing if i can find my
mouse again there it goes actually
before I'd we're going to actually add
more organisms to the system it's weird
i'm looking at this one but i have to go
that way so yeah y'all can't see that
but basically all I did was I added more
over here more organisms to the system
so we're going to run that again get me
over here and see what it looks like now
and we'll see how fat like we had that
slow delay now we should be actually
having a faster response and we should
also have a more diverse population
and there we have it we have organisms
reproducing in a petri dish setting kill
that all right
so and then so we have more organisms
now so what was my point in all this
well there's nothing really here at all
everything existed before elixir anybody
that's used erling for an amount of time
has probably encountered OTP or they're
doing it wrong right well the thing is
is that i leveraged OTP everything's
been around since the mid-90s and really
it was actually even before that but the
thing is is mendel didn't he didn't
invent genetics you know he built on
what was already there he discovered it
he found it he started kind of figuring
out how it worked and started offering
it up as a solution you know Darwin
didn't invent evolution it's not like
something that until Darwin's salat it
was there you know it was there all
along he just started telling the world
about it I know some other people that
are similar to this they built on things
that came before them they did a great
job I love the looks on their faces to I
found this one I was like this is
perfect because we're talking elixir and
they're like really just use darling but
that's the thing and even with even with
a lick sir elixir from the beginning was
all about questioning what was happening
at the time yeah granite josee came from
a rails background a ruby background and
he was having trouble with what was
there and he knew something had to be
better and so he started looking around
and started trying to find new answers
to things he wasn't happy with blended
inheritance you know he what he wasn't
happy with divine design there's
obviously other things that are out
there that may be there if we just
uncover them and look and really the
biggest thing that elixir is done for me
over the last three years is it's made
it about discovery again yeah for the
longest time I was a developer where I
was just rehashing I was doing the same
things over and over again despite
knowing that there's probably something
better and then I found a lick sir and I
realized there's this whole world out
there of other ways of doing things so
what did I do I started a hashtag
so the my elixir status hashtag if you
haven't ever used it before it's really
all about sharing discoveries you want
to talk distributed systems look at the
elixir ecosystem about three years ago
everybody was in these small pockets I
mean I swear at one point in time there
was probably 20 of us you know see Eric
was one of them and you know he was over
here you know I'm in Jacksonville
Florida and you know what Jacksonville
believe it or not is not a you know hub
of Erlang elixir community but that's
the thing is is you know we all
communicated with each other we shared
our ideas and the hashtag was really
meant to represent like tell me what
you're doing you know who else is
working on this and what are you working
on what kind of problems are you trying
to solve and really even with the
adaption or adoption of Phoenix is a new
thing I still question the answers is it
the right way are we building things
better and I think by diving into OTP we
can find out that there's better ways to
build things one of the projects i'm
working on that is still not ready it's
it's out there for public viewing you
can look at it don't hold anything
against me because it's seriously a
prototype but the idea of building a
true OTP application that when you want
to build a website or if you want to
have any other type of functionality you
basically create your application just
like you would any other OPP application
and just raise event to say hey I'm here
and then it's listening and then it adds
your routes and routes to your
particular application and so it's a
single library to handle that sort of
thing but it's completely breaks the MVC
model and goes to the OTP model I think
and I could be wrong in this but I think
that we have everything we need in OTP I
don't think that we need to actually
adopt other other design patterns I
think we can recreate and build better
applications using ATP and it might mean
changes dope TP but i think the
foundation is there now for those of you
that came to see a big genetics talk I
do have some more links for you and some
of the inspiration has anybody ever
heard of gene pool or swimbots I'll
actually show this to you real quick do
I have just a minute ok so gene pool 6
you can actually go to it at swimbots
com it's Java
but it's a really cool application that
you can use let's see if I can pull it
up let me exit this and let's see where
it's going to pop up
why isn't it pop up make sure I don't
have it open somewhere I can't find it
why is it not one to work okay all right
way I'm not going to show it to you it's
a secret but basically what it does is
it gives you a UI to be able to end it
drops a whole bunch of organisms
randomly generated into a petri dish to
gene pool and then you can actually
tweak little things in the environment
you can add more food you can take food
away from the environment you can spread
out the distances between the food but
you can also adjust that Fitness it's a
pretty simple fitness model basically it
says you know you can have organ on
organisms the fittest is to reproduce
based on the most similar
characteristics or the most opposite
characteristics size of the organism
things like that and are influenced the
option now the other thing is and I had
it in the slide is the boxcar to D has
anybody seen this this is pretty cool
this is another case for genetic
algorithms see here alright let's get it
over here on the screen can you all see
this everybody so what it does is it
randomly generates an object and it
actually kind of learns what are optimal
and the whole idea is to get these cars
to race across the screen there's also
one that's a variation of this where it
drops multiple cars and the winner
becomes the new fitness and then all the
cars that are built after that or kind
of mount and you can get in these really
weird scenarios where you get cars like
this that go to nowhere yeah just as a
warning between gene pool and boxcar 2d
if you've got anything you got to get
done that day don't even open them up so
well there you have it that's my talk on
genetics I will leave you with the
boxcar 2d and the other thing is is that
I want everybody to take this away for
if you can take one thing away from this
talk is to go out and explore and
discover new things and change the way
you build applications by building
something you would never build in your
day to day life thank you
