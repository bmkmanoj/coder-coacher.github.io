people it will have come in and have a
lot of food because I love walks with a
lot of food
I think there's places at conferences
for talks of all types but I like lots
of code I was going to do this as a lot
of any talk I had one of thousands of
times about how last boutiques for you
ever do it
Angra me demo Cosimo I listened to those
people submitted this is a lot better
talk but lovely attitude in 40 minutes
I did three versions of this talk a few
user groups and they weren't I boxed the
first time I gave them a version of it
it took me eight minutes till after
midnight so I thought okay this is this
is indifferent so thankfully there's
plenty of time that point to rework it
sorry works a lot and I gave it another
user group and so this time it took
eight minutes so finally I had this huge
insight into how I can reduce the time
substantially I just stopped
test-driving it all together so I've got
a lot of effort in doing that reworked
it changed it a ton it took eight
minutes
so since to them and everyone after me
they were forgive me if I took eight
minutes we can you didn't wear dresses
and a lot coding but we're gonna walk
through the build early it's a repo on
github and which can walk through the
commits in the order debts or they
happen since I've mentioned Merc I
figured his cap and now the way is
working to the violence Hawk and I've
got time to go to exercise to get
through some of them know
can't pause alright so um real snot I
guess just rap numbers going on and you
know the big new feature is essentially
a crappy version of each channels
contacts of people reusing them clean
those channels for this project because
they're also I love Reynolds I still
read it because it often but there's no
way I'd know the same thing in read I've
done multi-threading things every before
and I don't want to do them anymore so
Phoenix though is really really nice for
building web socket based accident it
also saved me from having to build all
kinds of things
in node.js and that's great because
javascript is gross so before we take
off the axe will talk a few links so
first of all I mentioned all this go
doesn't get up and you know the body's
convinced were are there in order this
talk really is just walking through that
repo next I mean the solicitors have
sting our core videos of myself learning
about elixir that they go about a year
and a half and people pay me for access
to them and if that's not the feeling
you like awesome and then finally on the
CTO of my snow globe we're a software
consultancy and we'd love to help you
the project to be involved and so now I
plugged my company and I've justified
less hitting the younger so let's get on
with code and do just Yelp me or
something if I'm moving too quickly I
have to talk fast if you go to boxing
star method
anyway the first step in our journey is
just we build a basic new Phoenix
application the only modifications we
made to the bog-standard
Phoenix new is we modified page indexed
to be a single pin canvas off
so remember house that javascript was
gross good because there's a non-trivial
amount of in the talk here some of it so
here just in the 2d context to the
canvas is this this is reading right
this is possible okay so here we're just
getting it to be context on the kids and
then we're building the object called
app that we have a few functions on so
we build a function called rough edges
and it just kind of sets up this fake
state and then draws board which right
now has an extra trouble right it it
logs a nice protective concept so so far
this is not rocket surgery but it gives
us some kind of framework to work with
the biggest thing to grab here is as
Chris mentioned we had a PSX by default
and so this is the first time I'll set
up like an ember application that I've
used again sakes
and it's really enjoyable so we're going
to look at the application as we go
through it so bear with me
all right so
this is a partial finished
okay so look at the console yeah
we're drawing stuff okay so we start
gratification okay so now we actually
want to actually do something might
actually draw and not to try some text
to the console so let's do that so here
we've mapped out what our game will look
like from the JavaScript side there are
only two components as far as the
JavaScript rivers concern there's the
current board and there's whatever
length pieces so you can imagine our
back-end continually updating the data
structure and the client rhythm again so
that's almost all the client has to do
if you look at the board you can see it
consists of a bunch of zeros the herbs
activities faces and a one direction the
component of the all pieces right so
there's an element even six ones so can
you imagine how boring this would mean
to watch me okay so next we passed the
drawing from context and staked into a
draw
so this function just Charles the board
and it draws the next piece it's easy
enough to see drawing the board consists
of drawing a frame around the board and
then just drawing the board as like an
array of pitches only that I'm really
can spread that bigger blocks starting
according to 0 0 so here you can see
drop it's already this is just loops
over
sort of two-dimensional ray finds
whatever's inside that position and then
if it's a zero the new thing and
otherwise it drawls based on the number
it draws a square so I could cut that a
wine as I do anyway drawing the frame
just consists of drawing some lines or
the boundaries of the board or game
structure and yeah I mean that's not
that exciting it's another couple of or
statement right this is not very hard
in fact that we can do girls where does
so is past the context a coordinate pair
in a brush and it kind of blows those
things up into 25 pixel squares then it
draws them on the canvas using whatever
brush you passed it and the brush is
just an RGB value and so you can see
that this brush for function takes like
names like the board the ill-fated of
the dream shape and just returns the the
color that they should be and then
finally there's a little convenience
function that maps I get a number to the
shape name give away this but I think it
may be a function of heart rate so we
make this all basic so let's go ahead
and get see what it looks like in action
this is
so
oh my god right like this is this is
tetris we're done so this is the bar
that's okay so we've got that that
they'll be stalling you know the next
piece was gonna be except the pieces of
falling they gave us static tonight
shaking again so we want to do is open
up a web socket that's server and then
we're just gonna have the server
synthesis of these two pieces of
information and then every time we get
the new game state we'll just call this
draw and constantly refresh that so
that's pretty simple as opposed for
almost entirely done with JavaScript now
I move on alright so next we introduce
is just a basic Phoenix channel we're
gonna often use this channel send
updates down but for now it's just
almost on so here's a very basic Phoenix
channel to some or the game interactions
and it basically write all it does is
that
and channels were good that way to get
to it so they had a route to the router
and then in our JavaScript file we go
ahead and connect to the socket Tony
look
once we successfully connected we're
going to log to the console just so we
have a like yeah the connection work and
so let's go ahead and do that and make
sure that we can see it working in the
rest
get back together the chain so things
looking good
so next we want to have the channel
provide the market so right now we've
got mock data it's part coded national
script rather than marketing at the
JavaScript you're gonna our code into
the the elixir side is pushing right so
first of all we're just gonna send a
message at all to the client so we want
to push our message to the stock that we
do on the channel Chris mentioned that
their main to make changes they haven't
seen the Lipton and this is also Chris
so basically once somebody connects we
send ourselves an appetite message then
we handle that message and we push down
that socket the Texas state which right
now is the safety map disorders in the
state and
anybody not gonna show you that here
because there's not a lot to see so the
JavaScript is still really some fake
data at this point so we're gonna fix
that we're gonna send we're just going
to move that data into the into the
channel so here's the channel right this
is just the exact same data literally
copied with it but anyway so yep now the
counselor changes to use this we get rid
of the Mafia and inside of here when we
get the petrous that state are the
devastate event we lot available and
so so now the JavaScript is you know
extra stupid it doesn't know if draw and
the Phoenix application tell us what to
do so this is like a nice foundation for
for every next we're going to add a
separate process that we run to handle
connecting that on this channel to the
racket so for now I won't be able to be
a separate process that sends this
message to our connected web socket and
we'll build up from there so here we
spawn all we do is respond to function
I started we spawned a process running
that function and then over here for
graduate right right so again I just
moved this big chunk of static data over
to a different to different month this
module will ultimately be responsible
for rendering our game to the WebSocket
and it will just send these messages for
people so obviously again this very
basic refactoring that's good
and for a little bit all you're going to
see is that I changed some code and
nothing is different you know there's
above this commit guys alright so we're
gonna do now is we're gonna send that
work to repeatedly to the website so
what's gonna happen is that website
across the satsang it's going to ask
whatever the running game does which
doesn't exist yet that's gonna say what
report look like and then it's going to
get back these two bits of data and it's
gonna send that to the browser
repeatedly and then that just gonna call
that trial function so this is every
week we've set a removable under
milliseconds and then we send ourselves
a tick message on that so this is the
WebSocket process that respond and just
sitting itself this message over and
over and over again and then we put it
into loop and every time it receives the
message it pushes that off but this is
that same data down the now the channel
and then it just moves right and for
good measure we output the standard out
so that it's clear this actually called
since there are no results are not going
to change until later so we will run it
this time total work
and so you can see it's been getting
some there and then they look it's the
exact same thing over and over again
but if you can see also
it looks pretty much like it did in you
know commit to but we're pushing the
implementation details in it okay so
enough of a stuff we also want to have
an actual game across this room so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna faking a
process so for now with some enjoy the
channel we're going to spin up a new
Texas game and we're gonna pass that
game into the WebSocket processor spawn
so yeah game time at the web stack
process that's talking to the browser
over here and that WebSocket process can
ask the game hey what do you look like
the river so easy now if we started
getting we pass it into the WebSocket
background function okay so the Texas
game module is just one more place to
show this part could a game state now so
my process here game con yet is to
gradually push the lower lower lower to
the finds itself a nice
again sir where it's going to change
over time so let's see how the WebSocket
process changes now and it's a basic
right the only difference from what you
saw before is the call tetris that game
now gets paid and we're passing at the
game right now this isn't even anything
useful because if you look it doesn't
give it right they'd always render this
board but this gives us a ship to begin
to look like a dancer okay so yeah this
this module has in a very small
consulate all it does is talk is give
the state of the website so that'll
change from the important in users one
of you I'm not going to my breath this
time I'm supposed to with whatever
next we introduce instructs the whole
thing game states so what you know that
this is where rather than just having
market of data about what the board
looks like we start to have a slot of a
concept of what you what is a game of
tests so we we into this truck right now
it's very sparse still and we return
that state we return that done from the
start function so now we're returning a
Tetris game stick show and then here get
state is actually extracting some data
off the struct and turning it into this
for the data line this actually bad
design this should
but that's not I did so really and like
imagine you know this still it's not
separately running process or anything
but model if so that it kind of looks
like one right so you call start on that
you get back to topple the pest okay and
then like something and then you pass
that thing into the gate state function
and you get data so this work kid rather
than instruct the in use really care so
we're gonna have to change our usage of
this model and that's that's just a nice
thing to do we can refactor okay so the
next thing we're going to do is we're
finally actually gonna change the game
to be a gender so like I mentioned from
the context and they call into the
public API still just start and get
state but this exactly agents are gonna
and so when we call when we handle at
all get state and we pull the board and
the next all of the state the state is
our struct right there and we replied we
give this as our response to get state
home but we don't change the thing we
keep our state say anyway look like I
said it's you know it's nice that we can
move from this thing that wasn't a
process to this thing that's backed by
process and the caller doesn't care if
we're using concurrency to give them
what they're asking for not so now we
introduce a module that's going to know
about all of the tension shapes so we
finally get to the point we're actually
doing attention see things I think so we
don't want to specify the pixel array
for the next piece you know what you
know the the concept of the running game
we just want to say like there's an elk
coming up so amount of our game state to
use an atom to the value of next and
then when we send a state for injury we
get the pixel array for what that shape
would be at the zero location and so
that that comes from the change model
and so let's look this change lock again
it's it's a student to refactor we
pretend
we know how to get all these chains and
rotations right but again they're
sparkling today for now and this is just
my it's hard to keep things in your head
right so it's very easy for me to just
like make really stupid refactorings and
just push the little bitty things
perfect out the stack until I actually
have something so I'm gonna go run it's
still not gonna look any different but
it's doing more to look the same all
right so that's a thing
this oh yeah anyway so next we need to
fill out the Chiefs motor so that's not
a stupid thing that's only notice that
talk about punchy and we need to start
overlaying your current piece on the
board so right now the board includes
like the concept of the current leaf all
of these it just like slapped into that
mix already they were doing that that
that has to go away because you know
it's kind of move anyway
so forgive the formatting of the slider
but and I can fit it all in this way so
this is really stupid
I'm using model attributes to just like
layout it's very clear that these are
the tension tries there's a jig there's
an S it just look like Tetris shapes and
then I've got the perfect function that
we're importing from the Tetris rotator
and it's it's a pretty stupid thing also
the distance have given some pixel right
fabricated in 90 degree notes and that's
so that we can at compile time generate
this this map that just says like here
are all four possible rotations of all
of the chains that you learn or worry
about because we don't want me like
doing this time we don't forget it's the
same freaking thing every time
and and then here's the rest of the
module it's we've got a way to get a
given shape a given rotation pattern on
time I've got a way to get the width or
the height of the energy
patient really trivial stuff we've got
some mappings between names and numbers
so you know earlier we had an elderly
consisted at once so this one actually
says like draw a yellow pitiful
so this way we can kind of keep track of
what's what going either way and that's
really losses and also when you get a
random a random shape so that's that's
the homeless model and this is terribly
difficult but there you've seen it all
an irrigator model again this is nothing
particularly fancy we've got basically
this kind of funky little nested pair
for conventions that sort of traverses
one way across one image to the array in
the other way across the other image of
the array and that that turns into a 90
degree rotation it's up I don't know
that it's easy to see here but and then
all our other like we're taking about
earn a degree just consists of overtaken
by lightning twice right so this is easy
and they're determined by something else
I just I throw heresy and then they've
updated the game state to include a few
more degrees they just had bored and
next now it also includes the car keys
the car keys of rotation its accent it's
white worth it
and then we have a way to get cells for
the shape so this is just a way to say
like what are the coordinates on the
work where the same presently
overlaps the node and it returns a a
list of 200 toggles for that smart
worthless so now our game we fill out
the state a little bit more so now you
can see we've got the board it's empty
when you start off the next pieces and
now all the current pieces about our
carbocation is here oh it's at 5 and 0
exoarmor respectively and then we call
this function house so the only other
thing that's changed is when we send our
state to the caller
we just overlay the shape onto the board
and the position is supposed to go and
obviously we don't have to change our
can you do that because that's not what
happens
and so here's how I was pushing the
current piece onto the board so
basically the air over the board in a
couple for convention and then it's the
current position if the if the current
position in the scan that were in
contains part the shape we we pushed
that part of the state's number how that
partition number onto the board so
that's that's really good and so we can
see this in action and this is where we
can actually start to see it look like a
Tetris game is important so to start
with it is not going a little different
but we'll fix it okay so that's the same
thing but then if we go back here let's
just come here and Tetris game and we
will say here current state our car
pieces like an S and inside when it's
further down four
and now okay so we're like 44 slides in
and this is kind of the halfway point
and it's starting to look like again so
that that's nice so now we're gonna make
that these fall down every tick in the
game clock so this is a component of
temperature at the piece falls so we do
this again by using Airlines timer
module to send ourselves a take message
every half an hour requested second and
then we handle that with any limb
function head so we're just sending
there to the server the message - and
then every time it gets the message to
tick it's going to increment the state
y-component bug line so and then
actually update state so that's easy you
have to do also in this communication
off pile hair in the JavaScript but
we're
so if it did it right yeah
it would be spalling so this is this is
basically Petrus of course some it's
gonna keep falling doesn't that part
anyway
so now we're gonna have key word
incorrect so we're gonna mock our game
that's what an England podcast so it's
just got a public API for a little bit
and you give it an input and this is
just a hammer and then what it does is
it it's not a reply that it's cast and
then modify the state by returning
whatever the interaction England of the
function returns so let's look at this
interaction module partner so here we've
got an interactive module if it has a
cable input function and the first thing
it does it just defers to this other
function called do Panama code this is
important later pronounced of Burgos and
then we gave them two minutes right we
have on the right and left this is
addressing the bug that I introduced is
commanding okay those are different
there should be different okay so that's
all right image so if you ask me even it
doesn't know about it just doesn't
change anything right in return the
state that you passed it if you give it
a fit it knows about the base the state
ever turns a newspaper so now that we
need to look at how to get support end
of events on the channel and so in order
to send input it into the game we need
the pin for the juicer so here we're
starting the game and then down here
actually assign to the socket this is
anything
with sockets we're signing to the
sockets can keep the vid so then later
when we have event we can fetch what it
is on the socket and then we we can send
to the end so sorry pointed that out
with slides negative here so here we're
just lying JavaScript the gospel
application send in a JavaScript object
that perhaps an event to an event date
and past the event name in to handle it
and actually better than when happened
don't don't do that because you know
that's that's a big ol DDoS somebody
used all your memory but it's really
convenient it's given a talk okay so
once we've joined the channel we're
gonna buy the Windows key event many
this is JavaScript because if you didn't
like reporting so presently no matter
what you push we're just going to push
the booth right ahead to the channel and
so let's go ahead
okay so that's sadly it moves all
screaming for them but we have keyboard
handling right so that's nice
it's getting ever closer to becoming a
game so now we're gonna introduce moving
left that's a big feature as well as in
terms of had the map in our browser
actually seen a dimensions so first off
choosing the direction you can move so
here's the JavaScript again it's just
another case statement trying to pass
the guard forgiving him and we get some
string out and that's the action to
bring us simple stuff and also fix my
little snake food and interaction module
so it's not always moving right so if we
try this one out we can move both
directions
okay so now we'd be able to make enemies
so bring a lot of the up arrow tip
apiece and so here's the interaction
logical change right and just edit a new
clause for rotation clockwise and all
that does is it you know Mozilla for
increases the rotation by the state and
here's the JavaScript again a trivial at
this point or we can see in action
BAM all right so it's a ever close
report which will have no boundaries in
an exciting to this and I into this and
we can all see it but it's going to at
least keep it from going past the bridge
so now you can see why we defer to
handle input think terminal input so
basically we're gonna hear this we're
getting what the new state would be
after angling the input and then if the
new state would yield something valid
state we just don't return it right we
return the original state because a
validation check and so that makes it
pretty easy to just start finding what a
talent status right so if X is less than
zero it's not bad if this thing passes
the right side would work it's a it's
not that pass the rest on the board just
means say look it's the width of the
current shape plus like the current X is
greater than equal to because we know
the board is 1010 Y so now we should be
able
pass the word if it's either place
either right let's look at
and you have trust me that I'm actually
trying but I can be saving this and if
that works no matter how located so
that's nice
of course again we're still falling past
the edge so now I wanted to actually
when it hits the bottom of the board
just stick right so what does it mean
mr. de right it just means bring the
permanently switch that piece where it
was so here we introduced the functional
the slightly increased bit of a logic
but nothing is still very complicated
than this at all so if there's a
collision for the bottom of the board we
update the board to include the overlay
shape and then we pulled the next shape
along with the current shape we said x +
y - 5 - 0 there's a bug here I should
also set the rotation of the zero
I don't and then we have eight next to
be a random shape otherwise we just draw
it like we did before so this is this
happens at the point that the people
would be dropping and the inclusion of
the bottom looks very much likely
oversized it right if the height plus
the wise is greater than 19 anyway
there's also a bug in JavaScript at bay
so you won't see it but if you remember
we were if if the position was zero on
board we just did nothing in the
JavaScript so this meant that we didn't
clear it so like the piece were just
like much various places
sorry that's actually on the next
because we're drawing the next piece the
next piece
you would still have your image to be
shown as well and they just kind of be
blended you know so that's not terribly
important tell me so let's see it
actually hit the bottom okay
most of the talk by way just watching
this hellhole
whoa yeah yeah of course there's a there
issues
so for instance it doesn't care that the
other yeah so hey so next we're going to
we're gonna have a collision of that
work he's just when falling so we should
have to check to see if the next step
would even collision with a nonzero cell
on the work if it because you build a
collision we take the next step right
we've heard if it does we do what we're
doing for the collision the bottom we
just wish to check on them and then to
see if there's a collision with the
board we just say do any of the next
coordinates intersect with the sorry
does the does the cell and the next
board has contained something other than
zero so that's that and then this
satellite function is very simple but I
want to overcome deepness so you pass
the state and XY thoughtful can will
just return whatever was there I'm so
that's right and look at this
so now it was following these watches
and now we have collision and it should
stop all these things oh okay now one
thing we don't do was the show make sure
your one case we won't handle yeah so
you know they actually gave us collision
with is falling so I can I think we're
still not at Texas so let's go to handle
that walk so here's that change a lot
like that it changed slightly simpler
because previously on the teach change
man said I wasn't gonna look like press
here we just defined that it would be in
talent right if there was a collision
with the board then it would be a valid
state but this is essentially the same
thing and so now we can't give anymore
and I wanna skip Chile has this you can
imagine that we were unable to do that
alright so we were hard coding the next
to the current shape previously so we're
gonna stop doing that
preparedness
okay so here we're calling shapes not
random to get random shapes for a game
so previously these must have helped now
that just shaken I call the shape time
writing this is obviously important but
it's not so obvious like if you come to
another language and you you know you
can't call random and you get random
values because that's what you want
before you call random you have to see
the random number generator and you have
to do that in the process that's making
the cost of a random walk so here in our
start function we call random not seed
and then down here everything should be
good right and seeded so let's see an
engine so that's a go ahead starting the
game up and running apparently
all right so cool these are both elegant
so let's just refresh it and see the
random pieces because his granny pieces
right so remember when I said that I
gotta see within the process this is not
that process this is the public 8 so
this is I made this mistake curvier than
when I did this long ago when I first
heard of this so we see that the random
number generator in and when you see the
random number generator and girly
frantic model he puts the seed in
increments to see in the process
dictionary so the process dictionary is
obviously as you might guess process of
civic so the fact that we see that the
RNG in that process doesn't do anything
in the new process that we spawn right
so England so that's how can work we'll
fix it and fix it by we move that call
to seed down into in it right so that's
the public API this is that for
happening in the process so this is a
thing to just just think about what
you're doing just first and so that was
easy and we'll go ahead and see it's
actually the randomization
area
and the different pieces that's nice all
right so the next thing to do really you
know we're colliding with the pieces
were climbing the end we're sticking
when we come on but we want experience
when we take the game right if we felt
that in decline hold on here like you
know we got our Texas and nothing
happens the lot of sticks around so
we're going to delegate to a function on
the statement that knows that clear
lives so right here when we get our
board with our blade shape then we're
going to go ahead and clear lines and we
will get that state that have clearing
applied to it and then we're gonna use
that for our mistake rather than just a
little change thing anyway so it's going
to look what that clear lines motion is
like so this suckers got some meat to it
a little bit so first of all PI over 180
public function so he passed in the
state you get back the same state that
the board has been updated to include
whatever clear lines this three or any
function returns and this is got a
couple of little accumulators that
as empty lists and anyway this is just a
recursive function it iterates through
the lines in the work so it grabs the
first one in the board if it's parable
then you know key place that line
everyone cleared accumulate if it was
not variable then it puts it back in you
know sort of the border people and then
once we're done we'll have a board like
you know I forget if we cleared for line
we'll have a board that has 42 lines
right and so then we shove we shove were
empty lines at the top the board and
then that's it
so that's all the steering air boiler
okay so let's let's tear on this is
gonna take some time this fall something
into something it's also going to change
the tranquilizers so how much fun is
watching somebody play really slow get
attention so here also the browser is
now too too little so I'm getting a
movement guys we're gonna clear that
second one huh
we've got tested
I selected this if we wanted to actually
get the you know to school we're not
rats for UNICEF in attendance but if you
want to do this would be the place that
you would return like how many lines
were in the clear
bit over here and then the thing that
caught their mother would use that
updates yeah so that's it for getting
tests working and this problem anybody
verify that this is my public happy one
second because I need to do that before
starting anybody that wants to take that
video and so ignore of that put 100
there so people not gonna need help
anybody the laptop connect to this and
I'll get it running so that you can at
least play your you're one player game
Tetris instead of a contingent sorry
it's a 100 and it's for 4,000 so follow
me was doing that it's been bothering me
the the next piece has always been drawn
the same color rather than the animal
color piece this is easy to solve so we
multiply each cell in the next twenty
list
so basically previously we just include
we just returned to this Jade stuff yet
right now we're going to pipe that into
this progress motion and it takes the
next pieces name and it gets the number
of that name and it multiplies it by
whatever was in that column that column
is either 0 or 1 so this just works and
it gets us to the poverty and so really
nobody else can play it this is going to
be miserable I suppose I better check
that actually didn't consider we can
show it as collaborative so this is
pretty pretty unpleasant to be honest
anyway so one thing that we can at least
show right this is using the red color
for the next piece now and it's not
cloud that's the next little piece to
show although apparently I can't
actually have anyone play it which is
visual huh I got
we can do this people we have technology
to our hospital pass
all right so the new password is elixir
humph and I'm going to turn it on you're
going to see a hot spot available called
changer in its kth drawing and I'm gonna
switch to how about it on time I'll get
ten minutes right
I have women my attendance is no good
alright sir let me my favorite real
quick we can do this table about anybody
able to connect I can I'm sorry IP
address is it's not you know I didn't
connect
well I think that's there's no escaping
the nipple cops I will let me show you
what the Platte River bit is and this is
this is super super frustrating because
I was really excited by getting people
potentials together okay so it's going
together so the only piece left to do is
to make the game clatters right every
time someone joins it starts App Engine
server right and then the website are
going to Berger gets that chance to rest
into it so instead what we're going to
do is when we start we're going to add
these two functions to the main Texas
model so we started getting when we
start it and all starting it without a
lot happens may work
alright so uh-oh it's not connecting
because that comes up all that many
fixes okay so the lipstick on okay so we
basically started getting rich to the
process and then we have this free
Stargate much and so hold on I can give
you an idea to this mail all right so my
IP address is right there so it's one
92168 43 not 184 and it will be running
on 4000 so one not two once they say 43
184 people are connecting possible okay
so I'm gonna kill it them because I've
got to check out this unit okay
okay so now we have a clogger game of
Tetris I'll show you one less palatable
changes while everybody connects the
place with each other
okay so this is the only other change
that we have to make so basically
instead of using the the game that we
created we just passed in the atom game
which is that register now that rich
food processor and so now everyone's
metric about the same game is it working
is it is a horrible claim if you don't
like each other
okay so this is I don't know how you're
doing it so all this would be a lot of
fun
