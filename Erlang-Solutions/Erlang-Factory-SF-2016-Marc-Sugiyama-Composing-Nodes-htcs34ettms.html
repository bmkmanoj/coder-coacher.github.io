senior architect at airline solutions
and i'm going to talk about how we can
design our applications and designer
applications in such a way that they're
more easily composed in two nodes so
that you can decide sort of at the last
stage when you're building the release
which applications are included in in a
node so to do that I'm just going to
start with a quick review of the sort of
the building blocks that the OTP release
management system gives us to do this
I'll talk a little bit about the what I
mean by a distributed application and
the challenge is there to provide some
of the motivation for why I started
thinking about this then how the
applications are designed to be able to
compose it to be composable into nodes
and then just a couple of examples that
we did that were for the project I was
working on last year for a company
called Infoblox it was a open source
project called I got us where we started
coming up with this idea to make it a
little bit easier for us to do our proof
of concept work
so just to start with up some background
information about the OTP releases will
sort of start from the bottom up
although all the bits and pieces so as
you know you organize your functions
into modules right in Erlang and that
processes are going to use the use code
that's in one or more of those modules
in the application and in OTP applicant
an OTP application and an application
unfortunate is a very overloaded term so
what I'm talking about when I in the
slides and when I say an OTP application
I'm referring to the the concept of
application that coming out of the OTP
framework right so that's an which is a
which they define as a collection of
modules and processes so it's this this
entity that usually has one source tree
right and has a dot a PP file right
that's that's what an OTP application is
yeah so that application is going to
provide some sort of service for the for
the the release or the system as a whole
and some people have started thinking
the micro service is this new term
that's floating around and some people
say well maybe applications these
applications are kind of like little
micro services but they provide some
service through a public API and I'm
going to use the API term fairly loosely
it's not just I don't mean just in terms
of Erlang functions that can be called
but also things like messages that come
in and out or maybe a network protocol
it opens a network connection and is
expecting or expect expecting requests
to come in over a network there are
applications that have no processes at
all and those are just libraries and
that's that's perfectly valid to butt in
here way so we have an OTP application
so usually what defines that is that it
has some top-level supervisor that
starts all the workers worker processes
and then the application also knows
about all of the code that's inside of
it
and finally the application has a list
of other applications that is dependent
on right so all applications depend on
standard lib and Colonel but other
applications they might depend on
amnesia or lager or what have you right
so there's this there's this dependency
tree that can that gets built the
applications themselves we bundle into a
release what we and I'm going to call
that an OTP release and the slides to
try to make it a little bit clearer that
not like a release of the whole system
and release is essentially what we mean
by an erlang node right so you bundle
all the software into a release that's
the thing that you then launch that's
running the virtual machine has all your
code in it releases are really cool
because they are completely
self-contained once you build the
release you can pick up the whole
directory put it somewhere else it just
runs and when you configure the release
what you tell the release manager is
that you tell it the list of
applications that you want to be
included in that release and the release
manager then looks at the dependencies
first and make sure that all the
dependencies are available right so if
so they're either system applications so
that it already has in the sort in its
release its tree or they are other
applications that you've provided right
makes that dependency check then it
makes sure that it figures out which one
needs to be started first so that
they're all they're all started in the
correct sequence so when a when your
application runs you know that
everything that you're dependent on is
already running right now sort of
outside the context of the the OTP and
the and and the Erlang is the idea of a
it's the repository right so this is
where we've put all of our source code
right and it's where we've put all of
our configuration for the release and
applications and what and what it seems
to be happening what seems to happen to
lives when we build our projects is that
we blend together the sort of the OTP
application and the release that we need
in order to actually use it right so for
example if you're building maybe like a
cashing service right you'll have your
your source directory which has got all
the code in it that's implementing your
cash it might list some dependencies
that you're relying on like network
libraries for your client libraries for
Redis or what have you but then it also
you'll also have a release directory or
at least configure the release in that
same repository for creating the node
that will run that application right so
the downside of this is that so the
upside of this is that you've got this
one thing that's got your code and you
got the way to run it and you can just
in one place build and you've got your
your release that you can pick up and
deploy the downside is you you've now
got this code to implementing your cache
say that it's kind of trapped in that
one node right in other words you can't
easily sort of pick up that code and use
it as a library in some other project
right because of the nature of the way
that the the rebar dependencies work and
the way that it's been organized into
the repository so that's what this talk
is basically about is about how to do
this this separation but just sort of
looking back at the complete hierarchy
is what we've got is the beam files or
the basically the source code bundled
into applications the applications are
then organized into a release and some
of the applications might be part of the
same repository or they might be
dependent applications so they're being
drawn in as dependencies from other
other repositories again like something
like lager write something that's shared
and then the sort of gray area of the
greyed out area on the top and the left
is meant to say that those are the bits
that are in a particular repository 11
repository
and then we take what's in that
repository we build the release so that
we can get a node that we can run right
it's are pretty clear yeah okay alright
so we've built our application we've got
our nodes running and then we you know
we it's actually part one part of a
larger distributed application right
where when I mean by a distributed
application that you have a maybe in
this in this diagram each of the boxes
is meant to be a node maybe you've got
some connection handlers you've got
something that manages state there's a
cash there's other services that are
running and they're all running in
different nodes right in order to say
maybe have better load balancing or to
spread the load out or two or to have
some redundancy in case of failure right
so the so we could see how you would
have say a separate repo for each of
these different different pieces okay so
this is good but my experience has been
sort of doing testing and de buttoned
debugging in a environment like that it
can be pretty challenging right because
in order to do anything you have to have
all the pieces running right and then if
you say have a request that come you're
trying to debug what happens say 11
request one kind of request comes in you
have to then sort of trace that request
around the network maybe add you know
turn on tracing in the tracing or some
sort of debugging in all the nodes and
then look around and see where the
messages are you know where what's
actually happening in each of the pieces
and try to correlate them all together
and that's that can be pretty
challenging so it'll be really nice is
if we could be able to sort of run
everything all together right even
though that they're there when we deploy
it they'll be separate we can run them
together well we'll get to that the
other thing is that again because of the
way
the the repositories are structured it
makes a little bit more difficult to
share the code right you can't easily
take a take a piece Satan's one way take
a piece out of the you know the
connection code and maybe use it in the
sessions or so advice' universe
versatile right you can't easily so if I
take a chunk out and move it from one
place to the other because of the
because you can't use one as a
dependency of the other because they're
releases they're not just they're not
applications simply applications and
finally because we've we've because
we've sort of preordained what
applications are running on each of
these nodes we can't rearrange them and
say well turns out you know we've got
two different kinds of services and you
know the the workload is such that
actually makes sense maybe to combine
them into a single into a single node
because neither of them is really busy
enough right so again what we really
wanted to be able to do is sort of pick
up our applications and move them and
put them anywhere we want in the nodes
and arrange the compose those
applications into the nodes and in an
arbitrary way so like I said it can be
so like I said it would be really nice
for say doing testing and development to
be able to just combine all of those
things into one node right so once it's
in one node you have just one shell
where you can do the tracing of all the
different functions that might be
handling the request achar trying to
understand right so and then if we it
would be great if we can you know more
easily share the applications around and
we compose the nodes in order to sort of
balance out that about be be able to
rebalance the workload between the nodes
okay
so that was the motivation so it turns
out what we need to do isn't really that
much right I mean the system was
designed to be able to have these
composable applications it you know the
the the whole idea was that you the holy
fact that reason they're called
applications right is so that you could
load them and have them you know load
them and deploy them into ER line nodes
so they are intended to be sort of these
independent things that have these AP is
that we talked to so but what's helpful
is to basically follow good design
practice right we want it we want the
the applique OTP applications to be they
should be single purpose they should
have very well-defined boundaries right
so you don't want them sort of two
applications kind of leaking information
back and forth between themselves the
the API should be fairly clear to you
know what the entry and exit points are
and we should understand how the
applications are dependent on one
another right so that we know what that
dependency tree is ok any questions
right
and then so so that's what we need to do
sort of on the application side again
it's not it's not a lot but what we
really the real challenge is to sort of
is to separate the OTP application from
the release its that's using it right we
don't want to put the two things
together in the same repository and what
that means is that we end up with a
separate repository for each of our
applications and then we end up over
with a repository for what's essentially
the node configuration right so will
will will have a application will have
all the applications sitting in their
own repository so that they can be used
as dependencies of other applications
and as we'll see we can use that
dependency mechanism to do the
composition of the nodes okay so in the
application repository what we do is we
just don't do the release in there and
and what we want to do is rely on the
rely on the repository we create for the
node to to build the release but we and
we still list all of the dependencies of
the application as we always would right
so if an application depends on amnesia
or whatnot and that's what we would and
the we would still we would still do
that
now on the for the the interesting part
is in the repository for the node so
here what I did was I created
essentially a empty application in the
in that repository and then built a
release around it right so the
application basically didn't do anything
but what it does what it does do what I
did what you do with you what you what
you do is you list as dependencies of
that application all the applications
you want to include in that note that
you want to sort of compose into that
node right so that when you generate the
release when you built rather when you
when you grab the dependencies you'll
suck in all the code from the
repositories that are those applications
you will build the release around them
the release handler will automatically
start them all right so you don't have
to do anything special and then then
you're all set right so the only thing
that you have to make so the only thing
you might need to think about at that
point is are there any sort of
configurations that are now specific to
that node right that that particular
composition right because maybe there is
something special about it that it needs
to be configured in a different way than
if it was just running one thing there
is also possibly the idea of there being
a master application on that node and by
that i mean not like a controller but
that there is a sort of an application
that this sort of blank this empty
application might need to hold on to
some of the private files that the other
applications rely on I had a option when
we get to the examples in one of the
examples we wanted to put the private
files in the some private files in the
print directories that was
closely associated with the the release
them with the application that they were
actually coming from and so we needed to
be able to tell that that build process
where where to put the print files the
print directory where the the
application name of the of the sort of
the top-level application the one that
was connected to the release okay
so the the structure then becomes a
little bit different where we have a git
repository that's holding on to
essentially just the the release and
that's what we use to generate the nodes
then there are separate repositories for
each of the applications that are then
you pull in as dependencies of the of
the of the the release and there are
still dependent applications that are
coming from elsewhere right that need to
be that need to be incorporated right
that make sense yeah so this is great
except that what about anything any of
the applications is providing a shared
resource right so in Asia is a is one
example cowboy is another so for example
within Asia something that there's the
the challenge with amnesia is the
setting up the schema right so if you're
starting up on a completely clean system
you need to create the schema you need
to decide if that scheme is going to be
on disk or if it's going to be a memory
and you have to do that before amnesia
starts right before the amnesia
application starts otherwise you have to
shut it down if it started the wrong way
you need to shut it down and say it just
starts up with nothing there right
you'll get an in-memory schema and then
I guess you can just change the storage
type right and then it becomes on disk
line but you still have to you know
there's still this this startup issue
and there's so it can be a challenge a
little bit of a challenge to to share
amnesia across the different app if you
have say you're composing together three
applications they're all want to use
amnesia right they all have to agree on
how it's going to get started right and
they have to agree on how to say create
their tables and then cowboy right you
need to add your
your route and then also start the
listener right so there has to be some
agreement on who's going to do that
particularly if you're going to share
the same port number right because you
can only have one listener for a
particular port so what do we do about
that and so what I did in the in our in
our proof of concept was I essentially
wrote a very thin I made it made a repo
that was a very thin manager around say
amnesia or cowboy and the the OTP
applications that wanted to use that
resources that wanted to use amnesia
would include as a dependency the the
thin amnesia manager and the thin and
easy manager would then say that amnesia
was its dependency and that thin manager
would have provided an epi two to choose
to create the tables and to decide what
the schema type should be so sort of
with the sort of the amidah startup then
became a part of this thin manager and
the the other the sort of the
applications that wanted to use it which
is use that API in order to get started
but once they were so once it was
started that coordination was over then
they're basically independent of one
another and they can just use amnesia
normally right so it's just a matter of
sort of that that Buddha phased the how
to get started so the thing that was
interesting about this to me was that
what it also meant was that sort of the
configuration that went into that for
the for that thin manager as far as how
to deal with the resource actually now
became a configuration for the it was a
configuration now for that release for
that how we compose that node so the the
decisions are now more about once we
decide to compose create a node what are
the
how is that thing supposed to be
configured rather than sort of each
application making a decision about it
so there still needs to be some
coordination there to make sure there
are no collisions on on on that okay so
I wanted to just show a show some what
that looked like something a little bit
hard to type by looking over my shoulder
ok so I just called it oops where am I
oh there it is ok so I just called it
Earl amnesia and so we can see in the
rebar config that it doesn't say that
it's dependent on any thinks it's not
dependent on any other repositories and
in the source code again it's very thin
but the API is just here we're all it
does is it has a function to to create
the the the tables so so the API into it
is to give it a list of table
definitions and then it creates the
table it creates the tables if they
don't already exist and then it waits
for them to become available and then so
if we were to look at that down here
just ski what maybe maybe exist right so
it's pretty simple all it does is it
check gets the list of all the tables
sees if it's there and if it's not there
then it will create the table if it is
or just wait a it's just waits for it
actually there is no weight of the
weight was another function call yet so
and that's that sort of all that was
really needed there to do the
coordination and then separately there's
a
single configuration that can be put in
the SIS config which is whether or not
the disc EEMA should be made persistent
right and again that ends up being a
decision for the whole node right so all
of the other all the applications need
to know need to at least be aware that
it could be one way or the other right
so one error that came up was that it
was a persistent was that the fall so it
was keeping it in RAM but one of the
applications wanted to create it on this
table and so of course amnesia
complained about that right so I had to
switch it for that note I had to switch
it to being persistent right
alright
okay so that was that and then I wanted
to show how it was used and that's in in
the long window should be over here oops
yeah so in here in da peak or node
that's going to be using the so this is
now a node that was been composed so if
we look at the rebar config it's it's
using something called it's using Earl
amnesia and then it's also using
something called Dhabi which was
originally called Dhabi it was renamed
it originally was called Dhabi now is it
got renamed to Dhabi core lid and I
never changed it on the left side so
that so now we've composed a note
together that just basically has these
these two pieces and we'll talk about
the third one the Earl sht in a minute
and and then that's it the rest of this
is all very very thin right that there's
basically the only thing in here is the
app file right which lists the lists the
applications that it's dependent on
right and we rely on the fact that Dobby
is going to say that it's dependent on
the Earl amnesia right in order to build
that dependency ok
and then so that was the node and then
the product did this in the wrong order
Dobby I didn't pull Dhabi cortland okay
so forgot to do that anyway so in dhabi
car live is the thing that is making the
call to earlham neva all right okay so
then the other thing was though is this
the other one that was there was this
Earl sshd so this one was a little bit
different and this was actually where
the inspiration to think this through
came from we had the the client I was
working with Infoblox was working with
their research group doing some
prototyping of things and they said we
built a bunch of different applications
for them that we're all running in these
different nodes and they say can we get
a ssh shell into the Erlang node to get
the Erlang shell the the shell prompt so
that we don't have to have Erlang
installed everywhere were to make a
remote shell connection now sorry okay
well that's not doesn't seem like could
be too hard and it's all behind
firewalls so that you know management of
usernames and passwords was not a big
deal to them they just want to be able
to make that connection and so we did
that and it wasn't that much work but
still it was it involved you know a few
hours of coding and testing and then
they said oh that's great can you do it
in this one too right and it's like okay
let's not keep because they're going to
ask for a now for in all of them right
so let's not keep doing the same work
over and over again although maybe it's
good for consulting because you're paid
by the day but I said let's let's think
about a different way of doing this and
so what we came up with this idea of
what if we could make a repository right
that you could use it as a dependency
and all you need to do is include it as
a dependency and now you've got SSH
access into your airline node right
could we make something self-contained
like that and so that's what this is so
if we sort of is you
as you notice when we went in where was
it in here in the DA be all in one or
even in the Dhabi we can look at the
lobby all in one here obviously I
haven't done the compiles in this in
these trees but we've got we've got in
this one we have the Dhabi we have the
Earl sshd which gives us the ssh access
and then this is also one that is
basically an all in one thing it's got
all the components in it so it also has
the rest interface and something called
the UI which is a JavaScript interface
is basically the UI thing is basically
just a holder of the all the static
JavaScript files right it just needs to
be included so i can get copied into the
proof directory same thing oh yeah so
then we can also look at sshd itself
so here there's a helper script that
will generate the keys and then in the
source tree it's actually relatively
simple the main the main part of it is
right here where you know you it pulls
out a bunch of the configuration
information about what to do and here's
this business about the master app so
what we wanted to do was put the keys
the public private keys the encryption
keys in the projector e of the of the
application that was closely associated
with the release and so we needed to
this needed to know what that
application was right cuz there's no way
of knowing so it looks in the we put a
environment variable in that tells us
the name of the that will give us the
name of the master application and then
from there we can pull out the we can
get the private directory of that
application and then we put the keys in
this Earl sshd directory so then all
this does is it starts to demon and
pretty much that's all this server does
another never it only the only other
reason it would wake up as if the demon
crashed just fine
let's see I think that's all i wanted to
show there okay okay and there there are
like some other examples we did a very
thin wrapper around Earl cowboy just I'm
sorry around cowboy for the four-hour
rest interfaces and then there's other
ways in which things were composed the
all-in-one node which is which you saw
and then there's this rest node that has
I think just the rest component the rest
application the sorry the rest api for
da be in in just that note so that we
can run the we want to we can have sort
of the dahbi which is the database
engine running separately from its rest
interface right we can run those on two
separate notes if we want to or we can
run them all together if we're trying to
do debugging okay one of the challenges
with this though is it now you've got a
sort of code scattered into different
repos right so the repo that you were
using to build the application or to
build your node is no longer the repo
that has the source code in it that is
the application that that is the primary
purpose of that note right and so that
can be a bit of a challenge and then
also because we had separate repose for
all these different components you know
sometimes we would discover a bug
working on this one only to find out
that the problem was actually in one of
the dependencies right and so the the
really awful way of having to fix that
was to do the fix here test it check it
in and then pull it and then you know
update the dependencies and and that
just was really tedious so what I ended
up doing was just making symbolic links
for the dependencies so after doing a
rebar get depths I just removed that
remove the directory and make a symbolic
made of some blog link to where I had it
other add another clone a clone of that
of that tree right so that I could
actually just do the work all together
but that's one of the challenges with
this with this structure and that's and
that's that that's it are there any
questions no yes
listen on port and you just follow me
yeah so that was the idea right so if if
you were I mean the what we wanted to do
right was to have a single single port
that we would then have all of the if we
compose together a bunch of the AP rest
api's who wanted a single port that they
would all connect to and so the way I
structured the Earl cowboy is it handles
starting launching cowboy with the right
port number and then it turns out the
cowboy you can dynamically add routes to
it right so you can even after it's
running you can add more routes yeah so
I did the I was surprised too so because
that's not typically the way you see it
used so it was fine to start it and then
when an application comes when
application starts up later that says oh
I'm a rest interface and I need to
install routes you can just it it still
calls into I think there's still an API
and Earl cowboy just because it's the
thing holding on to the kind of the
reference to the server but then that
all that does is just adds to the routes
to that reference right yes even
yeah so the question is that it seems
inconvenient to have to write these
wrappers around these these applications
that basically aren't playing nicely
it's like what is there how would I like
to see these applications designed to
make this basically more natural right
is that fair yeah so I think and I think
I've thought a little bit more about
amnesia than I have the others and I
think that with amnesia it would be nice
if the right so let's back up one step
right these rappers are only needed
because they're not playing nicely with
this way of composing the application
right their shared resource but they
don't really have AP is that a mint are
amenable to that kind of sharing right
so the amnesia for example it would be
nice if there was a way of providing
environment variables or something for
its startup that could be used when it
starts up to set sort of these options
ahead of time and then also maybe an API
where you can do as I did which is like
maybe create the table right create
create or wait for table right and so it
could then start up the you would have a
natural way of having it start the
amnesia for that node and then you'd
have an API where you can just say well
here's here's my table definitions just
tell me when they're ready right or give
me an error if there's some conflict
yeah I think that would be that would be
good yes
yeah that's correct right so if in that
case if you decide to split your note up
you would have to have some strategy for
moving the data because you've now split
the data from one into two different
nodes and yes that's absolutely right
but that's that was beyond the scope of
sort of this if this discussion just
sort of thinking about this yes sure so
the first question is did it we were
doing this for infoblox and did it
really fit the need and I think the
answer was is yes because what the need
was who wanted a way of i said what i
should say is that the the project they
were working on was all very very proof
of concept and we weren't sure as we
were designing it what the right choices
were and so this gave us more
flexibility to experiment right and so
from that point of view I think it was
successful I think also from the point
of view of productivity says it was that
we were building a distributed system
and being able to do the testing and
debugging with it all in one place one
node even though eventually it was
expected to be split up really saved a
lot of time it really made it much much
easier to do the debugging the second
question is that was it is it available
yes it's all in open source it's all
public open source yeah all right any
more questions oh yeah
for control so if you use the same
library for example e into projects and
you have person one that you need for
this first project for another one and
all your different libraries to your
components for your node right and
keeping yeah so the question is about
sort of version management software
version management I haven't but
basically I think rebar does that for
you right so when you make a dependency
you can say which version of the repo
that you want for it's a release I have
these I'm not kept are you had your bug
fix fix some things in 10 yeah yeah I
say right so automate sort of this
management of the versions yeah no I
haven't given that much thought yeah I
think the level of complexity that we
were working with wasn't high enough to
to need a tool to think it through if
that makes sense I think for us it was
still relatively simple and then we
weren't really it wasn't production code
so we weren't really doing releases
anyway right and that's probably the
better answer which is we hadn't gotten
that far in sort of how to do the
deployments yeah it'd be nice if there
was some tool that would sort of you
could use as a both taggat and update my
my dependency what's into my
dependencies may be right so basically
tag the repo
also update my my rebar config yeah yeah
that's an interesting idea if what
answer yeah version right right Yeah
Yeah right if there's a version clash
that's detected by by by rebar rebar
yeah I was going to say get but I met
rebar yeah all right any more questions
great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
