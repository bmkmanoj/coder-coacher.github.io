kind of surprised when it came out and
the website has come up when it came out
it better change the world better place
of our company which wasn't my intention
actually put it where it's five hobby
project done oh oh why did you do that
or two beautiful papers and five
interesting problem five half-baked
solutions to really difficult problems
include fun problems and not necessarily
in that order
and and I always thought that a lot of
conferences like these people say I'm
the format of the talk is sir well I do
this stuff and here's the solution and
I'll tell you all about it I thought I
was shame I thought that's it to the
conference would you know I really love
it if everybody said you know I thought
ten problems I can't solve so they told
everybody about them and then because
you're a load of smart people in the
audience and they were to a I think I
might get me help me solve that problem
so this is much more than in in in that
vein and that some problems which
interest me and I've been working on two
sometimes 40 years or seven and slowly
making progress on some of them sort of
like has been that somebody's might
provide that little extra bit of
information to make me progress them
learn that the problem I try and solve a
stuck could forget stuck until I go to a
new problem so I'm and I try to
structure that in some way so I'm asking
question rule I always could get it well
are we doing well where are we going
what comes all we solve so there's a big
problem areas are energy can you case
anybody happy notices we have a top with
a amount of energy we consume and how we
produce it storage big problem how do we
store stuff forever
not a failure how do we have you
preserved history then without the earth
time if we look back to today of worldly
it's always information within the cloud
lost forever the newspapers we read
today will people in a thousand years
time be able to go back and say a
thousand years ago they're reading the
newspaper we can do that today we would
be able to do it in a thousand years
time well I don't let I asked some
people of Facebook until one what
happens to my digital images when I'm
daredevil you know if I have descendants
in a few hundred years time will they be
able to access those pictures and they
said yeah that's a very good question
take this security you're bad people now
looking people they want to Bob you and
you know if you think they want to spy
on you into what you're doing I put
microphones in your rooms so they can
hear every word you say yeah
complexity yeah we thought we're so
lucky
complicated no to understands Outlook
you riveting and music the beginning so
so what I've briefly going to say is
check the hardware storage such as I see
because I've lived through it the
software story what happens as software
in the last 30 or 40 well black is 2300
years
five problems which I think are worthy
of solution and five partial solutions
for those problems including a new
algorithm which I have never ever
mentioned to anybody sort of try it out
and see if you like it okay here are the
five problems always gonna pretty deal
with preserving history authenticating
history gaining control of our data
reducing entropy and making music those
are the five problems I want to address
and five solutions five solution
techniques for solving these problems
when wanted blockchain authentication
dobrica mutable data that was the web of
hashes personality making pair only as
I'm going to this more so that's what
the hardware story from 1948 to 2016 I
think hard stuff I think a bit of
hardware for me started in 238 so
started here with Tom Kilburn in Great
Britain
they're very bit of contra bility and an
American so they invented the first
computer German say they invented the
first computer and quit so we invented
the first reducer and we right
well what the Brits invented was the
first computer with a store storable
program in memory the Americans invented
a computer but it wasn't stored in
memory serious critical to change um
this is the Williams tube which could
store a thousand 24 bits stabili for an
hour and it was the invention of this
tube cathode ray tube
it made the first computer possible and
this is the first program
there we go and it's in Kilburn flog and
somewhere just can see the date where is
it so they're handwritten the date at
the 19th of June 1948 is the first-ever
program I think it's kind of cool via we
can see the first-ever programming
completed like that we've figured out if
a number was a prime number or not or
composite number did it ran you write
down what time of day around so we don't
know that probably in the morning we
think but we don't know and there it is
blown up and here it is in the
Manchester Museum Wisconsin tip
dangerously look at a replica of the
original very nice nothing and there we
go my wife wonders why we have to go to
trip into museums on holidays actually
kind of like if you want to get other
places so we do that as well and there's
a number in the top really porn Oh arrow
arrow arrow this is my unit of computer
path and it's normalized to the cray-1
so one is the Cray ones 1925 and I
program the Cray there's one in Europe
wanted all of Europe's concern project
particle physicists we're really excited
I can program the Cray
it was like God for a programmatic even
go near the clay want to see it you know
you were blessed if you if you'd seen it
I was one of a duper I could go back
during them and say I have seen a Cray
one oh you are a man who has seen the
crayon yes II but really it was the
world's first supercomputer and it
hadn't amazing I mainly fast clock it
was 80 megahertz and it used credibly
little power a hungry 15 kilowatts and
it was tiny for its part 35 and a half
jung-hee yeah and eight megabytes of
storage to think of that a massive
amount of storage is 1975 product it's
not long time again
sameer 25 year old I mean looks hardly
not an athlete and well how do I look at
one so cookie this is the cray-1 and
you're not allowed to feed on that sit
on but sit on the stool that said no no
you get told what I got told off cuz I
never you know fern that fell in the
nearest I could get with from the
observation galleries I'd seen it but I
wasn't allowed to touch it so here I was
led to touch it up try it see how come
and you know why it's circular it's a
cylinder so would you straight to the
wire it was a big problem and then okay
so the next computer we've put the
computer that person M which was 0.006
tell them to grey wander that
collaborative making there's anybody
yeah you must remember that summer now
that was the first kind of a thing
called back mix this is the machine that
defines the vex mix the million
instructions per second on the backs
eleven 790
so from there after we start using this
unit million instructions per second
Zack snips came round in 1925 and this
is the sort of stuff that airline was
developed on kind of fun computer go
forward a bit iPhone 266 gray ones
somewhat lighter fits in the pocket and
I think Chicago giving a talk and some
of your kitchen can you run the airing
on a really sort of on that you know
little tiny little underpowered computer
like a Raspberry Pi I fellow 16 times
the cray-1 and now things get scary
really scared
the Nvidia Kessler P 166 thousand two
hundred and fifty two thousand two
Claiborne dedicated to machine learning
this is the machine that's going to
cause mass unemployment and I'm serious
it will take away all the jobs of
anybody who's input a little job is your
input to your job is bits and the output
of your job is bits and a wire then we
can put a machine learning algorithm in
between and do better than you and it's
going to happen within the next 50 years
it's going to make millions of people
unemployed you figure out what to do
about that fortunately there's a better
computer because we are two point eight
five times ten to the eight crayons and
we run at thirty eight petaflop
and run 15 watts we've got eighty five
billion neurons and with five million
years old so we've got this little
window of opportunity to beat the
machines at their own game
have to see what we do about that
the software story from BC 384 to 2017
write it all to get well logic logical
thought begins with Arabic tell
Aristotle came up with modus ponens if
it's raining I'll go swimming it Israeli
therefore I will go swimming 2,300 years
later we can say if F is of type t1 to
t2 and the input of F is of type t1 then
the output of F is a type 2 - right
from which we conclude that there hasn't
been much progress in software
development
we're glad you laughter Natalie right
apart
Rob Erlang 30 years later under X here
right so those it good so problem hit
the pump can we take history it all
started with them
Rebecca Berkut my mic pulled out so -
Rebecca answered them this is a from
1892 over said you know in 100 years
time will our defendant fine so two plus
I'll ask around a bit and ask people it
takes a lot Technical Director Facebook
we go I don't know
good question thank you I can testify
after us how much do we talk about and
how long we can store it off you can pay
for it where do we sort and hadley name
all this data zalta lot of data
oh that's unusable and how can we
provide our computational infrastructure
a computer for me I own my data
not another computer for Facebook with
any only my data not a computer for
Google were they have identical could
have been me
well I say who is allowed to have my
data what a computer where they say
which part of my data I'm allowed to see
how do we do that how can make a safe
system but I'm hack into it how can we
reduce entropy it's too much software
where can a lot off and far too much
software we're making more and more
other stuff all the time do we do the
same stuff and make it smaller
can we shrink it to a irreducible core
so I have a solution to this
so I've been thinking about for 30 years
and I got stuck breathing I've had an
idea about your guy and good idea other
people could have a good balance or died
about 10 years and Nadia most prepared
how did you go to prefer Ashley so to
help me solve these problems two
beautiful papers two beautiful pictures
of Science in Reverse look immutability
changes everything not only does it have
a nice title it kind of talks about this
notion of immutability which is central
to airline central functional
programming why it changes the way we
build software with lots of application
here and the second paper is by Satoshi
knuckle and Nakamoto B it's the first
paper about Bitcoin
both of these are beautiful papers I
would say the Bitcoin paper is not in
itself enough to implement Bitcoin from
I mean it needs a lot of detail out
so it needs it needs some supplementary
readings so let's look at how we can
solve some of these problems that I had
solution so am the first how much time I
thought you know would have to finish
100 deer at the three Dow so that's the
solution to the first part I want to
save everything forever how do we do
that well the first step is to name
everything this really can't if we don't
know what it's called we going to have
trouble naming everything so so the
third thing is to name everything so how
can we name everything those things
don't have names we can't what could
talk about so choosing names difficult
it's rather easy we can we can take the
sha-1 checksum or the shot in five six
check from the cryptographic checksum of
the data and that names it so we've
reduced a very large amount of data to a
very small amount of data so we could
name every paragraph on the internet by
computing its sha-1 checksum very simple
to do when you saw files and things X to
solve several difficult decision
problems what's the name of the file
what's the name of the directory you put
it in what's the name of the machine we
put it on we can eliminate all these
problems by saying well the file has no
name it is not stored in any directory
and it's globally available planetary
available so we store everything in a
content addressable store and we can
layer this on top of HTTP so imagine a
URL this represents us with five
difficult problem we have to choose a
site name we have to choose a path name
to the director we have to choose a file
name we have to make it highly available
and we have to make it secure all these
are difficult problems
so let's make it easier we could do
today if we're going to act together we
can easily do this together we could say
HTTP any old site in the planet so that
solves the first problem you know we
don't have to choose a site get will
come on a get I want to get something
and I need to name it how do I name it
I've named it with the sha-1 checksum so
let's say get sha-1 I could put sha-1 60
or md5 and then the name of the resort
that have solved all the problems all
those five problems in one fell swoop
because we don't have to choose the name
the name is that we don't have to choose
a site because we could choose any site
on the planet we don't need cryptography
to secure it because having asked for
that resource so mass times a person in
the middle could not corrupt that file
because we would detect it so we don't
need any cryptography and any security
to solve all those difficult problems
we've made it highly available because
we can go to any site on the planet to
get it and we can layer it on top of
HTTP today if we want to and we can
write the servers to do that in any
programming language so that'd be nice I
would like to see that happen right
that's something already done it
oh I didn't know shit
or all good goodie you know better right
okay yeah well family documents in Prada
store well number people on the planet
69% of nine becomes a red giant in five
times ten to the nine years we saw
thousand documents today for your thirty
ten ten to twenty five documents mcdhh
or ah this audios becomes a giant and
that's about ten to the fifteen twenty
ten to twenty five documents number of
atoms on the earth for ten to fifteen so
with lots of space
DNA George can distort IBM said paper I
read last week in experimental systems
can store tend to turn you on bytes per
gram so basically free code a store ten
to twenty five documents we can do it in
ten kilograms of DNA and that's until
the red Sun becomes a red giant that's
cool
technology wonderful oh the API to this
you know
I mean somebody's already done it so I
were so if you thought King value
databases were fun you know that's all
relational database with lots of keys
and Rosen's dolphin so we could keep
Ally's database I think the value on
there is no keys they're even more fun
we can embed this onto HTTP POST so
actually then then then you need to
distribute of hash table under the under
the covers because I'm going to you know
if you do get you know this hash many
website it's going to reply okay I've
got it
with my to play now I don't know where
he is at all or it might say no but I
don't know where if I think these guy
Bernier to it I think may know where it
might be and then you go recursively
down and this is you can use called
Academy Lea or something like that the
distributed hash table okay that's going
to explain how Gordon keV Emilia worked
but okay cool
well okay cause looks like that well you
haven't got all that much time we and
there's some literature on that stuff so
if we built file stores right now as you
can potentially store everything forever
and that would answer this question of
you know where the where the photos no
no a hundred years I told you it we're
aware of those photos whether in this
content addressable store they're not in
Dropbox because when when when I thought
pay my bills the Dropbox that stuff
going to vanish and they're not in um
Apple's ransomware you know which again
all these digital contents in a vanish
we stopped paying bills shouldn't lock
ourselves into this stuff
it makes sort of part of a solution to
problem is protocol virtually when
systems talk to each other we need to
make sure we're talking to the right
version right now and we're using
version numbers II but there's a much
better way I mean look at this query get
the HTTP a full version executed one
yeah that's the version this is the
version number of the protocol it comes
back I don't only it's very good way if
you do it right
you would say get and you would send the
sha-1 checksum of the source code of the
server and the source code of the client
and you would reply with the sha-1
checksum with the client and you would
check that the you know this is a pair
of numbers that have been tested
together and you would have sort of
total angle control over over everything
or bloody bit and they make sure that
everything fits together nicely and
authentication just I started I don't
know anything about blockchain and
bitcoins until about a week ago so every
kind of bad model that's cool and I
thought you can use these algorithms for
far more than you think so I thought I
said this or just as an example is that
the blockchain algorithm that carried a
proof chain and slightly peeved about
the fact that politicians and decision
makers can make statements and then
years later deny making those things
something is really good they are what
is the technical term for that it's
sipping and and so the first time in my
life two nights ago I shouted it at
television because I thought I'd watch
Fox with it and I don't have the
privilege of being able to see Fox News
in treatment and Nigel Farage with
commenting on a terrorist attack in
Britain and saying this was a
consequence of not checking in the
inspectors and peace of the border and
the people on Fox were not even a little
closer that's all I don't think it's
very funny because it only happened a
few hours ago how do they and they had
enacted published details as we've done
it and I thought it's a bit premature
thing this is the consequence of not
checking
turned out this guy is a 54 year old
British citizen who was born in Britain
his parents were born in Britain
he's a big-time loser who's been in jail
we've got crazy I didn't either crazy
right so I think it'd be kind of good if
we nails not easy I don't care I really
want to say either disapproves of
right-wing people or left-wing people or
anything like that I disapprove of
people siblings if you want to if you're
not crazy you might Windu's you should
be able to express them but you should
not be able to deny that you've
expressed them later so here's a
blockchain the first lot you know this
is what Joe has said please
or what several of us have said and the
first here's my message here second
message business here's my public key
and here's the digital signature but you
can take very - and stick them into a
algorithm it will say yeah the person
who did that had a private key because
once in that publication you always put
the public in there so you put it back
with the pointer in the next block to
the previous block you can follow that
entire chain and you cannot deny that
you did their abilities them the
blockchain part of bitcoins a lot more
now and this morning so so i implemented
all of that in a link that's all they've
chosen the bitcoin chose very nice
algorithms with elliptic cryptography
beautiful self beautiful stuff and
understand it not available
but as I understand it yes better so I'd
implement that bit of it in Erlang there
you go that's it and all of it in
Airlines that's a bit that's blockchain
authentication album in Erlang I have
you say me it would be back to the same
in exactly the same in the next year
with slight syntactic differences and
this morning I thought I'd be nice to
show the Genesis block so I started
googly a little bit could I get a
picture the genesis gloss and found this
some Kenya sheriff's blog hidden
surprises in the big block Bitcoin
blockchain
and you think to go back to miss it
whoops there you put any data you like
here doesn't have to be okay in Bitcoin
its areum Joe transfers one Bitcoin to
Fred that's what that's what those
messages are but 2004 any message you
like in there so it's the big chain ah
there's some Nelson Mandela's picture
that wiki links information this
software this crypto keys with all sorts
of wonderful stuff
there are also mysteries with industries
because the Genesis block for Bitcoin
the sha-1 checksum of that starts with I
think it's 13-0 bits in a row how did
that happen did that happen by accident
probably not what does it mean so the
goal sort of I love conspiracy theories
and remember are their secret messages
in the bitch and who the hell was this
guy who invented it and of particular
interest is the early bit caught usually
that's all the sudden event of funny
things that'll suffer whatever thought
the number one guy yeah and yet he
started people started buying bitcoins
oh he would sell things to others early
people early transactions so probably
they would probably him doing
transactions with himself with different
identities and this nobody knows how
much money there is in these unspent
bitcoins in the early days but there's
maybe a billion dollars worth and
they're unspent I spent I mean they
haven't been transferred out of Bitcoin
into cash they're still as bitcoins and
nobody has spent them right so I'm kind
of speculating what would happen if you
like big one of the bitcoins but the
Merkle trees didn't close where it came
from
if a Bitcoin whose age is like three
generations from the Genesis block were
to be spent all the Bitcoin mining
factories would see that and all the
mafia hitmen in the world
with rush to that Bitcoin machine to try
and find out who taking the money out to
be very great fun that I mean it would
it's not me now I didn't invent it I'm
not smart enough cryptography I could
have done this computing bit not with oh
now it's written in C++ I'd be good
couldn't possibly written that I don't
know because I was horrible language
okay so we could extend that how much
time cycle 16 sorry oh you can extend it
to all sorts of things I mean
credibility are you okay
reducing entropy I always you know me
there are more and more functions and
like to what I think it is could be
discovered that kin functions compute
the same thing approving that is very
very difficult out of the state of the
art so it's a small example you can do
it but if there are written in different
programming languages you wouldn't be
able to do that automatically or and you
wouldn't discover that and in closest
discovery in order to even countenance
the idea that you functions did the same
that has to have some cultural
similarity I mean you might guess by the
name but if I wrote a function and named
it in Erlangen named it with an English
name and somebody wrote it in Chinese
there actually happened to be the same
function about China how would I ever
discover this fact and I thought if we
could discover all functions that did
the same thing then we could choose the
best one and eliminate all the others
and there I got stuck I got stuck about
four years ago because I got to that
point and then I sort of a way of doing
that which might work I hadn't tried it
at scale
and I didn't want to publish a paper
about where I was or I could publish
about I don't want anybody to patent it
because I want everybody to have to use
it I didn't want to write a paper so I
thought actually just explained in
public reading adequate you know so but
nobody could claim precedence over that
I'm going to show it to you and you know
particularly said Oh somebody else have
done that it was harsh on average I had
never heard of anybody you've done this
right so two functions are the same if
for the same inputs they produce the
same absolutes how can we discover that
fact well find all funky which for the
same inputs produce the same output and
remove the duplicates of them and then
we've reduced the entropy of the system
so let's just do it for integers so
here's a black box and let's suppose it
with a factorial function
this is our function and we feed it the
numbers 1 to 100 and outcome 100 answers
so to black box it will be the same if
we things that I've typed introduce it
into just they're the same it's for the
same set of inputs we get the same set
of outputs but the federal output could
be pretty big as a bit of input could be
pretty big and then suddenly it came to
me
factorial we could take the sha-1
checksum of the set of inputs and we
could take the sha-1 checksum of the set
of outputs and so in fact all is the
function that I mean if you can okay how
you compute that that's airline center
binary for the inputs and airline term
to binary for the outputs and then
essentially one checksum and then
factorial is the function that turns
that into that and we standardized the
input to be the sequence of integers
from 1 to 100 so now this thing is a
hundred and sixty bits so I put it in
the database and I could put all integer
functions into a database
with a key that is the sha-1 check some
of their output for a standard input and
by extension I can take any datatype and
turn it into an integer the girdle
mappings and things like that allow you
to feel like anything injury I mean
basically term to binary take any air
long term turns it into binary but a
binary is just abate 256 integer so any
segment we make about any airline term
is also a statement we make about
integers so you can do it this way these
initiatives become very big but that
doesn't matter because we compute their
sha-1 checksum so the Haskell thing that
says what we called it you know you can
you can search on type signatures you
could also search on value properties
two things do what you want them to do
let's think that nobody thought I've I
have never you know now you are young
years ago but I have never seen it in
that case so I happy fun so somebody
wants to do a PhD here from yoga cleans
feel free okay computational
infrastructure I built a prototype over
your computer personal computing it I
would like everybody in the world to
have Alan Kay showed a prototype of the
iPad who's made out of cardboard and
took it to those of conferences it
showed people and they've able to
persuade people to make to make the
Dynabook with red solid cardboard
prototype of the Dynabook and eventually
I guess he bumped into Steve Jobs or
something and Steve Jobs
be funny nobody made the iPad
Allen scurried by the iPad I hate this
or partners okay and so I made a
prototype out of cardboard of what I
want to build I haven't brought it with
me is have brought some photos of it I
mean I want somebody to help me book
this thing whoops looks like that get
solar panel
you see I know I thought them processor
that solar panels made out of silicon
stuff and got lots of hand
CPUs are made out of silicon antennas
are made out of silicon memories made
out of silicon so the actual items blow
them all onto the sub same substrate
presumes you're much more reliable it's
just baked into the solar panel I want
to build this sink and then you stick it
on your roof at home and saw all your
you want to use it you get your laptop
and you talk Wi-Fi to it because it
understands Wi-Fi and then it would say
to your neighbors one hello I'm Jo
simply do that how do you do maybe we
should form a grid and then loss of a
nice little grid and a little battery on
it and then the Sun would move and they
would say okay my data can't be sore
because of sudden going down so we'll
move the computation round you're
following the Sun and then we make these
and we manufacture them we give them to
everybody in Africa everybody in China
everybody in the world I just don't go
by one of these things you can't buy
them I don't know why nobody thought of
building something like this and then
you put on your roof your mobile
computing piece you're sticking on your
car and then when you drive to the
shopping center and this 500 cars parked
there they don't start talking to each
other and become a simple computer and
we own our data and we put them on there
and we don't let Facebook build data
centers and use many personnel news
three or four percent of the world's
power then coals to do that for poison
the environment we want our own data on
our own machines powered by the Sun so
I'd like to make something like that
so if anybody in the audience could help
me especially people who know hardware I
come and talk to me because I'd love to
build it I hope that somebody would know
start building this thing or form a
company to do it and I'll buy all the
software for it I promise but I'm not
good at hardware last time I did some
hardware I accidentally sold at a
cupcake which
yeah the nice little thing you can do
all these things with it there are other
big problems oh yeah
and we all we have to answer the
question what happens when the marginal
cost of production is zero what happens
to repetitive the only task that can't
be automated inspectors also non
repetitive task starts with a high
degree of randomness the dependable near
environment you know nursing and doctors
and things you won't be able to make
that so dependent very very much of on
the allotment but everything else you
can automate through odin's my data I
think that's a very important question
to ask my data's gonna have a little oh
well it's okay
actually that's my last one I should
have had a side at this end who I know
okay so that was it
so any any questions comments it's all
be done before oh it's an idea best
thing okay right yeah I keep talking
around then it yeah well one minute and
I've talked into in syrup about this
then Debbie Allen care unit everybody
wants to do this part of Apple and
Google because they want to only mean
everybody but the people who invented
the internet want to do this Tim
berners-lee want to have private data
pods didn't surf invented internet once
once private data Alan Kay wants to save
it or we all want to save all this data
there are massive commercial interests
who want to own us and we have to get
that or we have to say this is a this is
a week I mean it's it it's the first
thing it's a feudal economy it gives up
some of your freedom in return for
something so you might say okay I'm
happy to pay Google or Apple $10 a month
forever and then you given up a bit of
your freedom there so you might I think
it's a shame that for ordinary citizens
there isn't the alternative for
something that's as well packaged
with an item but which is completely
open sourcing and completely secure yes
sorry
now I said I wasn't computer I mean no I
would love to be provide have this
billion dollars worth of Huntsman
Bitcoin ah but but the pub with how the
hell do I spend them cut the Mafia would
immediately overkill Jo and torture him
to tickle him to find his key you know
they'd tie me down
privately understanding understanding
exercise
I think anybody can answer that question
I mean it is I got you know you been you
might be the last generation program it
is yes
easy well I mean this is then it is this
is what you might call yeah so I mean
this is weak equivalence it's not I mean
strong equivalence would imply proof
it's a weak equivalent it it it makes a
set of candidates that are highly likely
to compute the same thing whether they
actually do it will be you have to open
them up and decide you know if you're
going to say okay so I've found 450 well
I mean I have this problem like this
right whenever I said I've got 43,000
airline modules on my diskin I want
something that part of a URL or you find
that partner and I've got 15 organ I
know which one is better so some of them
are just got some somebody else to
notice and was it in myself that I
wonder which is the best so you're still
going to have that problem having
haven't got the candidates for entropy
reduction you still after you make
choices about which the best one self
but if we can do away the naming things
in the name space isn't all that kind of
crap I mean why have namespaces got a
name space it feeds the sha-256 and
spectres pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
