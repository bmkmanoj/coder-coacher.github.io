systems engineer to learn solutions
videos generally aren't my thing but
over the next couple of weeks I will be
showing you some cool applications of
airline in embedded systems on this
Raspberry Pi board and other embedded
platforms as well so they became talk a
bit about the Raspberry Pi itself and
I'll also show you a little demo of what
I have done so far
Raspberry Pi is exciting because it is
an affordable platform that could be
rolled out to the education market and
the foundation's goal is to revamp the
ICT curriculum at schools the problem at
the moment is there's not much exciting
stuff happening within the ICT course in
schools so by introducing a small
platform an embedded platform like this
hopefully the kids will be enthused in
the swords programming and perhaps doing
some cool hardware applications with it
as well we have seen this happening with
the Arduino project and it seems like
there's a great community around the
Raspberry Pi
I think we will see an increase in
people excited about computer science in
general and since this is actually an
embedded platform with the inputs and
outputs that you would normally find on
an embedded system such as I squid sea
or SPI he might ICC young people
interested in developing hardware as
well and interfacing it but there as we
pies so hopefully we will see the effect
bolt on the hardware engineering or
electronics engineering side of things
and computer science
it's quite funny because even though the
board is not publicly publicly released
yet there are already tens of ad on
boards that community members have
designed and I see started producing so
you just imagine what will happen when
people actually get their hands on their
physical units I think we'll see a great
surgeon add on boards in the future
well the possibilities are truly endless
because you can plug add-ons to this
board say for instance if you're making
a little robot a little buggy that goes
around room or goes outside you can get
a little GPS module attach it to this
board and do some graphical things on
your computer to see where your robot is
going alternatively you can write games
on it I think that's one of the areas
the foundation is supporting actually to
get to get young people interested in
programming their publishing tutorials
where they are supporting the people who
publish tutorials doing game development
and so on
we're at line uses it's quite
interesting because o line and these
days is mainly utilized for massively
distributed highly scalable systems but
originally Airlines was designed for
embedded applications the original use
case where line was telep telephony
applications or telephone switches at
Ericsson so this is almost going back to
its roots
we are really excited that Erlang
solutions to have a Raspberry Pi in our
possession because over the next couple
of weeks we will be exploring how to
fully utilize the peripherals on the
board we as a preliminary experiment i
will show you some concurrence blinking
lights in a minute but we think the
Erlang is a great fit for embedded
systems because it does provide some
very interesting features such as
concurrency distribution and fault
tolerance and reliability over the next
couple of weeks we will cover these in
greater detail so keep an eye out for
more videos
since we only received a Raspberry Pi
yesterday we haven't had much time to do
a more impressive demo but as you can
see from these blinking lights erlang
does provide interesting features of
concurrency that is built into the VA so
the code fragment we have used to get
these LEDs blinking is as follows
and you can also find more details about
the inner workings of the blink loop
that's referenced on this program at the
address link below in the video in the
next video we will look into how we can
link multiple raspberry PI's together
and little distributed system using
these little bored we will also look
into ways we can off load calculation to
more powerful devices of raspberry pi
and see how we can collect data back so
we'll look at a simple very simple
implementation of MapReduce on raspberry
pi
community is a very important aspect of
our project so we would like to hear
your comments or your project ideas I
think a very good example of how the
community can really make a difference
is the Arduino project so if you're
interested in our line you to utilizing
your lying as part of your embedded
systems projects or just want to learn
more about it do send us a message we're
on twitter you can leave a comment on
this video as well and soon you will be
able to go to our shiny new website and
look at the Vicky and post comments on
our articles that will be posted over
there as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
