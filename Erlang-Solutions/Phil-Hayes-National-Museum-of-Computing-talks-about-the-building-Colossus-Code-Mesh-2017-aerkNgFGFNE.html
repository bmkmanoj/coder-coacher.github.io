National Museum of computing into the
profession park and I'm responsible for
the running maintenance and for the
research on the wartime computer that
was known as crosses
could you describe what you've spoken
about here equipment I basically try to
tell the story of how the Colossus
machine was required why it was required
and the people behind the build on it
and the people behind was the breaking
of the cipher not the classs was used
could you could you describe some of
that history of the building of Cuates
the original gibbet and it was designed
by a chap by the name of Tommy flowers
he was a GPO development engineer the
GPO was the forerunner of what b-team is
today and his brief was to produce a
machine that would do the mathematical
calculation that was needed to probe to
break the cipher action that was used by
the German High Command now that machine
is known as a terrain Nessa 42 that was
broke by a brilliant mathematician by
the name of built up and his algorithms
that are used in the first true leaf
electronic digital computer
and how was comes your copy of horses
built the Reaper yes that is quite a
good long and complicated story but
basically the director of the project
bird worked at mi5 he had also been
involved with the restoration of early
British computers and he found a paper
relating to the story of Colossus and
that was in what that 1990-1994 told me
was involved with the receding of
collection Park which is where the
government codes and cyphers school was
during the war that's all run over GCHQ
today Joanie had been involved with rest
early restoring early British computers
who saw this paper mentioning Colossus
and Colossus of the Bradley Park he's
involved with savings Bletchley Park so
he basically gets a team together to
rebuild the machine yeah
even at the time all the information was
still classified but because Tony was X
mi5 he paid his clearance resurrected
and he was able to read some of the
classified documents
that was how the rebuild will come about
is is the construction of Colossus still
classified reporter the bat in yourself
is still a very complicated story the
machine itself the hardware on the
machine the architecture of the machine
that was released in 2000 into the
public domain even though the rebuild
actually started in 94 after we but we
weren't allowed to talk about it
we were quite some strange kid talk
about it you know we were rebuilding it
the the those constraints really stayed
in place to this 2000 when one of the
documents was removed and just one
document and that is exactly what we
talked about the information that's
contained in one
and that relates to the hardware on the
machine that document only talks about
in one technique and the technique of my
talk is about and that's the only one
the public today the rest of the
information from these are a lot of it
is still classified today from 2017 how
does how do you interact with glasses it
Lawson is doing a pure statistical time
Clio statistics it's not based on doing
a brute-force attack like German words
it's a German message at working on so
you're not doing a brief blast attack
purely because it will take too long
sure do a brute force attack on Colossus
and that's the fastest machine at the
time for taking excess of seven hundred
and sixty thousand million years to do
that brute-force attack but built up
when he broke this siphon all those
years ago he also worked at mathematical
life of teasing out the starting
position of the wheels on the Lorenz and
the operators set the machine to when he
sent is in the Trinity and it's those
mathematical techniques that Colossus is
using and that is based on pure bit
patterns not characters it takes too
long
it's pure bit-part and you go from 760
thousand million years doing a
brute-force down to three or four hours
yeah and what the second machine up for
is so big pants you're asking the
machine to recognize particular bit
patterns but every time sees them it'll
basically count instead of chance the
norm of x and sees the pattern that is
looking for throughout thousand and then
that gives you a statistical bigger many
times we've seen what we look for and
we're doing is looking for anomalies
yeah yeah in other words appear when the
real positions that you're working on a
wrong you will get a flat round and
number of times you see what looking for
that's their encryption works it doesn't
difference or something unusual is the
way they're jokes flat random however
than where was that we are working on at
the time it's not 12
too many now will do in the right
position what you will see is a very
very slight increase in more statistical
results and that indicates no it more
than indicate
from the starting position
so in my correction in understanding the
Colossus that is not a I guess what we
would now call a general-purpose
computer so it could implements a
specific algorithm it's yes it's
basically what you're doing is you're
setting up the patterns that we're
looking for that is done the switches
and what you are doing with those
switches is configuring gates you know
in Hardware basically your line
connecting gates together just like an
array we put the switches into the
patterns that you want to see and that
walk that what will connect gates
together to perform that function so
it's all done in real time it's not a
stored program which is a pure switch
program and it's all done in little an
example why it's not stored program the
message that I normally roll machine is
60,000 is 6,000 characters in length
that's what we normalize an original
what I miss them for copy of that is
6,000 characters for each character is
made up of five bits is 5-bit code
so that's 30,000 bits in 1941 it would
take two bits two sides two valves per
bitch
so that is 16,000 vowels to store the
message breath 60,000 coming Colossus
issue that's two and a half thousand job
right
60,000 valves okay so what's the what's
the maintenance burden for a machine
like what do you do yeah someone going
through all the time and replacing
someone it's me don't take you back
during the war these machines are on 24
hours ago a whole of Bletchley Park
which is a code-breaking town if you
want the 3,000 people working with you
okay these machines are working 24 hours
a day at Keeneland colossi here yeah and
they're working 24 hours a day seven
days a week
reducing pain it is quite a hot
environment it's a noisy environment but
those machines have to be reliable
because the machines weren't reliable
forget it what you are doing is you are
leading these very very important that
you listen to so you need a machine
that's quick and
and they were the reason that they were
reliable quite simply because they never
turn their shirt off valves and
obviously bad reliability and the reason
is you keep turning the things off
turning them off is okay it's tight come
on yeah so Tommy flowers who design
process even though Bletchley Park was
very concerned about the number of elves
because the prototype like one and a
half thousand dollars yeah they're very
very concerned that this machine gonna
be unreliable like Tommy flowers new for
the previous work on electronic any
phone exchanges but if you turn a bell
wrong then you leave the damn thing open
you only have that problem one you only
turn it on once you run you have the
problem
sure so you really like all these
problems so it becomes very like yeah
machine today the ring feels I can't
leave it on 24 hours a day one because
the cost of electricity and to have to
employ somebody 24 hours a day seven
days a week because the machines are
fire hazard
because took enough power in the church
so what I have on the machine is what's
known as Dario's its day people knowing
a soft start these are electromechanical
transformers and when they're turned on
they to bring up the power very slowly
so instead of switch paying you lose
valves bring them up nice and slowly
we've done
so over a year I lose probably very
difficult to say somewhere between 20
said we say 60 valves being yeah yeah
yeah and I can't open yeah a manageable
number it's a manageable number that
they are original vows not let every
wartime they're valid manufactured up to
what seventies when all the
manufacturing flying in the UK
disappeared to America
so they are or the original manufacture
okay they're not modern days is they are
for the original manufacture and the
design of the circuit is actually
exactly the same as the water condition
so we have a modification
do you have cash should spare about yeah
I had present failure right my has some
leader agent of 10 years spent now we
know spares running the machine will
stop walk and the reason we stopped
working is because yes we could put some
money that one day the tronic signal to
replace the power but when we started
out from this project that started the
knowledge she shared the idea behind it
was we build or even the original
Mishima so that in public and not
opening scene here it feel the heat and
smelling it was that it was the true
machine now if we were going to modify
the electronics that modern-day
electronics in the argument would have
been all the rage in saqqara let's get a
front panel few switches few lights PC
for high gear job
right yeah so if you start notifying it
and you say well let's get rid of all
minute trying to cut PVC and that's why
if will not be modified</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
