Turner Oh Tanya and today I would like
to talk to you about Alexia that
effective learning so I have pulled out
a fact which cognitive psychologists
have done by taking ten learning
techniques and analyzing them and
choosing and writing the one which are
effective wheres effective and not
really effective so what's a
concentrator on the green both said the
one which is effective techniques so one
of them is the distributed practice
distributed practice is the technique
when you schedule your learning sessions
in time so let's say you want to
remember something for a week so then
you would schedule your learning
sessions 12o a day apart from each other
if you want to remember something for a
year you would schedule you learning
sessions months apart from each other
and the second technique is the practice
testing this is taking tests and quizzes
and puzzles to go over things you have
learned so I have been working in Cocina
and to be trained to be a croupier we
needed to go in the month through quite
hard program where you have to learn how
to be a good group here so what you have
to do let's say this is our winning bed
and we have all those chips placed on
our winning number and we have to
quickly say the number that how much we
are going to pay for the person who has
won so this is 89 if you would just
count it out it will take some time but
if you look how croupiers work they just
tell you the answer they know how much
this and actually it's 89 for all the
numbers in the middle with that pattern
so we're actually doing your part in
marching you don't care about any
numbers you don't know where they are
you just look at
and you know that if it's in the middle
and those chips place like that this is
89 and how do you remember all of that
well you use flashcards so you have a
pattern you try to recall how much teeth
you flip it over and you see the answer
if it's correct great if it's not just
just go through that again and again
until it's correct well it's alycia
conference and i would like to present
an elixir cards licks your flashcards so
let's go quickly through a little quiz
why is it going to evaluate to yes next
one yes correct and the last one yes
that's correct so now that you have a
few of how this is going to work you
could go and get those elixir a flash
card from my github it's so now ready to
download free to print out to cut them
and it's ready to be to be played with
right so if you have any questions
if you have difficulties with printing
the cards front and back marching
together just to grab me talk to me if
you have any feedback talk to me we
don't have much time it's only five
minutes so talk to me I'm happy to
answer any questions thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
