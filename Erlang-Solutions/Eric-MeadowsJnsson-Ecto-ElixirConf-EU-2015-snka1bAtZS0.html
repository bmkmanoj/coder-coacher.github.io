those who don't know echo is a database
library and and I started working on
ecto almost two years ago and and I
worked on it as a summer project when I
work for it for a for full time for
about three months during the period I
was mentored by disabling and that was a
great experience for me it was the first
big elixir project I did and it was
before I was like a team member and was
it was it was because of this project
that I got to talk would you say and and
I started contributing more to coral ixr
and I could eventually become a a core
team member so I'm going to talk to talk
about four things today first off we
have the query language which is
animated language that we use for
building and composing queries secondly
the repository which is the main
interface for the database which we talk
to database from actor thoroughly the
models which is how we model database
tables with structs in in elixir and
final talk about change sets which is
how we apply changes to models and cost
and validate data so first off we have
the query language and there's quite a
lot of prior work on embedded /
languages not so much in functional
programming there's lots of PI work in
in object-oriented programming like all
the object all the object relational map
and but we were facing a lot of it from
link
and Link stands for language integrated
query and notice here that they call it
language integrate the query and that
means that when link was created it was
added on top of existing languages and
as it was added they had to extend the
syntax of those languages and had to
release new versions of those language
with new specs that that incorporated
the link syntax but in lake sir we don't
have to do that because we have meta
programming and we have macros so we
don't take that new scene texted
language we can use creo library and use
the existing tools for building dsl's so
this is how link looks like in c-sharp
so this is all syntax in c-sharp and
this will compile down to this set of
change Shane method calls and so it was
Microsoft that credit link and added to
see sharp F sharp and visual basic.net
and as they were adding linked to the
language they also added a bunch of
functional programming to language so if
you look here where is just the Eno
filter we have in elixir and select this
just a functional map and so it's very
close to functional programming and they
were also adding anonymous functions
and all of this so we were basing this a
link and but one of the biggest
difference that the query language in
lecture has from link is that the links
in texts also works for in-memory
collections as you see just so post
could just be swapped out to a list or
an oar or any kind of collection and you
can run this it works on on the
collections and in lakes roller can have
that with the with the with the existing
functional programming we had in the
Indy Indy Indy Indy mayhem in the
innumerable module and and the reason we
didn't go this way is because there's a
lot of execution semantical differences
with databases and in-memory collections
for example databases have have indexes
so this kind of query can execute very
fast learner database because this is
just an index look up but on in memory
collections you have you have to you
have to go over the whole collection so
even though they have the same syntax
you can't really write the same kind of
queries for in-memory collections and
and and for databases so that's why we
so that's why we didn't go down that
road so this is what the query syntax
looks like this particular query returns
all posts that are tagged with elixir
and it all starts out with the from
macro which you can't really see has
been highlighted here but I'm trying to
highlight the front macro
and that micro receives two arguments
first off we have the the first argument
which is the source of the query and the
source of the choir is what we call a
horrible which I will talk about more
later we also bind the source to the P
variable so that we can reference it
later here and with P tags the second
argument is the actual query expressions
which is a keyword list and here you
would have your where's your select or
device group eyes and so on and you can
even post in multiple where's that we
combined with the end what is a support
interpolation in the queries and
interpolations are so all of the query
is not really executed as electric code
except for the things that we prefix
with the hat operator so every all this
so the front mech receives a syntax tree
and we escape everything in that in that
tree so that turn so that it's not
evaluated instead of instead it's stored
as the terms for the syntax tree right
and as well as an ester and as we are
traversing the syntax tree and we see
the hat operator we stop escaping for
that expression so this part will not be
be escaped rather it will just be
evaluated as elixir code so that's how
we can inject elixir values into the
queries and and the injected elixir
values will eventually come query
parameters and since there are career
perimeters we are we're safe from SQL
injections in this case
we can also compose queries so I
mentioned so that's what I mentioned
earlier that ekta queries are composable
and it's a very important and that's a
very important part of the queries and
what the mean with that they are and
what I mean when I say compose ball is
that we can take an existing query and
we can extend it and add more things to
it so this the early card that'll show
you which returns a bunch of posts and
say they want to paginate this so so to
paginate set of results it pretty simple
we limit the results so they will get
the number of results that we want per
page and then we need to offset to the
location to the page that we are
currently on and this is pretty easy
also here you can notice that we are
interpolating the two values from the
function arguments but we're kind of we
cannot mixing to two things here so we
so we both have the fetching post part
and we have the pagelet part so if we
can split those things that will be very
good so I'm not sure if you can see what
I marked here but the mark things here
are only related to page to page in
aiding in page anything is kind of the
same for a for a for all results it's so
we can extract that into a separate
function and notice here that the
function takes a query this is the first
argument we can we can just take the
result from Alexa post from so you can
just take the result that this function
returns so the original query
and we pipe that into the page net
function and that's how we can can
compose the part that returns posts and
the part the page names right and
because we can easily compose queries we
don't need special macros for creating
scopes so a scope is simply a function
that accepts a query and extends that
query returns the query with the new
constraints from the scope and we also
have an internal sub syntax you can
write this with so this is kind of short
in text you can sometimes use so the the
front marker here from the from the
previous slide actually when we expand
the from accra we actually expand it to
this this code and this syntax I prefer
the to use the keyword syntax here but
when you're but when you're writing
one-liners or short functions the syntax
can also be useful sometimes in a
mention earlier that the first argument
of from accepts incredible so we have
seen where the from our where the from
argument is can be a post which is a
model it can also be a query and which
we see here and both those are and both
those terms implement the horrible
protocol it's a very simple protocol
it's just have a single function called
to query and it takes anything that
implements it and it converts it to a
query struct so anything that implements
the cobble anything that implements the
cardboard protocol can be acquired on
and actor ships with four
implementations of this protocol first
we have
the query a struct that has very simply
implementation to query it just returns
itself we also have atoms and atoms in
this case our module names which are the
models right you can also is so you can
also query on strings which is of the
binary type and that's what we call a
source in ecto so so that's just a
string which for sequel databases would
be a table name so you can query
directly on table names so you can do
dynamic queries that way and it works
just like going on models except you
lose a few conveniences like type
checking which talk about later and we
can't create a model struct of course we
can't create that for the results you
can also query on source model topples
so you can get the benefits of using
model but you can also switch out the
table that you are carrying on water
support fragments sequel fragments so
for example there is no down case
function in active queries so instead we
can create a sequel fragment that calls
the sequel function lower and each each
question mark here will become a
parameter to the fragment function so we
can pass in a field we can also pass in
an interpolated value and again this is
safe from sequel injections because from
is a macro so we can shake that the
arguments to fragment or actually string
literals so we so we won't accept
dynamic values there
and it was the recently added expanding
on macro so if you don't want to to
write lonely fragment functions like
this you can you can wrap you can wrap
this in a macro that expands to fragment
so you can so you can create your own so
you can create your own lower function
and we do type checking on all
expressions and we also do type checking
when you insert data and that's most
letters the convenience because most
sane databases do the type chicken for
you except for databases like my sequel
so for so if your database is my sequel
this is very helpful it's also helpful
that you don't get an error message from
the database because then you get the
sequel syntax right so with our type
checking we can show the location
exactly in the echo query where where
there was a type problem next time I'm
going to talk about the repository which
we call the repo nectar because we like
short names and we're lazy so we don't
like to type repository all the time and
so the repo is completely decoupled from
models and queries and that means that
you can create one query and you can
Mull and you can run it against multiple
repositories and you can have one model
that you can persist against different
repository and thereby different
databases and everything all the
database actions in ector goes through
the repo so it's very explicit where
your query against the database so it's
harder to have accidental database
queries like you can have in some object
relational map so it this kind of makes
everything explicit and it's and it more
in
work shows when you have like n plus 1
problems and so the repositories bunch
of functions like all that returns older
cells from a query we can insert models
we have delete all queries that deletes
all records that match the query and
what we're positive does is that it's
just calls into a database adapters we
have adapters for for postgres and my
sequel that we that we ship with there's
also a hex package that has sequel
server support so that's really cool and
the adapter holds a pool of connections
to the database and we use the library
called pool boy for that and and the
other repository a user can can check in
check out connections in a sort of
transaction and so only one process at a
time can hold a connection so we don't
have issues where a connection is used
by multiple processes at the same time
and since each connection is in a
separate process we have isolated
failures and so this is kind of it looks
like so each dots here is a separate
process and each arrow here is a link
and so if a process is to die for some
condition like the connection with die
maybe there's a bug in your driver
anything like that the process will exit
it will trigger the link that will also
send an exit to the to the repository to
the to the pool in the repository but
the pool is configured to trapped exits
and that means instead of just killing
the repository the repository will
receive in
message that it can handle so when the
process finally dies the the repository
can handle this message and you spawn a
new process and and also since links are
bi-directional if we were to stop the
repository store for our application for
some reason all the connections will
also be killed with it so so we can't
have issues where we accidentally leave
that we accidentally leave connections
running yes I mentioned the adapter that
will ship within the sequel server
support next I'm going to talk about the
model and the model is where we define
the database records and we do that with
a schema the first argument to the
schema macro is the source which is
equal databases is just name of the
database table and the second argument
is a block of code where we define the
fields and and each field has the name
of course we also give it a type and
this is the types we use when we type
checking queries and we check the way
insert correct data and so on so this
macro will create a struct with all the
fields in the schema it would also
generate a few introspection functions
that basically return the title
different fields all the fields the
table has which we use in adapters and
so on and we use for the type checking
of course it will also automatically
create a primary key you can override
this so that you can have no primary key
if you if you don't want that you can
also override the type of the primary
key so so by default it's an integer but
if you use a but if you use some kind of
other tie
for the primary key you can you can
change that will have callbacks in the
model a callback will execute before or
after you do an insert update delete or
load something from the database and you
specified like this you have like before
insert before update a function name and
a list of arguments that you want to
pass to to that function so here we're
having an example how you could
implement automatic time stamping when
you insert or update a record this is
here the first argument is is they
change it I'll get to change it in just
a moment and explain what those are and
one thing we try to will explain when we
talk about callbacks is that you should
only use it for ensuring data
consistency you shouldn't use callbacks
for application logic because that
doesn't really fit the the concept for
for callbacks can we call back you can
do stuff like time stamps which are show
here you can do optimistic locking which
is a way of ensuring that no one optoma
that no one updates the record while you
are changing it and so on we also have
associations which look like this we
have has many has one and belongs to and
you define those associations in the
schema it is very straightforward if
you're used to and you if you're used to
libraries like rails it works very much
the same so first off we have has many
which define an association to comment
which we call comments and has many
assumes that there is a it belongs to on
the other side on the comments I'd
it also assumes that there are one that
there are no or there are none or many
comments husband works the same except
that it only assumes that there is there
is one Association per post and like I
say belongs to is what you would define
on the other side so so the has
associations assume that they are field
on the other side that is called so for
so for since since this is a a post
model it's it assumes this I feel
another side called post ID and that is
exactly the field that belongs to will
generate but in this case it will be a
user ID right here which is ready also
have has many through associations and
that means for example if so assume that
each comment has a user's well so we can
assume a so we can define an association
called commit authors which we say is
going through comment and that is going
through comments and authors taken X you
can directly access all the authors of
the comments to the post we also plan to
support many to many associations but
that's not implemented yet and you can
query on these associations for example
you can preload what preload means is
that so so so there's two way to learn
on associations there's preload and
there is join right when we do i join
that's a normal sequel database join the
only special thing is that we do is that
since since this will return a new post
for every comment so the results that
would have multiple posts so you would
help you would have multiple
e that we can bind the join in a new
variable we can use that variable in the
rest of the query so we can select on
specific fields on the comment and so on
we can use it in worse if we want to
group something or you want to and or if
you want to do something else with it
next thing we have we have Shane sets
change it is how we take external data
and persist them so it's a change it so
change it does three three major three
major things it costs it costs external
it costs external parameters it's
example if you have a web app all the
input would so all the parameters could
be strings if you have like get
parameters so we can cost so we can
cause those strings to the field on the
model where we want to persist that so
if there's an ID for example we can we
can we can cause a string to the
interior in that field right and we will
also be the change it also validates
data so we have validations that we can
run against the change yet it will also
track changes so if we were updating
something it will only send the the
changes in the change set to the
database instead of updating the whole
model and this is how you would define a
asian set so the first argument here is
a user model the second argument is
external parameters
the third of four argument are the
parameters that we want to use so the
third argument is the required
parameters if any of those are missing
we will store and google store and and
that is and we will make that change it
invalid the fourth argument are the
optional parameters so we will only use
these parameters from the from the input
this is also where you define your
validations which is just pipe through
and the validations will also store will
also mark we change it as invalid if
there was any validation problems so the
usual convention is that you define this
function on your model which you call
change it and below here we have an
example of how you would call that so
this could be in your web server this
could be like a callback for a post
request which takes a connection and the
and the parameters for that request so
first off we call the function we have
above here we pass it a new model and
the parameters from the request next
time we check if the if everything was
valid so it would not be valid if there
are missing parameters if any of the
costing failed if any of the validation
failed and so on and if it is value and
if it is valid we can assert it return
ok if not we can return the same
errors and show what went wrong and
a an insert here here will insert
everything from the model including the
changes from the chain set update the
kind of does dirty tracking it will only
send the things that we actually that
was actually changed so only the
parameters so it will only send the
input parameters so ecto comes with a
bunch of types that supports out of the
box like strings engineers binaries
erase and so on but you can extend this
with your own custom types and this is
how we do this how we can cost input
parameters we also need to say how that
could be any custom type so we also need
to say how to load and dump those to the
database so one example for using custom
acted types is in hex web which is the
server part of the hex package manager
so this is the releases table which
lists all really all releases or
packages and we need to do some
validation on the parameters when
someone uploads a new release one of the
subversions because for example only we
only accept semantic versioning so we so
we need to do some validations on the
version right so what we can do is
create a version ecto type which looks
like this 82 type is a behavior it has
four functions that you need to
implement typecast load and dump type is
very simple it just returns the
underlying database type for the value
costs it what is what takes
the parameter and costs it to the
version struct so version is distracted
chips with core elixir that handles this
metric versioning in elixir so what
matically handle the version strike
that's very City cost and if it's a
string like from a web request we can
parse that if there's a parse error will
return error if the person was
successful it will turn an okay couple
with this with the first argument is the
okay Adam the second argument is the
version struct if it doesn't match
either the version strikes or a string
what mike lee treat it as an error
because we don't know what to do with it
and that will be marked as an error on
the change set the change would be
Marcus invalid and we would send a
validation failure as response as the
response to the web request we also need
to tell ecto how to load the data base
value so as I said the underlying
database value is just a string so like
a bar Shah or it takes type for sequel
databases so that's how it loads it was
need to tell actor how to how to dump it
down to the string value again and
that's just a quota to string they
cannot fail so we are too so we wrap it
in the okay topple so this is kind of
extend actos types and it's how you can
define costing for types that take the
doesn't support so i think this is a
very useful feature yep
finally it's the last thing I want to
talk about is how phoenix the neck to
integrate so Phoenix doesn't ship with a
database layer instead it defines
protocols that are kind of the injection
points for a database layer so therefore
there are four protocols in in phoenix
that can be extended for a database
adapter first we have form data which is
if you remember from Chris's talk he
showed when you showed the generators he
showed like how you can insert a new
posts and that uses form data so the
Phoenix ecto project which you can find
here implements form data for Shane sets
so with this we can automatically give
Phoenix knowledge about the errors in
the change sets it knows about the
fields on the model and so on also have
HTML safe that is which we implement for
which is how phoenix ensures that you
don't have light cross-site request a
cross-site scripting and so on so if
something is not HTML safe it will be
scape if it is safe you will not be
escaped we implement these four so make
two types that are that are safe like
decimals date times date.timezone
Phoenix also ships with poisoned which
is its Jason parser and encoder to
implement that for the same ektu types
will also implement plug exception which
is a very simple protocol it just takes
an exception and returns a DP the HTTP
status code for for that exceptions so
for example a a cost error would be a
400 bad request a no results error from
from actor would be a 404 not found in
status code and so that's very cool and
it kind of shows how elixir has very
good accessibility so we can so we can
we can have a separate web framework
library and database library and still
make them communicate in a very nice
manner that's it about ecto if you have
any questions we have like five minutes
for them or over ten to five minutes
execute yeah so there are two ways to do
that ideally you would use fragments but
that doesn't work always because you
might not want because a can't express
everything with fragments but you call
you can call the adapters directly where
you just pass a sequel string and the
and the query and the query parameters
and that uses the same pooling from the
repository and all that so yeah
I'm a very aware off link you most of my
time working in that place was working
was Errol and act record so my question
asks about features allow parallel
because I think that Earl I'm not
familiar with that ah so because one of
the strongest points for sequel I think
its mathematical background so I'm not
super familiar with active record
because or or rails I'm not sure if I
can answer the question where well just
say can probably Arsenal were well but i
think that the query select arrived
today is very expressive you can do
almost anything with it so i'm not sure
if you would need anything more than
that if you say has a name but
if you have an example oh I would love
to see what exactly because you kept
everything well i'm working on a
reporting enjoy and it was quite complex
where he including counting repression
and if I somewhat could grab using arrow
when I was born again to Phoenix an
elixir I ended up just planning to call
sequel wearing two rails council a copy
there
ok
today wanna just inside the same
business on your question about yep so
so all callbacks runs we if it's if you
have not defined on a transaction
yourself we automatically wrap it in a
transaction so that the callbacks runs
in the same transaction as the query
that you're running yeah
we don't there's very many postgres data
types so we can't possibly support them
all and there are lots of extensions
that we could also support I hope that
we can so that we can ship with Jason
sport in the future but with ekta types
and the database library that we're
using that is called post cracks in post
breaks you can create extensions so if
you create extensions for the data type
you can create extensions for all
postcodes data types and you kind of
define to calculate your own encode and
decode functions to between the
serialized data type and the electric
terms and with that and ekta types you
can do you can support any postgres
types there's a question in the back as
well
so validation on the side it's still
possible that for example when you
insert a record fail because validate
some uniqueness and there's a like
double clicks and inserts a second
record that feels is there some special
handling for that
so we have a uniqueness validation
that's not perfect because there's the
race condition that you talked about and
that would raise a adapter specific
extension which you can handle but it's
not really supported in ecto you kind of
have to know the error code that you get
from the adapter and hannah let yourself
yeah that's an error code yet you don't
have to parse the string you can match
against so marked in recently
implemented conversion between postgres
error code and atoms so if you know the
name for the for the failure you can
just match against that yeah yeah in the
frontier
so prospects in my seek you are
supporting something else there's no
plans for sick you light or Oracle as
far as I know and we're not sure if
anyone is working on it we have plans
for experimenting with no sequel
databases so sick you later basis is
pretty straightforward to implement for
actos it's just a matter of someone
doing it right either the core devs or
someone contributing it during the
summer we're going to see how far we can
get with no sequel databases if we can
we can support no sequel databases in
with the query language that we have the
models that we kind of have and so on so
after the summer we will know if we can
support no sequel sequel we can easily
support anything
the
right so to kind of two questions I'm
going to answer the first one first and
so the goal of vector was never to
create a library for no sequel databases
so we started out with just supporting
postgres and as a side effect that it
became kind of psycho centric and there
was always kind of the goal to to
support sequel databases or that was the
primer go now we're going to see if we
can support no sequel if we can that
would be great if not that's okay too
you can create the other libraries that
matches no psychosomatics in a better
way because I think it's going to be
very difficult to support all no sequel
database well that's going to be
possible so no no sequel was never the
primary goal seek sequel what's the
primary goal and the second question is
why we create a DSL over sequel and it's
because the dsl and the models and the
callbacks and the same sets bring a lot
of very useful features like the queries
how you can compose them it's kind of
it's it's very hard to compose just
sequel strings right and we still have
like the protection against sequel
injection and all that then we're models
and callbacks yeah so I think it brings
a lot over just pure sequel strings
another question
in
ok
exactly no but like I've said the
dismantle for no sequel is very very
different an ecto is targeted against
sequel databases so I don't think that
we should try to like make the de cual
es el work for no sequel and make the
models kind of work for key value stores
and for document models and so on I
think if we can make it work that would
be awesome but I'm not sure if it's
