i'm martin from google and i will talk
about how to ship new code without
taking your system down so basically
probably already t said a bit and we
heard what code preload stuff mentioned
but actually going to do so give me a
quick show of hands how many of you only
call and have have ever had that titus
change or did it themselves that's
awesome I guess the others don't own a
car and how many of you have done that
while driving the car okay I show you I
showed you how it's possible to good
okay so um to get started how would you
really go about updating a software
usually right so the usual thing is you
just download a new thing and then you
usually start your application event
start running the new version that's
that's what everybody does and if that
works for you you should do that too
because then you can save all the
trouble of updating your code so
updating by restart it's simple it's
common it works for all languages will
have support for the fancy stuff and you
have to support and the cons down here
they they might not be that much of a
problem for you because the fact that
you use in memory state of your sister
might be covered by the fact that you
don't have the state in memory at all it
might have it in a database it's a
different system
by the way stock and the other thing the
fact that it updates your availability
might also not really affect end users
because you might have multiple
instances of your application running on
different machines and you have a load
balancer in front of it and no one would
ever know that you'll be signed in the
video instances of your app so do that
if you can but it's other that's not
that exciting so what we want to do is
the hot code loading part so changing
the tires while driving and to to get
started with this um I've also brought
you some demo application here so I'll
use this split screen layout so on the
upper part I would usually just run the
demo application and you see it's
starting up here's an education called
them or and all it does is it's looping
and has some stayed in fact which is
this counter here which keeps
incrementing so every two seconds it
spits out this message incrementing the
counter telling us online the iteration
of the Lewbert ass so in the bottom part
of the screen window I'm going to run
shell commands and also use that to
attach to the running application which
is also a pretty cool island feature if
you think about you can actually sort of
ssh into your running application by
attaching a console to it and in
director is a directive to achando we
can ask it hey which applications do you
run the note ah ok so I apart from the
mandatory colonel stuff basically you
are running our demo for the uninfected
today so that's all good and fun let's
look at the code so the main part of the
code is basically this so we start up a
loop start with the state condo being
one let's leave a while announcer
this message down here and then lupus
account being implemented by one so
that's all areas so then let's roll up
our sleeves in and try the hot covering
right so first I guess we want to do
some change in our software um let me
change the message here because it's
much better to have a lot of pluses in
front of it I save it save the file I
recompile it ok part I'm going back to
our console here application on top is
to run I instruct the Erlang virtual
machine tool to reload the particular
module which is 10 where s RB plus the
one that we just edited and we compiled
and bam it says ok I reloaded the demo
as are we sigh so must be right hmm yeah
that didn't work so well I guess she'll
try again I try again no whoo oh oh yeah
oh dear how we have crashed on Brittany
member and then we're application has
been shut down okay um it was the first
tried right so much might be expected so
to understand what was going on here
let's look at this little illustration
sasa was little so when we the learning
vm has a simple the whole server and and
this one is basically responsible from
loading the bytecode compiled thing from
this into the vm and when we when we
started the system and try to start
using modules it would initially load
them and one when we told it with the
elk
to load it again from this we had a
situation which is like this so we have
the old version still around as Robert
already mentioned we have two versions
and in this code sorry max any of the
current version which is the one that we
just love it and if you have an actual
process running some code it will
happily always execute in that
particular code so if you you can
imagine like program counter pointing
into that specific code in memory and it
keeps running that so if you do
something like this here is a local
function call you call function B this
will then still be executed in the very
same version all right so it will never
get out of there if you really want to
use the latest version of the proper
code module then you need to call the
function differently then you need to
prefix that wisdom of your name in this
cases just hold em so we call the
function d here it which needs to be an
external and exported function and when
we do that then we have and then we can
jump over to the new version of the code
so if you want to enable hot code
loading and we have sort of these
looping constructs we have to basically
design our code in a way that actually
uses exported version of the functions
otherwise it will not work at worse once
we load it again the second try we did
then this old version will no longer
exist basically because then we have
this version and and another one but the
process wants to run the version that is
no longer there and then all the vm can
do is just kill the process and level
crash and that's what we saw ok so um
that's let's get back to our code so if
you want to make this actually work we
need to do this loop call here through
the module
as this module macro that you can use
for that and then as a saying that you
also need to do is have it export it so
raloo one needs to be there okay all I
can also let me reword be about this
message changed to effectively to every
started basically okay so with this
setup now I forgot to compile I think I
just do that first with this setup now I
start the application again I also need
to restart the console because if i try
to interact with note that were formerly
was attached with and it can't because
the application fresh earlier so i also
need to reattach the console okay so now
we have a system that is actually
prepared to handle the kind of hot photo
rhythms so if we now do our change here
in crystal classes be safe you compile
and B load the module again hang on
drumroll aah hmm that's how do I
expected and also if must have done
something wrong clearly so I forgot to
say after the message change I think so
all right let's try again so it's not a
text for this time so now the drum roll
come on
and also notice that the internal stages
of course unaffected by this that's fine
just let's do that again Oh Alice alt is
a message can't get used to it did I
actually say that this time I did all
right and he loaded and the next round
we get the message cool that's great so
we walked around the first structure if
you want a hot code reloading you need
to have exported functions and all these
if you're looping constructs so let me
clear that usually I think it's pretty
rare that you have these kind of
processes those another homegrown loop
going on so usually you would have
something like cancer or other OTP
behaviors so that's let me check out a
different version of this application
step 3 okay so let's also make this one
like a nexus start it yep so this is now
running again server let's see how that
looks like starting at the top says it
can serve behavior and you notice that
the began server callbacks that we need
to implement this this behavior they are
all exported so the actual gain server
process will fall into a hole bags
through this module external call
pattern so whenever we change something
here should be good okay so and also
that there's also another saying let me
first do something else so like changing
the message steps may be a bit boring in
real life you see that the skin server
carry some state and you might want to
extend this stage because in
more features in your system so let's
say we want to keep track of the last
last thing that we received in a
different field of the state record if
you just do that okay and then of course
the question arises if we look at the
computer console again and as it is a
OTP behavior now we can also use a
system or sis module for example and now
if you know about that was pretty handy
so you can ask them and OTP compliant
sing for its current internal state so
if you are sued mrs early for its
current internal safe replies with
current state that record so you see it
has this one field which is only the
integer and let's reflect a what we see
above it's always a number for the next
iteration okay so the question now is
that we have changed the record
definition how do we transform this
internal state into a new version of the
internal site that has this additional
field and you might have come across
this foreleg function here which is
called code change it's also mandatory
to implement as part of against her
behavior and let's see what what would
happen um so if you have a code change
going on that we just just a bit a
feeling for it we just log in as a
message that basically locks all the
arguments that we got for the call okay
so we did a code change I saved I did
compile I will float the demo as are we
okay
so what now then who is doing this
re-insert for a while now ah so not only
didn't we see the code change message
that we were hoping for but also the
application had stopped doing its thing
not so great let's see where that is so
we have the callback handle info that
handle says pain message that pattern
matches against the save record with a
new code version that we have it expects
a state record with two fields and if we
look for the console and ask the demo
sov for its internal state it only has
just one hit the old one of course so
this clause will not match and we have
this clause here that matches any
message and any state and it does
exactly nothing now and that's what what
we're seeing right so does exactly
nothing so if you if you change data
structures you have to be aware that
your code needs to be able to handle
this somehow alright so and I would want
you to have these catch-all clauses
easily just don't have any cash or
clauses or if you need them or want them
for whatever reason then I would suggest
you're always at least match for the
current data data structure of your
state so if you do that and some time
did not compile I did if I now load to
them are SME something else will will
happen so we get a nice crash here what
you have it's our leg you have a
supervisor on top of our game server and
it immediately restarts it okay the
the state is basically lost to it starts
counting from one again but it is upper
body and doesn't just sit there and
idols and also as a plus when we ask the
person trying to say now we already have
the new record to finish many places you
know uses a second field yet but any
sort state measures of definition so
that might already be good enough in a
lot of cases because the system
continued working some state was lost
but that might be acceptable so if
that's not acceptable to you then
there's only one means left which is a
thing called release upgrades and that
is necessary to actually trigger this
pro change call that function that we
were hoping for to see already but
didn't so if you want to have actual
code running transforming your internal
state doing separate steps and whatever
you gotta do release are great so what
do we need for release upgrades I guess
it's pretty obvious that we do need
releases and releases are a form of
packaging your Erlang application in a
certain way I also have another commit
for that for so this is how committed
contains release name down one clear
these screens take a quick look so the
game server itself that's still the same
all right it not adorable so reverted
the state record to its one field cow
yeah but what is new about the release
is some saying some tool in which is
called the rel tool that needs the
config file and the pontiff I need to
explain what kind of
and in this case we're building a
release demo with the name one and here
this is what should be the contents of
this release and in essence just
contains our little damn where okay and
also if you want to work with
application upgrades in as part of this
release upgrades which we want then you
also need to have a heavier versioning
right in your application description
right so your OTP application behavior
should also meaningful version because
if you want to upgrade then need to keep
track of these things so how does that
work now we can make maybe something
like a deploy here a little main target
to spare me some typing so what that
does it does generate the release as s
of the description we just saw that
takes a lot because it really packages
into entire running runtime system
together with all the libraries and your
own application into into one directory
which then can be deployed in your
server I just kind of simulate that we
just move the generated demo folder to a
horrible demo deploy it which you could
imagine living on a remote machine and
you would there then start there I will
just start here so I'm starting the the
application from the release holding off
and give them or deployed one you see it
is doing what it did ever always you can
also you can also attach the console as
we did before and that's it I'd sort of
have which applications it would still
run the demo app as we did before so
let's do a release operate so again to
spare me some typing i just reset
seems that five should be good yeah okay
so we know how to demo too let's look at
that so this now has to field record
definition with the last ping and it
also features some implementation that
actually uses this feels or it expects
the sping and as he also announces it
together miss account and what we now do
it is we change the code change call beg
we still show the message here but what
we do before we return the new state we
call a function called upgrade state
with the old state and that would just
step on down here just matches on the
old record definition with one field and
returns a new one with with a new field
is a time stand editing okay so that's
that also if you look at the relative
conflict that has changed too now we
called release demo 2 and refreshing the
buffer also the application is also
incremented to for sanity to have the
demo version so let's make an upgrade
see what this target does so again it
starts by generating a release we'll put
it in the demo folder it but the release
will be the demo to release again the
safes couple of seconds and then the
next step is something that is called
generate a cop's so application updates
and then you need to specify from which
release are we upgrade so in this case
we want to upgrade from the version that
is run in
then we'll deploy it for them so it says
generated the app up for us of the demo
application and then the last step is to
generate the actual upgrade against
previous release and it says demo to
upgrade package is created and this demo
to upgrade package service a handy
toyota gzip file which you can then move
over to your server and it has all the
nice things that need started to upgrade
your application so in this case i just
move it to this down deployed folder
into its releases subfolder where this
one would expect it let's fire the
console and shrink to the one so then
there is the same quarter release
handler which we then can ask to unpack
the release name demo2 and it says okay
nice i just unpacked the version named
two and we can also ask this release
handler which releases doesn't know
about zoom in so it knows about them or
to relieves that we just unpacked it's
in the same unpack and it's just a list
of all the same sentence contains all
the libraries and it also knows about
their demo one release and this one is
mark permanent and permanent means that
this is a release that the note would
boot up right so if i stop the
application above and we started this
mark permanent one is the one that gets
started okay so we're in good shape zoom
back so we see they have running then
you can ask the release handler to
install the release
not demo2 for just the two is that how
you know something interesting happen I
will scroll back so we can what it was
so we had a brownie with the old message
was at 140 then we got our code changed
call them and these are the arguments so
the first one is the old version of the
module and in this case because we
didn't specify it as part of the module
metadata what this version should read
like is just as a hash of the
authorizing the bytecode so super useful
in our case but it also gives us the old
say this already contains 1.1 which
would be the next language right and our
code upgrade function must have worked
because the next iteration we are seeing
that we are displaying the last few
times that it was crazy now format there
and say it was kept otherwise so that's
nice that's us to release anger again
which releases doesn't know about so it
has demo to still and this is not marked
current because it's actively running as
you saw and it has been one but this one
is still more prominent so again we
could basically revert to change by just
restarting to note it with their own
release because that's still permanent
so if you if you're happy with release
and the final step is to ask the release
handler to make this version to the
permanent one and then you see that demo
2 is permanent whereas demo one is
Marcus oh it so is also still around and
potentially you could also downgrade the
system which is not really supported by
the rebar application update default
singie that it generates I can quickly
show you that so you do
the rel demo
that's a file that we were generated for
us a certification upgrade that business
s if you want to go to work with
application version 2 and you're coming
from one and you need to update the
module demo SRV you can pass in some
extra arguments that was would be the
ones that you would end up getting in
your code changed message as an extra
parameter you can also specify a list of
modules that you're depending on these
would then the update before but as you
also see this this goes here and you
back would be the downgrade pass so if
you want down read back to one that you
would need some instructions on how to
do that and and we were just does not
generate that by default but no one
would keep you from editing this F up
file of course okay so that's how you
change tires you still don't believe
that's possible i see i promise you just
show you that take a look um look at
these guys
you know their okay so we're stuck
with softly so this is a pup stuff to
sum it up it offers a lot of additional
features that you can do there any meat
just did a basic module swap here and
you did change the internal site that
was proof as I said you can also handle
module dependencies by saying which
modules need to be updated before this
one it also features means to change a
supervisor because just changing
supervisor code does not alter the
children it is currently running and
sings and can facilitate that you can
also have arbitrary function calls that
get executed as part as your upgrade and
you can also work with these
applications adding there and moving
studying changing the configuration so
yeah that's that's pretty cool to get
all of the advantages of the plain hot
coding which has some limitations of
course when it comes all these edge
cases but don't underestimate the amount
of work you would wanna put into this if
you really want to make sure say you
have some installation deployed at your
customers site and you just hand them
this release upgrade file and expected
to kind of work in the wild with all
possible states that might be in all the
servers that would need a lot of testing
and and sort for later and of course
it's not really limited but it works
really well with
penis when she should then custom okay
yeah same as the last speaker to have
the slides and and all the code in this
repository can follow along persecute
commit history and was that I think I
can take couple of questions 2 questions
okay so start in real time okay maybe
not a question but using rebar is really
nice thing because you could evaluate
for example veterans as a fact which
calling some shelves online right so
using this one and they need some
standard like reduce release and unities
it could make some automation should
always try to update it using the update
command on release in alley right same
way so this is really nice in the basic
examples is invaluable remark so if you
have a lot of basically conventions
established in your project and you use
the rebar tooling then you can make this
process of doing release upgrades pretty
simple still if you expect it to always
work testing is kind of mandatory ok one
more question yep how many so usually I
use the hot pot reloading approach
whistling systems because I kind of fear
the amount of work and to put into the
release upgrades and usually a lot of
changes don't really involve that much
of data structure changes of internal
state or if you kind of expect that to
happen in advance and you can also have
your code written in a way that it does
not follow over for example
record we could accuse the prop list
where we can easily have an extra loot
and the old code wouldn't bother and the
new protein bars are missing it so
things like that so I think this hot
coat the plain hot pot reloading works
really well in a lot of cases but
sometimes it also needs some manual work
when it comes to say supervisors you
have a new process you will then you
need to go to your running system and I
basically start that up manually okay
one more okay even one more question if
there's one yeah the beam itself okay
sounds amazing maybe you can think of
another video where they build a new
road underneath
