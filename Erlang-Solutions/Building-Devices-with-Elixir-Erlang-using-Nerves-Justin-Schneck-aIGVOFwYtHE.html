commanding voice anyway sometimes though
going handheld today we have some
special guests but here i'm talking to
you about going from prototype to
production using nerves to be able to
create some connected hardware but first
i want to take a moment to be able to
sort of reflect about how and every talk
that i ever put together it seems like
you get to the venue and then you end up
watching other people talking it's just
so inspirational that you just at the
end of every one you're like okay that's
really cool i should rewrite part of my
slides because i'm crazy well i went and
i I didn't really necessarily go that
far this time but I do want to touch on
something and that is a some inspiration
I took from our opening keynote
yesterday and as she was talking through
the realities of what it's like to build
communities in software I started to
feel like similarities in the landscape
of hardware so I first I want to talk
about what is the landscape what is the
feeling like when it comes to hardware
and from the top level perspective when
once you spoke about the the feeling of
building these communities and and what
it's like to be able to be interacting
with other software engineers and and
sharing knowledge it's it seems
sometimes like when it comes to embedded
hardware that's a that's not necessarily
always the case and a lot of times what
you'll get is these like siloed
workforces of people building hardware
that behind closed doors that they don't
they have something very special that
they're making and and theirs is going
to beat that yours to market and and and
and in early software things were a lot
like this as well and that open source
sort of just came along and accelerated
everything and so I sort of had this
meant this thought this mentality of
like you know what was stuff like and
where are we going next and and I
envisioned the
this sort of infinite pattern that we
fall ourselves into we're back in the
day and I'll make that an open timeline
we worked on things like hardware
products we built things that made our
lives feel better physical objects we
made like CD players and and stuff like
that and there is software that ran on
those hardware products but the intent
was to be able to get the hardware out
and then throughout the time we ended up
bringing on a lot of applications
software developers around maybe like
mid 90s or so people started getting
into the actual just heart of the
software aspects of programming where
you're making systems that are just able
to orchestrate and bring together
workflows and then Along Came web
development and just blew everything
away once the web opened up it seems
like we started to embrace the paradigms
of open-source software on sharing
knowledge between other groups and in
that transition it sort of felt like the
hardware design companies that the
hardware that we were building it it has
some should say comparatively to just
what a software developer gets to feel
like it has a few sort of disadvantages
in that yes it does take a little longer
to be able to iterate these kind of
things because when it's in the field
it's really difficult for you to just
apply a software update to be able to
fix some hardware problem that you may
have been countered so you got to get it
right you have to spend time and that
usually delays things to market and thus
that ends up spreading out those
timelines further and making that into
that property more valuable that
intellectual property so where are we at
today well we're advancing through the
forms of web development into an area
where it's no longer connectivity with
desktops and laptops and tablets and
these are the things that we're used to
but our lives are now being brought in
tuned with sensors and data and
everything the Internet of Things I said
it that's it
I'll let that one go for four maybe I'll
just do a one but now that everything is
going to have an IP address and we need
networks and we need things to be able
to - what we have the capabilities of
doing this is what we've answered
whether or not we should we have to be
determined but we have the capabilities
of doing this and the people that are on
the edge of being able to just reach
down and grab that sensor data it's
often times now presented with a lot of
web developers because now with
advancements in web technologies like
adding into the Phoenix framework having
the ability of having channels we have
the we have this fast-moving fast-paced
group of developers giving them the
capability of saying hey hardware guys I
need this and if we could just extend
their arm a little further so that they
could actually build it themselves as
well then they can create a new
innovative products with having little
knowledge or little experience about
being able to get started with hardware
one example of which is somebody thought
that smart water I guess wasn't smart
enough and that instead it needs to have
its own smart water bottle we too can
make creative products like this no
longer are you bound by the chains of
thirst tell you that you should drink
water mind you it got almost uh over
half a million dollars in backers so
these things are real and people are
spending their money on them but the
hard part about it is that hardware is
hard I mean if it wasn't hard we
wouldn't we'd all be doing it very
easily and there's a lot of stuff that's
bringing to the market the ability for
us to do this I mean it's so hard part
is in the main so over the years things
have been able to start to get a little
bit easier there's been advancements in
a technology that gives people the
ability of getting started faster
Arduino is one it's a low-level
microcontrollers that you can then have
very easy familiar to use IDE it's more
welcoming to software developers it's
got a community of
libraries and people behind it that
share a lot of knowledge and so for new
people coming in there's a really easy
and convenient places to be able to go
to get started and then further along
came Raspberry Pi foundation where they
provided single board computers that run
Linux they're more powerful they have
higher connectivity to the to the world
they have higher languages that you can
run on them and aside from all that we
have this movement now towards open
source hardware and open source software
that runs on it
thus giving us this now freedom to no
longer have to depend on using C C++ or
the sort of shelled jailed knowledge
that the groups of hardware developers
contain so what's uh what's actually
bringing these things forward you know
what what are we talking about in this
case well for to audiences specifically
and the birth of this happened pretty
much in in the maker market maker faire
make magazine Raspberry Pi foundation
they're putting together programs and
literature to be able to make it more
accessible for people to build this
stuff now I had an experiment on this my
own as a maker so sort of where I
started tinkering with things I
originally started using Arduino and
everything was great until the moment
where I decided I want to put this thing
on the internet and be able to
communicate with it from somewhere else
like my cell phone and that got to a
point where was really difficult with
just lower-level languages and
lower-level processes having the
experience of being able to use
higher-level languages I expected more
and so here's a snapshot of one of my
first projects we built a metod system
into this is now you this is using some
nerves devices so we have a wireless
embedded nerves device in a motorcycle
jacket that synchronizes with the
computer that's on the motorcycle so
that the blinkers the stop indicator and
also the ECU would be able
to be communicated with from cellphone
so the way that's actually worked in the
long-term it's really cool you just you
know it connected over Bluetooth so as
you walk up to it your phone connects to
it in your pocket it realizes you're
wearing the jacket so it just starts the
bike for you and then when you get off
of it and walk away it just shuts off
safety first it reads to make sure the
parking is is that it's not in gear when
you get off of bed never- from there I
ended up building some other devices
hack together some temperature
controllers and brewing systems for
being able to do fermentation control
for brewing beer because that's really
important when you know you're hacking
on hardware and things don't go your way
nothing beats that then a nice tall cold
beverage but you know nerves and these
devices they're not just for makers
they're also being able to be used for
professionals for production this is a
beautiful shot from the mezzanine at a
distillery in Pennsylvania that uses
nerves to be able to automate the still
we read temperature sensors from the
probes in the top of the stacks and then
use that to be able to actuate water
valves so that we can control the amount
that it steps down on the still which
allows us to be able to very fine tune
grain the exact sort of percentage by
volume of alcohol that actually gets
output from it but not just them there's
a wide variety of people that are using
nerves in production including a
National Association of Realtors I know
Chris this year and he's going to be
chatting about that we have a rose point
navigation they use it on both social
still the tote and farmbot and so for
those of you who don't know me or May I
work for without and in production we
use nerves to be able to automate a lot
of our warehousing equipment there's a
certain level of service that's not
really available on the market for what
we need to be able to do so we want to
build custom devices and control the
workflow from end to end giving us the
ability of connecting our embedded
devices running a
sir all the way up to our SAS
application running elixir using this
kind of connectivity and so before we go
into talk about what exactly nerves is
and to break that down I wanted to just
hit on this point of what it's like to
be able to create these devices and
since this talk is from production the
prototype I thought nobody better to be
able to do this then farmbot and so
farmbot is the device that runs nerves
and here we have Conor Rigby from
farmbot I just like to give him a chance
to be able to give you a thought on his
experience using it to build the fun
looking awesome robot that's in front of
you right now
Conor yes you will this is these fun
moments like giving a demo swapping a
mic back yeah easy all right I'm gonna
try to stick this right pocket can you
guys hear me okay I'm not good at start
speaking in front of people
um can I make this go to my just oh yeah
we'll do that way so we'll give a brief
history real quick I don't know if how
well you can see that I was taking quite
a long time ago that's what it used to
look like it was just a mess over bins
and stuff and we didn't even have the
Raspberry Pi we used to have Raspberry
Pi to control it now we didn't even have
it we're just hardwired in there with an
older laptop so we called that the dark
ages it was written in Ruby it
apparently is Ned DB which I did not
know I was not part of the company at
this point in time oh we did we we put
it on the Raspberry Pi and it was
terrible I when I first started this was
the installation instruction we gave
this to people in production we told
them you know install raspbian apt-get
upgrade get cloned blah blah blah let's
say I think I got a list of it here oh
so that was before this is what it looks
like now and
just a huge thing it took like two hours
just to set up the device is terrible
back then when you want it to update it
you just use get its magic easy so now
it's super easy we've got an image on
github we just host it there you
download it you burn it just the same as
you would as raspbian and then it all
just works there's an SSID that comes up
called farm bought you click on it and
it captive portal to updating super easy
now you just click the Update button
done the rest of that is can you make
this go to Chrome I don't know it'll be
easier yes sure
improv music okay so I'm going to give a
quick demo and we're going to hope it
works
I think I saw that right and we'll yeah
it sure how the heck does not work so
hopefully you guys can see that and
hopefully our JavaScript loads yeah I've
got a
there is no magic trick make react work
faster it's probably webpack going on
the background
it never works I've got I've got a
tether I grab my phone running pretender
- there's one everything together now
even that is oh there we go area so hey
magic that's the hard part
yeah go for it
it's the it's my demo one so don't
matter control it walk out my house so
this is extremely difficult to can to do
oh there we go yeah I think that you
want to hold the table there a little
bit so we've got a pretty basic
interface that sounds like is binding
real easily
I haven't transported this thing since
it was brought to me so I don't know how
well it actually works after being
ripped apart in my car for three days
and we call this part here nap the
control panel because there's just too
many options to configure so hopefully
that makes it work a little bit smoother
oh there we are much better
so it's just a big CNC machine basically
a 3d printer with a magnet on the end of
it right here and unfortunately I don't
have any actual plants here they didn't
want to come with me but we have this
whole sequence builder here that lets
you control how it moves around in its
plane and you know move its plants
around and I don't know if it'll
actually run it will try it I don't know
what that is
I don't speak LSX hey that did work kind
of so it kind of works that's not all I
have to say for it right now um this is
not our full-scale one obviously it
comes in a much bigger package I call
this my farm bought dev kit and I
started out with it started out with a
Ruby I rewrote it in probably about a
month in all your liquor using nerves
cool yeah what to do it grows plants
sorry I missed that part I get it does
the forming for me so you don't have to
yeah I'm scared of this thing we got to
set it back down yeah I'm just here to
be pulling off nothing B yeah yeah I
feel I'm feeling I'm feeling the pain
for the robot all right
and putting mics on I'm taking mics off
beautiful alright so that was farm but
so now I want to just talk about what
it's like to be able to actually build
devices using their than what is nerves
itself well we nervous built on using a
airline but you know we gravitated
towards the lick sir and with our lang
and elixir
we found that using these constructs to
be able to create a robot to create
hardware and machines was felt very
natural and for several reasons first
off well we all know the fault-tolerant
story you've got the ability of
supervising a network of different
connected hardware or you've got
different sensors and having fault
tolerance gives you the ability of
monitoring processes that you have that
are parsing protocols or maybe you'd
have some ports that are
when that are reaching out and
communicating with sensors or other
devices on your network in addition the
pattern matching story is is very
beautiful when it comes to being able to
communicate with these devices and
sensors the data streams that are coming
in this makes it really easy to be able
to just enumerate over them and break
them apart and be able to understand
them a lot better and also connectivity
as I said when it comes to lower-level
pieces of hardware and microcontrollers
it's really difficult to be able to get
out to the internet with them to be able
to reach outside and and get them
connected online being able to use
raspberry PI's and other systems like
that give you the ability of getting on
the network and being able to get out
there so what exactly is nerves well in
our approach what we have is we
basically take Linux and Linux kernel
when some user lands space stuff so and
we marry that with your application that
lives inside of the airline VM so we
take airline VM and we take Linux and we
basically take Linux's initialization
systems that would normally boot like
system D you'd as we replace them
completely by getting it right to the
airline VM which means that all of the
initialization of all the subsystems
happens from as fast possible inside of
your application and so this lower-level
piece here we call this the nerves
platform and so this is essentially what
kind of Linux kernel what kind of system
you're going to be running on top of and
the flexibility that you get here with
Linux is that you get all of these
drivers and all of the the low-level
details of the work that's been done
over the years to be able to support all
of you know connected Wi-Fi chip this
and blah blah blah all this kind of
different stuff you'd want to plug into
it and in a way that we support a lot of
popular platforms using that so with
nerves you can get started on a lot of
these different devices out of the box
all the different raspberry PI's
raspberry pi 0 including the 0w I
believe this some ongoing work with that
but I think it's actually pretty much
getting there with a support we did a
seminar with the Lincoln smart duo it's
pretty cool little MIPS processor it's
got a microcontroller on the back of it
actually connected directly to one of
its serial ports it's pretty neat it's
kind of like having an Arduino and a
Linux PC like all in the same thing and
then we also support other stuff like
beagle and black big one green the Lego
ev3 it's pretty fun for doing stuff with
robots and the Intel Galileo and the
nice thing here is that these aren't the
only platforms are the only boards that
you can use with nerves they're just the
ones that we officially did the work
forward support out of the box since
nerves is built on the technology called
build group under the hood essentially
it's it's fairly easy with the
minimalist minimalist amount of work to
be able to take any build routes
compatible board and fairly easily get
it up and running into an herbed
platform image that you can then use
later so how do you communicate with
some of the outside world
well what nerves your application has
the ability of being able to also
include any C and C++ that you might
want to bring in so if you've already
had some code that you had written that
needs to be able to interrupt in C or
C++ our tool chains that we supply as
part of the package will automatically
bring those that stuff and cross compile
it to be able to run on that target in
addition we have a series of frameworks
to be able to get you up and running and
started as I mentioned once you're
inside of the VM since we replace a lot
of the traditional initialization
systems it's up to you to be able to
bring up some of these subsystems and so
we provide a led's firmware update
mechanisms and curses libraries Wi-Fi
Ethernet GPIO a great deal of helpful
things to be able to use inside of the
Erlang VM and then for distributing your
systems or for actually burning it onto
the cards
we're built on something called we use
something called fw up and one of the
nerves core team members Frankenmuth
wrote this utility it doesn't actually
have to be used only with nerve if
you're doing other embedded hardware
development and you wanted a firmware
update mechanism that can just flash
over stuff and do a firmware update this
actually will do it with nice
configuration values well
and so what essentially our firmware
looks like that gets burned under the
device we have the boot partition this
is where your bootloader is going to go
and then we have to firmware partitions
that we layout we only make one of them
active at a time and then we also give
you extra data partitions everything but
everything on this this side actually is
read-only and that's nice because if you
yank the power out of it which is
expected in these in these situations
it's not going to corrupt things and you
have readwrite partitions where you can
actually store some data and persist it
those may become corrupted so there's
often strategies you'll find where
you'll boot into the read-only would
because you know it's going to work and
then you'll just triage in case
something happen to your readwrite
partitions and maybe you just flash them
back from a seed so that you don't
actually brick the device you'll just be
able to recover so there's some
different design techniques that we use
in this case there's a for soft
real-time you can just basically go and
use the Erlang VM to communicate with
some packages that you have one of which
in this case is elixir ale and that
contains a support for being able to use
GPIO communicate with spy devices as
well as ice core C and that might be
like a temperature sensor and you can
just ask for that information
periodically
if you have more hard real-time time
deadlines you can use nerves in a way
that allows your Linux machine that's
still running soft real-time to just
sort of supervise and monitor connected
devices in hardware that might you might
take a microcontroller that's running or
your hardened deadlines to communicate
with the sensor and then periodically
pull it or get some interrupts on when
there's information available that way
you just offload the hard real-time
processing and you'll just sort of do
what a lick sir and Erlang do best which
is send messages and make sure it's
alive
to get started with nerves it's really
easy you just type in the world's
longest URL we're making that a little a
little shorter but we got to get our SSL
Certificates up you can actually find
this on our getting started pages which
is the next slide anyways you have to
install an archive using mix and
basically with wood nerves will compile
anything as
long as it compiles under mix because
that's the environment that we we
bootstrap around and then you can use
our new project generator to be able to
just get up and running with mix nerves
new as I said we have a great series of
Doc's that are on hex Doc's you can
check out getting started guys here
it'll it'll give you all the other
information there's a few utilities like
fw up that you'd need to install on your
system and if you want to do able to
just jump get down and dirty with it you
can actually just check out our nerves
example repository which we keep
up-to-date with the latest versions of
nerves where you can do stuff like blink
LEDs and play around with GPIO and
there's also a bunch of different
examples for getting connected to
networks and doing some more advanced
topics as well so No
well so I had the pleasure of having
Connor make the fool of himself and do a
demo so now it's my turn and these
things do always go perfect so I'm
pretty sure that everybody can hear me
in this case I'm just going to set this
mic down for now and escape out of this
and I'm going to try to get us to a
reasonable a reasonable that's pretty
reasonable
that's not that's not as reasonable
we'll get a realistic ish resolution
more more reasonable little bigger all
right so I just have a folder here set
up and the first thing like I said I'm
going to do I already have the archive
installed so I can say mix archive and
the list I've got the nerves bootstraps
already installed so that means I can
say mix nerves Neal and I'll say
playground and this is going to use our
new project generator it's going to ask
us some questions like do we want to
fetch an install dependencies oh that
always works at the conferences why not
hey I'm on my phone stuff it's a fart
I'm not magical really so the thing is
that we give you a little bit of
information when you're all done we let
you know all you should feed into your
project then you shouldn't get started
like that sure cut you oh there we go
oK we've got that buffer line so
overscan all right so we're just going
to go into our playground application
and out of the box were set in a mode
that's compiling for our hosts and
that's because sometimes we need to be
able to build some utilities that give
us ability to communicate with our
target but I'm just going to pass this
over we're going to double here and
we're gonna say oh we're going to set
our target so today we're going to play
around with raspberry pi 3 so we're just
going to say export next under target
equals our PI 3 and I'll say mix step
step yet because this always works as
well and you know what that does is it's
just going on getting dependencies from
hex that includes all of the stuff
needed to build as well as like as I
said the system in the tool chain that
takes care of it for you and we're just
going to go crazy we're going to say mix
firmware that's going to put together a
compiled your application it produces an
OTP release it marries it with the
airline system and all the cross
compiled code that goes with it and then
we're done we're back to a prompt so I'm
just going to pull the FD
on the back of this guy get my trusty
little SD card adapter slide it into my
laptop and let's burn it automatically
discovers the SD card that's in there
we'll say yep that's the one I wanted
type my super secret password into the
window alright now I got an SD card pop
it into the back of my Raspberry Pi and
let's plug it in and see it laid up with
this power cable I also have console
access to be able to watch Linux boot
and here's one thing we can see we've
booted into our limit and 2.8 seven
seconds there we are now here's a trick
for newbies and new beginners we allow
we boot raspberry PI's directly off of
the HDMI port because people hook them
up that way they have a TV and
everything so there's a little bit of
work that needs to be done to be able to
switch this over to use a more advanced
connection method like this we're
probably going to work on a switching
this to use this mechanism in the future
but for now we're just going to we're
going to reconfigure the system and so
what I'm showing here is we're going to
just create a new file in our config for
the application and we're going to say
we're going to add root filesystem and
everything under this directory is going
to be applied as an overlay so we'll put
a file in X and we'll say Earl in it
config and we're going to paste this new
file here and magic wand hood we're
switching the uart port which is what
this is telling us that the Erlang shell
is not actually putting that us in the
right place so one other thing that we
need to do is we need to configure a
configuration to be able to make it
apply that overlay so we'll tell the
config for NURBS firmware to
that there was filesystem additions to
config route SS all right that's where
we put it and we'll save that and let's
go back to our terminal and let's just
mix firmware again as Pierre says in his
talk it was it's very it's so much
easier with that D cards to swap the
stuff around because you can you can
save them put them on the side flip back
and forth so we're just going to burn do
to do to do all right now boot it back
up and here we go
IX so we can see here we can say LS hey
how about how do we do that
and that windows off the edge there we
go all right so I say off we could say
on the root filesystem clearly a Linux
box in this case so that's just putting
to this there's one of them cool feature
that I want to show you as well and
that's in addition that we just made to
the dot 5 release of nerves it actually
has a experimental host shell emulator
that we provide we in this case we're
advocating that you want to live most of
your life in the VM and you never want
to be able to go outside of that right
well that's not always the case
sometimes you want to poke around at the
system and make sure things are working
well so from within job control we can
start a new job and we'll say elixir dot
runtime shell and we'll connect to that
and now we can just the less CD the /se
LS fan OOP there we go
say s been oh we see we have IP link
and just call stuff and get output and
then when we're done we can use job
control to list their jobs let's say
switch back to the first one in our IX
session so we never have to really leave
the beam at this point we can poke
around in the system there's some
limitations with it yet that's why I use
the word experimental but we're hoping
to be able to fine-tune that a little
bit more in a road map to one own so
real quick I do have some other stuff
that I could play with how's my time
what am i okay okay so I haven't quite
made a fool of myself yet so I'm going
to try I'm trying really hard all right
so let's uh let's setup blink some
lights everybody likes blinking light
okay that is true I mean seeing a robot
move that's way cooler but we're going
to blink some light so first thing I'm
going to do is I'm just going to add in
a little module here this is way
overkill all right so in our application
we're just going to say a blink server
and save time boom
I am so fast at programming and this is
just a gem server like I said that's
complete overkill for a blinking light
but you know there's nothing like
there's nothing like supervising your
lights blinking
anything can happen to them right and
you know what I'm just gonna I'm just
going to go for broke here while I'm
still on the Wi-Fi on the Good Wife are
let's add in let's add in some
networking support here and and see if
we can truly break stuff right so the
way that you lay out a nerfs project
like I said there's a host section and
then there's a target section in our
case here I can we can add dependencies
just for our host on our laptop that we
want to be able to use to build
utilities to speak with a target what
I'm doing is I'm editing this to be able
to include the Wi-Fi support for the
target and that we don't need that on
our hosts and in addition because I'm on
good Wi-Fi still I'm going to
I'm going to steal some a line from down
here and and this one we're going to use
for both and I'll explain that in a
minute so let's grab some dependencies
get over phone emmalin i know you can do
it this is what the backups are for
boo oh that's building
oh we do have a mechanism for being able
to to do some fun stuff like I said
since you have access to Linux you can
actually load kernel modules so in our
case here we're just going to configure
the application this is the mixed file
we're just going to tell it that there's
some kernel modules we're interested in
having it start when my clipboard is
happy with me oh yeah when you copy the
new end of the line there we go and we
need a little bit of config as well
thank you all for bearing with me hope
you look at the super super secret
passwords
this is where things get really hairy
because the network hasn't been friendly
with us today we're going to try it
anyways we're going to switch over to it
now
come on alright let's boot it up and
let's have it make some noise well it
searches for Wi-Fi networks and it
crashed I did there it is playground
uplink server is not available ok I
don't see anything wrong clearly there
and
yeah what we're running out of time I
tried to go full force on it if it's
linked lights if you can make that robot
move it can blink light we'll leave it
at that all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
