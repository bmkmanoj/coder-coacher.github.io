one is from the field from all right so
he has been a solution here for ten
years no he was more Theon we have
occasionally we cannot to begin she
won't understand that which is called
Selva brother hello fully functional
- excellent facility I think I see
second inner person so interpreter
Palladino I will say okay it is wearing
that same desire therapy say you must be
conscious taken to me I'm sorry but I
don't expect I used to our region but
because of lack of practice I forgot
let's talk about how to integrate any
fears and also earning with other
languages but I like to start by
complementing my own the while I am here
I'm in Twitter also about software
development and please go to super yoga
business come from Sao Paulo
I've been working with military since
September 2015 to play joint Sherpa
I think participate on this out there
they're growing bigger and bigger and we
have AV every three months or Allah
perform was almost a hundred people
community
and elixir is the first functional
programming language that I use in
production and experience so far the
company I work for and Sherpa is the
startup for human resources Brazil
trying to resolve its property so what
to do is we have a lot of system
integrations a lot of spreadsheets
people nowadays they use Excel for
everything controlling by hand so lots
of toughness storage lots of really
boring but resistance based stuff and
our stack is really free and connect on
the back end for the protein is closure
scripts and reagents we have read
foreign database both restoring 32
states and robots so we recommended and
last search for licensure and ok just
who given start to kill know what I was
doing when I came with the problem that
we need to integrate with other
languages and the first thing is why is
other language right is we opted for
resources we wanted to experiment with
functional programming we had
spermatozoon based I was the first
engineering hire there this is about the
CTO wanted functional programming to
attract software developers because it's
a really boring field so positive
digital he knows button from way before
so we wanted to support the language
also well anyway so why integrates with
other languages first thing is use the
right super job
perlite and manicured are great being
platform Israel it's great for
concurrency participative professional
course all processes bookkeeping
separation fear of death but it's not
great for everything if you need to
process huge files with lots of string
manipulation mathematical computation
anything disree heavy on the CPU major
and not with the two for that but maybe
still life healthy control and the
directives of the game the after thing
is a my formal name Aztec maybe you
don't have the time running a start-up
there's two engineers working so there
does linked an amount of work you can
put into everything
while the same time has beauty products
and prove it
so you can know use your time more
wisely it's already there some other
language why not in our paper for two
features that we wanted to implement one
image processing like I said it's a
chart so the first really interesting
feature that customers wanted to buy
what the admission so you going to hire
someone you sending a link on our
platform the user receives and takes
pictures of all the documents with a
smartphone and then we gather all that
and sent to the accountant that make the
contract so when convert birthday it's
ready to work so you'll have to wait
birthday with bureaucracy the other
thing is like I said with lots and lots
of spare clips so if you want to speed
up the process of someone using the
platform we have has some way of
importing a spreadsheet that the person
most likely already has at least a state
of all the employees into the platform
so I don't know about you but when I
great opening something the first thing
I look somewhere else has
the workroom to questions search for
library and remember that was September
2015 so there were a lot of library
filter so then we look for outside and
lucky there our firm is processing their
grass sniping and imagemagick
bouldering Caesar kind of effort
collectors have it different and now in
this new world that Microsoft is a cool
company and they release open xml is an
open source library to manipulate
acceleration of the office government I
said open sinners who the hell is
library and it's c-sharp Microsoft this
air don't give Helen to me and then the
question comes now we know what is the
best tool produc how we integrate with
that and so let's see there are a lot of
options to do that I'm going to focus on
two of the main ones the other ones just
give a quick overview at the start
there's a resurgence early port orford
actually and reloading and I should just
wrap it nicely but force are the
standard ways to communicate with the
other world outside of me it's oriented
by mutation rate is by standard in
standard out so if you communicate just
pipes to currently leaving and other
operating system process in each port
being is owned by a parent process only
this process controls the board and when
this process dies so does the port so
coupled like that and for example liquid
distance
excellent using port so kind of look
like this it's a bit hard to see but
there's a program leading outside the
port communication interview center up
in there the owner process there and the
thing is is safe because when the
program dies or crashes only the port
dies the process is not affected and
also when the founder dies so the
support and the files are closed so if
the program is created to deal with it
by closing it should also know and
nicely sometimes the first third of
course carries first thing is 56 and
recenter out program we need to wait to
an end of file after that despises close
so the porteños we receive the output
back so they're going to work around
that you can read the program in the
script that with let's say me us go back
to your lender elixir there's a library
called portaling that create some being
my helper to to do that and keep
spitting free so there is no guarantee
that you're going to receive comes back
together so you have to parse it
character by cracker if it's for example
grounded like oriented things away with
you enjoin processing center back dancer
but then you have no guarantees of the
order of the enter so you have to know
keep some kind of control maybe put the
size of the message are going in an hour
certain parties also there is no
specific encoding format so you think oh
you're wrong there is
berlin term format is library bike
running to encode further five other
stuff just gave them or whatever you'd
like so and also like I said zombie
process some by whether the pipes are
closed the process doesn't I saw the pan
made to do that so you have written
hangings or with roses on the OS also
you can solve that into Bradford scripts
so when the five code called another
group the way looks in the example using
electrical this language I'm most
familiar with five simple first you do a
port open and use just send a executable
that's going to be handled by this board
then in it behaves like the process so
if you do a board comment it's the same
as sending a message to the board with a
self of Commerce in the in the comment
so when I first comes back both of the
things that I tend to catch
so there's hello and hello again both of
the wastes and a common border let's be
patient
this second often well I thought we have
uses nice native implemented functions
and those are of deep difference in the
way that you do polenta consultancy code
or some language that is compatible with
C and it's loaded as shared library by
the Earl again thank you so let me this
code is exposed as function inside the
model elixir another model so you don't
have to send message to a process you
just call it like you would any other
all of them and it's simple simple
important semantics because you don't
have in real India acting as the elders
you can use the native L data size in
your C code there the library see that
count with your landed you twenty use
your key code and of course if you don't
have this overhead of communicating it's
better so for like this you have the big
as the need there but you need to
execute a direct extension of the VM so
this means is not done in the same bar
so for example the pink doesn't have the
same control to do stuff like
pre-emptive scheduling so different it
takes a really long time you can block
the schedule trends and all not cutting
in irrespective if you go beyond very
Airy
even with master bath and even in these
crises so does the host so it's
dangerous but don't be afraid because
although it let's take their food using
it there several libraries are
implemented for example the marked out
parser and the ex-cop the main
application analysis using it there's a
Cassandra drivers also you sister
several of them although there is
nothing called dirty scatterers so it's
like a different schedule friend only
for a city group or IO heavy lips I
think no latest early release is now
enabled by
so yeah so it's quite evident when
you're using that is safer in the way
it's not going to lock the others your
life process press is capital pressed
and also there's a real nice library
called rustler and you can play nice
with breath which is a language that is
supposed to create a native code bit
safer in see your expose blood I've
never used it but I'm hearing a lot of
good stuff I checked out a service that
it's simpler is in life and also this is
the one we used to integrate with
graphics magic image manipulation
library we use mini production 2015 as
crack so nothing tapered because of that
and white looks is something like this
this is the C code you include the
hazard from your life then this is a
final function sound - which is two
integers and Victor - some of them so
the first argument is always the
environment and then if you receive the
Argan count and the other values for the
final so then there is helper function
for the rock beneath get in and you
transform your into integer then you can
make an integral that is integral a life
as then you you have to export the
functions so there's a basic circle this
tells the name of the function how many
are going to take and what is the key
function list
cute and then the last thing is very
unique that if you say which is the
agency record length model that's going
to happen it will function arts portrait
and some other parameters am NOT going
to go into detail and on the elixir side
it is a fire model and only
initialization function of that you load
the shared library and you define the
same time very supported but they are
not going to be called unless the shared
library is not available so you do is
get something to return and ever just to
tell you that the libraries not loaded
and that is then it can just call you
from custom design gives you right then
there's this thing called poor drivers
and it's kind of like a mix of Port
pardon and so the way it works is that
you create a board but for process that
lives inside me
so what means is that it's like Annie
very slow that I just shared library
there's no compass switch you don't need
to use as being itself also lighten it
is it great it's going to break evolve
en and the main difference is that
you're implemented in implementing an
earlier process so weak needs you have a
model and implement assumptions of the
model with poor driver you're kind of
amazing process so you can be a thing
and you can respond to events in
comments and it's a bit harder to
automate of those I've only used doors
and is so from from this point on is
only thing that I research one
in production but directed so last night
for is trick trick I used before but not
in this context
Pisan RPC framework created by Facebook
it feels to me like the successor of
Corbin but I don't know if you know for
both and you provide pinko an interface
definition language there is a commonly
defined by Christians say which are your
data types and your servers in function
and tricks creates those definitions for
different languages so you can define a
list and it in Java is going to be like
a great list or linkages then you have
for for a long trip is natively has
invented by Facebook for
elicitor the interest library called
brittle is quite good if the conditions
heavy is by commenting and decided by
the official support is for Java C C++
Python Ruby hot cocoa Katie a lot of
language so if we just option if you
want to use any of those languages and
also a serialization is binary so it's
not some slow and one good thing about
3ds has been implemented digitizing the
language they don't seem awkward like
corporately
you like me so this is good absolutely
the other one political notes so instead
of process and lobby a third one called
earth interface and key an interface
Java improve on use that for the found
blog post father and their use to create
your periodical in ways that this port
they feel like another early note so you
have your application running one note
and you just like talking to a remote
zone so in that way this your other code
is not really come up with your ring
application you can detect it notice now
you have you have all of those same
printers of the product and what it felt
to me is that it makes more sense to use
it when you have too much occasions that
they can coexist but they don't
necessarily this end one another that's
for me that's the benefit of having a
note you can add Bolton like just
calling stuff or maybe synchronize but
that's what I get from that besides all
that I think we write with of were
seeking expose another @adam API bingo
right okay one option but okay what do
we get from all this what I wanted to
tell here is that there are a lot of
ways to integrate learning attitude code
other languages and what you have to pay
attention is mostly performance versus
safety and not just use whatever feels
bad for your case and in doubt always
gonna be easy and paperweight we can
always look smile later so thing is
l-akhirin is not an island you don't
have to keep everything inside in just
because of it you of course can door
locks thunder is powerful and a happy
place amazing place to be but there are
other stuff that are really cool i could
be really fast we have way over but I
put reference for a lot of things that
so I think thank you and I'm hoping for
yeah there are city from performance in
difference between using boards and I am
Porter way more because of the
communication and the way into serial
serial i encode data back before and
meet further on our way faster and but
the thing is before dirty scatter be the
recommendation was to keep computation
this last day of your segment sitting is
block the scheduler track now with music
in when you export the function seekers
you tell if it's a CPU bout this one
or are you bobbin or both and there's a
separate letter press for that but then
three if you need to focus on
performance now in keeping your obvious
reading memory and not having to
serialize when you write this earth
because that takes a long time go before
this port rather way if that's not
really your requirement I will go to
safely
you mean about what to be with us you
can appeal one expression which of all
these for the image we connected on is
the graphic match is a big library see
so they also have boundaries but for at
least we will receive English uploading
memory it means more sense just as to
the library he to current may be scaling
go back for this predicate and I think
we not going the other service way we
uploaded 32 different service that then
send us adjacent of them yes we press
the content is very tightly with this
other service that written with Nancy is
a kind of like a natural procedure to
effect on all these railings which are
it was eager to do it like that
let's actually personally but we got in
the July debate to be first it's super
intensive on converting online terms
into Java offset that let's take away
every performance of you need you to get
up everywhere that does not make the
word thing and also it's not a complete
oh so there are things that you cannot
do with a within the connection if you
checked all the images are module you
will be done there is a special way of
calling again never leave me alone okay
it is only if what you're going to do in
Xela we were a small chance of
communication and it's fantastic that
you cannot do like super creepy
otherwise so how what I got you just
maybe some how to sing some different
algorithms
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
