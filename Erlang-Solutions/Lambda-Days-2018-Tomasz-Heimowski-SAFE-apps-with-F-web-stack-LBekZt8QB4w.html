using safe stock my name is Thomas
Seamus key and I'm available at the hey
Mesquite Twitter or github if you'd like
to reach me and I work for I just market
company which happens to be the sponsor
of this event slides are available at
given URL and I've also commented on the
Hoover app this URL so you can reach
them if you like but there won't be so
many slides because mostly today's
session will be live coding
demo so keep fingers crossed and I'd
like to make the questions at the end
because we forgot pretty a lot of the
clutter okay and a disclaimer first I'm
not a web developer so there might be
some things that I don't fully
understand from today's talk especially
regarding the tools that are working on
the front end side but anyway I decided
to do this talk because when I first
encountered safe stack it was really
appealing to me how fast and easy you
can create web applications using F
sharp and safe side so that's why I'm
here and my goal today is to show you
the development process so I think it's
very nice and to encourage you to try
safe safe stack and F sharp afterwards
and we won't manage to cover all the
possible details of safe site because of
the limited amount of time okay so what
exactly does save me this is just an
acronym for a web stack and we already
know such acronyms in our industry for
example we've got min stack which uses
JavaScript on both front end and back
end and then there's also a lamp and
some folks decided to add Perl and
Python in addition to PHP so that it
just looks a bit more cooler and talking
about PHP I've also heard that Huskers
have they stock but they need an acronym
for it anyway back to safe this is a web
f-sharp web stack which combines several
open source projects and what's it
what's important is that
it's f sharp end to end and it's type
saved by nature because using F sharp
everywhere and it's flexible meaning
that you can switch out certain
components we've different if you like
and that's fine okay so now let's decode
these safe acronym letter by letter and
first we've got X which stands for
swabber which is already originally the
component of safe and it's a standalone
lightweight and composable and web
server but if you don't like suave ax
you can change it to any other
alternative like giraffe which sits on
top of dot I speed up dead core or a
brand new project called Saturn which
abstracts over the giraffe and there's
also Freya and if you're familiar with
air like water its looks like web
machine and then we've got for Asia
which is a cloud provided from Microsoft
and of course you can use your own
alternative here but I guess because
both F sharp and age will come from
Microsoft that's the reason why arrow is
by default here and then we've got F
which stands for fable and this is a
fabulous project it's an effort to
JavaScript compiler and it's powered by
babel meaning that you get brand-new
ACMA script standard javascript which
looks really nice and readable while
still babel maintains backward
compatibility with other browsers and
last but not least we've got it for
elvish which is basically a user
interface library and it's highly
inspired inspired by M language and in
fact if you are familiar with writing
apps in L it will look very similar to
you it will feel very similar to review
writing apps using F sharp and elvish
how you do that in elm to sum up safe
stands for for full project we've got s
for suave on the back end then a for
edge or cloud provider from Microsoft
then we've got F for fable F sharp to
JavaScript compiler and then we've got a
key for elvish which is a user interface
library
sitting of double fable and our
today will be based on a simple voting
form so we'll create a simple voting
form where you can select score the type
in your comment and and sign it with
your name and submit to the server and
see the results of other people voting
and I plan to make this up vote for my
session today so if everything goes fine
we should be able to deploy the app at
the end of the session and then you will
be able to vote for my app for my
session using this app so let's see how
to create safe project from scratch and
as a project with it you will need to
have installed net SDK version 2 which
is a cross-platform tool in addition to
that for the front-end stuff you need to
know Jes and a package manager a bit
yarn or NPM and for the moment being you
also need dotnet framework on windows on
or mono on Mac or Linux for the build
process but open-source community is
already working on tools that will
remove that dependency feature and in
practice we need to install the safe
template so that's one way of doing
things we've said and we do that by
deducted new comment then we can trigger
adopted new safe having the template
insult and then we trigger the rebuild
process using build script and wait up
until the build finishes and the app
opens in browsers so that we can start
developing so let's see that in practice
ok I've already created the project from
the template invoking dotnet safe and
passing in a couple of important
parameters or we'll just talk about them
a bit more later and if I open it in my
editor and I trigger the build process
so that it runs in the background and
while we're waiting for the build to
finish let's maybe talk about a bit
about the architecture of the solution
so we've got like three main
components here we've got shared code
which shows the code between the server
and client side then we've got
server-side code which uses suave as
well as clients as a client-side code
which makes use of table and elvish as
as well as reactive okay can you see in
the back the code or should I not really
okay a lot now better cool okay so let
me just briefly go through thee for the
architecture covered R so in the extract
module we've got and tape alias for
integer called counter and then we've
got some logic for routing URLs between
the server and client for our API and
then we use Fable remote in Kleiber II
for communication between server and
client and for that purpose we created a
counter protocol which has a single
method called get in it contr it takes
no parameters so this is denoted by a
unit type and then we return a sink over
counter so async is like an eye or
future in F sharp so this is the
communication channel between server and
client I keep in mind this is not really
restful because we have some question
okay now okay so so keep in mind this is
not really restful if you'd like to
expose your api's to third parties then
I'd probably have to stick with
something else
but for our use case today this will be
just fine and also in short codes you
can imagine that you have you can have
some validation logic that we could work
both on client and server side which is
pretty cool but we won't do this today
okay so going to the server design with
there's some code for configuring this
soiree and we've got a function get in
it contour which basically hard costs
number 42 and then we glue that app in
our init function which is a web part
and web part stands for a basic building
block is why
and we implement the counter protocol
passing the implementation of the
function and use fable romantic adapter
to to make it work and then we compose
the in its web part together with other
web parts which are basically rules that
you would see in a standard web
application and finally a trigger start
web server and passing the configuration
as well as the web part that we have
there and for the client side
that's what what's compiled to the
JavaScript and it's works in my browser
over there so we use for this the fable
compiler to JavaScript and up top of
that we've got a mesh together with
react elements and I try to briefly
explain the architecture because it's
pretty simple and to implement
architecture here we've got a type
called model which denotes all the
possible like whole possible state
within our app on the client side and
for now this is just encounter option so
option it's like maybe so we can have
the counter or may not which we
initially don't and we want to veg the
counter from the server and message type
corresponds to every possible action
within our app on on the front end so we
can increment the counter we can decrypt
decrement the counter or we've got also
the init message which corresponds to
communication with the server if the
server responds with okay then we've got
this access result with the counter so
the result type over here denotes that
something can succeed or go wrong in
which case we get the type denoted by
exception here so this is the message
then we've got a server module which
basically creates a proxy from the
client to the counter protocol on the
server side then we've got in a function
which stands for creating the initial
model and initial comment to invoke and
initially we want to be counter to be
none so if you can see if i refresh the
app deep counter for it for a
millisecond will be just low you can
just immediately loads the counter from
the server and the comment that we want
to trigger initially will be get the
init can't
from the server and then in case it
succeeds we want to map it to okay case
and in it and if this operator over here
is just composing functions in F sharp
so this is for the init function then
we've got up the function which
basically takes our current state our
current model and the next incoming
message and computes the next state of
our apps of the next model and we do
this by pattern matching on model and
message and in case we've got the
increment message incoming we want to
increment the counter and the same with
the decrement so whenever I click on
class button at the counter increments
and the same when I click - button and
when we got a init message incoming we
just want to initialize our model to
some of X so this is the applet function
then we've got some fancy stuff for for
the UI so we've got for example safe
components value which basically are
credits to the components used by this
template and then there's some also
react elements corresponding to those
elements at the top and finally we got
container box with the buttons plus and
minus which use the dispatch function to
pass the increment or decrement message
correspondingly so this batch function
is is a function that we passed our
model to our UI sorry to dispatch
messages from the yield user interface
itself and we go to that app together we
using view for the whole view of the app
in on the client side and using init
update and view functions over there we
can create an elevation app using make
program and then also apply the react
component and some tracing for for
development experience so this is it for
the architecture we saw how we can
rewrite short code between server and
client side we saw how to use Soave on
the server side and on the client side
we used fable as together with image and
react for our front end
ok so let's proceed to building the
actual form
to build a form with use Booma framework
which is like bootstrap from Twitter is
a CSS framework and it allows you to use
some certain components or elements to
build the user interface without deep
knowledge of CSS or web design which is
good for dummies like like me and then
we use Fullmer which are basically
f-sharp bindings for Bulma elements in
the elvish so I get static typing and
intelligence in my editor for that and
together with that you use landing boom
a template which gives us this nice view
444 the front end and the picture in the
background which changes every time i
refresh the app and together with some
elements at the top and finally we've
got web pack which bundles up the
application and we use also web bug dev
server so that whenever I change
something in my sources the up refreshes
in the browser and corresponds to those
changes okay so for example if I change
template label to demo here it should
reload in the background recompile and
now I can see in my browser that the
label refreshed so what I want to do is
to change one slight thing in the CSS to
make it more mobile-friendly later just
more concise okay and now I want to
remove save components because I won't
need them anymore and now I want to
replace that with a single simple string
score my talk at lambda base 18 and what
does I won't also do at lambda days logo
go to my app and I've created
I've prepared a URL for the four nice
logo so I just copied that to image
source value and use a built-in bull
mark component called level and the
level is basically level is basically
a component that allows you to center
and item movie in a horizontally so I
will use that for the image and this is
also image from the bulma framework and
finally I can use image from the HTML
together with source attributes set so
except our image source and this should
give us the lambda days log over there
it's quite big so let's probably make it
a bit smaller by using a built in class
64 by 64 which corresponds to the pixels
and make it a bit bit smaller which is
better right now okay next thing I want
to do is to remove the contents of the
container box over here just make it
empty for now and now before creating my
form I want to open new namespace for
the form elements and just a helper
function called filled with an input
argument which allows me to reuse those
components for OMA of my fields and make
it look nicer and having that in place I
can proceed to create my first first
input which will be comment and we will
use the model as well as the dispatch
function and this will be a simple text
area with a placeholder comment and no
contents for now and we can now invoke
our field function together with the
comment passing in model and dispatch
and if I click Save it should refresh
and open up and the comment within the
box let's do the same for name field and
for name we'll use input of type text
and there are other input types if you
like and same story here we'll use a
place caller called with name and
at this to our forum so we've got
comment we've got name and what else I
need a submit button because every form
needs ever submit button so let's add
that as well and for submit button we'll
just use a simple button with a string
inside submit and let's add this to the
form okay so this should give us the
submit button but it's quite small so
maybe let's do this let's make it full
wave by applying a built in class called
is full wave and why don't we add some
card it's let it be a primary color
which is basically the same as in the
top-left corner over there make it look
nicer given that I also want to create
as an input for our scores and to do
that I create a new type called score
and score will be a discriminated Union
and it can be either good or so-so or
poor so this is discriminated Union or
some type if you like and now I can
proceed with creating scores function
for for the input and for that we'll use
also the level component from Puma this
time applying custom class called its
mobile to make it more mobile friendly
and then within the level for each of
this course I want to create a nested
helper function and it this will output
the item it will contain as single
bathroom and for the button we want to
use an icon from the font awesome icon
library and for those of you who don't
know what font awesome is this is a huge
collection of ready to use icons within
your app so I can type in this is also
within the Puma bindings for my binding
so I can I have access to like all
Smiley's or icons within within F sharp
all right so this is this is air and I
want to trigger that using item good and
give it to my forum at the beginning all
right does it compile yep that's right
thank you
okay so this gives us a single button
here and it's a bit small so why don't
we make the icon bit bigger by using
custom built-in f82 x class and this
gives us nice bigger icon and we can now
reuse it for all our of our scores so I
just type in item so so as well as item
poor so this should give us free smiling
right now but they are all the same so
we want to distinguish between the
scores and for that purpose let's create
a function called score icon and this
will be a function from this core to to
the smiley and for good we want to use
of course the smile all but for the
other cases for so so we want this to be
the mesh icon and for poor this will be
every sad icon it will be for okay so I
can now invoke the function here based
on our score so this should be our give
this should give us free different
Smiley's right now and what else I also
want to add some colors to those icons
so why don't we create another function
called score color and for good one I
want the east success color which
basically in Booma means green and force
also this will be warning so kind of a
yellow and for poor this will be danger
yeah and button color score car of score
all right so we have our form in place
slides are quite small right now we are
ready to proceed to client side
debugging section and we'll see now how
to bind our model to user interface
using Elm architecture style and how you
to use various tracing tools to see if
anything to everything anything goes
wrong like console trace or hot module
replacement or other chrome dev tools
like redux with the awesome time-travel
debugger feature and as well as react
left us because we use react as well all
right so first first thing I want to do
is actually a correspond to our model
and to do that I'll create a record type
for our model so we have comment of type
string then we've got name of type
string and for the score we want to use
score but this will be optional because
initially we can have no score and for
message type I want to create each for
each of the field the corresponding
message so for we'll get set comment for
the comment then we have set name for
the name and set score for our score so
those set comment and set name a message
are like for every keystroke when you
type in your app this message is
triggered and you can you can see the
result afterwards so for our initial
model right now we want to create the
record and the comment will initially be
empty same story with name and for the
score
we've got none and we want me to trigger
any comment initially so just type in
non for now and I want to handle the
update function as well
so whenever set comment comes in I want
to output the same model but changing
the comment field to the comment that
was at this game together and same story
for set score I want to do model with
score set to some score
okay and now I want to also add one more
name space openings this will be fable
core J's Interop before I can bind to my
fields and one more helper function
called unchanged this will take an
action function and we want to unchanged
trigger the action on a target value so
what this gives us is those strange
operators already here that you can see
is basically a mean bypass type the the
compilation phase of Fable to JavaScript
because this is not yet bounty in the
table and we cannot use that in static
typing way so that's just what I need to
bind my fields and I can now proceed to
binding the comment so we'll type in the
text area default value should be bound
to our model comment and for the props I
need to say that whenever it changes I
want to dispatch set comment so I do set
comment compose with dispatch and say
story before the name
I want to bind to input default value
model name and input perhaps will be
basically unchanged I want to set name
and dispatch all right so this binds our
comment and name field and I want to do
pretty the same for this course
so let's bind to unclick whenever
unclick is triggered on the button
I want to dispatch set score message
passing in the current score I also want
to somehow show that score is selected
and I'll do that by not coloring the
buttons so whenever the but at the score
is not selected I might make it just
white and to do that I need to slightly
change my function over here so to type
in that explicitly and what else I want
to do is to
in the second parameter the whole model
of the application and first the pattern
match on the selected score and whenever
that's that's none
I just want white color meaning that's
nothing to select it and whenever it is
selected but it's different than the
current process score I also want to use
white and otherwise we'll just default
to the colors that we had before and I
also needed to pass the mod out to the
invocation of the function so what we
have now is that whenever I click on an
icon it's it lights up with the selected
color okay so now I want to refresh my
app and open up the console and as you
can see if I click a precursor in
selected a score and type in some
comments for each of the message
incoming we can see a trace in the
console together with the updated state
so this is pretty cool whenever we want
to debug what happens in your app and
let's see what happens if I try to fill
in the name field as you can see we've
got a lot of errors and they say that
for set name message there's a problem
in program update function so if you
just go to the update function we'll see
that we didn't handle properly the set
name message so let's do that right now
so for set name I also want to change
the model and give their name so
hopefully right now when the app
refreshes I can fill that in and
everything's fine okay and next what I
want to show is the hot module
replacement so hot module replacement
from WebP I basically allows to preserve
state whenever the user UI changes so
for example if I delete for a second D
name field and then bringing it back the
model is preserved so I get it's filled
in with my with my model so that's
pretty cool and what else I want to show
is the redux chrome dev tol I probably
need to refresh my page and
what it gives us awesome time travel
debugger whenever I click the icons it
recalls the history so I can proceed to
the beginning of the history and see
what happened in my within my app
together with all the comments so this
is pretty nice and what else I also show
you the react dev tools because the
react is used underneath and whenever I
changed my score you can see that
corresponding classes are highlighted
those changes right so in this section
we saw how we can use binding from the
model to user interface using
architecture style and we saw various
tools for tracing cry console traits hot
module replacement or chrome dev tools
that we can also use so now let's see
how to talk to the server side and once
again we'll use Lego remoting for that
purpose we'll see how we can implement
on server handling new responses and not
that watch tool will will be working in
the background and recompile the app
whenever it sees some changes and then
we will see how we can trigger calls
from client to the server side okay so
first thing I want to do is to add a new
message so whenever I click Submit
button I want to submit message to be
triggered and I want to reflect that
within my model passing in the loading
flag which says whether the model should
be loading and the user interface should
be should reflect that so initially of
course loading will be set to false and
whenever the submit message arrives I
want to set the loading flag to true and
what now I need to bind my submit button
and whenever button on click but
whenever the button is clicked I want to
dispatch submit message and what else I
want to also want to show that button is
loading so this is also
built-in Bulma and what this gives us is
that whenever I click Submit button now
I can see that the button is loading
okay so let's now proceed to actually
talk to this server and what I want to
do is to move type score to our shared
module because server will make use of
that as well and on the indie shared
module I also want to add new type
called vote that will correspond to a
single vote that was given and this will
be of course of type string then we've
got name of type string and score of
type score and I also want to add voting
results type which will consist of all
the voting of the overall video results
of the voting that we applied so for
comments I want to have for each name
and comment at Apple and this will be
within an array and for scores will just
use map of score to int so for each
score we have a counter how many scores
were selected and I also want to create
a new protocol and let's call it voting
protocol with a single method called
vote which takes a vote and returns a
single voting results and I'm ready to
implement that on the server side and to
do this I first create an in-memory
database if you like so I'll just go to
collections concurrent and use
concurrent back for votes and what this
means is does is basically Fred save and
now I need to create count votes
function which returns voting results
and first thing I want to do is to
filter out votes that either have empty
name or empty comments so I'm not too
interested in those so I want to filter
whenever name is empty or score or sorry
comment is empty and now I can create
comments from that so Fiasco's to array
map
and we select the double of name and
comment so these are our comments and
for scores we want to do pretty the same
so we'll just count by and by our scores
and then invoke map of array and we're
ready to create our record comments
equal comments and scores equal scores
and now we can actually create the vote
function which takes a single vote and
returns an async or voting results and
this will be an async computation
expressions where we want to return the
result of count votes but first we want
to also add to the concurrent dictionary
current vote and why don't we also add a
fake sleep to just mimic background
process for a second and now given this
implementation I can switch from country
protocol to voting protocol
so let's remain that rename that and use
vote function for that and this
implements voting protocol on the server
side and as you can see in the
background the servers where the server
is recompile and restarted so those
changes are already reflected on the
server side and let's do this on the
client side right now so for the API I
want to use voting protocol instead of
country protocol and let's add the
results to our model and so those will
be voting results option because
initially they will be empty and also
got results message of type result of
voting result and exceptions so whenever
it succeeds we get voting results back
and otherwise we've got an exception and
I need to initialize the results to none
for the initial model and in the update
I need to handle God's results whenever
they are ok so it means they succeeded I
won't set the loading factor
as well as the us binds through the
results field and that's it and whenever
we've got some kind of an error for now
we'll just ignore the error message and
set the holding flag to false so to make
it and to make things easier and I also
need to react to the message regarding
our comments so whenever message is
submit I want to trigger a comment match
message with submit I want to trigger
comment of a Singh giving in our server
api vote method and I need to create a
helper function in a minute make vote
from our model and then we want to bind
that to okay and got results and same
story with error and whenever the
message is any different than submit
I just default to a comment now because
we won't need it and let's create the
make volt function which takes our model
home type model and returns vote and
this will be for the mainly copying in
the fields from our model to devote and
for the score however it won't be so
easy because the types differ so for in
the model we have got an option and we
don't want to option now in our votes so
we just need to default and let's
default to goods which is better for me
all right
given that let's see what happens if I
fill in the form great talk now I click
Submit it goes loading sense request to
the server the response come back the
loading flag is set to false and I've
got the results in my model however we
cannot see them because I haven't done
anything with the UI yet so let's change
that and let's create a new function
called
form box which will correspond to our
form
for now and new box for the results so
this will be results but if we could get
the voting results as an argument and
for now let's just create an empty box
and then within the container box we can
pattern match on our results from the
model and whenever they are some or just
some results
I want to output the results box passing
in the results and otherwise we just
default to the phone box passing in
model and dispatch dispatch okay so what
this gives us is that whenever the app
refresh whenever I type in again great
talk after these responses back we get
an empty box which was what I expected
so let's now create some user interface
for the results and I just copy in the
UI from our scores field and I won't
need a button so let's just make it as
single Dave and I can remove this one
and invoke those within the box
oops okay so this should hopefully give
us the free smiles over here and for
each smiley I want to count the votes
and default arc I want to try find
within the map
current score process results scores and
default to zero because if I can't find
them I want to default to zero let's put
it within an h2
we're also heading with a single string
string count and this should give us
results for current votes so for we have
two smiles right now and let's also
output the comments and to do that we'll
just use another built-in boom a
component called content and we want the
size to be small and within that we'll
just use an unordered list and for for
them for each name and comments in
results comments we want to output a
list item and within that at least item
I want first to show the comments so to
do that I just output a single string
and then format the comment and
afterwards also want to give the name so
as you can see direct the comments over
here and then we just use a single
string for the comment for the name and
that's pretty it so we should now get
the name of the commander as well okay
so this is how we talk to the server
side using label remoting we show how
the server we compiled the app on the
server side and how to trigger calls
from client to server let's now proceed
to actually deploying the app and we
want to bundle it up and create a docker
image and then push it to edge or using
web web app for containers and if I go
to my build script you can see that
there are already a couple of the
targets there and I want to set the
docker user as well as default imagename
to save demo run days and copy one of
our targets to deploy to docker hub and
for the deploy this will be just a
single step this will be invoking docker
with the push sub command and given the
full name of the docker image I can
trigger deployed to docker hub and I
want to chain that in my in my build and
now I can invoke it so that it builds
deploy it runs in the background and
while that's happening let's see what
what we've got here in the chain so
there are some boring targets like clean
the folders and install dependencies
then we want to build which is different
from Iran as you can see here I want to
go into the details because of the time
right now
but for run we want to enter the
development mode but for build we
actually built for the production right
now and then we bundle up the scope
advice from the to the deploy directory
and then we create a document from that
and deploy to dock your hub using docker
push and for the docker file is really
simple which is based on microsoft.net
runtime image which is like 90 Meg's or
so then we copy the contents of deploy
directory to the route they actually
within the image the working directory
will be from this server we expose port
80 85 and the entry point is just met
with the binary so as you can see
currently it's building the docker image
and I also will have to create actually
the repository for that in the docker
hub so that this can push down as you
can see it's currently not pushed okay
let's wait a bit for the docker image to
build and while that's happening why
don't we go to the last slide so in this
talk we saw how to build a simple app
using safe stack and F sharp but if you
like to learn more there are cool
resources like safe bookstore for
example is an example of a more complex
up showing also how to use test in F
sharp tenters also safe Nightwatch which
shows the same story for wreck the react
native on mobiles and safe complainer
which combines safe the stack together
with cigarettes and even sourcing and I
hope you liked the talk and I encourage
you to try it safe side so that you
share your success story soon the slides
are available at the given URL let's see
what happens now it should be pushed in
a second to the two docker hub let's
create quickly web for containers here
just enter the name use existing
resource group and configure it using
public
how proposed the tree and it's already
pushed so I can now create create the
container in Asia it should take a
minute or two I know we we are after day
time let's just bear with me for a
minute okay deployment is in progress
you can see I have 44 euros remaining so
let's hope this will be just enough and
what I want to do is when the deployment
succeeds start right now I want to grab
the URL and share it with you using QR
code generator and I'll just download
the image for that so that you can scan
with your mobile phone wallet phones and
write my talk so this is it please tell
me if you can scan it it should be
loading for now because the container
needs to spin up whenever that's all
it's already there
okay so I'm waiting for your votes I
just I just put great from my mobile
phone
and let's see if we get some votes from
you okay so let's make us good score it
was really awesome it's me from my
laptop
let's click Submit oh we've got pretty a
lot of comments right now so that's
pretty cool thank you a lot and that
will conclude my my session today
