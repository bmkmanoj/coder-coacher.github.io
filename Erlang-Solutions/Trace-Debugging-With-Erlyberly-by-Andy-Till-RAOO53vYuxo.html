well as pretty much any beam language
that just uses a standard function and
allows tracing okay so early Burley is a
Java desktop app it connects to a remote
node using Erlang distribution so when
you do no call nodes in the remote node
it appears just like a normal Erlang
node with a private connection it uses
the James face library as integration
for this so Jane's face is a Java
library that implements the Erlang
distribution protocols and handles
network sockets and everything so when
it starts up it loads the early Burley
beam into the remote node and then calls
functions on that loaded module to apply
traces and get other informations so
when it applies tracers and those
functions are called
on the beam they will send trace
messages to the tracer process that it
starts up because it uses dbg under the
covers and they'll be forwarded to the
early burley JVM through distribution
okay so motivations for using this
there's already dbg and red bug and
other great tools so reason for
initially starting it was that the trace
API can be quite large quite difficult
to navigate especially if you're
starting out using a Lang and you want
to debug especially again if you're a
Java developer you know more used to the
Java debugger you expect something
graphical rather than going through
dbgap is le burly also gives you some
analysis of results so it tries to give
you more information or convert the
information you get from tracers into
something more readable or something
with a bit more information
so swing incorporates all the tools that
are found along the way I was writing it
sometimes written by other people
brought them into early burly and gave
them a user interface try to document
them a little bit so they're a bit more
discoverable as well so getting our
first traces on the left-hand side you
see a list of modules and functions that
list will show you whether the function
is exported or not and this is checkbox
there tell me whether it's traced or not
if you double click or use the shortcut
ctrl T or super T from Mac then the
traitors will be applied and you see the
tick box checked and after that the
function calls will send traitors into
the table in the table you get the PIDs
earlybird pulls out the registered name
for you as well the function call and
the arguments and results where they'll
fit into the table it also gives you the
duration in all time so it's not quite
good enough for profiling but it gives
you an idea of how how things are
performing because it's always there you
get a sort of background knowledge of
how your code code is working but it's
wall time so it does include garbage
collection and DJs your link so if you
double click on one of the trace logs
you will get this breakdown so the
arguments and the results at the top so
it's shown in a tree format which can
scroll down and navigate it's a bit
easier than going through just a block
of Erlang terms you also get the stack
trace so you can see what's called which
is especially good if you're tracing a
module which is quite generic so if
you're tracing something in Dix or lists
which is probably called all over the
system you can find who's calling that
module
how works is that you send the process
don't flag in the match spec when you're
tracing and that gives you back a binary
for each trace I couldn't actually find
the format of that binary process dump
so I lifted a bunch of code out of
Redbook so thanks those Red Bull people
have contributed to that project to make
it that easy for me
so on some tracers 480p behavior
callbacks we can actually annotate the
the records for the arguments and the
results so we can do that because we
know that the last arguments of the
function and the last element of the
resort tuple is going to almost
certainly be some sort of state record
so what early really does is go into the
beam get the ast out of that to find the
record definitions and then add the
record metadata to those trace terms and
send that to the user interface which
can then use that to highlight those
fields on the user interface it'd be
really nice to do that for other
functions maybe use dialyzer specs to
find which functions were using records
at which arguments or what if it was
returning records that's a possibility
in the future so le Bailly also allows
you to decompile funds that's get passed
to it via tracers so it does this by
sending the phone back to the remote
node and running some code that I found
in a great repo called sailing slash
util on github so it's another happy
discovery that I was able to do this if
using loads of funds in your code like I
do this is really useful so in this
example we've got a fun
from react kV query compiler which has
loads and loads of funds in it has a
form for each type of thing you can do
in the Select statement of an SQL query
so there's one type of form for just
returning the column one type of form
for returning select star or count star
so it's loads of different types so
being able to decompile that and see
what it's actually running is really
useful yeah and thanks again to saline
for writing that check that outs it's
got a user default module in there which
is important to show it's got loads of
cool utilities you can also get the
process state from OTP process so this
is user interface over sis get state
which you could call directly from the
shell the advantage of using early
burly's that's like in the tracers it
will annotate the record with field
names in the same way as it will in the
trace logs just just so you can see
what's happening you don't have to count
through the tuple elements it does have
their same restrictions as this get
state so it has to be OTP compliant
process you can't do it on a raw process
the reason for that is that it has to
support the sis get state message or it
won't understand the message it receives
early Burleigh supports xref so you can
see what function calls all the way down
you can see what those function calls as
well and it integrates well with the
tracings on the right hand side when you
see that at the top do port calls prop
lists and react or you can put tracers
on those and can also put recursively
put tracers on all functions so that it
calls and that those calls so you can
see all the executions all the way down
the path to start that you have to click
the button at the top for xref analysis
that starts xref analyze on all the
paths that the vm knows about
apart from some weird ones like mega cow
and a few others so it skips those
because it just takes ages this takes
quite a long time anyway so I've tried
to remove as many paths as I could
it also takes loads of memory for the
lookups and so when you've done that
right click function view call graph and
it will it will generate that look I'm a
nice pie chart for the Erlang memory
which could call directly but yeah
pretty you can also select a bunch of
processors see if we can get the demo
for lapses so for example so this is
what I was talking about with xref so
what I've done now you are know okay
thank you
yep so you get a pie chart of all the
processors use there or you can select
maybe everything except early Billy xref
which is holding all the things so
that's much more spread out now so this
is this is connected to react es at a
guess these are all V nodes or something
to do with V nodes because it's all
really evenly spread out and then this
big one is all the processes that are
too small to fit in the pie chart
so early burly can give you decompile
source code so if you select a function
or a module you can it will go into the
beam file on disk which has to exist on
it you need to debug info as well
pull out that ast pretty print it and it
can display it on there it's kind of
useful just for browsing around if
you're not that familiar with the code
base or you've hot loaded like a bunch
of different versions thank you and
you're not quite sure which version it
is anymore so same again but with AST
you can see the st for a module I use
this quite a lot because I enjoy writing
pass transforms and you can see what the
pass transform is actually producing so
you can't see otherwise the intermediate
stage of you've got source code you've
got the pass transform module but you
can't see what it actually produces you
can only see the well you can execute it
that's how you can see it except for the
ast also we use Merl quite a lot to
generate modules so that's really cool
if you're just dynamically generating
code workflows it's really important as
well in Oberly this is one of my main
frustrations as well with DB G so if
you've got a workflow that you have a
problem and then you do some tracing to
find the issue you change the source and
then reload the module without stopping
the node then all the traces on that
module are lost you won't get any more
trace logs from function course to that
module so what early Burley does is puts
a trace on the code module when that's
called it means a module is being
reloaded right now so when it sees a
trace from the code module it knows this
module is being reloaded is it
understands the function signatures of
the code module to pull that module ow
and then it will reapply the traces
on that module so that's all completely
transparent you won't see any lost
traces typically unless it's some sort
of race condition with reapplying those
traces otherwise you'd have to go
through your shell history reapply all
those traces it's just not quite slick
also if the nodes goes down for any
reason like it crashes or you need to
take it down so you've modified
supervisor or record structure then
early Billie will keep trying to
reconnect them and it does reconnect or
reapply all those changes it saves time
as well because when you when you close
a node you've probably lost the shell as
well so you don't have the shell history
to reapply those traitors so
automatically applicator of those traces
is really useful and you it just means
you can carry on testing as you were
before so you test you've made a change
you retest in the same manner and you
should see the changes so looking for
contributors we've already had a couple
of people from erlang solutions in
London contribute some features and
fixes that's been awesome so thank you
too and Russian Rohan
in the London office if you don't want
to get involved in codes there's things
you can do
so the wiki is publicly editable you can
document any features which you think
aren't documented well enough raise
issues include the exception and the
versions and what you were doing at the
time screenshots also screenshots were a
nightmare to keep up today every time I
add any and button to the user interface
after update all the screenshots on the
readme which is just loads it's it's a
constant pain so if you see any of those
that are out of date you could PR on the
readme or there's an issue where you can
just add any screenshot you want as a
comment doesn't matter what it is
doesn't matter if it's effects
just if you're doing something cool when
you want to share it if you do want to
get involved in the code this is a great
issue so number 94 and github elixir
syntax formatting so at the moment we
support syntax formatting for Erlangen
Aleph e so if you choose those in the
Preferences the syntax formatting shown
in the tree that we saw earlier will
come out in the format so for a low fee
you'll get round brackets for lists for
example Erlang you'll get square
brackets but there's nothing for elixir
yet so just need a formatter so
something that takes the Erlang terms
and produces elixir representations as a
string so if you're interested in
picking that up especially if you're
using elixir all the time and you've
seen problems in early burly cuz I
rarely use select X a while ago that it
did work with early burly but then I
don't use it day to day so I probably
don't feel the pain that some elixir
users are feeling yeah just let me know
if you would like to pick that up yep
and that's it do we have time for a demo
yes and and some questions afterwards
maybe
so I'll just hide the processors because
it's like this app really benefits from
a massive monitor so the bigger monitor
you have the better it's going to be for
you so some secrets of the filter you
can filter all the modules so you can
also there's a configuration flag in
there to say load everything every
module with the name react in it which
is kind of useful so doing that will
show you all modules that contain the
string react Cavey query if I don't know
the module name but I want to do
function name I can just do : and leave
the module part empty so it's just their
fa I can even do there and it will just
filter that for you so this is a
contains and it is case sensitive which
also might be a pain for elect certains
those functions are cased so I'll just
find the function now
so these are all the functions in the
module react kV query compiler so if you
just want to trace everything that
appears in this it's a little bit
dangerous but it's just if if you know
it's not too many functions if you've
got a filter at all control shift T or
super shift T for mac' that would just
apply tracers to everything so even if
you have multiple modules it will apply
tracers to it so now if we do a query so
I know that this query will require it
to be compiled by react TS and that will
call a load of functions in that module
you get those functions so you can see
the import was this is a record DDL
underscore v1 we could see the stack
trace you can go onto the stack trace
finds what the function does and how
we've got to this place also at the
moment this is development time only so
we're working on some overload
protection so if you get something a big
loop that you're tracing function on
that sends hundreds of thousands of
trace logs then that could completely
overwhelm the system previous to some of
the changes that went in in the last
month so now there's some very basic
protection where on each trace that's
handled it'll check the message queue if
the message who goes over a certain size
then dbg would just be stopped and
you'll get suspended and you won't get
any more traces also there's a limit to
the number of traces that the user
interface can hold course anyone that's
just left early barely overnight with
maybe timers taking in every minute or
so usually fine in the morning that it's
crashed without a memory course it would
just take all the messages that he had
however big they were and load them into
memory and try to show them as strings
it's still not quite safe for production
spurts and if you've got any stress test
systems I'd really appreciate any
testing that you could do so running it
try and break it and let me know if you
can break it in the most horrible way
especially if it's reproducible for
myself that's it thank you questions got
time for only one question okay so have
you done some performance comparisons
with other tools no so this is why it's
only development time because it adds so
many other features like the record
annotation I know for a fact that it's
going to be slower so if we did want to
use it in production and we were worried
about performance they'd probably have
to be some safe mode where all these
extra features were removed so we won't
do any annotation or anything like that
just because if you really want to be
safe you want as little code running on
the erlang side as possible just so as
little as possible could go wrong so I
know it's a lot slower but it's just
because he's doing a lot more at the
moment
all right thanks very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
