conference and I have Klaus beer por fin
Tina with me they work on embedded stuff
and we're going to have a little chat
about our line fixed in embedded
applications today so I think first of
all both what do you think the
challenges are in today's connected
society and Internet of Things and what
hopefully have to take into account and
redesigning new embedded systems well I
think the the whole if you talk about
connected devices I mean obviously
you're implying some form of
communication and if you also add the
mobility to that you will expect these
the software to be able to have the
communication over various different
forms of transport spotty communication
you go out of coverage in May you you
may be on expensive data transports and
so this means your software will have to
be able to respond to a lot of changing
changes in environment and coordinate
events and this is an entirely different
style of programming than the batch
style programming
people are used to and this is an area
where airline cleats extremely well
because it is exactly the type of
coordination problems that that earlier
was designed for so for an airline
programmers this is this is fun this is
what we've been waiting for this is so
finally the world is starting to look
like we wanted it to look people already
in the 90s so so we're having fun I
expect a lot of other people are not
really because if they see these new
opportunities but they don't want how to
write code for it so Tina how do you see
your like fitting into the equation the
challenges of just described and sort of
answered your question as well I love I
don't really agree with all that one
aspect which really makes not like
signing event to make this that helps
with all the connectivity and a
commutation between embedded devices and
again services the second aspect which
from my perspective is really important
is that embedded devices become for more
than 30 years well as snow multiple nor
much computing to starting on a bed
devices with pourquoi pulses being
available so if you look at the
toolchain of general toolbox which
developers have available to them the
tools really lack support for these
developments right so I almost going to
come out with the new new
which actually work cause I diverse
course with a smaller scale course as
well as big holes will be computation
and there's really no idea how the
developer will actually be able to make
use of that so I think that's where our
land kind of fits in and will allow
developers to develop on a much higher
level than they used to be and then
underneath that will somehow translate
to a really good implementation than
scared storm two to small-scale
processors as well as people debating ok
here you only the user line as part of
your method products could you tell us a
bit about how you came to do that I mean
to fund to figure out the Erlang was the
fit for your application actually it was
by accident lucky I I plan to build one
version of the product distributed so
being self network to each other too so
it can flexibly scale that's how I
started looking at all because it was
like looking at them from afar but so I
just tried using it and i gave myself
four weeks for the fall into the project
where I had to decide if i go back to
the old code or go on result and what
what I actually expected and hoped would
be that the productivity rizal and would
be so high that I won't go back and yeah
it was true
here the closer from the artists of
university do you see your line as being
a tool for teaching concurrency and
maybe getting embeded you're admitted
students to play around with it yeah
definitely I think so because I can see
that they have great difficulties with
developing control systems using C and
C++ maybe because it's hard to f right
this parallel thing that you need to
control I think I could be a great help
there I haven't introduced out and yet
but I intend to tell it's all about this
either so thank you very much everyone
we're at DLI use a conference and this
was embedded airline I think this is
episode 4 so see you at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
