started quiet corporate projects and we
get just across terrain and had convert
some grammar
alimentation create some simple project
after several hours and 12 weeks ago I
stopped and I got some feedback and last
year I've thought about this project
it's circle so what's JJ idea it's a how
flexibility for a lot of languages and
frameworks and it's really good for some
kind of mix project when you'd like to
use some quote for your backsides put
sets up server sides as also for some
client godlike
sir
because you can manage all the cotton
South some one single project and
mitigates through 0 files
so what is zero i plug in at the moment
sir I want two years project and sound
several thousands of I believe creepy
users because I hate every day i start
my day wizard emails and happy every day
gets water emails from users to the bug
reports and so on but when i wanna fix
it I get better little help now pull for
me but very very impressive when Sam
Carson told you this our game will be
four servings
as the moment projects my twenty percent
project difference but last year was
summer circuit Jen said this project
like the students and intimate work like
a full-time developer and today she will
share information about what she does
everyone so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you some demo of how you
can use IntelliJ for rollin development
which will include features that are
they are already and you can get the
idea how to work with it and after that
i'm going to show you something that is
about to come and which is not the area
so all right right now we're going to
write some simple project which is the
key key value database with rest
interface to it its implementation is
pretty naive and it is almost completed
with some issues here and there so i'm
going to show you around and fix these
issues there so that you can have a
general view on what it is about so
let's move on the project is going to
use mucha web which was imported from
right from github repository and it
builds with both with IntelliJ and rebar
so we can try it out and see if it works
let's just run some tests in
intelligence it is as simple as
selecting the tasks you want to run and
just hitting this hot key to run them so
now it works there I'm going to drag it
out so so that you can see more of it
here you can see all these tasks here
and you can navigate to their source
code and see what's going on there so
let's break something
see how it behaves if some tests are
failing all right so wizard just remove
some part of this string here and run
the test again it takes some time all
right so here you can switch to the mode
where you see only two failed tests here
is some information on the failed test
we see that it is in assertion error and
we can navigate to these tests source
and we are going to fix that and we have
hit this rerun failed test button which
reruns only the task that have failed in
previous run which reduces the total
amount of time you run your tests some
of which we may take a lot of time so
let's just want to our project as you
can see you can run tests here and it is
pretty well and tests can be run with
both rebar and IntelliJ internal runner
so let's take a look at our project here
it is in an OTP application with its
resource file here and as you can see it
starts with this module Lane storage so
we can go to this module and see what it
does oh excuse me something wrong here
alright so here we can see that we start
with this storage sub start link
function and we want to go and see what
it does so there is a special hotkey for
that you can navigate to functional
declarations just like this there you go
you have this start link function and
here you see that it is basically a
supervisor which spawns some children
and these children's our storage
dictionary which implements the database
logic itself and the Moche web HTTP
which is responsible for rest interface
so let's move around and see what's
wrong here we have this
variable highlighted as unbound here so
we can use introduced variable and here
we have a variable alright but we're not
sure what this variable should be so we
gotta look where is it used the variable
is passed as the first argument to the
start link function or module moisture
web HTTP so we can use go to module
intention here and just type in some
something that reminds us of this module
so let's go there and here we have the
module and it is pretty big you don't
know where the star playing function is
so you can use this file outline
functionality so here you type stl with
what I've type here and that's enough to
navigate to the startling function and
here it is we still have no idea of what
options should really be so we can find
usages of this function it also is done
as quickly as one keystroke and here we
have some usage of the of it in much of
HTTP tests so let's go there and see
what it is as you can see it is port and
loop support is basically HTTP or is TCP
port which are going to use a loop as a
function which is going to handle all
the requests so we can go there and see
what it is also so it gets the requests
and responds with some response alright
so let's write these options there here
the options are and we can just write
port let's use 8080 all right and as a
loop function we're going to use this
storage HTTP
dispatch function here we go so let's go
and see what is dispatch function does
we're going to use the same sequence of
action you used before so its storage
HTTP and here is the dispatch function
which basically extracts the HTTP method
and requests path then it obtains the
response and responds with it so as you
see here we have an unused variable and
bound variable sorry which is not valid
apparently so we can use extract
variable you select any expression you
want in this case it is get response and
you hit this key stroke and you have a
variable introduction so here we have a
response alright so the request itself
is handled in this get response function
which is not complete as it doesn't
handle requests types other than get
past post or delete so let's just write
another one and here I used what is
called smart completion so you just hit
this key combination and you get
something that you were about right so
we are going to write method and we are
going to respond with method not
supported by over to the code 504 and
let's board it alright let's explore
further and as you can see all the
requests are handled through this
storage dictionary server which is agent
server and it has some it should handle
these requests I get store and delete so
let's navigate to this module and see
what it's all about
as we get here the first thing we see is
that there is a warning about undefined
callback function we can easily
implement this in this presentation mode
you don't really see what happened so it
introduced this code change function as
well as exported it in this export list
so let's see what this implementation is
about so we implemented gen server and
for example you don't know what gen
server functions should do so you can
use this hot key to navigate into a
callback specifications so we are going
to implement in it we can go to its
specification and as you can see it
should return either ok and the state or
stop and the reason for stop we're not
going to break so let's just return ok
and new state and as you see here all
other functions like handle cast they
use this state record which is
highlighted as unresolved record so we
don't don't really have these records
around so we're going to just introduce
it there is an intention for that you
introduce your record and here is the
new record without fields so we also
have these data field there which is not
present in record definition we can use
another intention for that so we have
these data member here and as you see
from its usages it should be a list so
let's just initialize it with an empty
list and see what it what else is wrong
here we don't have implementation for
these handle call function so let's just
write it it should be something of
something but that looks up the record
that is requested and returns the
correct response with that so let's
handle these get key message
and reuse this pattern here all right so
we're going to use as you mean may have
noticed i use a lot of completion here
as I've started to type lists it
suggests that there is a lists module
and its functions are also suggested so
we're going to use key find here and you
may also forget about all the parameters
that function take you can use this
parameter suggestion which suggests that
the first parameter is term we're going
to use key the second should be a
positive integer and the last one is the
data itself which we are going to look
through all right so now we complete
this implementation and if this key
value pair was found we're going to
return this okay and relatable and if
it's not we're just gonna return
something like not found so this is not
a correct response which is intelligent
to be intended to be there we should
return something like reply they reply
itself and the new updated state so
let's just introduce variable here which
should be a reply alright and then we
are going to return this new to bolt Oh
ahead caps lock
shift capsule all right reply I'll the
state goes and changed great so now we
also have these warnings about unused
variables which are going to bother us
when we compile the project and we can
fix them all at once that this fix all
unused variable problems so now they are
all renamed and it should work all right
so we can build the project no all right
so we have a bunch of other unused
variables here let's just fix them also
you may have noticed that I used
navigation right from the build-out put
there we build it again and it works all
right so now we are going to run this
example and see if it works so we are
going to need this new round
configuration for console just name it
all right so here we run it I'll just
enable this wrapping right so in the
console we also have these completion as
you see that there is application module
which have a function start and our
application is named storage which is
also suggested here and we run it so the
application is right now we should test
it we can use a built-in terminal of
IntelliJ and I hope you see that the
font is not big enough but I'm not going
to do anything complex here so I'm just
going to do some requests to our
original server localhost 8080 let's
request something like food and what we
get is not found which is what we wanted
to return and now we can post some data
alright so we've posted it and it is
returned back you can also delete it but
i'm not going to should all right so
this example works and i'm sure that
this gave you a general idea of how we
can use it now i'm going to talk about
things that we are we have also
implemented and which are going to be
supported in further versions so we've
added some our 17 support which is going
to come out soon and in this example we
use these maps to mimic the structure of
json object so here is an example of
json object and i also written this
weird the implementation of printer
pretty printer for these json objects so
i've used this named functions notation
which is new to our 17 and I've also
added some support for it so that if you
have some Ronak or wrongly named closes
you can fix it right there alright so it
works another thing about support in
this new features is debugging support
which is also there you can run the
debugger alright so we hit that this
breakpoint and we have two local
variables with one of it which is
printer and the other one is this JSON
object and you can explore the structure
of this object by simply by clicking and
unrolling these lists tuples maps and
whatever you get there so this is pretty
convenient and it can give you a general
idea on what your jeremy's when you
debug it so another cool thing cool
thing about the debugger is that you can
step through all these named functions
and you get this whole stack trace here
and you can navigate through these thick
frames explorer
local variables and do all these other
stuff that you can do the earth debugger
so I've just hit it to continue to
complete and as you see it has just
printed out these Jason object which is
what we intended this program to do so
now I'm going to show you some
functionality that that is not there yet
but it is surely coming and it is macro
support when it comes to I to an ide for
language which have macro support a lot
of problems come up some of them are
concerned that you may have some things
that are not correct urban expressions
or something like that but after micro
substitution they become once and a you
can use all the IDS word afterwards so
having macro support you can write
something crazy like let's write some
function definition of function name
basically I'm writing a whole world of
vacation now but in such a weird manner
let's see all right so this has nothing
to do with declaring any function or
whatever now we can introduce the macros
which is fun name fun goal so all right
so this is function name and it's not a
college body right
that's what we have here we have some
other mac macros left let's name this
function foo and the last one is called
it's going to be a call to module
function and RX to it alright so what
you can see now is that these macro call
is highlighted with problem after macro
substitution which is unused and unused
function you can fix this by removing
the function which removed removes the
whole macro call and by exporting this
function the cool thing is that is that
these declaration of function becomes
accessible and you can use it while
writing code in other places so as you
can see here you have a suggestion
having these full function here but
enough of crazy stuff let's let me show
you some example which is there and
people use it really so this is a piece
of code from this web framework named
nitrogen you guys should be familiar
with this one and what it has there it
is a bunch of record definitions for all
the HTML elements and they are defined
using macros which in turn use macros
inside them and when you type you're not
sure which fields are there in these
records so if you have macros support it
becomes really easy so you can just
write for example h and then you have
these suggestions of record fields that
are there and they're obtained through
macro substitution so this is all I
wanted to show you guys now back to
Sergei
what is for me
typing
for this mistake
return 1 + y
Darius
barb
I'd like to generate this specification
so after this
the my dear but I
call the bar function as the basic
competition provides mail function sense
and so on but at the special candle
so called Smart condition but it's not
as markets about technique works and I
its provides on the functions which use
the return type integer so this is small
least deserve function bar binary
integer and this tutor and so on so it's
very useful
also it sir
very well 80 which is there will be with
the sister
only variable because type not
compatibilities so sir it's along the
initial initial permutation is true but
I hope you
what but I will do my best
it was some candles
some kind of experiment also it's
creates not waiting for individual page
and you actually use the dollar project
and today i'll show you how it
it's one nearly the same as Jake but
without any java support and so on well
I have a time I were you following a
straight- turtles from all we use and
from other stuff but it's natural with
the same supply two bodies it's more
easy to start with this product because
you don't be too so sample against
some pitzer homeless the same same stars
going to st. binaries was another other
title another splash three so we'll see
my day some of you will drop emails and
uh kind of research to understand what
people think about it might not ride
around and cities
no we're fine the idea project or this
flight you can
who have time for questions
Oh
yes it is possible and the fish was
about possible to use our console is the
remote debugger or lon shele transfers
yes it's possible you can provide your
information quality remote notes to the
special
this presents a circuit because it
reduces what your support last year and
yeah so you are capable of doing that is
just running the console which where you
specify the node you are trying to
connect to and after you detach the
debugger it just disables the debugging
so it can it can continue running as it
did before yeah sure we still have this
project structure but it is configurable
you can change it in whatever way you
like partially yes so you can reference
these projects by setting them in your
SDK dependencies or you can import them
as other projects inside your project
but I am going to make something that
would allow you just to attach remote
projects so you just set a path to it
and it's indexed you have all these
files from other projects so it is there
partially but it is one thing that we
have here to improve
what Alex the Russian the question was
about Alex or support in the plugin and
currently it is not supported and we
have we really don't have any plans for
spurting it
the question was about the plugin is it
going to be free as it is now or is it
going to be a great project so Sergei a
better one to ask it as a monitor open
source project you can depend on the
comp page and you have no wants to close
the sources because sir and can be
tomorrow because we haven't some some
some commercial project so it's going to
be free and open source and you can
outlast
uh could you repeat it once again what
could you you couldn't really that is
gone its present okay you can miss the
right way on my current projects in my
laptop nottin presentation modern my
current work i switched all this auto
completion because it's a bit annoying
for me as well but it depends when when
he likes it is or when you like to to
reach because when you like to
understand how its projects are which
models can you use there and so on and
its server may be useful because when
you are newcomer the project is useful
to understand watch one which model can
you complete there but when you so come
over later on for this project it's not
important than you can switch as well so
only thing is full time you can avoid
any any if you'd like I can show you but
this year we have ripped previous
release because we've done a lot of fork
about removing all unnecessary fees from
user interface from competition and so
on now you can run your ID like a1 equal
or running big black or white screen is
like like you can solid several months
ago and without online tool bar stool in
those buttons and so it's very useful
and you have a subscription
batter
Mississippi division i-a the question
was can you use this plugin having
subscription to another intelligent like
rubymine webstorm or anything else yes
it is possible but the version of the
plug-in which works with ruby mine and
web storm has its limitations and it
only supports rebar project structure
and you can only use rebar for building
projects running tests and stuff like
that what's what's that again yes there
are some API conflicts so that we cannot
bring the full support maybe I clear
answer the question because its
opponents I will not mention it about
both because a bunch of ID builds on top
of one platform and several of them are
free like their community edition of
IntelliJ and quite some pie chart for
Python it's completely free and you can
use this plugin as well for these
products so if you'd like to use on the
airline without any for instance
JavaScript support how else also it you
can download free version of IntelliJ
and install free plugin and sir of
course money for you
but if you'd like to use complicated
project is a ruby for ruby mine and
early as well you can install this
plugin to rub your mind but it's a
little bit restricted because not all
features from the platform are inside
rubymine for instance you haven't some
compiler native compiler by intelligent
because it's definitely impossible at
the moment but last year we brew the
station as the month you can run is why
adopted a lot of all intelligent IDs
what kind of Philippe's projects from
not i'm not sure about this it will be
we have a import from eclipse project
for gel gel projects it's I'm
100-percent sure about it but I know it
right sir converter line project from at
least if it makes sense we can make a
character because it's an loves to have
three again okay by the way you guys are
welcome to make feature requests for
requests and contribute and all other
ways you can use the github account for
that and you're welcome to do that
you
