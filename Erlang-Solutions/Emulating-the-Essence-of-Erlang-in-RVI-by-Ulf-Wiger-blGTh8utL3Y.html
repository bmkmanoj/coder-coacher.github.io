the essence of airline I'm sure you're
really curious first I'm going to tell
you a little bit very briefly what
Geneva is you're probably not going to
be able to read all of it but you can
look at the slides later and what r VI
is and then I'm going to get into the
interesting stuff genivi I think stands
for generic in-vehicle infotainment it's
an alliance of car manufacturers we're
basically the where the way where the
auto industry is at right now is that
there is no mystery about building a car
anymore at least not to them all the
characteristics everything is known at
the drawing board and it's very hard to
distinguish yourself by building a
better car than anybody else it's a
price performance decision the
competition where you try to
differentiate yourself now is in the
user experience in the car which is a
ton of software and they have realized
that in order to pull this off they have
to work together on the about eighty to
ninety percent of the software that is
generic and make that open source and
then compete on the remaining fifteen to
twenty percent so you find a lot of
leading car manufacturers in this
alliance and they're building a bunch of
different components they're addressing
security networking navigation software
multimedia all kinds of stuff so r VI is
one of the components in this and it
stands for remote vehicle interaction so
this is actually the
part of it is a transport component just
connecting and authenticating
authorizing users or devices and then
we're building stuff on top we're
building demos on how to for example
control different aspects of the car
often in the demos it's kind of like
lock unlock the car or control the
climate system in the car which is
surprisingly useful but primarily a very
simple demo and sota is software over
the air so when you have actually
millions of lines of code running in the
car you have to be able to update it
over the air so we're also building
tools for that and we are also now
cooperating with w3c so and try to
extend this into especially use our VI
also for other Internet of Things
applications so there is nothing
actually in our VI that is car specific
so typically it would look like this we
connect different devices mobile devices
vehicles or cloud applications over TLS
and then attach different services to it
so for example in an unlock application
ongoing reasonably quickly here because
this is just an introduction you would
have download an application on your
Android which is using our RV I SDK and
there you can have an app for example
for locking unlocking the car either you
own the car or you have been giving us
certificates and credentials by the car
owner so you can borrow a car over the
weekend or something like that you walk
up to the car
possibly the car detects your mobile
over bluetooth they synchronize exchange
access information and now you can
unlock the car and drive away so the RVI
application or architecture this is
small at least on my screens is
reasonably component-based do you see my
no oh there is a mouse you have a data
link layer you have a service discovery
layer this is a peer-to-peer
architecture a routing component and a
service edge and the service edge is
where the different services and clients
connect to our VI so this is the
external interface there is a handshake
protocol where where you first connect
you do a standard TLS upgrade using
standard TLS certificates and then you
exchange what we call authorization
messages that also contain signed and
verifiable access control lists that
tell the other party which services i'm
authorized to to invoke and also which
services are also service calls i'm
authorized to receive and all these are
signed by a trusted entity so that trust
can be established I the other side
knows that these credentials belong to
you and that they haven't been tampered
with so once trust is established you
exchange service announcement messages
so you tell the other party which
services you provide so that could be
for example the lock and
lock service the credentials the access
control lists are reasonably simple you
have a patterns right to invoke right to
receive and here you just do a prefix
pattern matching MQTT style if you know
what that if you're familiar with that
and the outward interface is reasonably
simple you have methods and this is
typically json-rpc it could be or
something equivalent where you can
register services you can unregister
services you can also query what
services are available a few other
things and you can send messages to
existing services and at the core this
is asynchronous and you also get some
notifications like when services become
available when they drop drop out and so
now I did the RBI architecture is
entirely synchronous asynchronous so
when you send a message to invoke
another service that dispatch is not
just a synchronous it's also storing
forward because this is designed to
communicate with devices that may or may
not be online at the time when you're
trying to talk to them so they may go in
and out of coverage as you're all
familiar with so you can't really know
that the your service invocation will
reach the target immediately or exactly
which transport it will be delivered on
so that is the routing component
that deals with that and it may actually
it may connect to the car on demand or
it may send an SMS for example this is
not implemented yet but that would be
one way to solve it send an SMS to the
car and say please connect when you when
it's possible and then I have messages
for you so then messages are stored and
dispatched when possible now we get to
the problem if you're going to write
applications for this type of framework
you really often want to have a
synchronous dialogue with a service we
have a couple of things that we need to
provide in the RV I architecture for
example storing and revoking
certificates adding new service or
resources to the system and also
queering different services you you
expect to get a reply you don't just
want to get an OK saying I well you're
all familiar with this if you're working
with Erlang the send and pray semantics
that's essentially what we have right
now or at the core so you want to be
able to do synchronous dialogues with
the service so how do you do that over
an asynchronous framework ah you could
for example pass a reply URL to the
service but then you have to either
start a web server and handle or
basically open a port and be prepared to
to receive a reply and match it to the
question that you send another thing is
we do provide timeouts but in a store
and forward system where the target
maybe
offline you don't really know when the
message is going to arrive so your
timeout is going to have to be long for
those who started using Erlang in the in
the 90s like 96 97 or so before monitor
this was a real problem when you did a
gen server call you had to size the
timeout so that it could handle very
long processing delays also we had weak
computers in those days but you didn't
want to make it so long that you had to
wait forever because the timeout was the
only check you had if something went
wrong if the server wasn't there then
you'd have to wait until the timeout
released and this was awkward and also
in RV ice it since it's a security based
system a failure may be in the
authorization chain that you were not
actually allowed to call on a certain
service and say if your timeout is three
days long or something it would be
terrible to have to wait for three days
to figure out that it didn't work and
not even get notified about the cause so
another problem here is we have several
different implementations we have an
erlang implementation for the cloud for
services for relay nodes we have an
Android SDK we have an iOS SDK and we
also are working on a sea client with a
very small footprint so whatever
solutions we put in will have to be
reasonably easy to implement so we can't
just say user Lang everywhere and this
will be solved the other thing is that
if I
as a port number for example to the
service and say reply to this open port
that is obviously a security risk so if
I have a secure connection I want the
reply to come back as secure as the
request was and also having to register
a service and also announced that to
your peers and saying these this is
where I expect to receive replies is
really ugly so that's not the way you
want to do it so being an erlang
programmer you always want to sort of
tweak your environment so that it looks
as much as Erlang as much like early as
possible so how do you do it in Erlang I
think one thing that is that captures a
lot of what's great about Erlang is a
simple client-server call this can be
really hard in a lot of different
languages and often you will get
basically a library function that that
sort of provides you with one
implementation of a synchronous call and
there is not much you can do to tweak it
inner lying it's so easy that you can
write it yourself this is basically the
implementation where you first monitor
the process that you want to talk to so
that you know if it goes away or if it
wasn't there in to begin with then you
send it a message passing along that
unique reference and then you wait for a
reply either tagged with the unique
reference so you know this is the reply
to the question or a Down message saying
something went wrong the server crashed
or it wasn't there and then you raise an
exception or possibly if you have a
timeout then you raise an exception so
this is pretty much what you want to do
and in Erlang that's fits very neatly on
slide now if you have something really
complex so that the server can't respond
right away then as you're probably
familiar with this is typically how you
would do sort of a deferred if you would
need to kick off some kind of a handler
process that deals with the request and
you want to free up the server but you
still want the server to reply because
the client is monitoring the server so
and you want to maintain that the
semantics on the client side oops so the
server monitors the calling process it
dispatches the request to some other
process or whatever and then it
maintains a list of outstanding requests
when it gets a message that is a delayed
reply it looks up the the client
reference in its pending list if it
doesn't find anything it's probably
because the client died we got a down
message and we remove that pending
request from our list otherwise we
remove the monitor we send a reply to
the client the client never knows which
process actually handle the request
because it gets the reply from the
process it expected so this is actually
quite advanced but it still pretty much
fits on one slide I did remove some
cocoa or omit some code here but not too
much and
so what I want to do is basically
emulate the synchronous call wrappers
and the delayed response and I somehow
want to emulate the monitor
functionality and surprisingly when
you're debating this with people who
haven't experienced Erlang and you say
well we want synchronous we want to be
able to do synchronous in vacations and
they say no it's an asynchronous
framework and being an airline program
you say so that's that's typically what
you want to base it on right so you
don't really see why you shouldn't be
able to do synchronous calls over an
asynchronous framework but with rvi you
do have some things that complicate
matters first of all you have the
security aspect which is different from
Erlang the store and forward which makes
monitor a little bit tricky because
obviously if the car goes all na offline
you don't want to get a down message
saying I don't have any connection with
the car because that doesn't necessarily
mean that the request isn't going to get
there and also we want to support
multi-node relay which is a little bit
special so this is how we're trying to
approach it MQTT is another messaging
system it has a syntax that we're
reusing for service names you have a
domain name and then you have / and then
basically a hierarchy different
components and we specify that an RBI
service indicators should be domain name
/ type / globally unique ID
each RBI node has a globally unique ID
and then your service tree hvac is the
auto industry term for the climate
system so and then for example you could
have a service that is set the
temperature so you could send a message
to this service with the parameter
saying what kind of temperature you want
in the car now the MQTT standard says
that any service name starting with the
dollar sign is an internal service and
that works for us because we don't want
to we want to reuse the service
structure but we want to be able to have
internal services so in our VI any
service name with a dollar is not going
to be allowed through the service edge
API so you cannot call it from the
outside so then I can create a reply
reference I create a temporary service
that is internal dollar or VI this is my
the callers globally unique ID and here
is the service tree which is it's a
reply and then i create a unique
reference so the client using JSON RPC
calls the message method and adds a
parameter reply true or false reply
false is the default so if you don't add
the reply parameter then it's going to
be an asynchronous request if it's true
our VI will create a temporary internal
reply service which will be the target
for the reply message
and then in the early implementation
obviously it will spawn a process that
registers a reply handle with g proc of
course and then it dispatches the
request so the semantics then would be
if this is a local service it is
actually serviced on the same RV i
know'd then i just call that service
directly i get a reply back from the
service if it's an asynchronous
invocation i imply throw away the reply
because there is no one to reply to if
the reply is true then i simply let the
client json-rpc method hang until i get
the reply and then pass it on to the
client if it's a remote service i pass
the message to the routing subsystem
which may have an open connection to the
node that has that service or it may not
in the case where it doesn't it sees if
it can try to set up connection if it
can't it will just put it in the routing
queue until either a timeout is released
or triggers or it becomes possible to to
route it so and the remote node when it
invokes the service and gets a reply
back and it has did I mention that no I
didn't you actually I'm going to mention
that later where I'm going to mention it
now the you include the reply tag in the
message so you pass it to another node
it finds out where to route the reply
back
now for monitors we want to do that in a
way that is reasonably cheap in terms of
messages and works across
implementations so we've added what we
call an RV I event service and it
basically logs it's kind of like syslog
it logs significant events you can
request or query this log with regex
pattern matches and it has a severity
indicator where zero is just an info
event one is a success so in the example
here authorization succeeded which is
fine too is a warning and for this
purpose we don't really care about that
but if three means an error means that
we stop here authorization didn't go
through for example i'm not going to
dispatch this any further so the way
this will work is that if there is a
reply handle included in the message and
there is a level three event in the RV i
log it will create a reply message and
send that back to the reply handle
so graphically you have to our VI nodes
a and B you have a client connected to a
and the service connected to be a and B
connect they exchange authorization
information and then if that goes
through they exchange service
information a doesn't have any active
services be has one which we call s so
it will announce the service s2a now if
the client wants to invoke the service s
synchronously and this is just made up
syntax to fit on the slide it calls on
the service edge and adding or including
a sink true option and the service edge
on a creates this temporary reply
service SX it includes that in the
message that goes across the RVI
protocol here as a reply to option B
receives that it validates that this is
okay that client a is authorized to
invoke this service if it isn't then it
will fail there and it will dispatch an
error reply back otherwise it will
dispatch the service call 2 s.s replies
and then you send you produce a standard
service dispatch but to that internal
service so this service sits there and
waits for this particular response and
it either times out or it gets an error
an error service invocation
or or an appropriate reply so with
multi-node relay then basically when you
get a node gets a service announcement
and it's connected to other nodes it
will actually distribute that
announcement to the other nodes if they
are authorized to call that service so
it will check the authorization lists
just like a normal service announcement
whenever it connects to a node it will
check all its services and the access
control lists and any service matching
the access control lists of the other
node it will announce that service so
then it can relay other service
announcements as well so the problem
here is if we have a synchronous service
dispatch going through an intermediate
node the end node may not actually know
about the originating node and even so
one of the nice things about Erlang even
in distributed messaging is that you're
guaranteed that a sequence of messages
that you send to another process if they
arrive they arrive in the same sequence
as they were sent now we have difficulty
guaranteeing that in a storm forward
environment but we can at least try to
use the same path when we're out the
request back or the reply back so how to
do this sip session initiation protocol
has something called record route when
you set up a phone call over sip then
each intermediate node will push itself
onto the record route so that then when
you send a reply back you can just pop
the stack
and know what the next node is going to
be so we borrow that and so when a sends
a request to the intermediate node are
it pops itself to the onto the route
stack are when it forwards the request
to be pops itself onto the route so that
when B gets the reply it sees the reply
to service indicator and it may not have
be connected to to the node servicing
this request but then it just looks at
the route attribute and it sees that
whatever the next the node I'm going to
send this to is are so then it passes
the reply to this node which pops itself
from the stack and finds a and then
passes it on to a so now we have a reply
path that works across relays and we
have something similar to monitor and we
maintain security so we don't have to
keep ports open unnecessarily and we
allow the client to use a simple RPC
method call which waits for the reply
and looks reasonably like an erlang
gencer recall which is roughly what we
want i will say that an open issue here
that i haven't quite figured out is that
when our relays the dispatch to be B
will either have to trust
that are knows what it's doing because
our can validate that it has the
credential so it can validate against
the access control list that this that
the node a is indeed authorized to call
this service but B will have to validate
that as well and it doesn't have a screw
dential so solving this without mass
distribution of credentials all over the
place it seems like it is solvable but I
haven't actually implemented that yet so
the status of our VI is that we have a
version 0 50 available it is not
intended for production it does not
implement the things i have just talked
about it is purely asynchronous but it
is pretty stable there are Debian
packages there is a corresponding
Android SDK there is an iOS SDK there
are some Python support libraries and
there are some demos and the intention
of this is to support demonstrations and
proof of concept what I'm working on now
is partly code cleanup because when I
started implementing this I kind of ran
into the fact that RV the RVI code is a
little bit of prototypes based on other
prototypes and a few changes in
direction so yeah pretty messy code I'm
cleaning that up robust defying it the
intention is that next year there should
be an RV I that you can put in actually
use in anger so I'm not going to pretend
that we are there now but this is the
intention and then later this year not
too far from now I should have our
working and reasonably stable version of
these synchronous RPC wrappers multi
message relay and also delegated
provisioning authority so that the owner
of a car for example can be authorized
to produce its own credentials
authorizing access to a subset of the
services available and also a see client
with very small footprint so that is
what we are working on now that we
intend to publish within the near future
ok so that was what I was going to talk
about do you have any questions yes do I
do we deal with when clients no longer
care about messages well if the client
closes its connection to the service
edge it will remove the that reply
service the reply obviously will still
be dispatched that far but then it won't
find the reply handle and it will be
discarded so that's pretty much the way
it would it would work ah it would be
nice to also perhaps have some kind of a
promise a version on the on the service
edge where you can ask for a synchronous
call and get a handle back and then look
for the response later on in some
programming models this would be easier
to work with than the typical RPC yes on
your security with JWT
the credentials is that piece of library
separable and can i grab and use anymore
well actually no I there is a library an
erlang library for JWT's that's JSON web
tokens so that's a way to to encode and
sign a JSON structure in a way that's
URL friendly and that can also be
validated so it's tamper-proof arm in
the RV I implementation I wrote my own
because that library didn't exactly fit
my needs so yes it's not that hard to do
I mean it it uses its it uses the more
is it called there is a URL encoding
library that it uses and that that's
available and then just basic OTP
functions for the for the signature
validation another
I'm sorry I have probably basic
misunderstanding and I'm saying that you
kind of going to release the framework
which would be able to communicate with
probably any car which is generally
available or I have a total news release
a framework that can communicate with
any car well only cars that actually
implement the yes so there is all the
manufacturers are going towards having
connected cars you have to support be
able to support software upgrades over
the air you also have to be able to
support remote diagnostics things like
that and you also want to be able to
support different cloud services and
this is what people are going to expect
from any at least any mid-level car and
up right now basically only the premium
cars have it but this is going to go
down to become available in most cars in
the near future and then so this is sort
of this currently the standard track
within genivi that is intended to be the
standard component in the Geneva
framework now that doesn't mean that all
manufacturers are going to be using it
some of the manufacturers that already
have connected car implementations which
are just about all of them in the
premium segment they have their own
implementations today and so we'll see
how how quickly they start adopting this
this framework and even if I know
anything about how that is going I'm not
authorized to say which means
hmm I know something so you're not
authorized to say if any car
manufacturer is actually using this no
I'm not well I mean if they are not
saying and I happen to know obviously
i'm not saying okay any other question
let's thank the speaker and go for lunch
