from Berlin where I work at SoundCloud
as a front-end engineer so this talk is
going to be about WebGL and now we're
not using WebGL at SoundCloud but I have
a 20% SAT time that I spent on working
on Elm for internal to internal tooling
and also some quad supports me in
hosting Elm meetup in Berlin this talk
is not about work this is something that
I have been doing for fun and it's
called bringing the fun to graphics
programming stuff I've been writing
front and Men in JavaScript for about 10
years now and every time I want to start
something new I face this JavaScript
fatigue where I've spent a lot of time
figuring out what I what is the current
state of JavaScript which libraries I
should use what tooling should I
configure and it takes so much time that
it has become very difficult to start
something and see the results on the
screen so something like this and Elm
was a breath of fresh air for me because
I could easily prototype prototype some
ideas and see them on the screen
immediately elm also allowed me to try
something new and the browser API which
was WebGL and eventually I added I ended
up being a maintainer of WebGL library
now so how many of you have tried WebGL
awesome and how many of you tried Elm
cool so I don't WebGL through Elm so I
first learned Elm and then I learnt
WebGL through the library
so in this talk we are going to cover
why WebGL in elm then we will cover the
basics of the rendering pipeline and and
the last part is going to be examples
and demos so why WebGL in elm my path
into WebGL was through making a game
when I was working at solando we created
the game called home Street for four
with my former colleagues and we were
exploring the way to render graphics in
this game so we had some opportune
some tools some things to try and first
we rendered it with HTML package using
bunch of divs and soon we figure we've
discovered that this thing was
performing slow on mobile devices
there is another package called own
graphics that implements canvas API in
elm but that one didn't have an API to
render sprite sheets which we needed for
animations and there is also a way to
rendered it with SVG but our game was a
raster game and not a vector game so
Sugie was not considered well on another
side performs much faster than Dom for
multiple for many elements on the screen
it provides us an access to fast
parallel computations on GPU with WebGL
we have also have fine grain control
over rendering so we can we could
achieve for rendering sprite sheets for
example however web itself has a steep
learning curve its API is very
complicated if you look at it at in
documentation WebGL in elm however
is a very nice way into learning virtual
it offers a declarative API the one that
you may be familiar when working with
elm or react where you declaratively
define things that you want to see on
the screen and then the library will
handle everything for you so you're
dealing with triangles instead of native
arrays also elm web elm has a library
for linear algebra computation so you
don't have to worry about that so you
have a convenient way of dealing with
vectors and matrices and the most
controversial feature of elm is that elm
language itself has a baked in support
for shaders so you can write GLSL code
block in your own program and the this
Java cell program will be compiled and
linked automatically for you
and more to that what what Elm does it
also derives a type signature for your
shader so when you write Java cell code
it is parsed and and type signature is
built for your own code so that it makes
sure that you're passing correct inputs
to shaders because if you didn't have
this and you messed something up then
you would see a white screen of death so
these are the benefits of using WebGL in
Elm and the question you may ask is how
to get started so first of all you have
to learn about the graphics pipeline so
here it is on the scheme the first thing
you do is you define the match and mesh
you can think about it as a bunch of
triangles
where on each vertices of triangle you
can attach any information that you want
so this can be position on the screen or
position in 3d space texture coordinates
or color like in this example
then the first thing that is executed is
a vertex shader vertex shader receives
each vertex of each triangle and its job
is to calculate where this thing should
be on the screen so it returns gel
position
it also can return variance which is a
way to pass information to the fragment
shader a fragment shader for for the
simplicity simplicity you can call it
the pixel shader so it is called for
every pixel within triangle and it
receives interpolated value of the ranks
so in our case you see that this
triangle is filled with colors that are
interpolated from RGB colors and the
output from fragment shader is just the
color what color should this pixel be on
the screen and the last bit is uniforms
and uniforms are global constants that
allow you to configure the scene so this
can be for example camera or projection
matrix or a texture so that you can look
up for certain color of the pixel on the
texture in the fragment shader and in L
this looks like this so this is the
whole encapsulation of the rendering
pipeline it's an entity function so this
is a type signature of it you pass a
vertex shader fragment shader and mesh
and uniforms and as a result you get an
entity type and in order to see this
entity on the screen you use two HTML
function you pass it a list of
attributes that will be applied on the
canvas element so width or height for
example and you pass it a list of
entities that you want to see and then
you can block it anywhere in your
virtual Dom tree of elm so let's study
the simplest possible example also known
as
hello world in the WebGL world so an RGB
triangle so we will go for three simple
steps we will define mesh implement
shaders and then wrap it up together
into an entity so in order to define the
mesh we first define your own custom
attributes type in our case for each for
each vertex we want to store its
position and a color and then using
WebGL triangles function we pass it a
list of a list of tuples for each vertex
in our case is just one triangle that we
want to see so the next thing that we
implement is a vertex shader and here
you can see gel a cell code block what
you may also notice is that attribute
uniform and varying definitions in the
JSL code exactly match the type
signature that we define on our for our
shader so if something is wrong then
this one wouldn't compile so the output
of this is the output of the vertex
shader is position we multiply rotation
matrix with position of the roof of each
vertex and we also pass the color of the
vertex to the fragment shader with
meringue fragment shader is very simple
it just takes the vine of the color and
it sets it to color of the pixel on the
screen so wrapping it up we just have a
view function where in our case the
model may be just an rotation angle we
call the HTML function path width and
height for our canvas element and then
we render our entity
and I configure and configure it with a
rotation which is calculated using make
rotate function that is conveniently
provided in the linear algebra package
so you just define an angle of rotation
and an axis of rotation so yeah so what
is left to do is you hook it with
requests with animation frame
subscription and then this is what
you're going to see so yeah this is as
simple as it is and and now we will see
what else is possible using the library
so as I said before the reason why I
chose WebGL is because I wanted to
render the game and the first challenge
I had to overcome was to render
something into G because all examples
online are using 3d they are usually
just cubes or this RGB triangle and I
wanted to render sprite sheet with of
with animation frames so in this case I
just passed the texture as uniform and
used it in the fragment shader where I
implemented some small code that did
this whole lookup so the challenges here
were to get familiar with the clip space
it's it's a coordinate space of WebGL
where every axis is from minus 1 to 1
and also the textures face so looking up
pixels and on the texture to do that you
have to use a scale from 0 to 1 and
you're not using the pixel of scale of
the texture and the last challenge was
to address issues for file for
transparency but that was not hard
another very nice example because Elm is
a functional language so using recursion
you can generate very nice meshes so in
this case it shows
if it shows the rendering is here using
recursion so what you do you start with
a simple octagon shape and then you
divide each triangle by four triangles
and then project the vertices back onto
the surface of the sphere so most epsy
take the closer it will approximate the
rails here and the next example I'm
going to play for a little bit so yeah
by the way the whole presentation is
written here now so what you can see
here is the actual Elm WebGL code
running so this is a snake game that was
created by Tebow is Shiva here yeah he
he should be in this conference too so
what we did together we migrated it to
WebGL step by step with multiple pull
requests so first we introduced flat
lighting and we'll also edit simple
planar shadows so the way we implemented
shadows was through creating a matrix
that smashes the mesh onto the surface
and and there are more games implemented
in elm using WebGL so the two first
games are the games that I contributed
to my own Street for for the tube built
at cylinder which is like a traveling
salesman problem where you deliver
clothes from warehouses to people who
want to buy clothes and moja is a
platformer game implemented on 64 by 64
pixels grid there are also games created
by folks from own community made citizen
as
experiment to have some kind of RPG
style where I'm Jeff altering integrated
it with tiled map editor so you can draw
map using the tool and then have it
imported into your own code and into the
heavens again by an icon which is a 3d
flight simulator
it uses an outdated version of WebGL
however they didn't change dramatically
so it's still nice to follow and since
last year there are more games created
in elm flappy bird cloned by Andrea
Beltran there's a countdown game and a
Rubik's Cube game that I worked on just
recently so we're going to see what were
the challenges and implementing Rubik's
Cube in um so the challenges were mainly
ray-tracing because you need to
understand on which which cell on the
surface of the cube user flips and in
order to do this you your plane inverted
matrices you start with Mouse coordinate
and then you calculate coordinate in the
3d space and then you draw away from the
camera towards this coordinate and then
you calculate you find out which
triangles this ray intersects with and
then you're able to tell which cell has
been clicked I also use something that
is called Cortana ins and this is a
nicer way to model rotations in 3d so
this allowed me to implement transitions
from one rotation back into the original
rotation and today open-source the game
so you can also check the source code of
it and ask me any questions if you find
if you want to learn more shaders
programming there is a nice website
called trader toy where many people
publish their creative shaders so I
tried to run it in a using web job in L
and this was not hard mainly on this
website a mesh is just a rectangle made
of two triangles and the whole
creativity the whole implementation is
in the fragment shader so I had what I
had to do is I had to wire subscriptions
and place them as uniforms so that then
this thing response for example to to
MOUs mousse so here with very little
code I was able to adapt this famous
trader by Alexander li TF called
seascape another nice demo is rendering
terrain by Dave Jaffe and the cool thing
about this is that he used a texture as
a height map so texture was not used in
the fragment shader but it was used in
the vertex shader so that you defined
your mesh as a grid on the plane and
then using coordinates you can do a
look-up on the texture to tell how high
each vertex is and he also used textures
of course in the fragment shader and the
cool idea there was to use detailed
texture and not detailed texture and
then fuse them depending on the distance
from the camera so the closer something
is more detailed it is and also it has a
skybox around the map so stepping a bit
into the future there is also an option
format support with
implemented by Florian Ziegler where you
can import a mesh created in blender so
it supports a subset of waveform format
and it for example it supports normal
maps and textures for for normal Maps
you need them when you want your surface
to reflect the light differently so it
it's not it's not looking smooth but
it's rather sharp and I would like to
show this
sorry this is
probably click the wrong
there's a model view right here you can
see Ellen logo but it it looks like
bricks and this is done by using normal
maps
and the the latest thing the last thing
that I wanted to show is scene graph
package by Ian McKenzie and this is
probably the most amazing thing
happening right now in home WebGL so he
implemented physically based rendering
that supports multiple different light
sources and also supports customizable
materials so you can make your objects
look like metal or plastic I would like
to show this to
so you can control material you can make
it look like copper or or plastic
so for the in this talk I would like to
thank John T Meyer who originally
created this library and also like to
thank Evans of chopped leekie who helped
me to come up with API for WebGL version
2 and thank you for being great audience
so now we can take questions now yeah I
think we have time for about five
questions maybe more sorry but first
that's awesome
and I have a question about about
animation and interactivity what woods
in more traditional approach be like a
main loop when you're passing all the I
don't know Delta's around I would
imagine that you know you would do it
slightly different like chi-chi like
changing change the geometry in certain
if if it's an animation step-by-step
like how do you deal with that it is
probably not not a part of WebGL library
that's usually what you implements in
application how how do you deal with it
it is it different from the usual usual
approach so it's it's very similar to
what you would do in Elm itself as WebGL
is only plugged into the view function
but the ARM architecture includes
subscriptions update function and
initial model and there is animation
frame subscription so you subscribe to
animation frames and then you can
receive time differences between frames
and then you use it in your update
function
to animate something but then WebGL
renders like declaratively computed
things
you mentioned there's a linear algebra
library for this is that actually
written in JavaScript because I usually
assume that the linear address of these
be like super fast so yeah it has some
native JavaScript code that uses native
type 64 32 fluid erase it's I think it
was originally created by Mozilla and it
just bought a song recorded for for the
native part
hi I might be a duplicate for two
questions ago what happened my question
is regarding casual games or simpler
animations when you do a casual game
actually you're making there are a
couple of steps which are wide simpler
in order to make it happen faster what I
mean what he asked animations for
example you specify the animation and
afterwards you don't wanna bother about
it even if you do that in the update
loop as I mean regular game engines do
that so what are the possibilities for a
game actual game engine a simple
apprehension for casual games Annelle
since for example WebSocket libraries
what they do is that they take take
their messages in the update loop and
they handle them appropriately they they
abstract I mean still you have control
of the state and everything but only on
that part of the model they are handling
their part for example for animations or
resource loading or what
physics and 2d physics 3d physics is a
bit different
aha what are your thoughts on on
building such game engine is that like
appropriate plausible and feasible
because I tried elmo 8 I also forked it
try to contribute it but it doesn't have
like much buzz about it I mean the
developer left it I guess so what are
your thoughts about it and does tell has
community to go in that direction at all
to target casual game developers to make
a functional yeah so I guess this is
what we have been trying so far there is
a game dev channel on the on slack and
people they are quite active some
building small games myself
and to show that things like this are
possible so you have WebSockets in Elm
or you know that right sorry yeah also
animation frame is something that you
can subscribe to conditionally so
subscriptions is a function from model
to list of subscriptions what you can do
there you can check if in if you need to
animate F in it then you return the
subscription if not you don't return it
and then nothing is change and nothing
is animating so I actually use this in
the Rubik's Cube for example so I don't
want to render 60 frames per second when
nothing is happening on the screen and I
know for sure that nothing should happen
so also for optimizations you can use
lazy so there is a function called HTML
the place you and it checks if the model
or an argument that you passed it has
not changed then the whole virtual dom
subtree will be not rendered it will not
it will not be reevaluated even so so
for example if you if you want to detach
keyboard configuration from from
animation if you don't want keyboard to
intervene and call another unnecessary
render you can store pressed keys
outside and then you have sub model that
stores the game and you only updated
when you receive animation frame
subscription then you read the state of
the keyboard from the outside for
example so there are ways and we are
currently exploring them I think what we
need more is enthusiasts so people who
would be trying will be willing to build
games and then we will learn from each
other and come up with solutions to
various problems it doesn't answer your
question yeah I will turn the channel
definitely thanks thank you
hi down yet I max out yet from Chalmers
see you showed us these shaders and you
showed that the shader is written in
some form q vs l like thing for GLSL
could you talk about that choice of
having a quoted DSL rather than having
it just an embedded DSL with
cogeneration what what are those sort of
why go for the cube yourself approach a
shade there is not a DSL it's the real
jealous L call it right I mean you have
the quasi quarter die which are
introduced into obviously embed the
shader code into your application what
are the advantages you see with doing
that in favor of just using an e DSL
where you could program in a more
familiar style let's say so the reason
why is like this is it's a historical
reason so I probably don't have that
influence or
doing like changing it and making
jealous l that their cell that would
generate jostle so the there was there
is someone going work I tried to
investigate how shaders are programmed
elsewhere and they I saw that people are
building kind of their own languages or
their own like graphs or how is it
called to that would generate the shader
and this is very interesting and it's
it's possible to explore this and look
down right now as well there is a
function called unsafe jail cell for the
reason that it will give you a shader of
any type so you lose the the type
guarantees with that but it takes a
string so you can build the string and
you can build the shader yourself to in
order if you want to explore this realm
yeah I was just going to
comment back and say that the sort of
the EDS L group of charmers everyone
would say that that's a back-end problem
that's the library writers problem the
goal is to provide an interface which is
nicely typed and then generating a
string in the backend well you just have
to get that what right once right so
yeah you can also heart both shaders and
then create a library like the project
that Ian is working on like the sing
draft package where you don't try
traders it so you just have a way to
configure material and then the library
will handle this for you
I guess yeah it takes a while for the
mic to switch on so let's let's give
Andre a round of applause and thank you
one last time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
