functional programming and emerging
technologies this year we have six
tracks we have over 40 speakers and
almost 400 people coming to network and
learn and just participating in this
event so the atmosphere is great people
are happy I think and we have attendees
from not only from Poland but from all
over Europe and us so this is also a
great way to actually connect with the
rest of the world what I really liked
was the first day of the conference that
had many talks on the philosophical side
of programming and the philosophical
side and also historical side of
functional programming which is really
nice and I think it's important to keep
this in 29 that we are not just coding
there are a lot of context behind it and
to know where all the concepts come from
it's a combination of things that have
never heard about the stuff that I don't
know that I find really really really
exciting and of course this morning's
keynote with lambda calculus to the
rescue a Twitter moment that was
particularly exciting so I think anyone
who wants to challenge what they know
and find out things that they don't
don't should attempt functional
programming languages aren't arbitrary
they weren't invented out of nothing
they were rediscovered many times I had
a lot to do with the development of
Haskell so that's my favorite but there
are lots of other interesting functional
languages out there over quite a wide
range including racket and o camel and F
sharp
scala is interesting things going on
with lounger there a huge number of
interesting languages where interesting
things are happening elm is one of the
most recent they keep popping up I think
it's good from my point of personal
point of view to hear things which
aren't Alex honestly to other parts of
the other parts talk some other parts of
the functional world and hear what
they're doing and why they're doing it
and how they're doing and things like
this what they look like I find that
very very interesting to see what's
going on how does it affect what I'm
doing what I'm working with accenture
like this how can we interact example
between things two of the highlights are
some talks I saw today the first one was
quite fear and by Claudia are talking
about embedded systems using functional
languages partially a lying and
partially owned in embedded systems
doing that and the second one was an
f-sharp talk via ballina describing
using f-sharp to get information out of
the Star Wars world of the communication
of peoples in there and how they
interact with each other and think I
think on it I found both very
interesting cuz they're different from
what I normally do and that that's why I
think one of the strong things about
this this conference is because a lot of
different different talks going on about
different problems different languages
along the days is really fun conference
it's really nice to meet with other
people that work on programming
languages that are functional it's it's
really fun and it's super exciting to
see that the functional community is
growing or slots of conferences lots of
languages lots of libraries it's really
it's really happening the conference has
been very successful and we're happy to
have all those people coming to wonder
days and spending those two days with us
and we hope to organize even bigger and
better events in 2017
