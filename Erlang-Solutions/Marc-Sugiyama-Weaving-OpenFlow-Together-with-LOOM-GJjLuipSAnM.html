a senior architect at Erlang solutions
and the Loom project is a project that
has supported by info box and as he said
Stu bailey will be giving the keynote
address tomorrow where he'll be talking
about Sdn and its relationship with
Erlang so first question I want to ask
how many of you have heard about open
flow okay almost everybody oh that's
great so maybe some of this won't be
quite new so the problem that we're
approaching that we're trying to address
is to create an open flow controller
that can manage hundreds of thousands of
switches it's supposed the goal is to
make it global and distributed and if
we're going to build something at that
scale we want to do shows Intuit in
Erlang because it's the right it's
exactly the right solution for that um
because it will need to be fault
tolerant it'll need be scalable and we
also wanted to make it extensible so
that third parties can add their own
applications on top of the controller to
work with the controller the motivation
behind this which I think Stu will
probably talk about in more detail
tomorrow so I encourage everybody to go
to the go to the keynote is that
networks are getting much larger and
much more complex and most information
now is starting to move with is in the
ethernet network as Ethernet packets and
one of our goals with this project is to
not focus focus exclusively on tcp/ip or
UDP but also think about know in other
words not think about just in terms of
Internet protocols but other kinds of
maybe proprietary protocols that might
emerge as as we try to address some of
these issues and in particular we might
want to build dedicated flows between
endpoints and we might want to use
specialized protocols so I mean most of
you are familiar sounds like your seems
like you're familiar with open flow but
for the few that didn't raise their
hands the point
the what openflow open flow is a
protocol that sits between a switch
controller and the switch data plane and
the idea is to separate so in a
traditional traditional Ethernet switch
all the function in terms of how to make
the decision about where to route a
packet that enters the switch which port
to send that packet back out on all that
decision making is made in the box with
open flow the idea was to separate the
the part of the switch that is matching
the packet as they come in against a
flow to send it to the outbound ports
from the logic that is making decisions
about what those flow should be like so
in other words in a traditional switch
you might have learned you know the ARP
protocol the idea would be that that our
protocol would be implemented in the
controller the controller would then
just tell the switch if you get a packet
from this MAC address send it to this
this port so that separation that allows
you to make controllers that can control
more than one hardware box and you can
get a global view of the network rather
than a view just from within your 111
box this is also interesting because
we're there are also now course
software's which is which is written
entirely in software and Infoblox has
sponsored the development of one of
those is called link allianz li and see
that's written entirely in Erlang and
they've been working with a another
company cloud dozer and they've taken
the link code and it's now running on
Zen so it's running with Ling right
right in a virtual machine so the
performance of that switch is actually
quite good that software switch is quite
good it starts to approach Hardware
levels which opens up a lot of
possibilities for having software
switches in a large network
doing the routing outside of the context
of sort of the hardware switches okay so
where it is loom fit into this so loom
is the is the is the name of the
controller that we're creating it's a
controller for an Ethernet fabric and
the idea is that the that it that will
provide a way of coordinating the
activity of many thousands of switches
so it has a sort of a layered approach
and then we're also not focusing on
traditional IP us switching so we
haven't we haven't implemented a lot of
the sort of the traditional functions
that's which switches do it's all open
source just like the links which is also
open source and you can find the open
source on github in the flow forwarding
repositories so the architecture of the
system is is is here the idea is that we
don't want to build a monolithic
controller because we would never be
able to get a single you know set of
nodes or a single node to really support
the scale that that we want to address
most of the other vendors that seem to
be working in this space are more
focused on basically replacing the kind
of replacing existing switches with open
flow switches and so the network
controller is that they're building tend
to tend to focus on maybe only
controlling a half dozen switches where
we're trying to focus on something a
little bit larger but also again not
necessarily focusing on traditional IP
technology so the architecture that that
we're considering is to create a placate
your controllers which are very
application specific so rather than have
a monolithic controller that knows how
to do everything you know the learning
protocols the
the load balancing and so forth that we
would create individual controllers that
each know how to do just one thing and
that they would be coordinated using by
another layer called the network
executive and the network executive
would be responsible for mustering the
resources on the switches assigning them
to these separate applications and then
coordinating the activity of the
applications is that clear any questions
so far ok so the source code for all of
this is on github I'm flow forwarding
and so far what we've written our a
collection of libraries that led us that
lettuce implement a open flow the
OpenFlow protocol and talk to the
switches and those libraries go from the
bottom up we have libraries that know
how to take Erlang terms and turn them
into the binary protocols that's off
message lib we have a network handler
called of' driver that provides the
connectivity between the switches and
the controller it's the the networks
with the network connection offers
handler is a layer above of driver which
provides some abstraction and is an area
where we're still doing some work and
then sort of separately from this on a
separate track there's the OpenFlow
config protocol which I won't be talking
about but we have three libraries there
Annette comp which is the network layer
of config which is sort of a low-level
interface to the protocol and ofs config
which is provides a the connection
between of config and and a net coffee
makes a bit easier to use this we've
also written three sample applications
one called I control which is you from
the Erlang shell you can send commands
slow commands to the switches a stats
polar which collects data uses the
OpenFlow commands that allow you to pull
statistics out of the switches and then
republish ha's them as folsom stats so
that they can just be monitored by other
utilities and then a utility called
tapestry which makes a the best way to
describe this it makes a graph it may
eat it collects data DNS requests
responses off the network and provides a
visualization for how the hosts are
talking to each other in other words the
communities of hosts and how tightly
connected they are to one another based
on their DNS requests we're currently
we've currently implemented open flow
1.3 and 1.4 so we're fairly up-to-date
with all of the standards are of config
is a little bit behind we haven't
implemented the latest standards yet but
we're where there are some work going on
to catch up
okay so this is a just just showing what
the the library stack looks like at the
bottom layer of protocol does handles
the encoding and decoding of the
messages so it will take the binary
messages and turn them into Erlang
Erlang records and take Erlang records
and turn those back into the binary 0 if
message lid provides a more inversion
neutral version of that same library of
protocol was implemented in a way that
makes it difficult to do handle more
than one version of a protocol at a time
so if message loop provides a layer on
top of that that solves that problem oh
if driver is the handles network
connection and office handler provides
an app more extracted view of the switch
right now it's a fairly thin layer it's
going to get thickened up a little bit
as we add the ability to capture the
configuration of the switches as they're
made so that we have a the controller
will have a separate view of the
configuration of the switches that that
will match what the switch is done wit
is on the switches the ofs handlers also
sort of is the layer where you would
write your custom controllers and it
provides mechanisms for sending commands
down and receiving commands receiving
the responses or the async messages and
routing them appropriately into your
application on the on the other side
there's a the O's config stack with 0 f
config is the library that handles the
encoding and decoding and Annette comp
is the network handler ofs config is a
simplified API that that mashes the two
of those things together and kind of
unwraps the XML packaging of Enoch conf
around 0 f config so it's quite a bit
easier to use than the any of those then
of configuring Enoch off separately
the wanted to just talk a little bit
about how the libraries interact with 0
if config so I'm just going to go
through a few of the flows so in and
open the open flip protocol the switch
is responsible for connecting to the
controller so in this case since both
drivers network hand alerts the switch
will connect to of driver the two sides
exchanged hellos messages which set the
version of the protocol and then of
driver will send a feature request in
order to get the data path ID of the
switch the data path ID is the is the
identifier that uniquely identifies a
switch and all of the library functions
above that you use the data path ID in
order to identify which switch you want
to talk to then once the oath driver has
completed this login negotiation it will
then call Anna Nick call back to the
applicator which well basically two OFS
handler to let off his handler know that
there is a new switch that's available
and if this negotiation fails then then
that doesn't happen one of the
challenges with well start some summits
so the on the on our library side the
messages are all represented as Erlang
records which are constructed using
calls in 20 f message lib those are then
sent off driver which which use is of
protocol to turn those into the wire
protocol the binary one of the
challenges with the OpenFlow protocol is
that it doesn't provide most commands
don't provide for positive responses so
if you send if you send a request to
make some configuration change and I
succeed you never hear anything the
switch doesn't say anything back so but
if there's an error it will send you a
message back saying that there was an
error so this can make it a little bit
difficult to decide how to how to
program with that the so in this flow
can show that the you know maybe we're
pushing flow modifications we're telling
the switch how it should be routing
certain packets and the first to succeed
the third one has an error in it and you
know I'm sorry we've pushed one we push
three of them but the second one has an
error in it and so it sends an error
back it there's a transaction idea an ex
ID that you can use to match up the
requests and the responses but there's
no guarantee that the respondent that
you'll get an error back before you send
the next command alright yes is it
possible that we've created the race
condition by sending the third message
no I don't think so I believe that the
switch will process the i believe the
switches the spec says that the switch
should process the messages in the order
in which they've been received however
it is possible that it is possible that
you can create you can do depending on
the order you choose to do the flows you
can get different results so they did
think about this thankfully and so the
idea what they what they have
implemented with the protocol provides
is something called a barrier request so
when you send a barrier request to the
switch the switch will send respond with
any messages that are pending until it
gets to the barrier and then send a
barrier response so this in this way you
can synchronize some sort of synchronous
interface and in our libraries we
provide a synchronous send where we
implicitly add the barrier so that we
kind of fix this impedance mismatch and
we say on the switch side it's always
synchronous but on our library side we
have a now synchronous interface to make
it much easier to program because
otherwise it's
hard the downside of course is you
probably don't want to do this with
every request because it'll be quite a
bit slower than trying to send a whole
bunch of flows and then sending the one
the one barrier at the end so in other
words put another way the barrier
provides a way of guaranteeing that
you've seen all the previous errors
separately from that the switch can also
send us asynchronous messages so
messages that are not based on a request
the most common one is a is a packet in
where you've told the switch that for
particular kinds of packets or if table
miss in other words it looked at the it
received the switch received a packet
couldn't find what to do with it it can
send that packet to the controller and
then the controller can then make a
decision about how it wants to
reconfigure the switch to handle packets
like this in the future so we provide a
callback mechanism in the libraries to
receive these messages and then route
them to whatever module in your
application you want to handle them one
of the surprises from the last plugfest
was it switches also send echoes which
are like pings and the switch expects
the controller to respond back with an
echo response otherwise it thinks the
controller is dead and it drops the
connection so we had to add some code to
handle that so that the echo requests
are handled automatically inside of
driver so that the application
programmer doesn't need to worry about
them so this slide what I'm showing here
is the series of callbacks that we that
we've implemented the libraries are all
designed with callbacks and for when
messages are received so for example
when a the switch logs in there's a nick
call back from that 0 f driver does that
calls the that causes OFS handler to
call the net call back in the
application the switch can be configured
to connect to the
troller more than once the first
connection is called the main connection
and any other ones that follow are
called the auxiliary connection and then
there's a whole collection of commands
that allow you to say to provide some
ability to customize which messages
should go to the main connection versus
the auxiliary connections this is
separate from the switches ability to
connect to multiple controllers and
there's a series of other commands that
allow this allow you to say how the
switch to treat the different
controllers whether it's a master and a
stand by us or they're all equal so and
there are special semantics around the
main and the auxiliary connections if
the main connection goes down for
whatever reason the switch expects the
controller to drop all the auxiliary
connections also that the of' driver
level we identify switches by their
connection at the office handler layer
we've abstracted it slightly so that
it's all handled by the data path ID
which is little bit easier particularly
if there's multiple connections we the
library the callbacks don't have that
many parameters so instead of trying to
guess what kinds of information you
might want to convey from call back to
call back there's a means of creating
basically a state variable sort of like
how Jen server would work so the anit
function is expected to return a state
variable that is then passed into all
the other callbacks and then the with
off driver the state variable can be
changed with office handler right now it
can't because of a different API issue
but we can certainly figure out how to
change that
right and then for so the the flow on
the on your left has the shows the log
in and the house of how the cult what
the names the callback functions are
what happens when the exhilarating
connection closes and what happens when
the main connection closes the flow on
the right is showing a message being
received from the switch and being
passed through the message at the handle
message callbacks when we send a message
the easiest thing to do is to use a
message lib to create the record that
represents the message this uses will
use a version specific version of the o
of protocol hrl file that has the all
the record definitions in it and because
the record names are common in all of
the versions of the HR all files for the
different of protocol versions they
can't be included at the same time which
is why we have this extra layer to
provide that then you would send the
request using of how office handler sync
send which will which looks up the
connection based on the data path ID and
then uses of drivers sinks n to actually
send the request to the switch sinks and
we'll like i said before will
automatically add a barrier and then
wait for the Barry reply before
returning and that way it it turns an
asynchronous interface into a more
synchronous interface for handling
asynchronous messages messages like the
packet ends there's a subscription
mechanism and office handler where you
subscribe to a data path ID and the kind
of message that you want to see which is
the what and you identify the module
that has the callback function
the what can be either the atom which is
the type of the message or it can be the
atom with a filter function and that
function will receive the the message
and then it's expected to return true or
false and if it returns true then the
message is forwarded otherwise it's not
and this provides for a little more
control over the kinds of messages that
you receive it's not just a few examples
to add a flow you specify start by
specifying the matches in this case the
match is any packet coming in on port
number one there are instructions which
knows what to do when we get the packet
and in this case we're telling the
switch that we want to send the packet
out on port to output two and then there
are other options so table ID is which
of the flow tables should the flow be
put into what is the priority of the
flow how long should it stay in the
table while while it's idle 0 means it
should stay in there forever then
there's a cookie in the cookie mask
which are a way of identifying
collections of flows in the switch or in
the table and then finally we use of we
build the request using of' message lib
there's a function flow add which
creates an add a flow mod message with
the add function with the version which
for which is 1.3 unfortunately there's
this sort of number skew in the version
numbers so 4 is 1 point 3 and 5 is 1.4
and then the matches instructions and
the options the documentation for I'll
warn you that the documentation 40 f
message live is not particularly good
and whenever I need to start doing these
I end up digging
the source code and the spec to try to
understand what I need to say this is an
area we could certainly use a lot of
help is in adding to this documentation
but in general the in general the the
names of the atoms correspond to the
hash defines in this spec the spec is
all done in C code and so in general the
the things that look like constants are
atoms that correspond to the names in
the hash defiance of the macros and the
ER line record names more or less match
the names of the see structures so that
that that helps to figure out what's
actually how to construct these properly
then we just send the that request we
built to the switch using sink send and
if it's successful we don't get a reply
right because the switch doesn't tell us
anything or we can bank in an error back
in which case it comes back with an
error that looks something like that I
think in this case this would happen
it's a bad out ports that probably means
that there's no port number two on that
switch the okay in both cases is
indicating that it was successfully sent
the request it has it so it's basically
a network response saying yeah we were
able to do the TCP right for the packet
ends there's a subscribe function and
then that will call this callback handle
message with the the type of the message
the X ID of the message and the body of
the message is a tuple and the state
variable is the state that was returned
that you returned to from the office
handle init function so that that way
you can provide more context so for
example maybe you would include the data
path ID or the connection or something
that you know which switch this came
from so this so pack it in you know this
kind of message processing might be
helpful for writing a network tap or if
we're writing a learning switch where
you want to
see the packets come in and then decide
what kind of flow you want to push back
down to the switch because right now all
the callbacks are or most of the
callbacks are synchronous so it's
basically it's doing a call and this can
cause deadlox if your function tries to
call back into the libraries so that's
something not to do you have to be very
careful about that we you know I as I
was doing some debugging on connection
clean up I discovered that there were
also the dedlock's there which I think
I've mostly fixed because of course as
you're trying to unwind things you're
calling the callbacks back out and they
were they were dead locking at one
another but there was somebody working
on a learning switch who had encountered
this problem because he wanted to send a
message he wanted he received the
message and then he wanted to
immediately send a command and the
course that didn't that didn't work very
well because the office handler was
waiting for the call back to finish so
what is our current status we
demonstrated the controller at the open
flow plugfest in Indianapolis last month
and we tested successfully with vendor
five different vendors so that was that
was good we did find a few bugs but
nothing nothing that serious we also did
a test with ixia they do testicle
network test equipment and they created
a simulated network of 2,000 switches
and we were able to connect to all of
those switches on a little Adam box it
had 100 we were using 180 megabytes of
memory by the time the two thousand
switches connected which really
impressed everybody there because most
of the other switches were written in
java or the controllers were written in
java and we did have to do a little bit
of tuning on that box of things like we
had to change the limits and the map
so number of file descriptors are sorts
of things you probably expected to have
to do we also had to turn offs in
cookies because I was preventing the
ixia from connecting and that i think
the linux kernel thought it was being
there was a ton of service attack on it
so it turned on sync cookies after we
did that we each of the simulated
switches were connected in a giant ring
where port one was a switch on the left
port 2 was a switch on the right and
port 3 was a simulated host so using the
the Erlang shell and the interactive
controller I control week I created just
used a list comprehension to connect
create flows that connected a thousand
of the switches together and then two
special cases for the connect the hosts
and then we were able to get traffic
flowing through this large simulated
Network the ease at which we could
create the flows like that on so many
switches really impressed the people
from exia because as I know no other
people building controllers have that
kind of programming language right for
their control and it was it was pretty
amazing when we finally saw the traffic
flowing back and forth between the two
ends because it's a thousand hops is a
is a not a realistic network but it was
still pretty interesting the other thing
we demonstrated there was the stats
polar so we created a large topology
we've connected together most of the
switch vendors into a into a ring again
and got traffic flowing in that ring
using some of the test equipment and
then we were able to monitor using the
of protocol stats commands i think we've
monitored the pack know the port the
port packet counts in input received
packet counts on all the switches and
then we were able to first then the
stats bowler is pushing that out onto
folsom and then we used wombat to graph
that data and everyone was pretty
excited when they saw the numbers you
know the graphs
climbing and the course and they said
well how do we know it's real data so as
well as increase the amount of traffic
and so then the slope of the line
changed upward which which pretty much
proved that it was working the one
downside was a significant amount of
delay the switches many of the switches
don't provide instantaneous statistics
so they're in fact their internal
software is pulling the hardware so
there's a few second gap there then the
I stats or the stats polar was pulling
the OpenFlow stats and then wombat was
pulling the stats controller the stats
polar so there was maybe a 20 30 second
delay between when something changed on
the switch and we can actually see a
response oh well then the web at you I
of course is pulling wombat right so so
there may be a 30 second delay before we
actually saw something happen but it was
still you know it worked and I think it
also indicates that there might be
better approaches to how to push that
data out faster so where are we headed
some of the things that we'd like to
work on we want to improve our fault
tolerance right now they're basically
isn't any because there's no redundancy
there's no built-in support for
redundancy for the controller so we'd
like to add that we want to add
something that's been referred to as the
switch level data store the idea here is
to keep have the controller remember how
the switches have been configured by the
application so that when we get to
having the network executive rather than
the network executive having to probe
down all the way to the hardware or to
the switch what's been configured it has
something a little bit closer that it
can ask that is the accurate supposedly
the accurate representation of how
things have been configured we want to
add a graph store which is kind of like
a beefed-up digraph that will provide a
way to remember the network topology
remember information about the different
parts of the network that would be
accessible from the network
controller or the network executives and
from the different controllers to try to
understand how the network has been
configured we haven't even taken a start
yet at the network executive it's like
what will that look like how are we
going to make it you know do the
coordination of all the different pieces
and sort of the ultimate goal is this
idea of a flow compiler which is to say
you have some higher-level network of
where application that says I need to
create a network beach or canedo create
a flow i'm going to send a lot of data
from this place to this place okay
network executive just make it happen
right and the idea then is to take that
high level description however it's done
of what you want to accomplish in the
network and have the network executive
turn that into the series of flows that
are pushed down to the switches do you
actually make it happen and of course it
needs to do that by incorporating it
into whatever else is already in the
network which is why we have all these
other pieces to make that information
available to the network executive if
you want to learn more there are the
places where there's references to all
this so that art and art all this code
is checked into the github under the
flow forwarding repository if there
you'll also find the links which link ex
tapestry and the other examples they're
all there and I'd like to encourage
everybody to to contribute to this
because we are at an early stage and any
kind of feedback that we can get about
the AP is and what not you have this
ability to really influence the
direction that some of this that a lot
of this is going and so there are some
ideas about things that might be
interesting to add a learning switch we
don't have that yet although I think
there was someone in Japan I was
emailing with whose name I don't
remember now
was starting to work on that may be some
sort of lightweight topology discovery
along the lines of ldp add more
capability to I control it's very
limited right now it's not full featured
it does just a few specific things that
I needed it to do to do some testing may
be a better integration for integration
for the stats pullers so that it instead
of having to rely on wombat maybe it can
go you know it pushes it stats out
somewhere there's another problem with
the stats polar where it doesn't
properly identify the the flows and open
flow probably familiar that there's no
flow ID right flows are identified by
the match set and so there we need a way
of simulating a flow ID so that we know
which flow were talking about so maybe
some way of making a string version of
the canonical string version of the
match to form the name of the of the
OpenFlow stat or I'm sorry if the folsom
stat we've done very little work so far
with open flow config so we would like
to somehow incorporate that maybe make
some examples that that work better and
there's definitely need for more
documentation particularly around how to
formulate the messages this is a
constant frustration for me and that's
that's it are there any questions
have we considered using maps instead of
Records for the messages no not yet I
just started playing with our 17 most of
this I believe I believe we've gotten
the code to compile with our 16 are 17
but there I think were some problems
with some of the external of the
dependent libraries that we're using so
we don't actually have it running yet
with our 17 but that's this on the list
of things to do yeah no yeah yeah have
we thought about it yet and no I can't
say that that we have but yeah it'd be
interesting to explore that to see if it
makes anything easier Henry why all the
coals why all the calls generating your
dead looks why'd you make cool oh why
did I make them calls yeah that's a good
question so when when my my experience
it ribbit was that we didn't use calls
everywhere and I fact my experience at
high five was that we didn't and we used
a lot of did cast mostly the problem
then became there was no back pressure
so when the system became overloaded
basically we've run out of memory
because the message queues would get too
long and so I thought well maybe that's
it maybe that's early optimization so
instead of worrying about what that
might happen let's just start with
something simpler just start with using
calls and if it becomes a problem then
we can start tweaking them and turning a
burning them appropriately into Cass I
hadn't considered at the time when I
made that decision that this might cause
deadly acts in usage and using the
library so that might be a different
reason to consider doing it at a
different way maybe more an open flow
question but it feels like if you sort
of change your network topology at
runtime many of you
it sort of applied inconsistently you
can end up with the network not rooting
at all how it's supposed to is that
something open for yourselves or is that
something you have to solve in your
application I yeah I believe that that
would be something you need to solve in
your application because the switches
them set the open flow switches are dumb
right all you do is you say well if a
packet matches this pattern do these
actions with it right they don't have
the ability to make any decisions on
their own so that's really up to the
controller so if the controller makes a
big mess out of the routes then you just
have a big mess yeah all right like any
other software all the questions
the questions okay then going once twice
foot sold thank you Mark thank you are
