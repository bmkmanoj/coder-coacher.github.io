it's in that address prezi.com slash
user slash anagha you can find it so if
something is not too clear in the screen
you can watch it on on your computers
let's get started let me introduce
myself first I'm programmer since I was
a little kill my first my first program
was translating my first introduction to
code was translating a small gaming
qbasic to from English to Spanish from
that I moved to basic visual basic.net
Java all that stuff until I found
Haskell then I switch to functional
programming I found out long five years
ago and I've been doing that ever since
and now a director of engineering at
anaka which means I get to decide the
architecture the components we are using
for all of our projects in a guy's a US
company but we are based in Argentina we
do airline consulting we will we also
build end-to-end obligations with
airline android/ios component and also
some Ruby part the main the core of our
airline obligation is highly concurrent
services mostly for messaging purposes
but there are some other stuff too one
of her favorite clients is tigertext
tigertext product is a messaging
platform that is HIPAA compliant it's
very is heavily use having healthcare
companies to connect doctors and keep
patient-doctor confidentiality using
messaging they have all of the servers
and many of their applications written
in Erlang they have android clients and
iOS clients and i will show you just a
tiny bit of what tiger texts about and
how i implemented it
this is I will start with a little bit
of story so you have a background of
what i built and then i will show you
the letting the product in the beginning
we have a text box where you could find
fellow tigertext users it was very basic
you have to type a whole world a whole
world to find somebody that its name or
surname and that was it if you want to
find say in su carrera but you type
ignacio with anass or without the oh it
couldn't find it it was an ets table
with an index by word so you have to
match it precisely we wanted to improve
that thing we're something way better
where you could start typing and it will
filter the results it will rank the
results according to for instance people
whose near you and we also wanted
partial matching and we wanted to match
by other fields like phone numbers
emails whatever we want that to be
implemented in our long because every
server we have was in Ireland so this
was this must be in Erlang too and we
won we have a lot of along developers
and not many developers with other
language knowledge so we want it to be
as a lanky as possible and it was it had
to be fast we've had to scale because
you know it's a it's web-based so each
time you type a keyword it made a
request it has to be very fast and has
to scale this is the first two we found
and i will read that straight as if this
written because it's a best description
i found for that the sinker is a
high-performance scholar full-featured
textures in china library with powerful
accurate and efficient search algorithm
it was all that we need but we was
written in java and we wanted an airline
application on the other side we have j
interface to interface is a java library
that lets you create nodes airline nodes
inside your java program and also send
messages and connect with a
with a regular airlock nose and the best
of all it comes with the OTP
distribution so you don't have to
download it it's tile it anything it's
already there with those two things we
created the scene server is in service
everywhere in OTP application like any
other you have but in the background it
runs loose in core server it's a it
doesn't require any java knowledge from
its users it's basically all airline but
behind the scenes it's all java let me
first show you how it works starting the
scene service is as easy as that you do
listen server start you can also do
application startup scene server as you
usually do you can include it in your el
tule whatever you need it's fine and
then you can start using it first of all
you want to put documents into the index
to do that you create the documents as
prop list with other atoms as the keys
strings integers floating point numbers
and adams wineries whatever as the
values not tuples not least complex
types know all the other simple stuff
and then you have the documents and you
can have more of one at the time that
way the documents get into the index and
to get it out you query remix for
querying you have this simple function
you seem much the first argument is a
string in the scene query syntax i will
show you what that is in a minute and
the second argument is a page size so
when you run the query it returns a
double with two animals the first one is
the list of results which is a list of
prop lists they are the documents that
you index and the second one is metadata
the total number of hits some
benchmarking and stuff like that and to
understand what you can do with that you
should you should you use loosing query
syntax in the first argument that lets
you do an wide number of things like
finding stuff by type by fields with
wheel while cars with ranges also
ranking the resort
cetera et cetera it's all it's all
provided by loosing and since you are
specifying the page size you will also
do pagination which is doing like this
in this example the first time I'm
having ten documents each one with just
one filled with its 1 to 10 as the value
then I'm matching them with a query that
matches every one of those and a page
size of 5 so if since there are more
documents of that the metadata will
include a next page token that I use in
the loosing continue function and again
with a page size and we get there the
rest of the results so as easy as that
so let me show you how it's done in the
indic what's the code for this we have a
particular set of goals for this
obligation but the first one was that it
had to be river compatible that means
you can compile it doing rework compile
no java involved and then it has to be 0
DB compatible like application start and
stop should work again not not requiring
any java knowledge from the user and to
do that the germinal should we start
them in the background but supervised
for reward compatibility it's a it's
something very easy River provides hooks
so what I did was I created a free hook
before compiling I'm I'm moving the J
interface library to my project I put
that path in the class pot and on the
post hooks for compile I compiling the
Java code in generating a jar file easy
as that and then internally Lucy in
server is in an OTP application with
with your usual application process main
supervisor and loosing which is
injection server that's linked to a Java
know which runs in a Java program and it
has a
a process called losing server that's
linked to this one so if anything
happens on the germinal this gen server
will know and it will be it will
terminate and will be restarted then
restarting the Java know this is the
code for the shin server the main part
on in it it basically opens port using
the Java executable with the necessary
argument like the name for this node the
name for the Java know and they cookie
so they can connect and it waits until
the germinal signals that is running
revy that happens because when you open
a port or standard output everything you
write and standard output in that
program gets to you as a message so we
wait until the java program rights ready
on a standard output and in at that
point we link the process and monitor
let me know on jealous I'll you see this
is a regular Java program public static
void main is the point of entry so it
basically starts an old an OTP know a
leucine server which is a process it's
an OTP Chen server I will show you what
that is in a moment basically when it's
done it prints ready on the
understanding open that's it then you
have an OLE in the Java in your Java
program you have a process listening for
messages there and you can just use it
to see how that works we we wanted the
leucine server the leucine server
process in the germinal to listen for
messages and for some of them it had to
return a value when you want to add run
a query for others it doesn't need to
return a value it's just hard to for
instance index stuff it was very very
similar to a gin server it was in the
Java side but it was
gen server so i tried to find if
somebody already read in a gentle server
in java or something like that and i
found this code Reese comment in the
Jenner model volume it says no c java SE
trata de etc so to me that meant okay
there is shen something in java there
must be a gin serving java it turns out
it's not so i created 10 division server
I needed that I knew how to work with
that and I knew that if every any other
person would ever need something they
will they will be able to use it this
way and most of all I wanted to do gen
server call whatever on my yelling code
and get all the goodness that comes with
it timeouts you know monitoring
everything so i just created the missing
component that was nearly in the java
side it's basically a behavior in java
terms it's an abstract class it has
constructors which are the same thing as
startling any need on the island on
airline and has the equivalent of the
behavior code blocks which are abstract
methods so if you are going to use it
you have to implement those methods the
same way you have to implement those
functions in our line and you don't the
rest of the work is owned by the OT
vision server class and this is my trans
server it has a handle call for M method
which if we if it receives a couple with
a knot on PA v it doesn't reply in this
case the reply is implemented as return
something because you don't need you
need a special turtle in Java because
the state you already have it and saying
that you wanna reply it's just returning
something so it's as easy as that and if
you want to do it no reply well you I
implemented that with an exception that
basically says okay this execution is on
so keep going
in inside the brand match I'm doing of
division server reply with the value
same way as you will do it in a way this
code is in this project say interface
standard library it's open source is it
it's in github I will show you the link
after in in a moment in one of the last
slide basically we already have all the
pieces processes and oh division server
we're waiting for contributions to to
create auto phne fsm anywhere anything
you want but let's go back a little bit
to to listen Sarah we had that thing
running we indexing documents much in
documents everything was running so we
started to get greedy i think is the
word we wanted more we wanted to run
results by location and we wanted
special queries that we're not exactly
the ones you would write in inducing
query syntax so let me show you what we
added we had two extensions the first
one is the easier to explain we wanted
to have a geolocation we wanted to index
documents will latitude and longitude
and we want to find a near double is
near some some coordinate so it's
basically it we we created that special
type to your record with latitude and
longitude you created with you seen you
Till's basically that's the value for
your field and when you want to search
for documents that are near that that
spot you just use field dot near
latitude longitude and the distance in
miles that's it the other extension is a
little bit more complicated it lets you
run airline code inside your queries so
we're you're running a query you can
match the values of some fields using an
online function to do that you type the
name of the field dot airline and
another log function that's run over a
list of values the list of values are
the values for that field in your
equipment in the a leucine index so
whenever leucine wants to run that query
it will invoke it will send a message to
the airline node for that function to be
executed and using the results of that
function it will filter the document so
basically you can do whatever you want
as long as you can write it in Irwin and
that will help you match any document in
your leucine index to implement that
first I had to all the extensions to the
scene that's easy using has that very
easy way to add extensions you just
specify the delimiter and then you are
the extensions to your busine query
parser near extension is easier to
because you only need to add a special
Java file with the scene spatial the
only tricky part was to parse geo
records but they are doubles with two
fields nothing to worry about dot
airline is way more complicated first of
all we needed an Ellen Parcell extension
that means we needed something to parse
that string inside the leucine query
syntax to do that I just split the part
like you have module phone function in
argument split them up create an alum
filter airline filter basically creates
a couple with module function argument
and values and it calls the gin server
using the gin server on the airline node
and it uses a division server called the
same way you would use Chancellor Merkel
and only among know the function is run
and the results are parsed as double or
anything else if it's a double it's a
ranking of that document and if it's
anything else the document didn't match
that's it
on the airline side this this is life is
a little bit trickier we have a gentle
server with a handle call function that
basically does in no reply and delegate
the work to a worker pool where it where
the recall is executed it's basically
parsed and evaluated and the return the
results are returned to a Java know so
it's a ping pong of messages when you
want to run a query you said you write
the query on the scene queries index it
goes to the Java note the values come
back to the L&amp;amp;O to be for a function to
be executed the resource go back to java
and you get the results for your query
for results matching your curry okay
well that's it that's most of it and let
me show you now three things I learned
along the process the first one it was a
funny one it took me a while to figure
this one out but we wanted to we added a
shavano to be supervising the java
process to be supervised it so that if
we going down if something crashes on
the other on the java sign we know this
it on the Erlang sign and we could take
action for that so coming from an online
background I said right that's easy the
process is resisted a leucine server I
just have to monitor it so I try it to
monitor it but on an online know that
works fine on the germinal it doesn't
there is no monitoring on Java note okay
Monica missing work that's pretty
advanced let's try to link it okay link
only accept PP IVs in an erlang world in
two in between 12-1 notes you would do
an RPC call get the PID Lincoln there is
no RPC in Java so because there are no
jen selter since our pcs implemented all
agent server so that doesn't work either
the only way I could make it work was to
implement the handler call on the
odibajian server to return the PID and
and I could linger the next this is
another tricky one this is performance
wise so remember I told you when you run
a lot airline queries in your loosing
much function it's a ping-pong of
messages okay those messages are not
huge but they have some size in them and
it made our we knew it was it was going
to make our queries slower but it was
way slower than we imagined so first of
all we discarded loosening internal
issues we tried everything without that
specific part of a ping-pong and so we
were pretty sure that it wasn't that we
were adding extensions in a weird way or
doing some Java thing that wasn't
supposed to be done and the thing was a
ping pong it was clear that that we're
wasting too much time sending messages
back and forth from the airline node to
the java node so we created a bench
marker to determine what was the issue
on the airline side it basically sends a
message to examine all the sharp process
on the only javanu with some time stamps
and it and some data when the message
come comes back it measures the round
trip in milliseconds on the Java side
it's an echo thing there is no there's
no even audition server here it's just
it receives a message it sends the same
message back to yelling node with a time
stamp so we can measure if going from
Airlines to Java takes longer than going
from Java duela but it's basically that
it does nothing nothing no processing
nothing just message passing so we run
some benchmarks first of all with we
thought the problem was related to the
number of messages and so we run that
benchmark thing sending one byte for
Marilyn to heaven and back again several
times the more time more messages mean
more milliseconds spending that round
trip but it was predictable and it kind
of scaled well and also the number of
blue seen messages is that small so it
couldn't be the issue then we thought
okay if it's not the number of messages
it must be the size of them so we
increase it the size of the binary that
we were sending back and forth look at
that in when you get when you send a
huge message like a million bytes from
one from from Ellen to Java and back
again it never takes more than five
milliseconds so that's totally not the
issue and also the usual size of the
leucine messages is in that area so it
couldn't be the issue and then we figure
it out the reason it was not a binary
message we were sending lists list of
terms from one side to the other and
that's how the graph look like looks
like if you run dutchmen than run that
benchmark thing increasing the name the
number of elements in your list it
doesn't look that bad here but let me
show you an autograph in this graph I'm
comparing the same thing back and forth
a message from the same size between a
binary message and a list of binary
element and look at that see that blue
line on the bottom always close to zero
that's if you send a binary the big one
that goes up and up and up if you send a
list the problem is the encoding and
decoding of Carolyn terms in Java notes
it takes a long long time so if you are
ever connecting airline nodes with Java
note you should always try to do to send
the smaller smallest possible number of
elements in your communication they can
be huge but they can be where they must
be not too many
see saying that again in a different way
it doesn't matter how many messages
you've changed it doesn't matter the
size of them unless the site the size is
affected by the number of objects you
are certainly okay and the final lesson
this one is a read the fucking manual
but but it's important to so when you're
sending messages back and forth from
airline to Java they are encoded using
Ellen external term term format so as
the dogs explain if you're sending
strings strings longer than this number
of elements are lists but that's not
every conversion problem there is that
12 and an empty string is a list of zero
elements any string below that number of
characters is a string but if you if
you're up from 65 535 bite it's a list
again and there are not subclasses of
each other you cannot cast one of the
year so you have to handle the cases
especially in other words use binary
don't use strings so let me finish this
top with something about the future for
losing server we are greedy again we
want more extensions we we want some
security improvements that are already
documented in our github project the
scene server is now running only memory
but the sim provides different begins so
we want to add them and of course we
want more users and I think that's you
so whenever you want to use it just you
feel free to talk about that with us we
can help you and you can find it in
github tigertext vision server the
changer fice standard library is on in a
casket tab you can learn about the scene
in its home page I'm a Blue Falcon
everywhere but that page has all the
links and the last three
links are for the company in Agra the
first one is our github full of open
source project our website and the blog
and that's it thank you very much yeah
first of all you can run ln code that's
one thing this back and forth yeah the
second thing is that this is an OTP
obligation so it's transparent for
everyone you just put it in your project
and you forget about you don't know
about Java doesn't care it's a it's like
that that was the main goal when we
started with not that I can recall of
but I'm not the responsible for
controlling those servers so maybe I'm
not entirely sure that no no issue was
reported that I can tell yeah for sure
sales a lot of it makes sense and we
have something like that not exactly but
yeah we have this application inside
another application that is replicated
so it shares the data but it's on top of
it we put that on top of this yeah when
someone someone fails we use the other
and we turn the amount up again so yeah
yeah it makes sense it's just not inside
this person yeah
yes yes yeah we're a next everything on
the start it's it takes yeah we have a
with our data in a Redis when you seen
server starts we have an SSL we have an
application on top of it so when that
application starts it starts with in
server grabs the data from raleys feel
the leucine index it takes nothing I'll
tell you it's extremely fast yeah it's
extremely fast it millions of users so
I'm not quite sure but yeah it's it's a
big one it's a big number but it's it
takes like a second so it's you feel the
index again and then there you go and as
I told you we have several instances so
during that period we are using another
one
uh-huh exactly good question you should
have you should ask him I don't know
yeah I know no it's something that was
never came to me so they never said hey
this is a java thing running here I
don't know nothing up to this point it's
been a year and a half and no complain I
don't know if I know JVM tuning and so
so yeah that's one thing I don't know
much about Java I did some development
but i'm not an expert so if there is an
java exper around here I'd be glad to
show him his code this code for sure
yeah Jeff expert no oh yeah yeah ah let
me ah no no no this one it's freaky
there you go
remain like garbage collector just yeah
not that I had faced him yeah I I didn't
know about that no just seen exactly I
think I think that's the key I think
that that's a geek oh the gene server is
doing almost nothing the scene is doing
all the work yeah oh that could be a
problem yeah yeah that's the thing if
you if you created a note efficient
server implement the new division server
and your code there it's it's not just
message passing as this one yeah I may
be tricky yeah for sure
around thousand queries per second tour
know something like that but that's on
peak I think the regular is like 10
queries per second 100 maybe but no not
that much oh I don't know that but it
must be around 34 yeah yeah I get tone
tell you yeah I get total yeah for sure
i can totally point to meet you with a
guy that operates that for sure oh yeah
it miss that's the thing it comes often
like when I talk to people I said like
oh I created a list in server or
whatever and they say yeah we use
elastic search so yeah it's a different
thing it's a it's the same thing make me
serve the same purpose but it's
different this one was thought to be
included in our obligations that's a key
part of it it's not something that
connects to a different thing it's
inside your application that's the main
difference
yeah for the for the people that wanted
me to work on obvious dl on queries yeah
yeah yeah for sure yeah now let me show
you an example let me show you an
example for instance we're using that
for that auto complete box and when you
type something it ranks your friends
first and that's something you should be
very clever to index that way because it
depends on who is running the query so
we solve that by doing an airline query
Alan part of the query that just fetches
your friend as any other piece in the
code that the same function it just
tells you if a value is a the ID for
your friend period that's it so it was
very easy in that part if you have it
indexes somewhere else you have to index
the relation between the u.s. senator
yes yes yes that's Roo
no I will be around you can find me
later course yeah to Martina whatever j
yes
right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
