developing a better system with the
CRISPR embedded port in this talk we're
going to show you a prototype we made
with it which is on home automation
visualization prototype so I'm cloudy at
the Pew slash I am Adam Lindbergh and
companies per sitting at GmbH and we do
embedded Erlang in general and also we
have specific application with thee for
the automotive and it does automation
industries and one of our products is
the femoral flashing Hydra Prague which
you see up there and then another
application is smart conveyor belts if
you were in the talk before it is in
this room you probably seen them and we
are also part of you project which is
the light-cone edge and we're going to
talk more about that later so this is a
table of contents of this talk so
basically we are going to explain why we
think this is a good example for the
CRISPR method boards and what is the
hardware platform what is the softest
stock and we're going to show you the
home automation demo and then we're
going to talk a bit about future
developments so one thing that's usually
pretty hard to do with embedded systems
is actually to look into them to
visualize and introspect them there are
tend to be a bit of a black box also
because they are generally see
application or C++ applications and they
don't have nice and nice things that
Olin has so Allen makes it really easy
to put a web servers on the end by the
device itself so you can just you know
get your data and then get it to the web
server and that get it back to some web
application and then you can also have
interactive shells with Erlang so now
we're going to talk about the hardware
of the grease port and Adam is gonna do
it so the grease port is a specialized
hardware we made for running
Erlang it's for IOT applications and
it's a embedded wireless device
so by embedded we mean like low power
efficient small portable wireless
because it has built-in Wi-Fi and you
can connect many other types of radio
extensions and P mods and so on so the
board itself has a 300 megahertz ARM
processor it's a cortex m7 it has 64
megabytes of ROM which is quite a lot
for Erlang so our Lang in itself is
already quite memory efficient the VM is
fairly small and 64 megabytes gives you
lots of space for for any type of
embedded applications you want to build
it has 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi built in and
a microSD slot for deploying software so
you can ship new software to it easily
or replace it so let's look at the board
a bit more in detail what type of
hardware we have available so I will
quickly go through a couple of generic
things that we won't mention in this
talk and then I'll go into a bit more
depth of the stuff we're actually using
for the home automation prototype we've
done so some generic things that might
be interesting if you do some embedded
IOT things for home automation maybe we
have some switches and LEDs so switches
you could use for for Hardware things
like toggling things on and off for
triggering certain events or RGB LEDs
for showing statuses for various things
on the board that you don't need a GUI
for the board has a couple of connectors
for various types of hardware so we have
GPIO UART and SPI which are all
different types of connectors or the
connectors are the same but at different
types of protocols to talk to the
hardware basically different levels of
abstraction and incapabilities so for
home automation we're going to look at
two other connectors a bit more in
detail the first one is i-square seed
this stands for inter integrated circuit
and was a really developed in the 80s by
by Philips and it is a four wire
protocol master slave protocol and it
has one wire for the data beta
we're four o'clock line for
synchronization and power and ground in
addition to this and it is a bus
protocol which means you can chain lots
of devices on the same bus and you can
address them so that means each device
has an address and you can send data to
a specific device using their address
and you can have up to thousand devices
on the same bus so it's it's very
scalable it's usually used for board
local communications so by that we mean
that over longer distances it's not so
reliable so you lose speed you lose
transmission quality so you usually use
it for things which are close to the
device you're building so if you have a
box with the grease board in one and you
might put some other hardware in there
and you might use I square seat then why
are all this up and talked it it's
fairly slow so it's about 0.4 megabits
per second because of these these wires
and the distance the other thing we're
gonna actually show a demo about is one
wire and this is an even more
lightweight type of bus so it's
developed by Dallas semiconductors and
it's the cool thing the name comes from
it only using one wire plus ground so
it's a small parenthesis there for both
the data and the power so that means
that if you have lots of devices on this
bus they can power themselves off the
data line when they're not using the
data so each device have can have a
small capacitor that they power when
they're not active or when other devices
are active and then once they get the
message that for that for their address
they would then start using this
capacitor as a temporary battery so it's
very similar to I square C but the good
thing is that it has it supports longer
distances it's more stable and this is
more a room scale type of connector so
it's slower than I Square C because of
this but if you want to wire up a house
or a like a bunch of rooms you can
totally do this with wires and it's an
addressable microloan so each client has
an address just as with I square C
and it's a unique 64-bit address so it's
pretty pretty strong and it consists of
the ID of the device unique ID the type
of the device and a small checksum so if
you have devices showing up on this bus
you can actually already figure out by
the ID what type of device it is and
start using the right driver to talk to
them and popular examples of devices for
for one wire is like simple buttons like
buttons for example key fobs for
security systems different types of
sensors like weather climate temperature
and and so on what also useful for home
automation is wireless communication so
on the grease board itself we have
built-in Wi-Fi so there is a Wi-Fi chip
it's BGN Network 2.4 gigahertz and it's
wired up with onboard USB interface and
it supports up to like 17 megabits per
second for 20 megabits bandwidth or up
250 mb/s is theoretical Wi-Fi speed so
you never reach them but it's it's quite
fast so it's it's useful for bit more
heavy applications and for integrating
with the rest of your home for example
it also have power savings so it can go
into low-power mode or you can turn it
off when you don't need it so if you
want to build device that sits somewhere
maybe powered by battery you can still
totally use this and then adjust the
usage of the Wi-Fi to your needs and in
addition to the built-in Wi-Fi you can
then connect P mods to this so I'm gonna
bring up one example here which is the P
mode RF 2 and it is a P mode that has a
receiver for I Triple E 802 15.4 which
is a wireless personal area network
standard so it's a wireless standard for
making kind of local networks
specifically made for low cost and low
power devices so things that need to run
for a long time may be connected to some
master every now and then which then
could be the grease board with one such
p mode and it supports up to like or
around
and meet the range things and on top of
this standard there are high-level
protocols and two examples are ZigBee
which is an open standard protocol and
me which is a proprietary one but lots
of these lots of like devices they
support one of these protocols for
example and I think this p-mod also has
support for for using these protocols so
the cool thing is if you use this p-mod
you talk to it with SPI the SPI protocol
which we have drivers in the wisp
runtime so you do it from Erlang and
then you don't have to deal with all the
nasty hard Hardware level details like
wireless things so this is very cool so
now we're going to talk a bit about the
front end and the back end stacks you
know software so the first thing to
notice is that this is really a real
Erlang VM which is running directly on
the CPU so there's no intermediary that
there's no operating system and we call
it real bare metal because bare metal is
a bit of a you know overused term maybe
they're fertile bare metal even when
it's like a virtualized serving in the
cloud so this is actual metal and this
is an overview for this for the Safa
stack of this prototype as you can see
there is a grease board there are the
sensors and there is a front end so the
way this works is the grease port has
got these sensors connected through the
one wire protocol and drivers for this
they get information from the sensors
and then they give this information to
the web application which also runs on
the Grzyb embedded or and that
application sends this information back
to the web shop through the web sockets
to the front-end application and now
we're going to show the front-end
application but first I need to give
credit where it's due
most of the d3 part and the SVG part of
this application has been done by Amelia
Bellamy writes and she's a published
author with O'Reilly where she has four
books on SVG and we ask for help a while
ago with some as tricky as Fijian CSS
stuff so she also helped did a lot of
this work
and this is the screenshot of the
application as you can see there are
three thermometers and they each they
are components made in d3 and SVG and
then below there is a graph which is a
graph which shows historical data of all
the sensors which are connected so
basically there is a thermometer for
each sensor that's going to get
connected and so this is what happens
when you connect so the web degrees
Development Board has got an IP and you
can connect to it and there is a web
server on it so this is what you get a
static HTML a static HTML and then you
get what you know the JavaScript and the
CSS whatever it's on its and then the
components are made in SVG and d3 is
updated getting the information from
these web sockets and then updating
information into the SVG and this is a
graph of how so there is a particularity
about d3 that he needs to bind with
apparent Dom components since we are
going to add and remove sensors we don't
want to be you know tied to a static Dom
so the result our script controller that
creates and removes Dom elements as
needed and binds them with the tree
and this is the WebSocket protocol so
basically once you've loaded the static
HTML it there WebSockets will open and
then you start to get your data and this
is also an example the protocol is in
Jason and this is an example of it's as
you can see it's very simple just got an
ID at a time and the value for each
temperature sensor and every time one
temperature sensor updates it gets an
updated like snapshot of all the data in
the connected to the system and then it
shows it and now we're going to talk a
bit about their web server so we on the
backend we use our lang
so we have a Norling application and we
run we have cowboy as a dependency so we
use cowboy to first just serve the
static pages from from memory from the
SD card and then we also set up a web
socket listener that the web page will
connect you back once you load the web
page into your in your browser and in
the early application we're using the
grip on time to use mic to use the
drivers so we have a one wire driver
already in the risk runtime and we have
a driver a high level or long driver for
these temperature sensors and the Erlang
application for the the the prototype
for the demo is basically wiring all
this together so it runs a regular scan
on the 1-wire bus to see if new
temperature sensors have showed up and
whenever it finds a new one it will
start an Erlang process that then will
regularly query that specific sensor
with its own unique ID for the
temperature and then when the WebSocket
updates it will ask all the temperature
sensors that are available like what's
your current temperature and then we'll
develop ship it off to the to the front
and regularly as updates come so we're
going to attempt the demo and let's see
how that goes so we have a grist port
here running out for battery pack and we
have a long one wire bus here a long
wire so we have three wires it's broader
than this but we only use three of them
because we also
power the temperature sensors with
onboard power from the grease board so
it means that those sensors they don't
have this fancy capacitor thing because
they're just like a super simple
temperature sensors with those three
wires and we'll just use the power from
the grease board for this demo so could
you maybe hold this one and then I will
set up the computer side of things
let me know if it shows okay they're
perfect so now I'm on the same Wi-Fi as
the grease board and the grease board
has booted and I've configured it to
connect to this Wi-Fi I'm on the same
Wi-Fi with my laptop and what I can see
here is I can already ping the IP number
that the grease port has so it's on
running on the Wi-Fi and let's try to
view the webpage that it's serving
so this is the dashboard that we have
for our prototype and it's a very simple
one right now it's empty because we
don't have any sensors we don't even
have a 1-wire bus it's fine so it's
still running and the back end is like
regularly occurring the 1-wire bus to
see if anything is is there so what
we'll do is we'll connect this to the
grass board so the one wire interface
has three wires as I said before two or
three depending on the power so first a
data wire and then the ground wire and
lastly the power wire so this means that
now the grist pass this one wire bus
active and it will just keep scanning
this for things so if we plug in a
temperature sensor into one of these
slots we should see come up in the short
while so the scan is running every 10 15
seconds the reason it's not like
snappier than this is because one wire
is actually really slow protocol and for
this demo we're kind of abusing it so
we're running these things like much
faster than you normally would do if you
would worried this up in your home just
so we can see some nice things on screen
so normally you would never like run the
scan regularly you maybe have an
interface where we go in and if you
plugged in a new sensor in a new room
you would just go and do it manually
basically for this demo it automated it
so it looks a bit more fancy and now
we'll see if we can do like some
interactive things so we want some help
from the audience so basically if you go
and hand out a few of these sensors and
we can actually bring the grist port
with us because it's wireless and it has
a battery pack so this should all be
possible and let's see if the thing
still works
maybe you just hold this and then let's
maybe pass this around
so make sure you get like a slot
somewhere with a space for a sensor
so maybe give all of them here and then
they just pass it backwards along the
wire and oh okay
so if you plug one in you should see
them popping up after a while what you
can do for example is you can like hold
your finger around it or breathe on it
or something you can see the temperature
slowly going up and here we also have
the historical data graph of the
temperatures that we've seen so far so
it's a bit slow because I don't want the
scan to run too often because as you put
in more sensors the scan kind of
competes with the sensor data which
means that if I was scanning the whole
time there would be no traffic on the
wire for actually getting the data and
so on so let's see if we get a few more
sensors showing up soon so how many has
been plugged in so far ok so should be
more showing up not sure why yeah so one
problem is like as soon as you have lots
of them on the wire the scan is very
slow so maybe we added like too many too
fast now ok there they go all of them
and so I mean you won't see it now
because we didn't add them like
regularly slowly but the speed of the
updates would basically be slower and
slower the more sensors we add so
typically in a real-world use case you
would have a room or a small house wired
up with these sensors and then you would
maybe update them once a minute or once
every five minutes or something because
you don't need the data that regularly
now we're just doing it for show
basically to get some more interesting
demos so what's cool is right now we're
running an Erlang application on this
Chris board lying around over there in
Paris lab and it is battery powered and
it has a long kind of sensor with
temperatures and things like this so
what we can do is we can also talk to
this Chris board so yeah we see this
so I will attempt to login to the Erlang
shell on the grist port so now we have
an interactive Erlang shell running on
embedded hardware over there and so the
way this works is that I running a
remote shell with our line is the text
okay can you see it or should I make it
a bit bigger bigger F suspected so so
let's see if we can fit most of the
stuff in here so this is the Erlang
shell even bigger okay let's maybe let's
do it like this
so this is the grist shell and if I do
for example application which
applications you can see that we are
running cowboy for example we run the
the grist run time and we run this
application called home which is the one
we wrote for the demo that kind of
connects all of this together one other
thing we can do is so I have this grist
project that I created on my laptop and
this is where all the code is so I can
start a rebar shell here and what you
can do with rebar is when you start a
rebar shell you can tell it to set a
node name for the Erlang VM that starts
that rebar uses for compilation and
things and I'm setting it's saying
cookie that I'm using on the grist board
so right now this is just a normal rebar
shell running on my local computer and
because I'm on Wi-Fi and because I've
set up the hostname to point to the IP
number of the grease board I can then
connect to this one so this is the same
node name that's that's up here
and I get a pong back which means the
ping worked and if I now check which
notes I'm connected to you can see I'm
connected to the the crisp node remotely
so this is now distributed Erlang
running from my laptop to this grease
board if I check the nodes on the grass
board itself you'll see three notes
because there's a hidden node behind the
remote shell node running on my local
computer that connects to the grease
board as well and rebar has some fancy
functionality for running rebar tasks in
the rebar shell so I just compiled the
code in my local computer and it's
running on that local shell only so with
this information we can then go into a
editor so this is the driver for the
temperature sensor in the wisp runtime
and it has a few functions to talk to
over one wire to the sensor so the
sensors work like this that you send a
convert command so this is this function
here and that will initiate one
temperature conversion and store the
value of the term thermometer on the
device and then there's a temp command
where you actually acquire the value
that's stored on the device so you
specifically have to tell the device to
update the temperature you can also
configure to like out update and then
you can ask for the temperature so we do
some fancy bit mangling in Erlang
this is really nice because we don't
have to do C to do this we can do
everything in Erlang with some binary
pattern matching and this is basically
how you get out twelve bits of
temperature value from the sensor data
and because it is in total two bytes
sixteen bits so we divided by sixteen in
the end when we get the numerical value
to actually get the degree Celsius
because the sensor gives us degree
Celsius that's how it's made so if you
wanted to change this for example to
Fahrenheit we could update the
calculation so I comment out the old one
and use a Fahrenheit calculation instead
now I go here and I compile the
application again
which will recompile the grist from time
and the driver and I can now net load
the module which is one wire v20 and
that means I've now loaded the new
driver on the grass board and the next
time we get an update for temperature
values we should actually get Fahrenheit
values instead possibly this might be a
little bit slow so let's see if we can
see the actual WebSocket or maybe the
WebSocket died
let's see let's reload the page and see
if we can talk to
so it could be that like it's just super
slow acquiring the temperature and we
have to wait for a while if we don't get
anything here I will just try to run it
manually on the shell to see that we
actually get Fahrenheit okay there we go
and now the values are in Fahrenheit so
I basically live updated the home
automation application I tweak the code
fix the bug and I loaded the new code
over the wireless network and it just
works so this is our demo okay so kind
of updates of what we're working on at
the moment or what's the future for for
this work and for the grip itself so one
thing we're looking into is to use MQTT
so MQTT is a kind of machine to machine
interface it's message queue made
specifically for Internet of Things
applications and we there is a mqtt
smart home initiative that kind of has
some architectural best practices and
collects lots of projects that use MQTT
specifically for a smart home so the way
you would use MQTT is for example you
would enable MQTT on the wisp you would
maybe add some dependency find or make a
library to use this and then you could
connect so you do you run like the
grease past a central home hub which
runs an empty TT message queue on it or
you have already one somewhere in your
home or on a server somewhere and then
you can talk with MQTT to this hub and
to publish/subscribe messages things
like this so for example one of the the
applications in this smart home
repository or like one one of the
applications they list is a bridged from
apple homekit to MQTT which means if you
had MQTT running and you had a crisp
sending like MQTT events for example
with this temperature values you could
then view this via via apple homekit on
your iPhone or something like this and
there's lots of different projects for
different hardware and different like
gooeys and from tensor things so this is
very cool stuff and we also plan to use
MQTT for some more industrial
applications as well because it's a very
nice protocol for for distributed
systems in general when it comes to
automation and now we're going to talk a
bit about the future for the fronton
libraries so it would be nice for us to
get more of a generic library as the
application you saw was all hot dog
based it was all harder basically but
you me nice to get a more generic
library with more types of widgets so
you can get many different types of
sensors and still have some widget that
you can use to show them off and it will
also nice to get the dashboard to be
editable and persistent so you can
change the layout of your time of your
temperature sensors for example you can
see the layout of your widgets you can
change the type of widgets you can
change their value ranges stuff like
that and then save it back to the grease
port and then the next time it will show
up exactly as you want and also we want
to look into more higher-level graphing
libraries because d3 is quite low level
so maybe a lot of effort to do all of
these in just straight in d3 so for
February right now for the Greece
project we're already shipping the
hardware since last year and we're
working on releasing the next version of
the runtime version 1.1 with the latest
drivers and fixes and so what we have
working is Wi-Fi wa2
encryption airline or their latest
version of Erlang is running with crypto
so you can do like HTTP and other things
and we have all basic drivers kind of
kitted so we have the drivers for all
the different ports on the grip and we
are slowly working on adding like high
level drivers so one example is for this
temperature sensors we have different p
mods that we won't have drivers for
things like this so we're part of a you
project called light-cone and it's kind
of an internet of things project they go
into
see our DTS synchronization free
programming habit gossip protocols all
with the purpose of improving edge
computation so by edge computation we
mean things which are close to the edge
of networks that means small devices out
somewhere and like your laptop's your
iPhones or Mobile's your grease boards
whatever you have so a way to like
improve communication between such
devices which are already close to each
other without having to go to central
servers all the time and synchronize so
we do lots of things there to to improve
for example Erlang distribution and
things like this so yeah as I said
before we want more drivers more high
level drivers we're looking into pre
building the OTP or the Erlang VM that
we use on the grist board and the tool
chain so right now if you want to create
a great application you would download
our tool chain you would compile it this
includes like GCC and other tools that
is needed to compile cross compile
software any software C software for for
the crisp architecture and then with
that we then build our line using the
rebar plugin for for crisp so we build a
specialized Erlang vm including all the
runtime drivers that we provide and you
can then add your own drivers and then
we can put this on the SD card so we
want to provide pre compiled versions of
all these things so that if you don't
have any special needs like you're fine
with the grist drivers that comes out of
the box you could just like download a
package that's already built and deploy
it directly instead of having to wait
for all this compilation things when you
set up a new project and as I mentioned
before in the light-cone slide we're
working on fixing Erlang distribution so
Orlan distribution right now it's a
fully connected mesh so if you add more
nodes all nodes have actually a TCP
connection to every other node which
means like if you do an i/o te project
and you have like hundreds of grease
boards running in your big auditorium
for example you would like quickly
realize that the scale of this network
wouldn't really work so it's too many
connections too much traffic and we want
to make it more lightweight basically
and
make it so that the connections are more
dynamic which means that if you have for
example a smart conveyor belt with
hundreds or thousands of Erlang nodes we
don't want to connect all of them to all
other nodes you want to like partition
it a bit and be smart about where
traffic goes and not to overload the
whole network so yeah so so this is
grifs that was the talk and if you are
interested in Greece and into getting so
there is the crisp website Chris play
talk and then all the well the source
code is on github at github.com crisp
and there is also a free node channel
you can if you have questions after this
talk I mean later when you're at home
and you have more questions then you can
go to the pheno channel and then there
is also a channel on the urlan slack and
also if you're interested in getting
grease port you can get a 20% discount
with the code lambda 2018 all lowercase
and that was it
thank you yeah thank you both I really
enjoyed the demo so we have time for
about 4 questions is to mate
yes hello so if we have the application
written along as such for the home
automation and just especially for the
grease board and how do you think how
much effort do we need to deploy it also
on some other arm seven for example for
salmon there are seven boards is it only
to having the drivers or some more
reference will we need to put it on the
another platform it's definitely
possible the work you would need to do
is so we have a fork of OTP of Erlang
where we did some adaptations most of
the code is actually not in that fork
but in our Grist repository so we have a
build process where we build the Erlang
VM and during that process we copy in
some extra code so we override some
files then we cop in like the drivers C
files and then we just run the normal or
line combination cross compiling it to
to our architecture so if you had a
different architecture you would need to
do two things you need to adapt the
Erlang the this the tweaks we've done to
the Erlang vm maybe change some files or
set up some C code that you need for
your specific platform and you would
need a tool chain for your platform so
you would need that compiler where you
can compile C code if you have those two
things then you could actually reuse
most of what we've done and just replace
those two parts and then target a
different platform and with the Grzyb
initiative we really want to do this we
want to so the the the plugins and
everything is set up for multiple
platforms and at the moment we have one
or soon too because we're doing some
industrial platform as well for a
customer but there's nothing stopping
you from like contributing a different
platform or reusing the parts we've used
and then just replacing what's specific
for your platform so that's completely
doable okay thank you
how does supporting multiple platforms
connect the elixir and nerfs project
because in nerfs you have the tool chain
that supports multiple platforms out of
the box would it be possible for example
to create the modified Ireland VM plus
the system as a target in attics or
nerfs project I think maybe yes I
haven't looked into nerves so much in
depth so as I see there are two
differences with nerves and crisp let's
say three if you count the hardware
platform as well so one difference is
that they are targeting Linux systems so
we're talking Raspberry Pi other systems
which are actually more way more
powerful than the grease board and
powerful enough to run a normal OS and
then put our leg on top and then they
provide some system drivers to interface
with Hardware using I don't know the
Raspberry Pi libraries and things like
this
for Grist we're actually targeting
smaller more low-power more efficient
applications so we don't have this
operating system layer at all so there's
nothing you could share there to like
like you cannot put Linux drivers on
this thing you actually have to take the
C code and somehow integrate it with
with Artem's and with Orlick vm another
difference is that we want to provide or
we because we have the control over the
hardware we provide many more high level
drivers and actually we have right now
we have a complete set of drivers for
all the kind of low-level interfaces on
the board and with nerves they are
targeting much more like a broader range
of hardware so I think they have a bit
less less like complete set of drivers
for various pieces of hardware so this
is something like we see it's a value
that you should be able to buy one of
these start a no line project and just
immediately be able to use everything
which is on your board so this is one
goal for us as well
they could be possibilities to share
like more high level infrastructure
between the projects but I'm not sure if
it's worth it
we can definitely run alex here on the
grid support because it's the Erlang VM
so I've done this I've deployed an alux
application
without problems we want to work on
tooling so we have a rebar project we
want to work on tooling which is a
library that the rebar plug-in uses and
then we want to write an elixir plugin
for mix as well that does this use the
same back end and can then deploy a mix
application directly directly to the
grist as well so this is kind of how we
see the world
