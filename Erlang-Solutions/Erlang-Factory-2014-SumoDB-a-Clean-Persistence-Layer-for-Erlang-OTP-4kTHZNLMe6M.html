and Excel in certain scenarios you can
find any memory databases graph
databases document stores and more it's
becoming more and more common to run
many of these in your stack the
difference in interfacing with these
databases can add inflection complexity
to your application so it's important to
have the right abstractions in place
Marko's I wanna see know what source
developer an earlier in the novel will
describe the tool he's build called soon
to be designed to simplify interacting
with a variety of databases okay hello
everyone can you hear me okay okay we
have to run everyone and thank you for
coming
this talk is about sumo TV which is an
alarm person layer designed to be easy
to use in your heaven applications I
hope you enjoy it you go my name is
Marco Salman acid I'm from Argentina I
study computer science university
Italian as you know in Argentina - I'd
be working on an application for about
three years now before that I worked
mostly on pro-v apps and currently I am
developer a Tanaka where I have work on
some radical applications like whisper
maybe you know it in a geyser on US
company with offices in Argentina we
have quite a large team of runners we
will end-to-end applications mainly with
air learn Ruby on us on Android we also
do Ellen consulting
ok let me get started here we are seeing
a hundred call statement extracted from
a very big server I call this distance
sensor the gut module the goal of this
code is execute a select query in the
database and resolve the results how
many of you have written
I got module with function like this one
track say your databases ok once ok this
like the personal first thing to do to
communicate with the data races inside
this function we have a car code query
and we are executing it by using some
driver
I see well in this case and also we are
handle different side of results even
even the errors but this way actually
tends make Krabby project because
there's no clear definition of concerns
and responsibilities and our business
logic is mixed with the data
implementation details also it makes the
application carbon to test with our own
in the whole system
and we can we can't test the business
logic isolated from the exit layer from
the exit side from the data access layer
sorry also it has a lot of community
call since we are compa based in code to
create new hundred call statement to
create new queries and for the same
reason if they used to scale and
refactor and it's very easy to make a
mistake and this is an ibid of the god
module here we only have four functions
for this code module and the code
doesn't fit in the slide as you can see
it's an excellent nightmare work with
this code so let's say let's see how we
can help us to write this in a cleaner
way which smoothly we only need one line
of code to do most of the common queries
we can do a lot of things with just one
line in Simone
like persisting and deleting an entity
such as user messages etc and we can
fetch by conditions passionate assaults
on also we can create a schema for each
one of our end entities so let's see how
some is about how it work and white and
why in it is interesting the secret is
just a pattern
repositories how many of you are
familiar with this pattern okay okay
to try to understand what is what the
repositories are let's go back to the
code module for Freud in the side and we
can see its responsibilities the first
thing that we notice in in that in the
inner life it does it that it has a lot
of responsibilities on also it has a
handle it handle multiple entities
that's bad so let's split each end
on its own module I mean one module one
entity this song live actor record right
how many of you have used active record
here
you'd rather enrollee for example okay
with active record instead of one big
god module we will have several modules
and one per entity it's a first
improvement for this 2d situation but
it's still a mess because we still have
a lot of mini god modules they call this
thick coupled to the data eighty tales
so let's go one step further let's take
each entity and let's start splitting is
responsibilities into new modules the
first module will be a domain entity
which encapsulate the business logic and
the state for the entity this dominant
it is this module not nothing about the
storage details then we will have our
repository which is the layer that
translates back and forth the
representation of the entity into
something that the data is can use and
also the repository store single called
like cooked on select or and editors and
finally there's a leash this there's a
layer that actually knows how to talk to
a dangerous and those are the stores
buttons oh it's sorry the tokens are
just a convenient layer to encapsulate
the different in the driver so that no
one else know of them in some of these
three concept are implemented weight
behaviors the domain entity in Somali we
are just modules that implement the
similar behavior this behavior only need
three callbacks suma Chima summative and
Summa wake up let's take a look so
nickimja is used to create the entity
schema in the database in it we
construct the schema the sumo needs to
create to create it in the degree to
help with all sumo provides two
convenient options
which are new schema a new field then we
have the sumo slip callback which one we
recall when we want to persist the
entity in the in the data is someone we
use this function to translate our state
representation in subproblems which is
the internal representation in sumo
in this case we are translating for a
record which is unusable Solar Probe
list when sumo loads an entity from the
DB it will use sumo a cup to translate
the entity from the probe lead to our
representation which is a record here we
are seeing problems and we are returning
the user record so let's see how the
workflow looks like for the persist and
finally operations when we call when we
call the persist function Sumalee we
will use the sumo slip code back don't
relate the state representation for for
the entity to a probe list and then it
will convert this probably to whatever
the data is other means the exact
opposite happens when we fetch an entity
from the database the data
representation is taken and transformed
into our own state representation by the
sumo by the function small a couple the
point here is that we only need to
implement the sleep and punch and wake
up functions and the rate of the work is
maximally okay
that's all about the illumina entities
repositories repositories the
repositories know about know about
queries and how to work with a different
storage Bracken's and you will also
translate information back and form from
the domain entity to the storage
backends
this really helps to minimize the query
induction duplication so the idea is
that our domain entities can focus on
the business logic and it will delegate
the storage details to someone else to
our repositories but the fault some
accounts
comes with basic limitation for
different repositories like my sink when
a movie
and these repositories already have the
Milliman tation for functions such as
per says delete it by fine by in sidrón
usually you will use one of these
default repositories and if you need
some special query to execute in your
application you can use these before
repositories as the foundation for your
own where you will write your new
queries for example or is not supported
in fine by closest closest yet so if you
need a query with an or in it usual
usual write your own function in your
own repository
it's simple do that okay now we have the
storage plugin this first bug in our
module that implements the zoom Obachan
behavior they encapsulate and now how to
use the data is writer such as in my
sequel and also it start a connection
with the database and provide this
connection to the different repositories
a suppose somebody is capable of
dispatching event that affect the state
of the domain like notifying that a
certain entity was created updated or
deleted also it will notify when a
schema was created for any entity it's
useful to react up to react upon the
events coming up from the domain from
the domain and dispatching other kind of
events for instance into a resident
queue system or doing cleanup tasks etc
this is implemented using an event which
is the standard code TP way to do it
so how we can how do we use so many in
our system well let's say we want to
work with that entity called user and I
think what we need to do to implement it
with sumadi the first thing to do is is
to write the entity module where we add
the suma dog behavior and it's state
representation in this case is a user
record with only an ID and a user name
field and then we implement the three
callbacks that we mentioned before
so my schema to create the scheme in the
database
with the two field ID and username we
can add some options rising demand or
not known etc and then we have the sumo
sumo asleep and some wakeup functions to
translate the from the user record to
the probe list and vice-versa and also
we can't recall implement a constructor
function we could do it but is no
necessary is not necessary here we have
it
and the next step is a configuration the
first thing that we do is bind our
entity user so our repository a
repository called
user repo then which I that repository
name to the module that had
implementation in this case is some repo
my sequel which is one of the default
repository that comes with somebody in a
region we had some option like the
storage back-end and the number of a
worker for this repository and finally
we will computer the storage back in
with a specific database ragged option
such as user password etc and that's it
done now we can start to persist and
find user in our system using smoothly
for instance we could have a user
service with function right Neal get an
elite and this function only have one or
two lines to do your work to do it works
very simple so let's do another step and
let's see how we can combine sumo dB we
call wait to have an HTTP server with a
storage back-end in a few lines for done
we will explore the connection tab which
is a sample application created created
by Naga to teach l1 to the new comers
conchita means paper Roy in Spanish it's
a simpler level server with server send
you and capabilities and it basically
receive a store and dispatches new
flashes it has two endpoints one to
publish new flashes and another one to
receive them and we have cowboy to talk
with the users and we have some DVD to
talk with the database in this case we
are using my cygwin with the endpoint
and we kind of start listening for new
flashing from the server when the
communication starts the server will
retrieve all the new flasher from the DV
and it will keep the connection opened
then with the post request we send a new
flash to the server and he will store a
new flash in my sequel using some unity
and also it will send a new flash to
open connections let's see the main here
we have the new event that we add with a
post in endpoint okay let's see the main
part of the Ganesha task code can you
see the has only one small dog which is
connected a news in it we can see the
zoom vlog behavior relation and the new
flash record which is the state
representation for this entity also we
can see the sumo schema function where
can she defines the title for this
entity
below we have the sumo sleep and sumo
wake up function where the first ones
are laid a new flash it's well published
and the other one translate in the
opposite way then we have our controller
function which received two fields and
red zone a new flash record finally we
have three convenient together functions
and here we have the cowboy under
functions in the handle post can Sheeta
use the sumo persist function to save
the new flash in the database with only
one line well actually we have the new
and with the hundred in the gods in the
conjugate Knesset our calls to sumo find
all to get all the story new flashes
very simple with only one line we are
calling to the database and getting all
the new flashes very simple so which was
right
I showed you an a whole application that
really works it's very simple
okay the current state for for some of
me is if the next one so many read now
supports my sequel and one with me very
well actually we have a big project
working with sumo and my sequel and it
works really really great
we have almost finished their support
for readies and single three and the
next in the future we want to Adam Nisha
and ETS and also Dino movie and also we
are thinking to work on ps3 and PS 3
sorry that's pretty much it ok to finish
and this talk I want to see that summer
was warm from or need to find a way to
write fast and clean code to access data
races and since we couldn't find any
application to do that in the Pureland
world we decide to create it soon as I
am project it does it work pretty well
and we want it to grow up it's an open
source project so so you are invited to
contribute somebody is our new way to
were in Ireland and it can be yours too
thank you
it was really small
yes actually we created it because we
need to work with my sequel
so the first support was for my sea wall
in convene in the list is no really it
is in the list but not yet we were we
will work to write right you don't need
to use record to to represent their your
entity you could use problems or
whatever you want it's not necessary
yeah actually you you could connect each
repository which one different source
button so you call right now each entity
only can work with one repository so you
you can support multiple databases but
one per entity right now you don't have
right now you can do you can work with
multiple database for the same entity
but you can implement different database
the databases for different entities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
