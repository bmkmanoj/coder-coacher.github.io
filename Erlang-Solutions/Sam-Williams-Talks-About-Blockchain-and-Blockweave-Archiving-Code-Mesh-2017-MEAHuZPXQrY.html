who you are
I'm Sam Williams I'm the CEO of the
Archean project also a PhD candidate at
the University of Kent can you explain
what that project is yeah it's
essentially an open permanent archive
parallel to the Internet built on a
block we've kind of blockchain that's
slightly modified so I'm not familiar
with this area very well can you explain
to me the difference between a block
painting a block weave yeah so block
chains is a chain of cryptographically
linked blocks a block weave is same but
instead of just linking to the last
block you link to another randomly
suited randomly chosen previous block in
the chamber I was going to loop it back
in and it makes a sort of weave
structure but the interesting thing
about that is it uses a proof of access
algorithm rather than a proof of work
system so you in order to mine the next
block you have to prove that you have
access to the randomly chosen previous
block which incentivizes you to store
those old blocks and essentially the
amount of or the portion of the old
blocks you store is the proportion of
the amount of time you can spend
usefully hashing in the system in order
to find new blocks so at a network scale
what's interesting about it is that it
incentivizes people to make an even
storage of the box over time so if
there's a block that only I have and
nobody else has then when that one's
chosen as the recall block the one from
the previous list that's moved back in
again
I'm almost guarantee the reward if I can
do the small amount of hashing acquired
and so I get a large financial incentive
to store those blocks than nobody else's
story
okay and in that fashion you'll you'll
tend to seek duplication through the
whole network yeah so you see redundancy
but also self-organizing redundancy so
you don't see spikes if everyone has
this block and no one has that block
because if no one has this pocket is
very financially rewarding to gain that
book and see yeah you've said
financially rewarding a couple of times
where's the personal money bit so
there's a reward for mining blocks in
the system as well as the transaction
rewards good the yeah
the mining rewards association for the
transactions as well as a flat reward
that you get for mining the block or
actually that reward goes down over time
okay what what led to this idea of what
interesting question um we were thinking
about how to build a decentralized
internet archive so really we were
looking at how news articles would
change nowadays over time so there's a
great thing about the Internet is that
people have been able to get news out of
people very quickly but that means that
a lot of people end up reading just the
first draft at redwood you know normally
become say that headlines in the next
day's newspaper and that's a bit
concerning because those drafts change
over time and if you don't go back and
catch up then then it's gone the
information you read may have been false
and also there's no record of it ever
being published so we were thinking
about how we could sort of re linearize
bad experience well human history really
and we thought a decentralized archive
is basically the way to do that this
Vince
irrevocable and immutable you know once
it's on there it's really it's never
going to change
interesting so you said running parallel
to the Internet are you are you going to
run it like archive.org where you start
pulling in the existing Internet by
periodically scanning it or who or what
so people can choose to archive the
pages there interesting okay
they pay a very very small amount just
put it on the chain well we've men is
there permanently
indefinite says it later if they want to
and that has a neat thumb it solves a
problem that's pretty major in archiving
which is you don't really know what's
gonna be historically important in 10
years time today yeah right
so you either end up storing everything
or storing things that you know a
committee has decided a small committee
has decided the right things but most of
the time you're likely to be wrong I've
very essentially employing the wisdom of
the crowd select for us the things that
that are worth archiving I see what
what's the end the end better world that
you're trying to achieve do you feel
that if we could see the news as
involves would be able to make better
choices about how society evolves or
I mean I hope so but um the real things
we're attempting to achieve is the end
of the Orwellian memory hope and so this
idea that you can take human history and
you can remove all evidence that it ever
could and we think that the effects of
that work have community development of
future authoritarian States is pretty
well we we hope you can stop that yeah
um because if you look at the
development of these states over time
and you see that there's typically a
period that they go through but they
start modifying or removing things from
the public record you can't do that then
we hope that that can at least offer
that part of it
Interfax yeah thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
