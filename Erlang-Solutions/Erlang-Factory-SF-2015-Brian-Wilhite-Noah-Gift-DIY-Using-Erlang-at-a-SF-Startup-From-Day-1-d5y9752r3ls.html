for Erlang we've gotten to know the
folks of Erlang very well and it's a
it's really it's fun to be here the ID i
had i'm on the business side i'm so i'm
not another engineer i don't i don't
write I don't write code and but I do i
do know how to start a company and I and
I got it going on my own too I found a
company that I could partner with and
use their widget technology and I worked
with that and made my business work and
I'd prove they had a business and then I
knew I had a vision that was a that was
real and I saw a big opportunity and I
built the team and I hired a team and
made some money generated profit in the
first year and a half enough to convince
me that I had a real business around
sports and the ability to scale Sports
technology which is fast moving right
now finally technology sitting sports
and I was focused on the athlete and the
athlete is big fan bases and I was
really trying to find a way to make
athletes fans in and dollars flow
together so I started that hired hired a
couple people and I got the spinning
wheel of death didn't work and I raise
some money is a very embarrassing thing
to do to go to investors and talk about
oh it you know it's going to work soon
and in its ass idea and there's this
layer that goes through down here and I
have a CTO who was from google he's got
is a Googler and he spent some time at
Nike and he's just got this thing and it
just doesn't work let him go it and I
found met Noah in that process I met
Noah and Noah comes to me and he says uh
Noah is probably one of the most
competitive people I've ever met my life
and he is an athlete and he just wants
to win and he says listen here's what
we're going to do we're going to use
Erlang and we're going to build a
world-class company and we're going to
focus on sports could be an enterprise
solution for the vertical sports and
this is what we're going to do is it
great okay let's do it and I was
actually able to sort of my great the
business
what I'd started which was really
nothing much but I got advertisers to
pay me I got athlete's I had
partnerships with traditional sports
publishers and I was able to make make a
living and turn profit and but I had a
bigger vision I wanted to build the
social network for sports around the
world and I want to be the enterprise
solution for sports or no that was my
vision I don't write code I don't know
how to do that but I have the business I
had the connections we have a couple
thousand athletes in our platform now we
have teams and leagues no it comes to me
he's with me for about 24 hours and I'll
never forget out on the golf course in
in New York playing in a major league
baseball tournament thing and it's about
105 degrees and I had a friend who was
helping me transition he was also a
technologist and he was helped me
transition from what I had in firing the
CTO to Noah he actually helped me meet
no I know it comes to me says that guy
doesn't know what he's doing and 24
hours I think he'd been with me he says
I got to take everything you've done for
the last nine months and throw it in the
trash can so I've raised money have
investors and he goes and we're going to
use Erlang and we're going to build a
big global business that can handle
everything you want to do and but I got
through everything away and that was how
I got introduced early and it was really
scary and I'll never forget this I'm on
the you know I don't play a lot of golf
I played well I haven't played golf in
probably years I was in a place i have
athlete's connections are professional
athlete connections and teams and
leagues and that's what I do and I was
there and I it was 110 degrees i'm gonna
go of course they have no one this year
and I'm like you know hold on a second I
had this other guy who's my friend who I
trust and he is not the skill of knowing
and he says look you know you guys pick
you gotta make a call he goes but you're
betting the company on this and it it
was a really interesting thing because I
had a couple of seconds really because
Noah had brought a team over from where
he's
me from for them newer lang they were
going to do it and I did felt right he
said he made it very very impressive
pitch for the fact that Erlang can do
this and here we are so today we have
approximately 3000 professional athletes
on our platform we have some very
high-profile athletes in our platform
around the world soccer football
baseball track auto racing Olympians
really really amazing international
people in the platform words so for me
as a non technical person as a CEO who
is very good at raising money and
getting the business side of things put
together and in really wanting it to
work I don't have the spinning wheel of
death you know that for me is really
what happened with us and we're in a
really good place so I'll turn it over
to know at this point sure so I'll kind
of
how about now good okay so so one of the
things that's kind of fun about when
people I've been people talk about
software languages is I've been doing
this now for a while so probably writing
software for close to 15 years and it's
kind of fun because people talk about
like academically something that works
or in my company in a eight thousand
persons startup or eight thousand person
company in this one part of the company
I did this one thing like we're this
this story that i'm about to tell is
actually we bet the whole company on our
leg in san francisco so i don't know how
many people did that but but we did and
we're live so here's the story using
Erlang at a San Francisco startup from
day one so as Brian mentioned we had an
unsuccessful prototype and the fun part
for me and maybe I'm a little you know I
like to stir things up with people a
little bit as I was told by someone
you're not going to use your lang the
reason why people use are lying is all
developers want to use exotic languages
like that that's why you want to use are
lying so you're not going to do that and
the existing developers before I even
started said now now you don't don't use
our like that's kind of like how I
started and once we got past all that
the the next part was how do we actually
do this and what was interesting is that
we had there was just me and and these
three new developers and and so what we
started out was that let's do the
backend Erlang because we know Erling
scales and let's do the mobile and
c-sharp which was we had a really good c
sharp guy then xamarin was also a very
risky choice at the time LSU android and
iOS xamarin and then we'll do the will
do the front end and back bone so
they'll just hit we'll just hit single
page app and we'll talk to basically
rest api is one of the things that
actually happened really you know early
and this is not going to be a not going
to be a Erlang's awesome talk this is
going to be like a real talk and i like
our line but it's going to be like a
real story
so we use my sequel because AWS didn't
actually support postgres at the time
and postgres in Erlang i think have a
very good story but my sequel and are
lying is very bad and the.net developer
just said no no like any he just deleted
all the he basically he still does this
day he doesn't admit it but he actually
wrote a parallel system that had a
sequel server running and then I the
reason I know is that that we were
getting trace backs one day and dev and
it was like net traipse traceback sounds
likely a second what's going on here and
then though he was he knew that this was
a failed option and he had he actually
rewritten it and you know he made the
very clear decision that like we're not
going to make it we my sequel in Erlang
is not going to work so we kept the feed
and a lot of the search engine and are
laying but the dotnet guy who's a high
performer just said I don't think so
three months in we I think we did a
heroic job we built an iOS app a
back-end and sea shore up in Erlang we
had this lightweight fantasy app so is
okay I probably still have my job Bryan
price will trust me and we both this
core deployment system as well that's a
lot what I was writing was like systems
automation scripts and then about 9
months in then the next thing was ok now
I gotta build my social network so the
feed and data collection has been mostly
in or laying and in that the story
behind react and rest api is that talk
to to Jason and exchange between other
other systems it really has worked very
well for us and at the same time in this
nine months process we start to get
really big athletes using score like I
mean really big athletes so about a year
in one of the things that I started to
work on it's like okay now I gotta shift
hats I've tried to write code in every
single language we have like about eight
or nine since I
in here some CTOs I got to write every
language so I wrote our for a while and
I wrote this machine learning system
that predicted which athletes we could
pick and as you can see this is kind of
this is like the fancy our stuff is that
that we this is the actual page views
right here so we have exponential growth
and then this is what I predicted that
what that would happen based on our
machine learning algorithms and there's
like yes we have an exponential growth
we're going to win so that was really
they're really exciting about a year ago
that that we have that and then about a
year and a half in we we got a android
released app release we started to get
really huge international growth so one
of the things that we did at score that
that was what was a an interesting move
from the business perspective is that we
started to get UFC athletes and I don't
know how many people aren't know about
mixed martial arts but mixed martial
arts are really interesting if you're a
programmer because it's a lot like
writing code we're like thousands of
years ago there was judo jujitsu and
they're like years and years and I mean
it's like a lot like how program the
programming language developed and then
they came up with in the I think it was
the 90s this contest is said okay let's
just see what what style is the best and
and then the UFC is really an outcome of
people deciding which fighting style is
the best and so it's kind of funny that
it's really similar to feel like you
know the ecosystem of San Francisco
startups and if you're into the UFC
Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of the
specialties inside that's a big deal and
Brazil has been a huge traffic source
for us internationally so where you're
in your year and a half in and we're
getting massive international growth
we've released android app and so so now
we still have this exponential growth
which is really exciting we actually
plan on reaching a billion people on
earth we think we can own the sports
vertical inside of social networks and
we have some of the biggest athletes and
sports during every day
I'm a little less in the know on this
but I know David Luiz who was on a
Brazilian national team and the world
cup he's he's on skouries got 40 million
followers we have rob king Gronkowski
who is a really big deal in the NFL Jon
Jones is the number one pound-for-pound
fighter he's a light heavyweight got on
the UFC I don't know Bryan fry knows
like Dale you know there's a lot of
people I don't want to say all the names
there's a lot of people who are in the
air the queue right now and then and we
also have three full-time Erling
developers and a couple part time I
still I try to write our lying all the
time I've written some fun stuff in her
laying and so now I'm now I'm going to
kind of talk a little bit about our
ecosystem so that was like the story of
like where we where we got to today so
as I was meant to be for I've actually
written language I've written everything
and everyone of these languages Sepher
Swift haven't done that yet but Erlang C
sharp Python Ruby our JavaScript sequel
every one of those has actually been
something we had to use so i think that
might be an interesting story for
adoption at a company is that is like if
you are humble and you say that erlang
has to be a polyglot solution like
there's certain things that's really
good at like high availability and
talking to Jason based api's like or you
know protocol buffers like something
like but not doing things that other
languages do better like talking to
relational databases I mean it might be
that might be a story i don't know i
mean people here made may know more than
I I do this is just two years of
real-world experience but these are
these are kind of some of the things
that we did and and so here's here's
actually what I learned at from a
manager is that and I think I haven't
heard this a lot from Erlang is that
that is it I learned that if you're a
new developer it can be very difficult
because the tooling is pretty bad for
laying in comparison to other languages
if you look at Microsoft know they're
there a giant company but if you look at
let's say the object relational mapping
visual studio and sequel server and you
look at the support compared to
it's not even close so I think you have
to tell something you have to have a
story for that if you're going to adopt
you're lying at a company and it you
know we're about making money we're not
about adopting or lying so you know that
that's part of the story to the other
one I think that's interesting is that
I've heard this a lot of it like you
know I which is an interesting argument
is like functional programming is like
so exotic and I i actually don't agree
at all I think it's I can't think of a
more logical way to write software then
you write this function it takes
arguments and it passes back values I
mean that seems in inside of it it
doesn't do weird that's weird stuff
there's no like changes of state I mean
I thought that's very logical to me I
don't think that's hard to explain to
people and the whole like the reason why
people don't adopt or lang is its
functional programming I just say
 I i think there's but that's
not the reason in my opinion just my
opinion and so and that hasn't been my
my my opinion with with people that have
adopted or laying in our company but one
of the things I did notice was that
there are people that just wouldn't pick
up her line and they just and I and I
think that there should be a much more
aggressive onboarding process if you if
you are like I mean I don't know how
many other startups actually day darling
day one there's probably some other than
us like I don't know three or four other
but you have to be very aggressive about
this very aggressive because the tooling
is not not the same and if you don't
have a story for that people people are
not going to adopt Erlang so this is
kind of my philosophy is that the Navy
SEAL philosophy is that you can't leave
bodies behind so you want orlane to come
to your company you cannot accept
there's a dead body that's left in in a
field of combat you just can't do that
so you don't accept the fact that
someone doesn't pick up our lang like if
you're a developer it's very easy to say
oh well you're just not as smart as me
or you know it's functional programming
you don't get it you know that that I
think is really really bad and I think
it's going to stop adoption
of a language like you're lying other
thing i think that i've really noticed
is that there isn't this soup to nuts
success story for like actually real
world production deployment and Erlang
so you know I there's lots of books like
learn you know like some of the some of
the books online about learning a little
or laying or you look at Cowboys
documentation about running rest service
but then there's like okay so you're in
a company and you're going to get fired
in a month because you work at Netflix
if you don't do something and push it to
production so how do you do that where's
the chef's recipe it could so it doesn't
matter that it that it's not an erlang
but where's the chef's recipe that
pushes it to production like the whole
deal the whole like every single aspect
of you right you come in and you run a
rest service that returns back Jason
it's you know here's the status codes
and then you have a recipe that deploys
it to AWS and or here's how you deploy
it to docker or here's how to deploy it
to you know as you're like that that I
mean maybe someone else knows this but
where this exists I don't know where it
exists we had to figure this out
ourselves and then the other thing too
is that really the people that are going
to learn are lame there's not a lot of
people at no we're laying in San
Francisco are probably be rails
developers or no developers or junior
developers and so if your solution is a
lot harder than what they're currently
using they may just say no thanks and
then they may not you may not adopted it
at they may not it at your company so
and this is one of the things that I
want to just not talk about problems i
want to give some solutions that this
isn't completely finished because be
there's some stuff and then i want to
clean up but we wrote our own continuous
deployment process like me and kyle some
other people and we're open sourcing it
so we'll show how we do how our chef
recipes work we have some automation
code with bodo that talks to ops works
and we're going to open source all this
because i don't want to just make a
bunch of complaints and then have no
solution so I just have to clean it up
because it would be irresponsible for me
to release stuff that has
things in it that need to get cleaned up
but we're gonna we're going to actually
give an example of how that would work
so here's a little bit of the example
that that I had to kind of figure out
myself as that what happens is that
github is listening basically Jenkins is
listening to github and in the dev
branch or the staging branch of the
production branch it notified Jenkins
that something's changed Jenkins builds
the job and again I I maybe this
documentation exists somewhere but I had
to figure this out myself it notifies
Jenkins to build the job what happens is
that two things occur during the job
build one is that Amazon s3 pushes the
tar file to I'm sorry Jenkins pushes the
file to Amazon s3 and and that's
actually the release for that
environment and then we I don't know how
many people are familiar with opsworks
which is a layer on top of AWS that's
chef essentially so chef then the the
life cycles of chef and this is the
deploy lifecycle is called V an API call
by Jenkins and then the recipes run the
recipe what it does is it goes into s3
and it pulls down this tar file and then
it runs the chef's recipe then then runs
the release process and so this is kind
of what we figured out there's some
really fancy things that I would love I
know there's there's people have been
programming or length way longer than
I've only five years or so that probably
know how to do like automatic continuous
deployment hot deploys and like all
kinds of really fancy stuff but this is
how we did it and and and the thing I'm
an open source will show show actually
how it works let's see here so the this
is something that I've you know said a
lot a lot to to to people is that with
our learnt Erlang adoption is that being
right or increasing up adaptation you
can't do both so a lot of really smart
people I work with this way I say to him
they'll be like oh this guy he doesn't
understand
and blah blah blah and I always say like
well do you want to be right or do you
want the best solution because you're
not going to get both you can't be
technically right and get the best
solution they're not possible they're
like they're actually directly in
conflict and so here's I think the deal
the real honest truth is relaying is not
the best solution for everything and I
think it really for adoption to spread
through san francisco and the world I
think the this is be honest that there's
other languages are way better I mean if
you're if I'd say a relational database
story I think you and I'm I could be
totally wrong but but i don't think so i
don't think that relational databases in
our lying are what it's good at and I
the you know the other thing too is it
there's been a and I don't know I
haven't followed a lot of this but
there's this kind of like academic
argument the purity of functional
languages or concurrency you know like
there that's why you should use their
language people don't people don't care
no one cares no one that makes money
cares no one that has to talk to an
investor every day and say why aren't
you making money cares about this no one
but but if you can make money use your
leg that's what people care about so I
think that's another argument that I've
heard that would be great to kind of
take more seriously and also the the
onboarding process from other language
isn't taken seriously enough I this is
another one that I've just kind of
observed it's like oh well if you're so
smart and you you know you went to
Stanford you got a computer science
degree you should just understand how
this works or you know or whatever the
answer whatever your argument is is that
i don't think that actually is the right
answer i think you have to go Navy SEAL
style where you say if you're getting
people to learn or lang you have to say
I'm not going to let them fail there
come there from some other language and
there's no way they're going to fail
learning or length I'll do whatever it
takes I'll sit next to them 12 hours a
day I'll follow them home to their house
oh like I will make sure they aren't
learner length and that's the way better
way of thinking of like well they'll
come to me and then we'll talk to me
about you know they should ask me
questions about harlot howling
works like know that that's how you will
never get adoption there's some real
problems with with some of the tool
chains or yeah but there's some things
that are lying is awesome at but you you
have to you have to be really aggressive
about that the other one too i think is
that and hopefully i hope i helped solve
this because i'm complaining about it is
that the documentation about deploying
to production it just really isn't there
and i think it is a very huge problem
and and i would love there's people
there way better than this than i am and
i would love to see like a hot dapoli
documentation at all like a github
example of like how that works and all
kinds of really fancy or lang stuff like
i don't know where it is I mean it's
possible it exists I just don't know
where it is and so that's kind of the
that's my you know really honest
feedback of two years of Erlang you can
see we you know I we're putting our
money where our mouth is we we bet the
farm on our laying and we're doing very
well we have but it was it was it was
not like a it's not a slam dunk her
laying is not a slam dunk and i think i
think that's that's the thing with any
language you can't just say oh it's it's
beautiful like everything will be
perfect no it's not gonna be perfect
does it solve some problems that are
that are really hard and it's really
good yes and i think i think its but but
you have to earn it you have to kind of
earn the things that erlang is really
good at so you know i'm open for
questions yep
I don't know if we're at that level of
engineering yet to be to be honest I I
know that we've I know kyle has done to
himself with react and in he and he's
done some things on that level but I
don't know if we've we rapped out we're
about 30 people i don't know if we have
a skill yet i mean i think i would like
to know what I i would like to be at the
level where i would be good enough to
make modifications or lying i don't
think we're there yet
um I think I think it's just when you
it's one it's it's kind of funny like I
I learned Python in two thousand and it
was kind of a fun thing like probably
how a lot of people at this conference
are there like or lang is awesome and
you know it's kind of it's cool and with
them then there's like this other part
which is like okay there's people that
have millions of dollars invested in
your company and can you make it work
and and I the part that's a stumbling
block i think is the tool chain and i
think it's it's less of like the ER
llings bad or earnings good or it's that
it's just the it's now in the spotlight
it's going to take a while for
everything to come up to the same level
of tooling that you know C sharp as that
node has that python has that ruby has
and I think it's the lack of like
instrumentation you know like where like
New Relic for example works with Python
or Ruby and these you know note in
c-sharp but doesn't work with are laying
it I think this once you get that stuff
solved where it's it's it's like a
no-brainer to all the all the things
that you normally do work really well
with our life and I think it's happening
but I think that's a little bit of it
that's going to be a stumbling block for
people yep
yes yes
it's been really good we use protocol
buffers everywhere and probably we have
we've really had no problems with it I
actually maybe Kyla is even more
experienced than I know I know from a
superficial level I mean what do you
think well the biggest place for you is
talking to react and physically built
into their reactor line client
yeah so so yeah we've actually been yeah
I mean I did the problem with protocol
buffers you know from you know it's a
trade-off like protocol buffers a cool
thing is that you get this really speed
right of interacting with API but then
it's harder to debug that's not that's
nothing to do with our line now like
like but well there's a couple things
that's a good question i have put this
in there one is that I think you can get
better people at your company if you
take a riskier bet I mean there's so
many people there's so many startups in
San Francisco and if you are using or
laying or I don't know go or Haskell I
think you're going to attract you're
gonna self-selecting crew of people and
I think that's been really helpful to us
so I should have actually put that in
there but I think that's actually a huge
part of the story is if you're using
rails I mean it's kind of like you know
I don't know I don't know if people
you're going to get the same caliber
developer as you get our leg developer
back in two thousand if you're using
Python I think you're it's it's it's a
trick to get the best of a print your
company so I I think I think I think
that's maybe maybe one of the biggest
things
I want to see that talk but I didn't
have a chance
he said that when you go out there to
result to
yeah I think I know I think it's back
it's a size in the other question is
that that I think a lot of developers
are very interested that are good like
they're like oh wow what sort of laying
and that's very interesting and and I
think but that was kind of what I was
getting at is that if you then destroy
that like you we haven't had one hundred
percent success rate with adopting
people to are lying so it could be the
thing that attracts you tracks these
develop these really good developers but
then do they actually use it so I think
you absolutely can use it as a
recruiting tool to your company but if
if you think that it's going to happen
by itself and it's going to be all like
you know sunshine and butterflies you're
in for a rude awakening you have to be
very aggressive about making sure they
succeed so but i think it's a you know
on the other hand there are people that
are just aggressively in stirling by
principal like it's like why would you
use this thing it's you know it's so
exotic and the problem it solves is you
know it's true it can it's better at
than anyone else but like it doesn't
come up that often so for us though what
we're doing is we want to actually reach
a billion people on earth well we
actually think we can do this and I
remember a few years ago I was in New
Zealand and I met a guy at Facebook
before it was a big deal and he said
we're gonna reach a billion people on
earth and I thought you're crazy like
well we're crazy like we think we can do
this so we're picking the right language
that just handles us at so i think
that's that's a pretty good answer is
that like I don't know you want to be a
billionaire or or do you just want to
like make a salary like we're picking a
language that can do some exotic you
know things that that mean look at some
of these other companies like machines
own is blowing it up Wright what's up
you know hopefully scores the number
three billion dollar company so I think
that's the answer
the major capitals what would you say is
the biggest problem that you solved in
your process you know I think it's so
easy to do the wrong thing and the said
uh and I have to I have to to take this
like it I have to be really careful
because i don't want to be an asshole to
two people that are on my team what I
also want to be really rigid and say we
have to have very high uptime and and
there's best practices and they're not
optional and so once you're at the level
we're at now where there's all these
famous people are using our platform you
have to say it's not optional you have
to do best practices and that would be a
little bit of my critique is that the
doing the right thing is a little harder
than it should be and in it you know if
you're using other languages there's
enough stuff where it's like okay I know
I should do the right thing I should you
know I should do these things to do the
deployment and here's all the different
processes but you know laying it's a
little too easy to do the wrong thing
and so we fixed it we have chef we
automate it you saw the diagram but
because we invented this I mean we
literally just I mean I did a lot of
this code myself and I'm the CTO Kyle
helped a lot with it I mean we just
don't know where else that exists I
think that I mean maybe maybe this the
code we release will help maybe other
people have some ideas but I think
that's the thing is like you you want to
make it so easy to do the right thing
that it's it's it the wrong thing is not
even an option because once you do the
wrong thing and you like you have a
developer that's in production he's like
how about now how about now like you're
you're down a very very dark dark dark
road and it's not good
is in Python actually so I stayed a long
I've books for a Riley on Python I mean
I like Python it's a good language for
certain things like I mean people people
will disagree with me on this but but I
don't think you should write big systems
of Python and the I just talked to
somebody uber that told me about 500
Python developers I mean is there 40
billion dollar company they can afford
it but I six Wow 500 Python developers
really and I think the it's it's kind of
I would say with Python with writing
certain things it's really easy to do
the right thing can you write like an
incredible Python Koecher but is it easy
to do the wrong is it easy to make the
spinning wheel of death and Python yeah
it's real easy no you can see ya yeah
okay well this is good like I was I'm
probably boring now let's let's have
Brian fun once you talk about score
well thanks for inviting me back up on
stage Stewart they let the non-technical
guy back up so score what is it say it
say the highest level today and a prize
solution for sports I started I had the
idea a few years ago that the world
needed a sports specific social network
social media is Pierre part of our lives
and this general sock nets are out there
the noisy and cluttered and Facebook's
filter or throttling the content and
everyone's thrall so it's not the cute
true pure thing so I'm like okay this is
no brainer oh and by the way fit LeBron
James who has 20 more 24 million fans on
Facebook makes 0 facebook makes lots of
money it's like this is easy let's just
create an economic model that makes
sense for everybody else that's part of
the content creation and of course right
so that was the idea behind it and took
got a lot traction and so what we are is
where a social network for sports but
but more but even above that we're sort
of verticals we've got a we've built a
core social network but then on the
fringe we also have tools that make them
smarter and better and data and
analytics and how do you like what are
you really worth and if you're really a
high profile professional athlete or a
pert and entertainer or a fan for
instance like what's your value so we
built all that into this ecosystem and
then we from the business side of things
we go out we talk to the world of sports
and we say you're getting ripped off at
Facebook they're just picking your
pockets there now they're filtering your
content most people don't even know that
and why are there and they go I don't
know I am there and I'm just like okay
welcome to our platform so that's what
we are 48 that social network that is
completely dedicated to the sports fan
and sports business and teams and
leagues and athletes fans and it makes a
lot of sense because you think back in
the broadcast world ESPN was founded
right under the nose of CBS NBC ABC they
all had sports content every Saturday
you could watch ABC waddled sports for
an hour
in the Harlem globe Harlem Globetrotters
once a year and that was your sports
content needs pins like out there's more
more thirst out there than that so
that's where we are in that mole
spectrum the number one sports network
in social media around the world billion
billion dollar couple billion users any
sport is everywhere cricket soccer and
I'm World Cup rugby Olympics it's the
global language and so we picked a good
vertical be in so not on our network yet
potential yep we did 20 million 20
million fans in February as Noah mention
I think we we start we kick the we kick
the platform live really about 11 months
ago so we're not even a our year
anniversary yet in terms of the social
network so but we're growing very very
rapidly we have if you look at the
combined social graph of all the fans
and our screaming of this of the the
athletes that are part of our network
and they which are the most active we
have over 125 million cumulative social
graph that we're reaching so point there
is that there's a lot of upside in our
business in our model as particularly as
we start to get leagues teams major
global events that are using our
platform is their primary social network
there's this intersection what's really
interesting about it is that the
broadcast world which is where
traditional sports is they feel like
they have to cover sports and we're
partnering with sports and sports
constituents the difference is partly
money but also partly like really at the
DNA of in the core of who you are the
editorial world the broadcast world of
sports is all about you know if someone
gets in trouble or does something stupid
they got to cover it they can't partner
with them it's conflict of interest we
on the other hand we don't cover it
we're partnering with them they're
creating content because we have the
tools that we've given them to be able
to do that off the field on the field so
therefore we're in a partnership with
them which it really creates a different
relationship
and I would argue that potentially
long-term it's a better and more robust
and more profitable relationship than
the people that cover them from an
editorial standpoint so we'll see where
it all plays out but we definitely L
build our way into the ecosystem sports
and in position ourselves to be a part
of the the ecosystem and you know should
be should be very successful at it yeah
yeah it's a good question and that was
kind of my kind of being real up to
people about in San Francisco because i
think our legs should be way bigger than
it is in San Francisco is that let's
just be honest about what's good at
what's not if you're going to write a
web service that that talks to an API
and Jason I have no idea why you use
Python a ruby I mean the performance if
you look at Cowboys I don't know
somebody probably notice that number by
them is it is it like 10,000 requests a
second or 12,000 request a second
something like that will hire 15,000
request a second you look any run a
rails app that talks to an adjacent API
it's like a hundred you know pythons
like a hundred I mean like really I mean
that that alone is like I mean come on
so that that's the part I think that
that it's like why in San Francisco are
you using Python or Ruby to talk I mean
it's not harder I mean it's really like
the the coding is very similar I mean
it'sit's maybe less code so we're using
Erlang for the feed system so the thing
that talks that talks to react and and
does you know all of the content that
comes comes back the user system is all
in a relational database and there's API
is that we talk to and then obviously
mobile you can't write or laying in
mobile so
no no it was just just straight API now
that this is all like all like
deserialising serializing data and
talking api's Erlang is very good in
real-time like web sockets and the other
thing also kind of related to your
question is that you know another thing
that I haven't necessarily heard yet is
that that a lot of people are talking
about note or Python or Ruby and I've
done projects and all those that have
event loops I mean that to me is just a
tragedy it's a real tragedy that people
are writing event loops in Python Ruby
or node because what happens is if
you're doing a software-as-a-service
which is the rage now that venture
capitals are benched investing in and
you're using Python Ruby or node what's
going to happen is that core is going to
get hot and I know Guido's here and I
know Guido and it's like the guild does
magical things that's great but if
you're writing the software as a service
application it's going to hit one core
and now you're gonna have to figure out
how to process a request that go to the
other course and then you're going to
pickle you know deserialize data and
then do multiprocessing and all this
stuff and every language has got their
other way of doing it or you'll just use
erlanger use rapid mq to do all that but
but why would you do that like why would
you do all that stuff when you could
just accept data and then it spins
spills out to all the cores on your
machine all the machines your network so
that's another thing that like every
software as a service that collects a
fire hose of data why are you using Ruby
or Python or node like why it's just
just horrible it is so horrible like
please spread the word is so bad like
like so bad
yeah and a Guido is here we should ask
him in like five minutes why why would
anybody use that yeah I hope he just
says like I don't know like yes you
shouldn't use that python is better for
crunching data or something but like I
you know so that's my other advice but
in that that's what when we collect data
and process things like her leg is very
good it's very good at that business our
business is released early and
communications and what we see the
business phone yeah yeah that's the
other thing too is with kind of where
we're at from a social network to is
that I mean or laying is so good at high
availability and like scalability if you
mean John is like is awesome because if
you look at what they did you know I
talked to the CTO yesterday it's like
you see all these you know millions of
users simultaneously using something
like if he and i think i was talking to
you and you said her legs good at making
billionaires like yeah if you want to if
you want to be a billionaire any you
know that's a fun problem to solve like
go to that i go to the good like that's
what our lang is really good at is you
want to build a company that could make
billionaires that that's why use you're
lying all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
