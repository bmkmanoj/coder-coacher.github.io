so the plan for this talk is I want to
tell a very short story I was originally
planning on doing the whole what is new
in galaxy 1.5 but you can go and read
the changelog and everything's there so
I had to change of plans and I want to
tell a short story about something new
that we discovered we've alex around at
five and it has a lot of potential so
we're really excited about it so it's
the feature that noah knew okay so the
end result of this feature we can
actually see today so if you get alex
31.5 your machines and you're running
airline 20 if you have something for
example like access fetch if you call a
function like access patch passing
school bar and you pass it invalid
arguments you get and reduce this you
get this very beautiful and longer
message now so in previous a little
burst so what is happening here we are
calling a function and we are passing
arguments that do not match any of the
clauses that function that function this
that's one she say
look I don't accept those arguments and
before the clear one of five everything
that I highlighted here would not show
right everything it would say would be
at the top it would say no function
Clause matching in access hatch and then
it would have a stack trace and if you
kind of wanted to find out why that did
not work you had to pick the arguments
out of a stack trace in the last line
and that was a little bit awkward so now
we can see that we get all this great
amount of information we say exactly you
know which arguments are actually trying
to pass that function and if you are on
IX we show that we've seen text
highlighting and then we also show what
are the causes what is the actual
implementation of that function and we
say exactly why that particular Clause
did not match so for example the first
argument is the Adam fool but the first
Clause is expecting a struct that's not
going to match
we show here in grad okay it's exactly
here what went wrong and then we say oh
the next Clause we expecting the first
argument to be a map but we are pasión
Adam that's not going to work so we show
really detailed information about what
is going what went wrong why none of
those quads match and how you can move
forward from there so this is much
better and what is really interesting
about this is that if you had so Alex
product five was really like this month
like couple weeks ago right so if you
ask us at the beginning of the year when
you started preparing the work for Alex
you're not five like hey can we have
this feature we would have said would
have said no I'd be like well we are not
quite sure how to implement it it may
require changes to airline itself you
know or may require a lot of code this
is actually quite complex to do it but
at some point we promoted this in one
leg at some point it became obvious how
to implement this feature and and that's
because of the feature that no one knew
all right so what is this feature okay
so in order to understand how this works
we need to talk a little bit about the
Alex your compiler how electri actually
works internally okay
so one of the first thing that elixir
does oh you have your mix project you
have your Alex your project and then
every time I call something like mix
compiled to compile code one of the
things that it does is that it's going
to get the first files in your project
and it's going to convert that to Alex
here ASP and that's a process that we
can even do in the shell right so we can
say something like code to do and we
pass one plus two and that result that
we got returned there that's the Ali
curiosity that's the the code
represented in Alex your data structures
okay so it's the Alex your abstract
syntax tree ast so-called represented
data structure so that's the first
process that we do when we are compiling
code so you can think that the Electra
compiler goes kind of like this I'm
going to write some pseudocode here so
first I have the file right and then we
want to read the file and after we read
the file we get a string
right with the contents of the file the
contents of your elector source code
then the next thing we do is that we
actually convert this string this text
we got from the file we converted to
Alex here ast which is this process we
kind of just saw right now and then what
we do is that we expand all of the
macros in galaxy s P so we go for the SD
and we kind of go expanding all the
macros everything we can expand and then
that returns to electricity but without
macros evolve called expansion that we
could possibly do already done and then
we get these ast so we get this finally
curiosity and we convert that to Erlang
gasping okay and and then after we
convert that to the earning SD we see
this information to the airline compiler
so we are leveraging the whole
infrastructure that comes with airline
for compiling stuff we just say hey now
compile everything and what is the end
result of this process right the end
result of this process are being files
okay so this is not an episode of code
if I try to execute it I'm going to say
there is no such function but that's
kind of the process and at the end of
the process the output it's a bin file
that we write to disk it's a bin file
containing all the information that the
virtual machine needs to run that code
so every time we call a function okay in
in our application so for example string
so every time it cost of like strained
out case foo in order for this coach is
acute we need to have the bin file the
bytecode for the string module somewhere
and there is actually a module in Erlang
that tells this for us there's a module
called code and we can say code which
and space these training modules and
this is going to return the location of
the bean file the file with everything
that we need about the string module
where it is in the file system this case
where it is on my machine okay so this
is need so we can access the bean file
and okay so now we notice that there's
this bean file and it exists and what is
a bean file what is actually inside of
it how it how does it work
a being file it's made of a bunch of
chunks it's kind of like a key-value
thing where you have a key and evaluate
the bunch of binary let's let's dig a
little bit deeper right so we have this
what I'm going to do so in this works
for every module right so for example we
have a tipple module which is a smaller
module then they string one and we can
sign the location for the temple beam
file I want to store that somewhere
because we're going to need it a couple
times right so now I have this type of
path variable that has the location of
the turbo-bean file and now I want to
see what is actually in this bin file so
Airlines also ships with a module called
bin Lib which is a bunch of functions to
work with being files and they have this
function called all chunks that expect
the path to a bin file and it's going to
return all the chunks so a bin file is
made of chunks and oceans are like key
values right so let's invoke that and
this is what we get right so when we get
all the chunks of a bin file we see that
it returns a tuple saying ok the name of
the module that is actually there and it
returns a list of tuples where the first
element here is always that with 4
character this is this is the key each
chunk is identified with four characters
ok and it has a blob of binary which is
whatever you want it to be a lot of
these things they are internal you
should not those are things that the
brutal machine needs to load code make
everything work we should not expect it
to be a certain format you should not
rely on it in any way a lot of those so
they are completely internal so they are
actually exposed to developers and you
can actually add whatever shows you want
to this right if you're free to add your
own textures like a key value store can
add whatever you want as long as you
don't override something that it's all
right there so for example Alex here
uses it to store documentation can you
see this trend here exd see so this is
where Alex restores documentation when
we compile your files so every time I
say something like h2o to access the
documentation of a module what we
actually do is that we find the B file
we we get that document
check out of there and then we find the
documentation for the module or for a
given function in that module that
access the documentation for right so
there is a lot of potential in those
being files right it's something else
that we also have in the bin file is
that in the bin file we also restore the
air link aft remember when I was talking
about the compilation process right and
I said well we have the file and then we
get Delic 3 ft and at some point we get
the airline gas da we compile this
airline guess D it's actually starting
the beam file as well we can actually
fetch it so we start off getting out
chunks let's say I want to get the
abstract code choke and what we see here
okay all this big data structure that we
got here is our code represented in the
air link ASTM D an abstract varmint okay
so for example you can see that the type
of module here it has a function named
chillest that expects one argument okay
and this function has one clause that
expects a variable and this function is
on line one four seven one of the
features that actually came with valid
3.5 that we can actually do this you can
say I want to open the tube the chillest
function in the topper module and then
if you're ready from is it actually
opens exactly there for you so we can
see here so we can see the
implementation of that function right
it's well it's a it's a function called
to leave indeed expects one argument
right and this and all it does delegate
to the underlying align capitalist
function right so all that is what we
saw here boom what we saw this
representing airline code okay so at
this point you may be wondering right so
cool that we have the airline gas p but
why are we storing their language gee
they're right and that's because a bunch
of this was a explicit design decision
we chose from the beginning to use their
link compiler so we can leverage
everything that airline has already
built in terms of compiler optimizations
and all this kind of stuff it's what the
design series was explicit choice right
we want it to be as
medically close as possible to airline
and the other reason we did that is that
a bunch of tools that we use every day
they actually require this air link
chunk the airline abstract syntax to be
available so for example dialyzer it
requires the air link abstract form to
be available so if ever you dialyzer in
your project it's actually doing this
kind of process that I just said about
where you need to find a big file and
then you open up the big file you get
some particular chunk and you get the
air link ASP out of that chunk cover if
you get test coverage in your project is
doing a similar process it gets the
original source code and then it
modifies it somehow and compiles it
again so this is so this is interesting
but this also implies that we lose
information so I was talking about cover
if you run coverages in your project you
know that sometimes the coverage is off
right that's because every time we
translate from Alexia to air link there
is some loss of information in that
process we can even see it here at you
can see that the variable here it's not
called topo in our source code is called
tuple but here it is a version variables
called tuple at one because if you
rebind we need to version the variables
so there's always some laws of
information and that makes so it's good
to have the earliest a because it means
we can use the tool that exists today
but sometimes those tools they are not
optimal right like over it's not
sometimes it's a little bit off so we
start to ask so we start to think the
following well it's awesome that we can
use everything that airline has to offer
us
but what if we want to have better
coverage tools right for those tools to
work efficiently we need to have
actually the Alex here ASP in there we
want to have the original elector code
right we don't want to have the airline
code so we thought well what if we then
we just store the Alex RESP and that's
and when we thought about doing that we
were really thinking about the futures
like well maybe in the future we want to
leverage these ideas so that
start let's get prepared now so if we
never want to do it we'll be ready
right so it was really picking about the
future so what if we start the
electricity and then we started to
investigate and then we realize that
those ASD chunks the the metadata about
your code it's actually 50% of the beam
file right so if we start Alex here ASD
and they're lying SD that's going to
actually cause a big impact on the size
of the beam files and there are some
some colors problematic for example I
called string down case right every time
it constrained our case we have part of
the Unicode database embedded in this
training module that knows how to for
example handle my name right so and this
is a large so that V file can probably
get close to 1 megabyte and things like
that
and there are places where people are
using a lecture like embedded devices
where actually this kind of space
matters ok so we said well so apparently
we cannot just if we add the Alex VST
and we also keep darling SD that's going
to be an issue right because the bin
size is going to grow and on the other
hand we cannot simply you know remove
the Aer Lingus T because a bunch of
tools like dialyzer and covert they
require this information that's what we
realize that actually there's something
wrong about this process because why are
the tools that we use like like I'm
saying the debugger cover dialyzer
why are those tools actually expecting
the airline ASD to be there you should
not expect the Erlang FC to be there
what it needs to do is like well I don't
actually care what is in the bin file
but as long as we can spit something out
as long as that bin file can spit the
airline code for me I'm fine I don't
need their lingo to be there but I need
the bin file to be able to give it to me
right so we need a new layer of
abstraction right like abstractions
they're like Oreos the more layers you
have the better it gets right so
so what we did is that we actually sent
a poor request to the OTP team and
disparate pass was accepted and and we
can actually now have an idea of this
bird pesto so we are now introducing a
new chunk remember that the bean file it
has a bunch of chance okay we proposed a
new chunk a check remember they have the
chancellor all identified by four
letters so this is the VB GI chunk which
implies the big bug info chunk and in
this chunk we don't have a luxurious tea
we don't have airline gas D we have
metadata only right so this chunk is a
bunch of metadata should not rely on its
contents but from the metadata you can
ask and say hey can you actually give me
airline code can you actually give me a
lecture code and then the matter the
data may say yes or no to that question
so that's what we did we send this per
request and it was accepted by the OTP
team and it's there in airline 20 so now
we're starting to put the pieces
together right because now when you're
using Alec 0.5 and earning 20 and that's
why some of those features that we have
in electronic five they only work with
our length 20 there's actually because
of this because now we have galaxy st
and when you're running on air length 20
we are actually storing the alex EST in
the bin files but if I run here link 20
all the tools that we had before they
still work right cover still works
the dialyzers two words exactly because
air link is also asking now instead of
saying I want the I want to find their
link code it's now asking hey can you
give me the air link code and we say yes
of course we can
here's the air link code for you and
then all those tools they still work so
that's what we did right so this is the
feature that no any we simply said ok
let's have this small a distraction
where we can say where the tools now as
ke can actually give me electric code
can actually give Maryland code and and
that's there and now we can store the
Alex furious T in in the bin files and
electricity is there so we did this
thinking about the future right like
this is going to be great to have in the
future
right I think this was merged at some
point maybe 26 April
so this was merge about three months ago
let's say three four and it was there we
had this feature and then sometime later
someone opened this issue okay someone
opened this issue where he was saying
how to debug quickly in Phoenix and Alex
here and this is a really a well-written
issue okay where he says well I'm
learning electric Phoenix and when
something goes wrong here's what I do I
go like imagine that I call it
dependency with the wrong arguments I go
I open up the dependency and then I need
to add like some IO inspect calls and
then it's record pod that dependency
they need to check the documentation and
I was reading it I was like alright I do
this too right
and then he was like and this is
horrible and I'm like oh it's horrible
alright we need to make it better right
and then here and then he goes to give
great suggestions of how we can improve
this process and we actually adopted all
the suggestions medic 0.5 but here at
part of the issue he has these
screenshot ok and this is the is the
roof no function Clause matching that I
started talking the beginning of the
talk right so here's what he got in
Phoenix it says no function clause
matching into word pump it doesn't say
what is the proper argument it expects
it doesn't say what it actually passed
and made it go wrong right this is a
actually really horrible her message
okay so I was like okay point taken we
need to improve this whole process all
together right and then and then when we
were thinking about how to improve this
thing the feature that no one knew that
we're not expecting anything from
consumers like wait we actually have the
elec seriously now which means that when
there is a known function clause
matching error we can actually get the
arguments that the user tried to call we
can get the source code we can try to
run each of those arguments against the
source code and how the user exactly
what went wrong we open up this issue to
discuss suggestions and this is the
thing that we came for this exactly kind
of ever so now it's a new function
called match and access hatch but as we
saw in the terminal
if you come here to the bottom we say
now well we're trying to call it sub
stand by the way here's the
documentation in case you want to go and
see it it was called with two arguments
you can click anything see the arguments
and we say exactly what are the claws
available what we try to call and what
failed and what did not fail okay so
when these so if you're running Phoenix
in electrolux five and airline 20 we are
going to get those reports right so this
is small features started to go to the
whole ecosystem right and that's exactly
how it works let's go back to the
beginning of the talk right let's Ida's
up okay so when we do access hatch fubar
and any other functional clause error
right we are going to say now I'm going
to show the arguments explicitly and
we're also going to show the functional
clauses that we try to call and every
time it fails right it gets something in
in red it's because we could not match
that particular place okay and the way
it works is that we have a new function
in a lecture called exception blame and
what it does is that so let's open the
source so what this function does is
that every time you're not going to call
it directly the tools like plug or
Phoenix during development
ix the test framework they are going to
call it for you because it can be
expensive this process but what we are
doing is that every time there is an
exception if you give it exception blame
blame is going to try to add extra
information to it's going to tell more
is going to try to add more things about
the exception and the only exception we
have right now is function calls ever
but we can see kind of here what it does
is the process that we saw during this
talk so you can see here that the first
thing it does that for example if you
have a function clause there in the
access module or in the string module or
the keyword module first we try to get
the bin file for that module and then we
say hey does this module have a debug
info chunk which is the chunk that we
added to DP if it has a debug info chunk
I actually want the Elector code from
this debug info chunk and then I get all
the definitions and then we go through
the process of checking what
right and what is wrong and this is just
one of the many features that we got
from the simple fact that we are
starring Alex seriously there so another
feature that we have in electronic files
that we have breakpoints in IX
so remember that the bug report said
well then I need to grow I need to
change the dependency I need to add iOS
packed calls and then I need to
recompile the code now I no longer need
to do that so for example if there's
something wrong with the URI the code
query function I can set a breakpoint
directly from IX right so now I set the
breakpoint and when I call this code
let's call it and then I'm going to pass
fubar
and then I'm going to call this function
passing a string I want to decode and
the initial map value it reaches the
breakpoint it's saying look I reach the
breakpoint in the URI decode query
function right and it says I am exactly
on this line right here where we have
the query and the map variables and I
can actually go and say okay I have so
what are the variables that I have a
sign right now we can access the
variables I have query
I have map so I can access them we can
actually type where am i and get
information about the code again if you
want to be your radios you call where am
i 10 and it's going to show more
information around the code right and
you can even do things like just type
open and Alex you're going to open up
the editor exactly where the breakpoint
is right now so you have all those
wonderful facilities to help debugging
the code and all of these works because
of that chunk right because now we have
deleterious T so now we can do a bunch
of crazy things and change how your code
was defined and there is one last thing
that happened just this week fifteens
like two or three days ago that happened
because of this child which is Alex very
script 0.30 it was released a couple
days ago and this this release is very
different from the previous unclear
script ones because now it can compile
Alex your code to JavaScript on the fly
so while it happens as that imagine that
are typing alex is Alex your code and
then an extra script code and then you
call something from the top of model
something from the training module
whatever you call smile extra code when
you do that galaxy script compiler is
going to find the it's going to get the
electricity from the beam file and
compile that JavaScript on the fly so
you can call all that exists on the
library you can call any of your
dependencies right and then it's going
to find everything that you're calling
and compile the JavaScript on the fly
exactly because it can actually get the
electricity now and transform that into
JavaScript right so this feature it has
a lot of potential because now that we
have galaxy AFT we can do we can stay
closer to the code that we actually
write and we can do more relevant
information more relevant debugging
right so if someone wants to actually I
have a better coverage too for Alex here
that understands all very clear
semantics okay it's actually possible
now so that's the feature that no new
that's what I wanted to share with you I
think it's a very exciting feature that
is going to allow a lot of interesting
developments with Alex here for the next
two three years even even long term
developments and I hope you enjoy it
thank you
thank you thank you so we have a good
ten minutes for questions to use a like
I'm inspired by this may be things you
want to ask that you never dare to ask
him but just like you know just very
minded it's a public wholly public arena
so we're going to screw around with a
mic and if you have anything to add just
like raise your hand and I run to you
and you can ask okay although I don't
have a mic right now I can also repeat
the question now there is a mic there is
a mic where's Mike hey hello thanks for
the talk you mentioned during the talk
that at when you critic elixir he
decided nigga that give it compiled to
land vs tree and other languages that
built in the air link VM like I think a
la vie decided to compile the Corps
instead so is it a decision that you
regret it or if you think that there was
a good decision and what was behind the
decision yeah so it's not a decision I
regret I think that one of the benefits
of taking the decision of compound to
airline that it also allow us to be
restrained because so for example if I
think back like five years when you're
designing the language there are a bunch
of design decisions you can take and the
fact that you are confused that I set up
some constraints like you know we need
to do that needs to be expressible with
their leg ASD it allows us to focus on
the important parts of the problem and
they're like a couple times really very
few times where I would say oh this
restriction is annoying but given the
fact that we can leverage all the
airline's optimizations given the fact
that we
we can leverage all the tools that come
with our link I'm still like 99% happy
that we went with this direction now we
have the choice to change it in the
future but we're not in a hurry thank
you thank you anyone else oh sorry hi
thanks for the talk what you hinted it
like you know you were thinking that
this is something in the very very
future that you're doing because of
possibly features that you might
possibly have in mind and I was
wondering if you could hint at what you
thought some of those might be the
reason behind you making this change in
the first place what might be to come
that you thought of right yeah that's a
very good question so one of the so one
of the things was exactly the elixir
script work so now you know complete
even if you want now - because compiling
- as I said compiling to Erlang means
like lost of information some of the
idioms they would not be carried over
and now the videos they can be carried
over so the the benefits of alexia
script is something that we were talking
with Brian Joseph for quite some time
and he was working against Alex a master
exactly because of this for a while but
even things like if you want to go a
little bit more crazy say well what if
we want to have a type system right
that's something that we can actually do
now because yeah simply because you know
we have the SD there and then we can we
can type the idiom that we are using and
not lose the information so that's
that's the so unleashes that happen with
dialyzer for example is that when you
use protocols in an exterior basically
you throw dialyzer away like it's just
the when we define a product or an
elixir for dialyzer that protocol can
accept anything and now that we have
this information someone maybe even at
one the type system you may want a
dialyzer that is actually aware of Alec
your code and you can understand
protocols better that will be possible -
so it just generally opens up the
possibilities about everything
do starts called reconstruction now it's
easier because before you'd have to get
the airline code get the air link old
translate italic circled it was kind of
messy that's also easier now so there's
a lot of possibilities really yeah
thanks there was another hand yeah this
is the first time I've seen Alexia
script and I was wondering if this is
something that you're using in
production or if you know anyone that is
now that's a question that would be
better for Brian Joseph I am NOT that
involved yeah but yeah more questions oh
here someone from here should aspect I
do need to do more exercise so that's
pretty good
when you showed the the example earlier
can you reconstruct pretty much the
original licks of source codes I can you
construct exactly the elixir source code
and the point of the question is could
you use this to write a nice pretty
printer for Alexa code so you know if
you want something where you can check
out punch it you know I don't know no
one yes so you can't use that to rec
instruct the elixir code that's a very
good question so so remember this
process here where we had all those
stats for the compiler what we are
storing there it's the expended Alex est
all right so what we are starting there
like the macros they have already been
expended so you don't have so you cannot
rec construct like the fully original
extra code as the user typed it because
the macros have been expanded but this
is by choice because for example things
like Alex your script
it doesn't really care about the the
macro expansion you just wants to define
a result of that and it actually
simplifies the job that things like an
elective scrape or even a potential type
systems could do the good news is that a
and I think Willie's going to talk about
it maybe
so the good news is is that a pretty
printer does not it works with the
original file it isn't so the pretty
printer hooks right about here right
about the file in read file it doesn't
need and things that are done later in
the process so yes we can have a pretty
printer but it could have had it in the
past it's not related to what I said in
this talk and they are there is a Google
server approach google Summer of Code
the project that is working on that blue
is working on that as well so we may see
it so all right cool thank you
any any other question then I'll ask a
question and you just mentioned Google
Summer Code I was actually curious to
know how how it went he's about to wrap
up I guess so
oh yeah how was it yeah so I think it's
a salute some of code for those are not
formally reads with it it's a project
it's an event
kind of thing organized by Google where
you have students contributing to open
source projects and we have parts of I
think this is our third year
participating in some in some shape so
the first yeah so yeah with perspective
of the year so for example if you use
Windows and then we have a Windows
installer for Alex Siri that was done as
part of gruesome of code project so we
got different kinds of feedback
throughout the years from google Summer
of Code the e ex-prime functionality
that exists for a long time next year
and it was expanded in LX 0.5 it
actually came from also google Summer of
Code project and this year we had two
projects one is one working on a pretty
printer for a lexer code so no more
style guides no more should I use you
know should I how should I dance my code
discussions the pretty printer is
supposed to get your code and
pretty print it for you and handle it
for you that's one of the projects that
we have right now and it's going well
we already did some improvements
slightly clearer to make that process
easier maybe we're going to talk about
it I don't know but
so and the other project unfortunately
the student disappeared as soon as the
person started so and that the other
project was supposed to be a language
server protocol so we have a bunch so we
have a bunch of programming languages
and we have a bunch of editors right and
each of those editors they integrate
with each programming language in a
different way right so you have like an
ampere and kind of setup where you need
to all those actors need to know how to
talk all those different languages so
Microsoft had the idea of building a
language server protocol where you have
one format that the language and the
editors they need to follow and then
they can all talk to each other without
reading from any everything over and
over again and the goal is to implement
something like this for Alex here but
the student did not show up but the good
news is that there was someone already
working on that that we he started
working as the google Summer of Code
process started and now he's continuing
to work so we may see it after all but
yeah so that's kind of the status update
it finishes next week and we'll see
thank you thank you that's excited so
you see there's always an opportunity to
contribute even in the face of a I guess
like in a mystery like a person
disappearing that's pretty good okay so
I guess I qui sugar just like wonderful
clothes for you say thank you for
