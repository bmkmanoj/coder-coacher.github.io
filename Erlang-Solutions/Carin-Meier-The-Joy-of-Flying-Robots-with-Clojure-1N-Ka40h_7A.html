come over here and especially talk to a
room of fellow functional programming
other languages and these guests and I
have to be honest I'm a little bit
nervous because I have Hardware demos
and all all sorts of things can go wrong
but what we're going to do is I have
backup videos very good very important
we're going to try like up to three
times and then we're just going to say
no and everybody that's in the first
degree at row okay you were going to be
my dream catchers for going forward okay
so there'll be instructions on how to do
this it shouldn't be needed but just so
you know if you're sitting the front row
that is gonna be your child so I would
like to do my presentations in the form
of stories because i really like stories
i think stories teach us stories
entertain us stories i think are a
fundamental way that humans communicate
information so this presentation will
have part of the story with it as well
and this story takes place a long long
time ago it was a time before mobile
phones I know it's crazy a time before
even personal computers and in this time
there was an ordinary completely
ordinary five-year-old girl and she's
completely ordinary every way until
until she watched an episode of sesame
street and you have sesame street over
here die antwoord okay this mixer and on
this episode of sesame street there was
a robot and this robot was called Sam
and it stood for Sam the what the super
automatic machine and the girl was
completely
and with this robot she wanted it to be
her robot friend and in fact that's all
she could talk about I mean to her mom
was all about Sam and the robot and
everything had to revolve around Sesame
Street now and drawing pictures of it
and in fact she just stopped playing
with her dolls and she did stop playing
with you know her stuffed animals she
stopped playing with her toys she even
got to the point when she stopped
playing with her dog and this is when
her parents really starting to worry and
it was an age where he just couldn't go
out to you know the the store and buy
all these really cool computer toys and
robots that you have today yeah there
was nothing like that available but they
love their daughter and they had to try
to do something for her so they made her
a wooden robot completely wouldn't had
wheels and it had a string that he could
pull along but the robot did one thing
and had one job that it could do in an
automated fashion and that was pick up
nails or anything metal it had a magnet
on bottom and it could pick up the girl
Lovelace this became her robot friend
and she dragged it around house with her
she dragged it to the store with her she
dragged it to the library with her it
was her constant companion and she loved
it but the years passed she grew up she
became a software developer she worked
for quite a few companies small
companies large companies she learned
quite a few computer programming
languages small languages large
languages and she even had kids of her
own and she had completely forgotten
about her robot friend until one day she
saw a Roomba and the wonderful thing
about these
they just a marvelous design that to use
it you don't have to know anything about
how it works it's just got a big green
button and you pass it and I cleaned
your floor but then on the other end of
the spectrum it's got an open API where
you can actually program it and have it
in any sort of way that you'd like so
she looked at this and she thought wow
could this be my robot friend so she
began to think it could be my robot
friend but how do you talk to a robot
she starts I think you met her language
choices how would she talk to this robot
what language would she use and it
seemed to her naturally that should be
list and is it because of John McCarthy
who is one of the founding fathers of AI
and she figured well you know if he
thought that this would be good for AI
then if the computer or the Roomba has a
natural language then it probably should
be lisp but she was a modern girl and
she wanted to have a modern lisp so she
wanted to do it enclosure and so now i'm
going to switch the first person because
little girls me and it's like easier
than I get looking fused so what's up so
let's take a look at what makes closure
I I think a great length after doing
this it's a dynamic language and it's
functional and it has java and drop and
concurrency we'll talk a little bit more
about each one so first a show of hands
who in the room has closure experience
all right quite a few okay so just real
quick like it's kind of stretched out
text here but that's right it's a
dynamic language so here we're just
defining a cat to be the strain cat but
we don't have to say
anything about what type it is or
anything like that it's functional
here's how you do a simple say hello
function and closure so you define this
concatenate hello and the string and the
actually call execute at st. 11 but it's
got Java interrupt one of the really
powerful features of closure is a who
access to all these wonderful java
language and you can actually call the
methods on the job methods on them
proper free so in this case you're
looking at like a class of a Roomba
which is really just a job a lang string
and you can call to up a plate case on
it there and of course it's a really
nice feature is concurrency and it's got
a mutable data structures and it's got
these things called bars and grab some
atoms and agents that work together for
concurrency I'm not going to go into all
that right now but it's very nice so
back to the Rumba the Roomba has a you
get it out here so this is rumba
everybody seen a room but before you
know about rumbas know okay they vacuum
your floors awesome but you usually have
a cover on it but you'll see that each
one of them comes with this port the
serial port that you can plug in and
send commands to through this
specification so this is their their
port I'm going to put the Rumba here and
you can connect to it via bluetooth so
they have this thing called a routine
specially made for the Roomba here it is
a roux tooth
very cool you can order from sparkfun by
the way very good and there was his book
called hacking your Roomba which was a
very fun book and the cool thing about
it is they have a library that's already
written in Java I'll go back to it so
there's an already library written in
Java called Rubicon so because we have
power of Java libraries I don't have to
like rewrite that I can actually have a
closure rebel and talk to the roomba
using this library through closure which
is what I'm going to show you a demo
right now which is great fun so and you
know something you might have trouble
seeing the roomba on the table I'm going
to show a short video for how it works
later for the people on the back so hold
on hopefully it'll work I had bluetooth
trouble and I tried to do this earlier
today so but we have backup that it's
all about the hardware right I warned
you about this so going over to my Emacs
here oh wait before I do that I have to
actually try to connect to it so system
preferences and then oh great things are
going wrong already oh okay see I like
freeze up here wait where is the thing
like how do I get back to my okay that
wanders okay thank you
wet control oh sure thank you I get up
here and I just get so nervous I can't
do things anymore which is horrible but
ok so bluetooth here it is pair
connecting connective pairing field but
that's okay because I have to put in the
secret code now you all know my secret
connecting connected yes ok ok so here
is a Emacs with closure Ruppel in it so
I can execute the commands I think with
control x ee ok so that's working that's
cool so first you did define your Roomba
here and I'm actually flying that job
class that room become serial from that
library that we just saw and I should
see all the ports there so you see it's
kind of small text there but that
Firefly thing that's the bluetooth thing
that we just got I'm going to define a
port name and now here is the moment of
truth this is where it was failing me
before connected to all right so let's
start up the roomba we can look at his
mode of string he's in a passive mode we
want to control him so if it returns
true we're in good mode here good ok so
we're going to play a note it's kind of
hero and you can play this tells you how
long and what frequency
go with say guys here they're young yeah
I think it's really cool okay so you can
tell him to do things like spin left so
areas spinning around and we can tell
them to spin right and you can tell them
to like stop and stuff like that i'm not
going to have a go for it cuz he's on
the table you can even do things like
turn his vacuum on this is actually my
son's rumba from his room each my
children have a roomba so it's very
excited he's forgotten my own room but
two as well but it was very excited that
Miss rumbas it's a come over she's all
the way for you so of course you can
write functions to control the roomba so
here's a function that I wrote to spin
and beep so it's kind of you know you're
doing a lot of imperative stuff but here
but you'd have to be sleeps with the
room but but it's all worth it because
you know you're controlling a Roomba so
the spins and beats good rumba Sonny's
he's done his job he's done his first
step I'm going to put them away because
I'm very proud of them and then I'll
show a video for you free people in the
back so you can come see he'll be coming
out again and we'll see if you can
behave himself like you did before and
they'll be great so back to keynote play
it okay so here's the backup video and
also that so
can see in the back Oh sound here I have
a sound clip them do you okay oh there
you so that's me with my humax ruffle
there and we had it in the office and we
were just having great fun with it so i
recommend so i'm sharing the
documentation there so anyway if you're
gonna get one it can keep your floors
clean and you can play with it and
hackett which is pretty fabulous so it
was happy times with the roomba and we
were getting along great and then I saw
this thing an AR drone parrot ar.drone
and I thought whoa could this be my
robot friend the answer is yes so a
little about the AR during here we're
going to put up it's a black on floor ok
and this is one of the important part is
that it usually has a hull that goes
around it as a Styrofoam hull to protect
the blades when you're flying it inside
and I had so proud of myself because I
had brought both the roomba and the air
drone overseas i was on the underground
by myself which I hadn't done for the
first time I'd found my way all the way
to this stop and I got the would you
call it an underground car the train
okay the tooth so I got off and I was in
the station and I was holding the box
with this in it and the hull on top and
the breeze came by from
train and just the whole thing and went
straight on the tracks so we are going
to fly whole list tonight it'll be okay
a little exciting but this is a
quadcopter so it's got actually got two
cameras it's about one in the front and
it's actually got one on the bottom as
well and it's got sonar isn't this cool
so I can tell how far how far it is off
the ground again beautiful design you
can you don't have to know anything
about how it works you can fly it out of
the box connect to it with your iphone
or ipad but on the other extreme you can
hack it to your heart's desire it's got
an open API you can hack it in any
language that you like many people have
they see there's a node library out
there there's a ruby library there's a
go library I've written wanted closure
that we'll talk about in a minute I
don't think there's a haskell one out
there yet sounder saying so anyway it's
great fun so they're going it there is
they publish an AR Drone developers
guide and very well documented and I'm
just going to show you walk through a
little bit of how you actually
communicate with it so I forgot to
mention that is about a wireless network
actually on board so when you start it
up you connect to its wireless network
and you talk to it over a TV p channel
and you send it commands so that's how
it works so just walking through just a
sample program here what you do
enclosures you have like a namespace and
you import some Java libraries very
useful Java libraries in half we don't
have to rewrite having to do with the
EVP communication the next thing you do
is you define your actual thrown host IP
that you're going to talk to and it's
default port and then you have a socket
of course that you're going to use with
this and there is just a send command
function where you're sending it and the
thing that you're sending is just a
string you send just a string over UDP
and we'll see that in a minute so you
construct your date of your own packet
and you just send it to it and here is a
simple command for a take off and land
you see it's it's a string you're
sending over it's got an 80 rough in
there the thing after the equal sign is
actually the sequence number so that you
have to actually increment with each
call or I won't listen to it that that's
not higher than the little one before
and just a return character on the end
and you can take off and land and you
can send it hand just like this and I
was actually doing this just in the
closure rubber one night and I had it
like sitting here in my table and was
after they could put the kids to bed and
I was packing on it and it actually
worked and I screamed out loud and my
kids both woke up came running out of
the room oh my gosh I worked like it's
flying so so I ended up writing a
library for it called sealed a
Pteranodon
github and so just extending those
commands there's all sorts of other
things you can do it that you can take
off you can land there's an emergency
mode and this is important because as
will see the safety instructions later
if it gets an angle greater than 90
degrees it cuts out and then you have to
reset it and say it's okay you can flag
in spin rides been left up down tilt
back health front turn right you can
give it a combination of these
parameters and have it fly I tend to do
this a lot i'm talking about flying but
in any sort of position that you want
their flat trim tells it that it's on
the ground so kind of stabilizes it
before it takes off and reset watchdog
that has to do with the navigation data
when you're getting the navigation data
it'll only keep sending it to you if you
tell it that you're still listening and
you're still alive so up the commands
the way they execute them is I read
function drone that sends we saw it
earlier basically that you send it a key
and you tell the Drowned what you want
to do all right you guys ready for
another demo safety first all right so
this is an incredible safe product I
mean they've done a really good job
designing it the blades are plastic I
have stuck my finger in the blades
before and I still have all my fingers
I'm not going to say it doesn't hurt it
does hurt okay but it's a very safe
product i'm going to show you again we
talked about the engine cutoff right so
there's a certain way that you catch a
drone if it's not doing one at tribute
which happens its Hardware down those
your programming it stuff happens
sometimes it shouldn't but I want you to
be prepared so this is how you don't
catch down
so especially the hall like grab it here
and you get the blades right it's gonna
hurt he still has all its fingers and
you know it just hurt so here is how
you're supposed to catch it around so
especially that's the hall there you
flip it so in this case it doesn't have
a halt but you can still get a hold of
it this way or like if it's underneath
you can grab it underneath and then flip
it like this all right okay and first
row right okay so a call from Mia he's
also from neo as well he is going to be
this side of the stage drunk catcher I'm
going to be this side of the stage and
bright oh we're not to back up that you
don't have to use it quite good so I
need batteries now you might notice that
I put a lot of tape for the people in
the front row and this is because the
drone gets into hover mode based on its
vertical camera so if you have a
featureless floor or low light so this
actually I have a star and like a little
thing so this isn't anything special to
the various just features so it tries to
when it hovers it'll try to orient
itself and not shift too much but if it
gets on the black here and you can't see
a place to stay in place it might drift
a little bit more okay so hold on you
have to get back to me max here and my
other program I have drone moves okay
so again this is usually has a hole on
it like you saw in the pictures but
we're going haul us today it shouldn't
make a difference we'll see okay the
turns green okay so then you have to
connect to the network there it is a neo
daram and connect it to here and that
took the lift it up to the yay ok so we
initialized around and we do that flat
turn we talked about to tell it's on the
ground and just for good measure and we
do the merchant to you though not really
need to do it and then we take off
all right doing pretty well here so we
can do some moves here they have some
animations that they program in and
we're going to call on here this is
called a double by theta mixed so we'll
dance move there this one's called a
wave it's getting too close to call all
right okay this one's a turn around one
it flies a little differently without
the hall on actually um okay so here's
the tricky bit it's going to do a flip
okay you guys ready so yeah I'm not
having the hall on first wave off
usually it kind of like bounces right
back but stead it covers a little bit
higher now but yeah not bad so yeah
good job both my robots have been so
cooperative down let's see if they can
just keep it up what's up my backup
video is going we don't need up okay so
not only can you send it commands but
you can also get navigation data back
from all these wonderful sensors on here
so again you have the sonar that you can
get back and it's got other sensors so
it can actually tell how fast it's going
and it has these cameras and of course
you can do vision processing but it's
actually got some pre tags that it can
look at and some of them are texts like
stickers you can put on the hull of the
other drones and or on the arm on the
case so those are one type of tag it
recognizes this is another type of tag
it recognizes it's called an oriented
roundel and you can programmatically
decide which camera you're going to look
for these tags you can look for them on
the vertical or on the horizontal camera
as well so the nice thing about those
tags is they come in very fast so you
don't have to do your own vision
processing and it can actually kind of
estimate how far away you are from these
tags like the Delta X and the Delta Y
and it can tell you immediately when it
detects it a multiple actually tagged
detection which is pretty cool so I
gathered this sort of navigation stream
data you have to have another court that
you connect to and it sends you back
this data and I this is a closure Adam
called a nav data and this will share
the information across many threads so
all sorts of good streaming debut can
get it can tell you its control state it
can tell you if it's flying land
covering et cetera battery percentage
pitch roll y'all altitude and it's got
some idea of its velocity but you know
it's not all that accurate and then we
talked about the vision tag stuff as
well so here's an example of how you
would use that you can log out any
information than that navigation day
you're interested in you would
initialize the drone and then say that
you want to target stuff what things you
want to target you could look for those
stuff on the horizontal camera there's
tags and they have different color tags
in case you want to be playing with
different colored drones you have like
blue tags ill attach green tags I could
show you on the whole I have it but it
on or you can say that you wanted to
look for the Rhondda on the vertical
camera and then you can call this
function initiate nav data and you'll
start to get all this data back
streaming in and that nav data Adam that
you can look at you can also do vision
processing your own vision processing so
the video comes back to you in a tcp/ip
channel and it comes back and it's raw
stuff in h.264 format you can go ahead
and you can take that format you can
save it off to your own accorded video
if you want to you can display the raw
feed and any way that you want to as
well or this is kind of cool you can
take that video back and you can convert
you train to a pink format that can go
to another open source vision processing
library opencv and you can do facial
recognition so this is my husband
testing this out so its target to space
coming into the target you know
the the face detection library so it's
pretty the face detection library is is
pretty fast itself however doing all
this processing on the video format is
really slow at least on my
three-year-old error so I'm not going to
actually show that because it's actually
like a like a four-second delay which is
a little bit disappointing I haven't
figured out how to get that down but
anyway you can do it and you could do
stuff like trackballs you could track
laser pointers you know anything you
want to basically but opencv has job
bindings and because it have access to
the jb FML the java libraries you can
use it so it's very nice so all this is
really cool you know you can control it
make it do things but I thought you know
if I really want this to be my robot
friend something's kind of missing you
know it would be nice if it had beliefs
and goals and this isn't a crazy idea I
mean John McCarthy Road a nice paper
about ascribing mental qualities do
she's and he said that in cases it can
be quite useful to do this you know it
class example of this is a thermostat a
thermostat can be said to have beliefs
and goals not many but it could pass up
so its beliefs would be you know the
room is too cold or its belief could be
the room is too hot or the room is just
right and it could have the goal that
the room should be just right so why
would you want to do this well one of
the things that parking sadness papers
was that it could be easier to
understand and reason about I mean this
is how we relate to each other I
i I don't know exactly what is going on
while looking at somebody their blood
sugar level and all the goings on and
there but they look like all right here
their stomach rumbling I can describe my
belief that I think they're hungry I
mean that's so maybe others are easier
to understand a reason about and complex
systems this could be a useful concept
also for building intelligent systems
our AI computer programs are going to be
incredibly complex to model human
behavior maybe we should start kind of
modeling it after how we think so
started working on beliefs and actions
for the drones so here's an example of a
belief action it's called a belief
action that's landed it has a strength
human-readable strength that I am landed
so it would believe that I'm landed when
it's got a function a predicate function
that evaluates to true so you remember
that navigation data control state so
when it sends back landed then it will
believe that it's landed and go ahead
and do this action take off another one
a plea faction of taking off it believes
it's taking off when the control state
gets into the state trans take off and
then once we have these belief actions
we can put them together and actually
give it a goal we can say that this goal
take off which human readable string I
want to fly so you can have the goal
that he wants to fly and it can pose
composed of these two belief actions a
belief action landed and a belief action
of taking off and yeah that's hovering
so then you can change a chain these
goals together so you can give it a goal
list so it can give it goals that you
want it to take off get your cruising
altitude and then
so let's try so another kind of risky
thing about this one is that it relies
on that stream of navigation data coming
back and I have been other demos before
when it's a noisy Wi-Fi environment that
it just cuts out and it'll it'll stop
the stream because it just can't get the
stuff fast enough and I know it's not
relying writing I'd have error handling
on this case but so if the navigation
screen stops and it doesn't believe that
it's ever high enough that's possibility
that it could just keep going up so
that's one possibility I'm just letting
you know here
well you're here good so we have a goals
here during nap goals okay so here's the
program and it's got a whole bunch of
these belief actions that we had before
and setting the current goal list like
it did before I'm just going to go ahead
and execute this entire buffer here real
quick yes okay so it's not all that's
beliefs and goals in here oh shoot we
have to do this again because you're not
actually put them he's on the same okay
oops wires that could be really
dangerous okay oops so I'll have to
execute this again okay and I should
have a log this should lock his beliefs
and goals if I have the right log of
them see okay so he has all his goals so
now when i initialize him and then hit
that an it nav data he should just go
and do this all on his own based on his
own goals and beliefs and not me giving
him the commands here all right
ok Cece here he's it's hard to see but
he's trying to get to a cruising
altitude and he's drifting backwards
well just let him go for a minute he'll
be ok you watch my boy you're right ok
it's ok doing this is fun ok yeah to get
he got interrupted there so I think he
got their merchants to cut out so that's
as far as he got it was a quite safe
landing but you guys get the ideas they
are there so you can tell what he
achieves the goal he never actually
cheaper gone actually the one thing that
I found when I was working with doing
these demos and reviews just playing
with it then it actually was easier to
debug like when he went up and got stuff
on the ceiling I knew that you had a
faulty belief hi so I made it made it
really clear so back here
so we can do the backup video but like
you guys saw about it ok so now I had an
airdrome huh that's my friend and I have
a roupa that's my friend and I thought
would it be cool if it could be friends
together you know it would kind of be
like Bali so I started working on a
program for both goals and beliefs for
both the Rumba and patron as well and I
had this idea that and this is the dicey
is down on the wall i couldnt even get
this to work at all during lunch but
we're just going to try it me back up
videos so the idea is that the Roomba
has this oriented roundel on it right I
put little velcro on it and it would
sort of be like an old-fashioned movie
where the room boo would come out and be
looking for his friend and that the
drone would take off and the drone would
be looking for its friend and then they
would find each other and then the room
but would see theme song from wally and
then they would dance together and then
the drone would land on the Roomba
so this is fabulous when it works and
it's I have actually got to work in live
demo yet but we will see today could be
lucky I did we just let also require set
up so for this one that is even more
dicey than the rest when we find well we
won't even talk about that quite yet
okay so first thing I need to do is I
need to see if the Bluetooth will
actually talk to the Roomba so we need
to get to the blue tooth thing again
okay so first I have to slash first
delete that one and right to rumba has
to go here stage left I've got to put
this thing on and we'll see if we can
connect to them again alright guys slept
on the blue to stuff here
appearing failed that's okay too it
connected back to Emacs this is the
river and drown our friends namespace
and better redefine the Rumba and I'll
see the ports are showing up this is the
dicey time of whether it actually
connect again this was our okay so we're
going to my plan B I've never done this
before either I am going to show you the
video later of how it all works but
you're not going to be able to hear how
to sing his Wally deep song here which
is about it'll be on the video what I'm
going to try to do is I'm going to have
the drone initiate its takeoff sequence
and try to look for it and that i'm
going to try to position him over this
and then i'll just take this thing off
and then maybe have it dance around but
that's probably won't work but we'll try
it so for this case I think if you're in
front right you should really get ready
so see when you get the drum set up I'm
so sad i come to connect Tom again
set up the drown or initiative to yell
and I work again I'm on that are so
conditioned Eliza emergency mode here do
our initializing the targeting remember
we wanted to forget the roundel on the
vertical camera and we wanted to hover
on that Rondo and where's my land
function it's right down there all right
just making sure i know this all right
so i'm not going to send out the room
but because he's not talking which is
kind of sad but we'll see if we can get
them to find it anyway and paul i'm
going to actually grab it underneath so
don't that's it don't grab me out okay
right but why are not going
so you should try to fly just like
flying and trying to find them right now
okay so at this point the Rumba would
find many would kind of sing right and
it would seem this nice put on your
sunday clothes song which I'm not gonna
sing and they would dance together like
this
ok we're going to get back on the ground
and they would spin around and dance so
I show you
but you kind of got a flavor of it a
little bit but whatever it's ok so here
here isn't actually working so i can
prove that Tito right video or didn't
happen so this is in our office and
Cincinnati so there's room back to the
moving so he's navigating with his
beliefs of goals and then the Rumba
circling around there and then finally
it flies over it enough that if it sees
it you see it's really quite
they're good
and then they're spinning and it's hard
to see the room but his room otherwise I
like go there you go keep spinning
around like the spiral there and that
works so exciting one actually works but
it's pretty complicated but it is fun so
the next question you're probably asking
yourself is what if you have more than
10 right they could be friends too and
in fact that we've actually done this in
the office as well where Jim wyrick and
I will both work in same office and
we're also in to drain if he is a
directed room then we have an office
trip so we have we have a lot of fun so
you can get them to fly together and
work together but there's a little setup
that you need to do i'm going to show
you to see you your way or and you can
do it then you can go programmed in our
line so first you get them on st.
network you have to get them in a peer
network you can actually fill that into
it my drive is totally unsecured and I'm
so glad that you're all very nice you
can actually do that thank you very much
so you tell it into it and you can run
scripts on it and writing biz box so you
just run some configuration script where
you assign them you change the regular
network to peer networking and
assign them all at skype IP so you sign
like 11 hundred and then you assign the
other one two hundred and then you can
connect on that same ad hoc network with
your laptop it was a multi dramatic and
you can change your computer to a sec I
keep so you can talk to as well
networking stuff and then you can follow
them so we actually did this in the
office with some beliefs and goals as
well because we want them to have
beliefs and goals of course this is a
video I can play down here first what
they button I got no the replay so this
is up to grounds and the books on the
floor was I didn't have tape that day
and I wanted to give them something to
look at so what they're doing is they're
going to see each other and when they
see each other then they're going to
wave to each other so then I wave to
each other and then they'll and that
will not wait
clever here so recap robots or great
funded program I mean it really is a joy
and I encourage you all to do it because
it's just a joyful closure is a powerful
and yet simple language and I think that
it's perfect for doing a I work in and I
think that describing beliefs and goals
into machines can be useful so if
nothing else it is another way
alternative way to think about
structuring your programs that's what
useful to get out of your box and I
think that robots communicating acting
with each other put together is the
future you know hopefully that's a good
future we can work on that together all
this so and that these are recoveries
and the resources my steps all I did
give up so if you want to play with it
and get a drone you're more than welcome
to there's clj brain which is a control
library for the drone and others control
lever for the Roomba and there's
something coat that i should here is the
root beer and friends and then there's
java karthi's papers resided love and I
think that you should definitely read
his stuff there's tons of gems of wisdom
in there so one paper is scribing mental
qualities and sheets that you should
just check out all those papers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
