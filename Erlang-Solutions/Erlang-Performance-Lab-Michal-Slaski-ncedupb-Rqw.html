welcome here I'm glad so many of you are
here I second all right that maybe
someone can help us so we'll increase by
increasing volume of the speakers if not
I will try to speak up loud all right no
no this is good I hope that you can hear
me now a bit better so again I can see
quite a few of you joined I know that
the the reason for being here with me
now is that you wanted to secure your
place for the next speaker in the front
row so and the only thing that stands
between the next speaker and and
yourself is me so I'll try to get myself
out of your way quickly but I will do
some video casting here I have captured
a number of movies short movies that
will help you understand how Erlang
clusters work how message passing in
those clusters can work this will be the
bee so few words about myself I have
graduated from the IgH University of
Science in Krakow
some few years ago I'm a technical lead
of one of the erlang solutions offices
which is in Krakow Poland and I'm also
in mangas I am developer this is a
product open-source product that the
thing in Krakov is responsible for and
and a few years ago in Stockholm during
the Erlang user conference I had a
chance to present a proof-of-concept it
was a lightning talk
so the proof-of-concept look like this
it was a graphical user interface that
was rendering in a browser on a WebGL
canvas some 3d gladwell visualizations
of processes and messages being sent
between them so this was just a
lightning talk not really useful I was
trying to be funny so I handed in
something like 400 3d glasses to people
sitting there and people actually could
put it on which way did and then the
whole audience was actually watching
those video
those that were presented in 3d this was
just trying to get an idea whether this
is something that community would be
interested in is it something that
people would find intuitive to navigate
so this was just a proof-of-concept and
then for quite a few years I've been
looking for the right tooling to improve
on this visualization and then few
months ago I came across a component
that Netflix has released as open source
they call it V zero if you have attended
to a talk by Casey a few minutes ago
he has demoed this tool when I saw the
animation that can be rendered with this
tool I felt like this is really exactly
what I was looking for this can be used
not only for what Netflix has there
which is hundreds of micro services
running on several amazon regions but it
actually could be used to represent our
language elective distributed systems so
we decided to give it a try
last year late last year we implemented
another proof of concept and now what we
do here is we have elixir getting
started application from the elixir 8
language website which does implement
the key value storage but you have a
hash function on the key so those values
are stored in two different nodes
depending on what is the hash and what
this visualization will do now is you
will see traffic coming from the
Internet where people are trying to
store key in the database and because of
this who knows which are here across
which we distribute the keys you will
see that the traffic will be evenly load
were load balanced between the two nodes
so I have just started the demo
application requests are hitting one of
the nodes the hashing function is
distributing keys across who knows and
this has been demoed in December during
elixir conference in Warsaw Poland again
I was just trying to understand whether
this would be of interest to the
community we got quite some good
after the conference so we felt like
this is really something we need to
alright so the question is what is the
meaning of the speed of the dots each
dot represents a single message sent
from one airline node to another the
speed doesn't really say much other than
the density of the spark dog's particles
is updated every five seconds so for
five seconds we observe how many
messages were sent between two nodes and
then we update the producer of this
particle system with what the volume
that it at which it feeds out the
particle in s it is animation but the
pendulum then city of this animation
represents how intensive the traffic is
so the more particles you see and more
interesting traffic the more intensive
traffic we get you will see in the next
few examples what we can represent with
different graphical features of the
animation all right
okay so so this was sort of the
preparation for the talk when I was
thinking of what was to talk about and
the agenda for today will be I will
share some design principles behind the
tool and what is already available this
is an open source project some features
have been already implemented and you
can get them and how it works inside so
what is the the idea behind the scenes
some ideas for future work and I will
also be happy to answer any other
questions so the design principles here
first it has to be intuitive so the idea
here is not to add tens of wiki pages
which will explain to you how you are
supposed to use this tool but this
should be intuitive you should
open a browser you should see the user
interface rendered and it should be
included how to navigate it also
visualizations should after few minutes
at most the easy to comprehend this is
the one of the design principles I would
like to embrace second is that all this
is based on airline crating Airlines
tracing can be used to capture a lot of
different events in the system and the
more events you have the more complex it
gets those sets of events can be really
complex and how to navigate how to
reason about them how to analyze them
this is this is quite a challenge if you
have many trades events so the decrease
the design principle here is to simplify
the set so say you have a thousand event
that tell you that the message has been
sent between two processes we want to
simplify it just with for example
account so how many of those messages
were not really what were was sent but
how many and by simplifying this set
just when the size of the set it can
already give quite nice feedback to the
user and yet make it easier to
comprehend when another design principle
is that we don't worry about production
systems so although it would be of
interest to see how a production system
behaves that is not the principle here
the we want to make it work for
developers who are iterating on their
software design and they need to
understand what they have done what just
happened what was just committed and of
course would be nice to have it run on
the production system but we will not
warranty that it is safe to do so so we
don't worry about production system and
also I mean the tool that I showed
before was to develop four years ago at
the time only few browsers had good
support for WebGL converters nowadays
every browser has reasonably good WebGL
support so we want to leverage this and
really do a lot in WebGL
so most of the visualizations that you
see today have been rendered with webbed
engine on the web geocanvas so what is
available so first of all this is a tool
this is really a developer tool you can
download it on the website
or you can check out the repo and build
it and it builds to the command line
tool so you can run it and discover what
it can do for you for example it can
tell you what are the arguments that you
can pass through this command line tool
argument being that the node you want to
monitor cookie that you will be used to
connect to that monitor node you can
have two plugins and a few other things
that you can pass as arguments so having
look you have a look at this we realized
that the way to attach us to a node is
to provide a node name we will also add
some extra logging here to better
understand what has happened so we run a
command and we see that plugins were
started
we have plugged in for dashboard for SP
for version for traffic we don't know
much about this yet but a tool says to
navigate to the local host on port 8000
so this is what happens when you
navigate to this fort it's this this
page actually has been implemented in
the Elm programming language for those
of you who are familiar with this
language maybe already liked it maybe
you don't for those of you who are not
ell is now getting quite a lot of
interest I'm not sure how many companies
have been using it successfully in
production systems but generates a lot
of interest and this was also one of the
ideas behind implementing an elm view is
to try to get some feedback from this
community and maybe they will be able to
contribute new plugins it's not that you
have to develop views in L but we do
support M as one of the front-end
programming languages so what L does
here for example it connects to the back
end and gets the version of the tool and
then renders here in the view so the
simple but just illustration on how you
could use em language then another view
which is already available it's just
like very very basic information value
system nothing interesting what is more
interesting is the dashboard and here
the unique selling point of the
dashboard is that it has seven metrics
seven I repeat
seven this is quite a few isn't it
handful of metrics and it has three
literally three charts right and those
metrics are throughput select number of
messages and bytes that are being sent
to the system number of processes that
are currently running in the system
number of spawns that happen in the last
five seconds as well as exist and
abnormal exits so this is how it looks
like so now we will just play some
animation when monisha is executing
transactions alright so first we observe
the system not much is happening there
is something like thirty three messages
flying through the system every five
seconds you can see this dashboard here
a throughput is measured on the timeline
in other words those 6565 messages
thirty messages they just fly through
the system but now we will start
executing some media transaction and of
course number of messages flying through
the system increases so now we are
processing something like 3000 messages
per five seconds and this is also
visualized in the graph to get some
context so you get some historical
context how was it few minutes ago how
is it now you can spot a trend if you
like so nothing fancy but it gives you a
very very first impression on what the
system does is it really busy or maybe
it's not maybe it's just doing nothing
really I doing this one is now quite
busy as it executes the Museu
transactions and we can very easily spot
it by looking at the graph right now
next thing to do now that we realize
that there is something going on would
become navigated to this tab so we
navigate to the star
and this one will draw a graph
representing a Supervision tree so the
provision tree view supports some hide
and show applications so that language
is consists of several applications
typically you may want to render just
some of them some others you want to
hide you can zoom zoom in the tree so
that you basically see in more detail
certain branches you can also zoom out
and then you can also click and get some
more information about certain worker or
a supervisor so this is how it works we
have now enabled this this view of
supervision trees and the two
applications running one of them is
Cardinal that one is in Asia you can see
them rendered here supervisors are green
workers are blue when you click on the
process those squares represent
processes you can see there's many
process info rendered on the right hand
side for example here we click some
process and it happened to be initial
occur process you can tell by looking at
the registered name attribute from the
process info function so you we can now
try to do another process info this is
monisha transaction manager media TM
process which is connected here so let's
see what happens when we kill that
process so we now call the exit beef and
we're going to kill that process media
transaction manager let's see what
happens application shuts down it says
and so it disappeared alright so this
was quite crucial process for that
application because it didn't review
restarted we now need to restart it
manually so this whole supervision tree
of media has spawned again and we can
see it being rendered here and the first
layout is trying to make this graph look
nice and unreadable so this view will
help you explore your supervision tree
and also try to understand which workers
are doing what all right so we move on
now we will present another view which
is already available that view of the
cluster traffic so this committee
systems consist of more than one node
airline nodes connect with each other of
a so-called distributed airline protocol
and they can send messages between
processes sitting on different machines
and it would be interesting for us to
understand how many messages are being
sent between the now that we observe and
other nodes in a cluster so that we
better understand if there are any
bottlenecks if were like is it the input
or output traffic which is high and so
on so things like this would be nice to
understand for example for years I've
been wondering what are the differences
between leaves dirty right neasha sink
right and miniature transaction right
people will tell you that the
transaction is more expensive because it
has to do some distributed log while
dirty right is asynchronous whatever
that means
which means that is cheaper they say so
things like this have been on the
mailing list for years I've been reading
about them I'm a technical lead of a
corner of my team so I didn't supposed
to read those mails but how do you know
that those guys who post those messages
on the mailing list say true so I was
always interesting to understand how
that works and let's try to find out
because in this class of traffic view
you will see the number of adult
distributed messages being passed
between the node observes and other
nodes you will be able to understand the
ratio between ingress and egress traffic
so input-output traffic as well as the
distribution of load across the nodes so
we start with eight nodes so we have
amnesia cluster which runs on eight
airline nodes all connected together the
sensor one that you can see here
represents the note that we are
observing so you also see this here a at
127 and so on so the name of the note
that we observe is this is the node and
the ones around them is node b c d e f g
h right what we will do now is we will
on this node execute malicious
transaction from
two thousand times all right so we will
see what happens and also just to make
it even more interesting soon after we
will execute the same number of
transactions but originating from node B
all right so this is not B this is not a
let's see what happens first we start
with no day like let's see right so this
is 6000 messages for five minutes
Oh 11,000 this is quite a lot there is a
lot of traffic which is now within this
cluster eleven and a half thousand
requests now we also started this other
one from node B and you can see that
this now generate 25% of the overall
traffic the other nodes generate twelve
twelve twelve and so on so it's it is
evenly distributed across the note that
just receive write operations from the
central node but this guy because it
also executes some transactions it's
responsible for generating twice as much
traffic as the ones that are just
receiving but it sounds about right and
I think those guys who were posting some
well information about how many turns
actually works but right about right
this visualization prove this but it is
just transaction we can now also see
other animations this one will show us
how things they're to behave so now
let's have a look again the same idea we
will be executing 2000 sync dirty
operations from node a and from log B
and we will see what happens so again
similar pattern however here there is
half the traffic that was on the
previous slide right we had 11 thousand
before now we have five thousand so this
is less expensive at least traffic-wise
compared to this transaction that was
run previously as far as the load
balancing is concerned it's this one
also generating 25% of traffic and the
others are responsible for the rest so
same pattern if you like as far as the
load balancing goes but in terms of
number of messages
we actually generated half the traffic
compared to the previous operation and
then we have another one which is dirty
right and this one again we will be
executing it first from this central
load
there are even less operations now we
can see something like two three
thousand and you can see that the color
of those is only blue meaning we don't
actually receive any messages back we
just send them out this is truly
asynchronous and we don't receive them
back the only node which sends us
something back and sending back is
represented by yellow dots is the one
from which we are also executing
asynchronous right operations so it
works both ways
that makes sense and it actually indeed
proved visually at least not
mathematically but visually that
asynchronous operations take place when
you execute dirty right ok so what's
what's next next is also message passing
so once you have observed how a class
will behave and what are the traffic
patterns in a cluster you may be
interested in understanding the patterns
of message passing in side and node
right so we already have that
implemented as well we will use again
Netflix visualizations for for this but
we will dive into one of those nodes so
again we are replicating Lygia
transaction but we want to understand
what is happening inside an airline node
so we start with this global view of the
cluster you had seen this presentation
already so nothing new here and you can
see that the density has increased now
we click on the middle node we dive in
and now we will be observing what what's
going on in there so this is not
rendering nicely yet this is something
we need to fix so it takes a bit of time
to actually manually do the graph layout
I hope that we will be able to add like
force layout or something which will be
more automated not manual but still as
this animation is going what we can see
is that there are some processes which
are very busy there is the media
transaction manager there is the few
other processes here that we can CP this
off there is an easier Locker here as
well
and you can see which direction those
messages are passing right here this is
both directions here is just one
direction here's also one direction by
density of those particles you can tell
also how expensive or how intensive this
application this communication is
because other nodes other processes
don't send that much between each other
those are only they want 2 3 4 5
processes that are very active when
Lygia execute transactions so it's
helpful because now you obtain the send
world of possible bottlenecks right you
can easily spot the processes which are
really busy with message processing and
those are probably the ones that you
should look at her when you want to
maybe look for bottlenecks or understand
better what's going on and who is really
responsible for for the load of the
system so how this works behind the
scenes it's quite simple it's actually
consist only of of one fun
one function which we spawn remotely
there is just a hack here which allows
us to spawn the fun on any node no
matter what is the airline runtime
system version on the remote node
because it can happen that the version
of the runtime system on which you
compile the tool is different from the
one on which you want to run the
application that you observe and in
order to be able to found functions
remotely we are actually doing all the
scanning parsing and compilation for the
RPC call so that later we can phone link
this remote fun on the remote node so
this is really all it does it spawns one
fund and is running one process on the
target node and that process what it
does is it turns on tracing for all
processes for flags like send receive
process related events and it will
always sum them with a timestamp so this
is exactly the reason why I do not
recommend running these on the
production system
because what we say here is we want to
process all your prophecies and actually
want to press trace all send and receive
messages by all of your processes that
in some cases can be a lot of traffic
you have seen the animation with Misha
on eight nodes and it was something like
eleven thousand messages per five
seconds so what are the ideas for future
there are few that I listed here but I
will be very interested to talk to those
of you who find this useful on what are
the views that you might need and I
would be very happy to try to work on
those views as well so one idea is to
hook this tool which helps us observe a
system to continue slow testing so what
continues low testing I take it that
most of you have heard the term
continuous integration and tools like
Travis continues integration which works
perfectly fine with github is a tool
that you have the chance to use or at
least you you have heard of this is a
dashboard of a Travis for mangu Zion
project on github what all it does is
just execute all the integration tests
every time you commit some increment of
code or send a pull request so the same
idea is with flow testing for every pull
request we would like to execute a bunch
of load testing we came up with a tool
called the murder of crows and what it
does when you started is it attacks your
system right this is how you can
visualize what the amok in for short
guys with your system and we developed a
tool that does continuous load testing
the same way as Travis does continuous
integration we call it tied for price
plus a mock and also instrumented with
the Dockers forum which we used to set
up the environment the test environment
gave us an opportunity to implement
continuous load testing
concept so we spawned cluster of monkeys
I am note of our claw generation tools
and this is similar to typical Travis
continued integration workflow and we
get a dashboard but this time we don't
show how many tests have failed but
instead we show metrics that were
captured during load testing and you can
compare and contrast different metrics
between different pull requests as you
move on with your development so what
would be nice is now not only to capture
those metrics which you can easily draw
with tools like graph honor but also to
observe the node during load testing
with those visualizations and also be
able to compare and contrast how certain
pull requests affect the behavior of the
traffic of the of the distributed system
another idea is continuous chaos which
for those of you who were present at the
talk by Casey Rosenthal before coffee
break he was talking about continuous
scales at Netflix he introduced us to
the concept of chaos monkey next week
transcribes monkey on life systems and
he claimed that it helped increase
service availability because when he
runs it on a production system engineers
tend to implement callbacks which will
protect the system from any cause monkey
effect so this is good and this would be
actually something that we should do
when we design fault tolerant airline
called elixir systems we should also
keep in mind that we need solve ax
should something go wrong we need to
have a fallback to to make the system
fault tolerant but how do you measure
whether your design is already fault
tolerant it's not easy you do it through
some experimentation but quite often you
actually find out about flows in your
fault tolerant design on the production
system so if we could use this
visualization during cows monkey
experimentation on a
not necessarily life system I think it
would help us understand whether the
system is already designed in a way
which helps it survive certain crashes
another idea that comes to mind how this
tool could be extended as with the beam
modeling language so although the tool
is called airline performance lab and
you can derive on the name that it is
supposed to help you find bottle legs
and increase overall performance
actually going forward I'm thinking of
it as a tool for developers in other
words that we should help you not only
find bottlenecks and understanding the
behavior of your system but also help
you communicate what is it that you
actually have designed and for this I
believe we should have a universal
language visual language which will
describe semantics of a system if I'm an
airline developer somebodies an elective
developer and we want to talk to each
other showing him or her my airline code
will not do any good in the same way
when him or her would show me some Alexa
code I will not necessarily be able to
follow what's going on and what are the
semantics of the system if we could have
some modeling language like the UML in
the object-oriented programming to show
properties of the system maybe this
would facilitate the design and also
discussion between different engineers
actually this concept is not not it's
not new furball hoffman has came up with
what he used to call visual airlines and
i put here on the slide some examples
from his visual airline notation so for
example you could represent that one
node observed other monitors the other
through such visual shapes here you
would represent two processes being
linked that one process spawns another
or a message is being sent from one
process to another some thinking that if
we could use the WebGL canvas to draw
some of those visual
language properties and maybe it would
help us translate semantics of the
system to slightly more formal
description like in here there are some
other ideas as well there is already a
waiting pull request with timeline
tracking where you actually capture
changes of your gem server state over
the time and then you can understand how
certain messages that jens ever had to
process change the internal state of the
gem server so it could be interesting to
actually be able to go back and forth on
the timeline and see how the state was
evolving as the genitive it was
receiving messages so this is one of the
ideas and again this is an open source
project it's that there is an open
source community we have two people
contributing and me my and I'm also
contributing to this project we have
quite skilled front-end engineer as well
as elixir engineer but if you would like
to add new views of share some ideas I
was very much encourage you to join us
those are some links that you can visit
there's a website where we publish our
built our releases there is a github
organization airline lab we also try to
creat now invent on the airline lab
handle with news or schedule releases
right so to recap this is an attempt to
improve tooling for Erlangen elixir
developers so that we as engineers were
responsible for designing the system and
different aspects of the system being
performance scalability fault tolerance
we need to have tools that will help us
through that process and this is an
attempt to improve this tooling if you
have any questions I would be happy to
answer otherwise I will be also
available during the day thank
thank you very much
have you considered depicting there a
lot of trees and trees so that you can
actually see the relationship right now
I mean it would be interesting to find
some good visual properties which would
help us indicate on the picture in the
picture this extra property that you
described now we just use colors to
distinguish between supervisors and
workers but we could use other
properties like an orbit like the size
of a shape like some extra text of
things like this to tell a better more
detailed story about what what you are
looking at so this is interesting it
would require some some brainstorming
and what what visual properties are
available and useful many times in this
operations we have several green
creation of change so workers ways we
started and will see if you are actually
looking in the same
so in other words we were trying to
think of a way to visualize rest pawns
of workers right yep it's interesting I
would say it's a research as but I
haven't done that research yet so yep
very interesting concept to think about
Thanks so the question is what needs to
be done or improved in order to make
this production system applicable or
safe so I think that this is a question
to the airline VM engineers and there
are a few sitting here there is one with
who has implemented the new back-end for
the traitor in airline runtime system 19
where the overall performance of of
tracing engine has improved dramatically
compared to 18 the question is what else
needs to be taken into consideration
when you do creating a life system one
idea I would like to explore is try to
use the ltte AMG back-end for capturing
and then generating traces so instead of
using the airline native tracer which is
built into the VM try to leverage the Lt
PNG and Lt PNG engine which is operating
on the Linux kernel level and it's
already available in Airlines 19 what is
the difference between the overhead of
one and another I don't know but this
would my first step try to understand
can we do it cheaper if we would use
Elsa TMG engine instead of the native
airline tracer and then I would take it
from there
depending on how low test behaves and
how the system is
responsible unresponsive under some
Lopez I would be able to tell you more
precisely under until what loud this is
safe right beyond certain load is unsafe
because of our blah blah this is
definitely of interest but we are not
there yet I would love to because this
is I was teaching airline for the last
six years or so and it's always a
challenge to explain to students how
this works what has happened and we try
to use well pencils and whiteboards and
we do a lot of brainstorming during
classes but tools like this should also
help understand the behavior by
visualizing those things life right on
the life system so I didn't have a
chance to teach any classes things this
was developed and really this tool has
been developed over the last and 1/2
