expressions of change
so first the wide so software will
change software it's either dead or it's
changing and yet the basic building
block of software is the text file which
has no concept of history what about
version control systems you ask well
like this fire escape
version control is bolted on so it's
text but with change tracking on top and
modern buildings have integrated their
fire escapes and I say modern
programming languages should have
integrated support for modification so
in this approach we make the
modifications to programs the basic
building blocks of the programs so
change as a primitive Vista slogan there
that is we reify the modifications in
the program and to do that we first need
to actually think about what is program
modification so the question is what is
a good vocabulary to talk about change
in programs and once we've answered that
question we just record everything in
terms of that vocabulary and then of
course we reap the benefits and that
might remind you of this approach but at
least I have some ideas on how to
actually actually do it in practice
so in terms of the implementation we
first need to build an editor so by
definition we can't use an off-the-shelf
text editor off-the-shelf text editors
produce text that's not we not what we
want we want structured information
about program modification so I built an
editor myself and the current status is
that such an editor exists and it exists
as a prototype
and the second step is to create some
programming languages that builds on top
of this so the editor is the side that
produces the modifications and
programming languages are the side is
the side that consumes it so that's the
profit slide or the profit part from the
euro area slides so what's actually been
achieved so far well here are some
authority figures to tell you what you
should already know which is that
composition is very very important so we
take this observation and we ask how
does it apply to this primitive of
programming model of program
modification rather so what are the
means of combination that you can think
about in program modification and is
there a meaningful interaction between
the structure of the program and the
structure of the programs modification
and indeed there is such a meaningful
relationship but of course it doesn't
fit in this 3-minute talk so you'll have
to look it up later for the second
result I'm assuming that you all know
what static analysis is and why that
would be useful so what happens if you
come back if you combine that idea of
static analysis with the idea of refight
program modification and again the short
answer short answer is if static
analysis can tell you where in your
program you should look then this
incremental analysis tells you when you
should look and the longer answer could
be found here so I hope that makes you
somewhat curious if you have any
questions just find me in the hallways
or on the website thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
