talk about the history of functional
programming in particular that the
evolution of functional programming
languages how we got to where we are now
I'm a professor at the University of
Kent and I've been researching
functional programming languages
actually since 1972 so I've seen a lot
of history of the subject it seems to be
interesting to people who are using say
Erlang hospital now to see the history
that came behind them the ideas from and
this is a really interesting conference
made to talk out because it's a mixture
of commercial and academic talks and
non-academic people you don't often get
the child in both those fancy people in
one conference so yeah we have people
talking about like something like lace
closure Haskell so yeah there is a lot
of maybe one of them a conference that
has a lot of languages like three
different line we talking a lot of
different language that are not
vertically were used in an industry
right yes and also it very interesting
applications like someone's using
facebook a using a sport program
facebook functional languages being
in the financial services to do trading
it's fascinating to me see the way
people are using these tools well thank
you very much David poor yields very
well thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
