kawaii to go but we still not read but
most of what I talked about two years
ago is still to today so this time I
want to go over the process of making
cowboy to the lessons I learned and then
give a few interesting things one
question came very often yesterday on
this morning which is when will you
release cowboy 2 so we will get to this
but first a few coefficients so yes
cowboy to came very slowly there's a big
reason for that there's actually a few
reasons but does one that is bigger than
the others which is that the life
happened I became a father and so I
spent a lot of time doing something
other than computers and then there's
the difficulties of working on an
existing project especially since I was
not the happiest with the first version
I wanted to change a lot of things I'm
changing things takes time now you have
to change the code that s the
documentation and so on so starting from
scratch feels easy at first but
modifying it is pretty difficult
and so there's a lot of changes the
biggest stuff in the course so there's a
new feature of the screen on wheels we
will get to it which changed everything
ready it gives a lot of power to users
if they need it and the interface also
change but it's mostly when you convert
from version 1 to 2 you have to delete a
lot of code
that's about it so it's mostly it's been
a lot of welcomes ago
I have also so the first version of
Cobre I had a lot of tests but they were
they were not very I did not have a good
method about them it's basically someone
reporter Berg we write a test and we fix
it in Co boy - I take what I will get to
it but I take the speck and white test
it takes a lot of time and the
documentation change a lot we will get
to it also
and the final reason why it takes so
long is that it's GTP is already
complicated that http/2 is an muscle so
all these things took some time to
figure out and to build so let's take a
look at the important lessons I learned
when building Caballito first there's
something I want to call it the
tentative name it's active supervisors
so there's often this pattern when you
write our own code you have one process
that tells another process to start the
self process that's your process telling
the supervisor to start a new devices
and to supervise it so this is
everywhere and this doesn't fit well
with what I was trying to build so in so
in http/2 for example you have one
connection and you have many streams
which are request response on that
connection and so we need to handle them
concurrently so we have this process the
connection that has to deal with many of
the processes will the novel way to do
waiting along is to have a supervisor
that we can stop them
but that's a lot more work so instead of
going this in this direction I did
something completely different so does
two solutions if you want to avoid this
middle process that just starts
unsupervised you can have what is
basically a supervisor that can do also
some other things or you can simply have
a process that is mostly doing things or
so supervised so we'll explain what I
mean
so in launch which is got that takes
care of the socket the network below
convoy I want to move to I didn't get
there yet but I want to move to a point
where we are basically a supervisor for
a process which at the same time as it
manages the connection processes also
accept so it's basically we take the
supervisor code with an info callback
for accepting connections and that's not
it so it's intuitively very simple but
OTP doesn't allow this so we have to
build it ourselves so this is something
I want to do I I definitely don't have
time to do it at this point but whenever
lunch two will be released it will come
with this mechanism and other side is
what I was talking about so you have a
connection that needs to start work of
processes and needs to do it efficiently
so you have the connection process the
process that manage the connection also
take care of supervising the children
and that's not actually too difficult
because we only we're basically doing
simple one for one supervisor so we just
spawn the process and listen monitor and
to see that the process you can't really
terminate so it's not a lot of extra
code that really need to be written and
this changes everything because in
cowboy one we had direct access to the
circuit
so if cowboy wasn't doing something you
needed if we needed some info from the
circuit we had it's just they're
incorporated that's not the case anymore
your your code will run into in a
separate process so at least at the time
of the 2.0 release there will be the
will that will probably be some things
you can't do because we have to write
the extra code to do so calculations
like receiving certificate with SSL and
things like this so it gets more
complicated because of these extra
processes but we don't have a choice
anyway with HTTP 2 so the second thing I
want to talk about is list of commands
so it's it's something are as anyone use
the gents datum already it's a new
module in OTP ok 1 2 3 4 5 okay so
instead of of having toppled well when
you written something from the call back
you waiting on the table and in previous
OTP modules you basically only say one
thing I moved to this next item for
example in Jen Statham you can later on
not only that you move to another reason
but you can say I want to
this time I wrote I want to put a
message on top of the mailbox things
like this so you have a list of things
that you tell the behavior to do so
that's a list of commands and that's
something that I like very much and that
I use in the low-level side of Caballito
so here you see a list of free commands
which mean I want to send response 100
which is an intermediate response with
headed I give flow is to tell cowboy
okay I want to read the body from the
district and spawn means I started a PID
please supervise it that's it so this
commands on one after the other
and that's how you can control a cowboy
as you wish
so they are present in cover - they are
present in streamers laws they are
already there we will come to them and I
also want to do something similar for
WebSocket so I won't do this before the
2.0 release to the current interface
will stay anyway for Todd's version -
but I want to add another alternative
interface where you just return the list
of command and state so you it would
work mostly the same but as the
contactor face except currently we have
we return a double reply list of friends
and state and we just remove the reply
and maybe add one or two more comments
as needed
this is necessary because something we
need in habit MQ which is what to get
for n QT t of a WebSocket of stone
Buddha WebSocket is that we need to stop
quitting from the circuit basically
manage how much the client sends us so
we stop quitting from the circuit and
this is something we can't do with cabal
1 and the current version of cowboy - so
these are commands that can be added
later stop quitting temporarily from the
circuit and this this is the interface
of stream handles so it looks perhaps a
little complicated so streaming uploads
are modules that are called
every time there's an event related to a
stream to request or response and they
are called with the idea of the stream
and then the information about what
happened in it is when we receive the
request data when we receive the request
body info when we receive a message you
can send yourself servicing so that's
also where the communication between
this and the process handling the
request happens by default terminate and
earlier is a little special earlier Hoth
is for all the requests that came in but
had an issue before the entire request
headers arrived so that's why in earlier
aureus
partial logic instead of quick because
it may contain nothing it may contain
just the method and personal
so on and so with this interface you can
do a lot of things we will come to it
geison so the third attend I have his
couple callback chains so there was
already a kind of callback chains in
caballo one with middle where they are
modules when functions really that
occurred one after another and in cover
two three models are also sort of called
callback chain and they work differently
so these are all the middleware and
criminals coming with Calvary but COBOL
compress is not enabled by default it's
there but you have to enable it yourself
middleware looks that looks like this so
basically we have an available mount
where we have some values that are
defined when you start when you use
statically and if we do something with
this environment and with the request
and we modify the environment for the
next middleware so that's for example in
the case of water of present layered or
tailored to the environment which module
it needs to call with which state and
that that's very simple three Mohanlal's
are very different so to give you to
situate you stream a lot of much lower
in kaveri they are image very receive
everything immediately middle words are
into the request process so for example
you can do two things with three modules
you can here so let me first explain you
have the cowboy stream module which is
you
to encourage the next three models in in
the list and so in this case we start by
calling the next handlers then we get
the results and we do something with the
results so that's what the compress
scream Allah is doing for example get it
with these results it will check if it's
a response that we got if it's a
response it will decide if it needs to
compress or not and if it's the body it
will compress it on so you can modify
what goes out of Koree and similarly you
can also modify what goes in so in this
case we first do something with the data
we receive we could decompress for
example and then we've already put
towards the on on the following so this
way of doing things is a little little
more complex because you have to keep
track of the state of the next one where
every time but it's a lot more powerful
you can modify the behavior completely
and of course you don't have to change
anything you can also for example
implement access logs like this you will
receive all the events so it's it's up
to you to to decide with what to do the
first pattern is very common in Iran but
yeah I had no better way to to name it
receive loops what they are and in
cowboy we have the if you don't know
receive loops you probably know but in
Kabul you have the recover loop module
which I want to make a lot more useful
than it is today
today you can switch your home left
workable point where I'd ever receive
look for for example sending the body
streaming the body to the client in Co
boy - I want to be able to switch from
restaurant let us through loop handlers
so currently I it's not possible anymore
to stream the body using restaurant
girls with the normal interface you can
still do it manually but in cover - I
want to give the possibility to switch
from rest to go belly up and just go
from one to the other two strings
already and the opposite is also true I
want to be able to read the body a
synchronously so this is something that
won't be incorporated but these are the
things I look forward to doing and yeah
several scent events it's something that
is standard were used so why not have
the loop on girls
well at least other function to format
sort of Santi ones so now we get to the
lighter aspects so I want in Cabo I want
all that look like this everywhere ok
maybe not like this like this so this is
coupled with three values there's two
values that tell the program what the
problem is
so connection arrow means we will close
the connection we can continue it could
be called photographer but that's the
terminology of HTTP to protocol Iago is
a type of arrow
so we know what to send to the parent
and the last part is the most important
because when you have this you look in
the robes you see the problem
immediately so that's very good for the
beginning and this I want to send so in
http/2 when you disconnect the client
you have to send a frame go away it's
very nice and you can put some develop
information so I want to have a debug
mode with which will send all this
information so this is something I
started to do on all my projects and I
hope to see it more often in the future
then we have maps which are really
really great especially for options so
in Kabul we use I use my palette I
switch most of everything to maps so
this is an example function that we
build the UI from the request and you
can provide an optional map which
contain which can contain any parts of
the UI so if you specify for example
different path interruptions then when
Koba rebuilds URI it will give you the
same base of the right press the pasture
species
inspite so you can build a lot of links
like this and this function also is
aware of different types of your eyes if
you provide and define for the host for
example it will give you only your eyes
starting with the bus so it's very
useful to build all kinds of different
you arise and this function read body a
similar we provide requests and options
options always have a default so in this
case we I think the default is to wait
for 5 seconds of 15 seconds maximum and
for 8 megabytes now 1 megabyte maximum
and it's the same but it took this is
this specific example because this
interface changed a lot between k1 and
cowboy to today wit body will always
succeed unless there is a bug in Coburg
even if the socket doesn't send data
fast enough this function will wait on
at least when the period is finished it
will return also of course if it if it
received enough data as much as it asked
and the timeout is there to make sure
that if we don't actually receive the
message containing the body in that time
we will cache it's safe grout by default
it's the period plus 1 second but
normally it will always it will always
return and if you need to control the
rate of the heading of the body you have
to do it separately it's something you
will come to anymore
and this is necessary because not only
because we don't have the socket but
also because cover to change everything
so Wisco if you have a lot of requests
at the same time
to manage flow control to make the ones
you want communists and that can get
tricky so instead this should be a
better start
and so these are specifications of maps
and there are no required values in Koba
but you don't forget you can write specs
with the first symbol instead of the
second if you need require the value
engine and so this syntax for the type
of the maps is why we require OTP 19 in
cowboy it's the only reason I really
wanted to make full use of
dialyzer so I burnt the version
requirement next beta tests or rather
better way to find which test I need
white and to write them so the goal of
copper is to basically implement all the
relevant devices and all those found out
that is mostly active and also to
implement everything in the galaxy so
for every part of the RFC that is at the
world well for every must include
everything that we want to implement
most we have to should we
it's up to the implementation but go by
tones to be strict with its
implementation so we need at least one
test for every sentence indirect C that
says you must do this and that takes a
lot a lot of time because there's a lot
of these sentences in your axis that's
the key alpha ferrite these are these
are fixed
donations so for example the test suite
for http/2 is now at more than 2,000
lines of God and it's not even half yet
and some things you can't really test
you have to sometimes you have some
things you need to test manually or
sometimes you have some things that are
difficult to test they are each case
that are difficult to toggle for example
so in this case is instead of writing a
test I write a big block of commands
saying this part of the earthly section
something I could not implement because
of this in that reason and when you come
back later if there was a bug related
you can see that you do not you did not
forget it and that's why you couldn't
taste it
similarly so that's who that was one
kind of district the test fault or not
the second kind of district is features
for example the Quebec module so I have
one destroyed for the Quebec module one
destroyed for Kabu Kabu study concern
and similarly every combination we have
of functions options and so on needs to
be tested so that's a little more of
difficulty especially for the functions
that I've a lot of options but yeah I
try my best to cover everything and so
for this everything is tested over HTTP
one HTTP to GLS with compression enabled
and so on so when I write one test it
wrong at least eight times
I don't have many unit tests it's useful
sometimes when you write for example
passing function for a header that is a
little complicated because it helps
writing this function but otherwise I
don't rely on them I write features and
the standards test I always want the
testing power L because that shows a lot
of birds they have intermittent issues
and they usually don't show up if you
own one test after another they need to
have some load in the system to appear
and when you want everything in parallel
you see them a lot more fun and a lot
earlier than when you put in production
and everything start failing
I also so I kind of go my own way in
this case I or my test by default and
actually following a an advice sorry an
advice from a kostas taganas I should
not output expected errors so when I
test for levels I silence them there's a
way to hook into a common test to catch
common tests and a holograph to catch
the errors and ignore them if they were
expected so I try to do this and so when
you want a carbureted Suites at least
for the path to that elite being updated
you will not have any output except
actual errors so you can see immediately
what went wrong
and finally all the test case start with
a function doc which documents the case
with all the relevant air it's for the
HTTP two LLC so we have the correct
location of what the test is about for
veterans and this shows in the output
from commands bus in the wrist and in
the test case Peggy
Bethel documented documentation also so
basically I want to buy two of this
amount of documentation okay maybe not
but I want to have at least good
documentation and I went to take lessons
from bhp of all things so I don't know
if you followed along question mailing
list but there was a huge tired about
documentation and so I was talking in
this head about how PHP has a very good
reference manual and so I went and did
what they were doing what is so I have
okay
okay I can't take for some reason
no this one so this is the documentation
for the records manual and this is one
function
so I basically follow what PHP did and
adapted it to along so wit body we have
the name so the name is required only
because I also generate mine pages but
otherwise where the description with
respect it also details about it of the
butcher's the arguments one by one with
full explanation so it own values a
change log which will be a little small
for the time being but if maintained it
can help when you move from one version
to another and examples very important
and that's something I think miss is
missed from a lot of documentation you
know long and finally links to other
relevant functions and modules and in
cover two
everything is documented like this so
for every module every function of the
module you have a spirit page with
examples every function has at least one
example on full text description
that takes a very long time to to make
but it's done yeah so yeah you can have
you can go to the website to get the
documentation you can read the source
files they are text files it's very easy
to it you can generate man pages and
start them on your system it's up to you
so let's go to the most interesting part
for many people it's a question I had
where accurate soca boy 2 is actually
almost finished so my goal for the 2.0
is to stabilize the current interface so
there's a lot of things that I still
want to add but there's no point in
waiting to it so it will be released
disavow probably I didn't put an exact
exact date but pretty sure it will be
released this summer and at least the
first release candidate will be soon
after OTP 20 basically I want to check
that it still works even so I went with
the OTP 20 release candidate already but
yeah I just want to make sure it works
that it works with 19 and 20 and then we
can make a release candidate and yes it
it requires 19 or above and I'm terribly
sorry about this I receive a lot of
tickets about my projects stopping to
work with earlier versions and they will
need two tickets left for 2.0 one is
very simple I actually almost did it
completely yesterday
which is to change multiple traders to
other map instead of lists it's the only
part that wasn't converted to map yet
and the other part is constant so
constants are what you can use when for
example in the voting you much pass
segment into a variable and you can
convert it on the fly make sure it's an
integer for example and convert it and
the thing we need to do like we perhaps
need to do for 2.0 is make sure we can
convert that value back into do the
reverse operation because if we can do
the wave of separation we can do without
sorting and that's something that a lot
of people have been asking for so what I
want to do for 2.0 I'm not going to say
regarding we work directly but I want to
do the changes that will enable Vegas
wedding because they are working changes
cowboy has new user new users rabbitmq
for maybe one year and half so I joined
a bit MQ past time to help them with a
lot of different things and they wanted
to move everything to my project so they
did it works very well but they are on
the first version for the moment we will
it's mostly an issue with a chibi
version requirements they have to
support different versions than the ones
I support so it has to wait zoton ik
which is in another home issues and
cover two and they make good use of
stream controls I have them a little
with this and earlier callback was
implemented songs
their feedback so thank you so tonic and
bile which is a database no sequel
database which is from Benoit who gave a
talk yesterday I walked with him
with a customer it works very well and
it uses Caballito already and so
yesterday I heard from a few people that
they are using Cabaye to in production
already that's not a good idea but it
apparently works very well so okay no
problem
what about so I just go by undoes
everything I do
alongside it cowboy launch as a night
900 date that released yesterday which
is when you start listener you have
valued them except us the member of
Exeter's and there's a lot of confusion
about this value so I now hide it by
default the odd functions are deprecated
they are still left on a single bike
they are deprecated and the
documentation doesn't mention this
anymore garden which is which was
created as testing client for cowboy
we'll get to the first version the
stable version written similarly it has
been used in production by some
companies for a long time
for example Simone if you have heard of
it which are linking different instant
messaging services together the is gone
for speaking to the different platforms
Kali is the library that contains all
the passing code that copper uses so all
the idols also get the same cookies and
so on it's
going to be released as 2.0 at the same
time my strawberry but probably won't be
documented at all so there's no public
interface yet my goal is to document
everything because there's a lot of
functions that are useful they are not
only when you use go by but also when
you write another project along MK the
build system is going very well it's
been adopted by a Abbott mq before I
arrived there I was quite pleased with
the decision it works very well I fix
things maybe once every two months it's
a very very slow development because
simply does no there's very little
issues with it I know it is
and finally looking-glass
so Looking Glass is a new project I
never spoke about it before probably not
even on Twitter in the course of helping
orbiting pew we needed a project to
profile a beat'em pew as a whole and we
looked into the different profiles so
you have a lot of profiler that use the
dbg interface for tracing which are not
very performant because dbg makes every
single tool one process and so that
using this you start to profile the the
tracer on orbit thank you
you start hammering as a bit improve and
you see 100 requests per second is not
very good instead of 50,000 so in OTP 19
Lucas added the old tracer module while
also nice witch
basically we implement functions in C
that allow you to decide what you want
to keep from the tray segments and what
to do with them so you can send them to
one process like the division interface
you're doing or you can send them to a
pool of processes and such you can drop
some if you don't need them and so on so
that's what we are doing with leukemias
and the idea is that we place first and
then we profile the traces that we saved
on disk and so for saving on disk we
need to be as efficient as possible
because it's a lot of events or be time
to regenerate a lot of things so we use
a zero I had to write also an if for the
default format there was already one but
to load over for what we needed and then
when you profile you get clunky oh gosh
crank file so I should probably have
taken a screenshot I can show you if you
if you want and it's it's it's very very
fast instead of well we can handle about
50% of the original requests when
running on the same machine so that's
with all the writing on disk when I
didn't try it yet when running on a
separate machine when running when
saving to file on a separate machine but
I expect it to be much faster so yeah
you can look into it we just added the
license and reg me files you can use
them you can use it and one last thing
this is important in the context of
cowboy too because looking glass' can
use color batch containing
specifications for what you
to trace and which processes which
modules which function and soon and
cowboy - maybe not 2.0 but very soon it
will come with these callbacks so you
can just use looking-glass point it to
the correct function to get specific
insurance and then you will get all the
traces for the go by processes without
having to look inside cooperative so of
course there will be more versions of
cowboy but we will stay on version 2 for
I think a long time but at least a year
maybe two now that I am very happy with
cowboy - the way it turns out now so I'm
not looking into changing everything
again
but there are some fatal skirt that we
need to add back there are I want to add
some more videos like server-sent events
when I'm not happy with something I will
keep the backward compatibility for for
the moment I like for example changes I
want to do in WebSockets you will be
able to keep the current code working
until we release until it's deprecated
properly and removed which will be in a
long time yeah so there will be of
course
kobori but it won't be for for quite
awhile don't worry
and so after I'm finished with Kober - I
want to go back to the topic of heist if
you were in the torque from about goth
girl yesterday
yeah I'm just bail munch and me I'm a
big fan of West
I'm very sad that nobody is doing it
properly almost nobody I know a couple
maybe two or three cases where they do
respitory
but you know outside the boys are I mean
and so I want to build a framework that
allows you to other proper REST API
formula without a way to deal with the
complexities of implementing properly
and this is exciting to me because then
you can only you don't need to update
the clients once you're done you just
update the server to sell different
things and as long as the client knows
what you are talking about if it knows
if you have other clients or forums and
it knows about posts you can add
informations to to the post and you
don't have to change anything and that's
it
so one last comment so I have been in
the past two years I have lost almost
all my sponsors due to value the various
reasons
people changing jobs companies stopping
pivoting and so on so I would like to
try some code funding so if you go to my
website intermedia you will see two
links there's two ways to help me
finance the work I do which is either
the usual record fund you can give the
equivalent of a beer every month for
example I don't drink so I can use this
money for bit of things or you can buy
the book I'm currently writing which
covers a lot of tips about writing along
projects so thank you in advance and
if you have any questions please ask
I'll let you are hungry I never have
questions yeah these are crystal clear
yeah like you thing you're going to use
the thing in Gen Stadium where you put
actions back into the loop will let not
make it difficult to test certain things
now we not it they are not the same
elements we want at the command where we
protections back in the in the mailboxes
that's what what you mean there's no
they are commands are related
specifically to HTTP so sending the
response sending swimming the body
asking for more body and so on you can
also go to a new protocol you can do
anything you need between strictly HTTP
and a little supervision with spawning
processes and the other question yeah
do you already have any performance
burnt parts I have absolutely not looked
at the performance yet someone did and
apparently it's the same performance as
far as the Wi-Fi http/1 it's the same
performance as far as criminals are
concerned the Delta little extra latency
when you go from one process to another
this I'm not sure I can do a lot about
it because we the future is not HTTP one
it's HTTP 2 so we have to have an
architecture that can deal with HTTP to
HTTPS we'll take a hit in performance
necessary all right thanks again thank
you
