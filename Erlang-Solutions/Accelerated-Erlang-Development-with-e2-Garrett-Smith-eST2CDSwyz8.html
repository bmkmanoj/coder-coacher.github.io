economies and we really expensive use of
our land and this is a something I came
out of both my experience there as well
as experiences teaching airline
controlling camp before you know are
just quickly so fulfilled by our thang
bachelor for that like wild shindig last
night I was fantastic I've been the best
like that but usually not associated
OpenSocial analogies there's not really
really awesome and have a fantastic time
at that at that event there was a
gentleman from joint and he is open to
the point x yes I won't be quiet and
gave bash ate alone well was worth a
glaze and and he said as pretty as he
said there are developers out there who
like to solve easy problems that's me
and in just like he laughed or people
people around me laughing I thought I
actually not very serious I actually
like to solve easy problems I hate heart
melts her home so awful these problems
are good so anyway I went to further
elaborate the daughters who really had
the vision for solving hard problems
like mashing those are the special
developers and I felt a little bad
because I absolutely don't like her
one of those those other developers out
there so felt a little bit bad both of
the bar that helped a better bomb so
even proceeded and and I think things
closed up around eleven-thirty most a
little to release of course trapped into
the bar and continued about it all along
thinking back in my head you know I
should have a really big problem solve
and the background of that problem is
hotel room man tell so I vote for this
event I decided to use hotwire cars that
sort of gamble a little bit you think a
region a circle rating and you get the
hotel they pay for your pre pay for it
so like it's kind of fun I like it used
before and so I picked the region and I
got a hotel that was three blocks with
many like this is awesome we're not
going to say oh nice nice room good
price through possible thing is
fantastic so I get here on Wednesday why
are my suitcase and here is three-block
stretch so in a middle of an urban
central amount on the side of the
mountain to put my three blocks so I'm
going off this hill and I fully
appreciate how damn still is and as
you're drinking and drinking
I'm thinking myself this is really going
to be a very hard problem for me of
course one of the milestones of drinkage
images you are challenged with walking
where's the technique that I knew is
when i get to that one it's very
physical it's very basic form of walking
just leaning forward and it beats ain't
will catch you as you want a little bit
it's called tumblelog you might not use
it effectively you can walk miles some
were walking but you can't do that when
he'll I knew that last night and I
thought this is going to get hurt from
so is this stretch and I'm just like you
know what I like easy solutions easy
problems understanding account and he's
going to drive it in top of the co
that's going to be it within the
gentleman join his words broke my head
under leaning over I'm on the stash away
start optima solve this problem to look
at the hell I said this is an
insurmountable problems problems too
hard for me I simply have not voted off
this field is impossible to track I am
elevator something so let's try to make
this easily break this into three
segments three blocks each one is
progressively super true to four or five
and i'm just going to take this problem
rating the 3 i'm going to worry about
the third one the sea mist was the most
horrifying 1 i'm just going to take the
first one in front of me which is
somewhat reasonable it's still though
it's still a bit of an abstraction for
me to get here to the end of that block
in mitran state to munching problem so I
took that home and reduced
we're finding out true so I'm just going
to start to walk going to focus on walk
you think may think i'm kidding is
literally Rosie this is how I get up to
the hill to sleep and not collapse in
the gutter the starter step and I said
that this young really conservative I'm
not going to take I'm not going to go
fast I'm really slow and conserve my
energy because I need to this is my
process is it my simple line of sight
problem solving and I got to the next
stage and that big probably kind of
slightly less did the same thing I got
up and this is a slightly steeper
stretch so I started to like my cardiac
issues relating to happen and I get up
to the top of that and a couple of
people who are just as needed as I have
a potent worship couple of young women
chemo and I stopped and they genuinely
asked if i was doing okay what are you
okay I'm fine I'm Elena gopher I
Britain's calm down there this is not
that big of a problem because now i just
have answered well i'm going to make
this i'm going to do this and said you
know we believe you we believe it you're
gonna do now is encouraged by so this is
the stretch is really cheap but this
does not do it justice it's like creates
like a ski slope it finally gets the top
I find that side and here is my view I
accomplish this impossible problem I
went
from impossible to the possible by
simply reducing so be taking the hard
problem of reducing it to a series of
small problems lets you can execute line
of sight can actually execute simple
goals heart phones and you might be
might ask around are being so sort of a
hopelessly naive approach problem
solving how do you take impossible
difficult to define abstract problems
and simply reduce them to these
primitives and expect to really get
anything over a complexity you don't see
that in architecture you don't see if I
so far there's generally very high level
abstract solutions is never in building
incrementally very rarely building
infinitely but then again I look I look
at the set of thing and you see when was
magnificent and breathtaking
architectures that you'll ever see in a
single cell rooms and no point this
organism ever have the single huge
problem to solve if only had a trivial
simple line of sight stumble types of
problems gravity take me forward to e
forward and your instincts your reflexes
catching along the way line of sight
trivial problems can indeed manifest as
fantastic solutions so that brings me to
why I heart Erlang so very much I hard
it I hard to get a lot on fan
I'm almost a fanatic view at all because
I don't like to be a fanatic but but
anything really i really like rolling a
lot i like it because it helps under
store it helps me easy this process of
taking complex problems and boiling them
down to simple it's very easy to see in
your code or architecture in your design
where it is too complicated trying to
solve too many big problems and it gives
you some nice tools and patterns and
axioms of both components to do this
type of drunk walk stumble walk up the
hill you find the god oh my god so a
harder line and i want others to heart
Berlin I think you guys don't we all
hearted very well but I want more people
to heart because I think that this sort
of is a dau of problem solving and
software that we just don't see in we
just don't see it as tragic we don't see
experimentation their little bell to
prove things we don't see gradual
iteration you don't see a discipline of
reducing problems so that they are
completely trivial and obvious all but
enter lengthy do you see that a lot and
i'd like more people to enjoy that
benefit it's important so there are some
problems with every it's not his syntax
I think that you can get through to
change without turning stone that's been
aight a little bit too much if you look
at some of the core components of
Overlander particulars of the OTP
architecture there's a lot of moving
parts there and my experience and we're
people to help them learn OTP early how
to use it when it is filming small
blocks is ok I finally kind of sorely at
my head around all new concepts I'm not
sure how how come together and I think
that that is a problem we can solve it's
definitely a problem it's barrier that
doesn't need and I would like to work to
try to remove ever reduce it so that
more people can heart early so that were
you indeed e two goals as I just said it
was really to help that people use our
life it's not too certain that you go
around or create something new simply to
enable because you use what's already
there one of the easy low hanging fruits
one of those line of sight problems is
just totally brain hobbies is let's get
rid of some little boy look like let's
remove some of the noise and see what
I'm talking about what interests you
mind telling me just what is it done I'm
sorry
okay so we'll quickly interloop so we'll
go take care of that simplify the api's
of something can be made more simple
with made simple you see a counterpoint
to that minute and then just as
important 15 so just support is to take
the components and present them a way
that people can use to solve their
application problems concept like jam
server Jen fsm are are certainly
understandable but then the question is
how do i use it how do i use this to
build something and that's not always an
obvious answer if you're if you're new
to to OTP ok some non rules i want to
avoid having to change for safe change I
want this library to reflect our leg not
library so as people learn and
understand through this to the library
closer to our line there may be some
changes there may be some different
spins on things but really want I don't
want to change any more than need be
undermining OTP is along that line I'm
out of Italy syntax is hideous take that
people use it in a hideous way a lot of
times but there's nothing inherently
wrong with the syntax of early leads to
change so Ravin see press transforms or
other things that try offload and
address that problem just in my opinion
simply is not a problem and then just as
a matter of principle i think it's
consistent with your Liang Dao the
design tradition to avoid magic that is
avoid things that are in backward
our protégés surprising and Ryan
fantastic disciplined language in that
respect so we want to keep that
tradition okay the status of me too um
it's very useful today I would call a
feature complete insert in the phase
where features are in place it's very
stable they don't know the cases that
may not meet requirements but we were
running at that cloud in production and
it's there's been no issues at all so
I'm very happy with it in his current
state we'll talk about through the next
steps in a little bit but I think today
you can pick it up and make good use of
it okay so in in e2 I take the concept
of the bitterly process break it into
two process types services and tasks so
service is basically Jennifer you
started it's a process in waits for
messages and then replies I reinsurance
service because James Stewart cryptic
and services of contrast to text and
i'll show you how tasks and service is
why i miss those terms task something
that starts and is expected to run in
iran right away it may be deferred it
may repeat itself but it's something
when you start is expected to at some
point one so it's not going to
necessarily wait it typically wouldn't
wait for something to trigger it we just
don't want to actively so i'm very
confident pneus unconfident in this
approaching and breaking things down
between services and tasks because all
this often the world today runs on
operating systems that have these to
come primitives services amount to
system demons they run at startup when
the OS boots and they say they're having
to do things they run strong messages
but that are supposed to be there as
services facilities an example sir
service or demonize an operating system
will be matched and of course we know
that early is designed as an operating
system for your code so we can sit in
right of action when it as a service
assistant demon the other two processes
run on computers on operating systems
are these jobs and you go and run shell
and you type of command and run
something you're asking you're executing
I ad hoc job is typically long through
drawn or a scheduler or something also
job starts up and runs to completion you
might repeat it you might defer it
scheduling opponent but it's one of
those active things that's it that's the
way all software is managing one in the
world and I confident that we can do
anything with these two primitives and
its really don't change its they're both
answers they're just concepts that allow
a developer to start thinking about
software construction to service a great
utility but it doesn't help to cues as
to how to use something by mapping these
concepts into the role the operating
system I think we're going to give
people a better chance at assembling the
system where they need to build a girl
developing applications and early as a
matter of developing systems it's the
same process is going to operating
systems servers and installing apache my
sequel configuring them right the anit
sequence that you use when you start
mirrors DNA sequence of personal races
so I want that to come out I think that
is a hidden gem that needs to be talked
about more and using eat ooh people will
be automatically put into this realm of
services and tasks
ok sit here
so let's take a look at some code
comparisons here's a gin server this is
the boilerplate contract sorry this is a
template that comes from the ax BX mode
would be nice i simplified it a little
bit but you can see here if you were a
new user and just looking at this for
the first time you might had a lot of
questions we have a search to explain
this is what this is the different
handles these are message handling
terminating no change etc there's a lot
to sort of get people to head around
before they even start to code the
correlator certain minimal skeleton
coordinate of service which is the
analog to it Jenn Suhr generate is this
most of the boilerplate is really oily
most of sort of a distracting noise is
kind of up in the export Simba and the
I've lived left the barrier on the the
behavior declaration out was it called
exports that could be combined into one
etc but we loaded the code it was very
straightforward and you started an
uninhabited message so in e to the three
functions handled info cattle cast and
health or consolidated to one function
called handle message and now that it
works out quite well it's analogous to
the message loop program you first start
to learn Earthlings one place to go put
your handlers so you're not written up
based on the way
the message was sent it should be a hand
a hamlet logic independent of how a
message was delivered so that's a very
simple I think way to say handle
messages you've started crosses its
learning processes receive messages
handle the message that's a service and
in fact that mirrors answer asleep ever
see it's something that starts up and
runs and handles the message services by
definition our software the ones behind
some protocol writing that protocol
provides a intermediary stage and you
basically respond call respond to calls
from the outside world so now we're
seeing so very very trivially
architectural reflected in her life so
let me point out this is a gesture this
is running pure gin server code is just
a layer on top of gin server you have
additional function overheads to map the
inbound gen server to this list later
that's one function call so you get a
much cleaner i think abstraction to work
with at minimal performance cost and to
deliver new developers i think this is
valuable performance of not the main
concern especially the overhead making
single function call okay so that's the
service here's a service within it the
idea here is that we take a very basic
svelte and we can incrementally act we
don't have to get everything at once if
you don't need an initialization
sequence and that is it said you don't
need to perform something it within the
context of your of your process of a
circle process you just have to stay
right here so that comes up but this
there's not a lot of our cases where
you're casting might be poor value might
be something else and just want to pass
it through there's no reason to have an
it but of course we want to perform any
non-trivial functional phone init
function
knit all that because that executing the
context of the process and that's good
it protects the caller from any crashes
so what kind of if he wants so we have
here and in addition incremental e ad so
now starting were loaded Lola Jensen
okay now you can also add Germany if
you're interested in handle determinate
you just add the traffic that is handled
so that they call the common problem
you're trying to figure out how to get
that thing that it called this is just
takes care of it and and you can
actually overlap that traffic if you
want to but most pieces you want because
you want to solve okay so that was a
service i'm going to start to shift over
to tasks there is a very common pattern
in early which is you anything you want
to start something right away process
that you want to start so you know the
thread you have run its wrongs right
away and when you're doing spawn your
loop don't gen server it starts anyway
from messages so if you want to run
right away you obviously can't do it in
it because that's going to block the
caller let's start with the circle you
use this trick not many people know
about it you can say you saw the message
of here
the more thorough correct way is to
return 0 not very intuitive so that will
be this is going to cause a janitor to
send time out before it handles or
before it's not even message dispatch
it's a direct call but it's within its
after the caller has returned so it
allows you to do your work as soon as
you can this is course a horrible
interface it's a hack it just simply
have to try to explain this I'm going to
just explain it to you try to explain
that something's just starting out early
like is it this language is not very
nice style like this language I don't
blame them if they're just starting my
best appoint they might not have the
tolerance push through to get all the
benefits this is to recognize that this
isn't that bad but when you're
struggling out it feels really bad so
here e to task so you started and then
the override single function called
handle task there's no you don't even
have to respond to a message in this
case because now there's no message to
handle you're just won't try of course
you can add handle message because you
might need to interact with the world
outside of your your own state you can
repeat here you can delay then this will
show you some examples of that but when
you say hey if you have a task that you
need to run I mean it needs to do
something start and finish just use a
task super simple so here's a variant of
task that release every five seconds and
again very them the spirit of Cubs
incremental improvement we started with
no options here and then we add them as
we need to they're not asking you to
provide more than he or she needs to
provide initial so let me to say when
you start I want to repeat every five
seconds and then down here if you want
you could stop if you wanted to you
could simply wait for messages if you
want to repeat which is being a little
handle task again you call this very
simple so what will happen here is it
will wait five seconds oh wait five
seconds I'll make sure it's all back at
five five second interval since a little
bit it's not just asleep so here is a
task start of initial delay so you can
say delay you can also add a min or if I
have an example of the net no I don't
you could alternatively if you need to
do your initialization and have to get
that value someplace you could pull me
to that option implementer in it and in
return the timings the delay in repeat
in response to along with your state so
that that use case is accommodated okay
supervisor so this is this is also known
as just a complete I mean I don't lose
any controversy about the native taking
this and helping people to understand
what the hell is going on yeah I'm not
going to spend a lot of times trying to
explain why that's not the best
interface for somebody is starting out
so this is the equivalency realizer and
to you simply have hello so what are we
going to do ninety-nine percent it's not
starting publicly you're always doing
something along so the default of course
is struggling actual argument list of
courses nebulous there are some other
decisions that are made but those are
the fault they're sensible defaults
those are all documented and then you
can override them so if we want to
override them with some options let's
say we want to make this temporary but
faults permanent typically what you want
start something up you want to make sure
it's wrong until you explicitly or you
go
so that's a baited with the default
available so it happens to be permanent
in this case so who want to be temporary
space like a restart of temporary there
as an option ever safe we 100
milliseconds for sharp at the default or
shutdown is brutal kill I need to debate
that passivity the argument that has
been made to me and I tend to buy it as
shop brewco deterministic Wells
milliseconds is not you can have
bubbling up effects etc if you use these
timings not wisely the booboo kills the
state might not be the most pleasant but
it's the safest and probably the best
defensible default so there in lies
another value which is we can sort of
figure out for new users what the best
defaults are and they don't need to
worry about them until they actually
need to worry about them so we can
collaborate and say what's the best of
all what's the most sensible one it's
maybe the ones that are that are now
need to be changed but whatever they are
they should do there so people don't
have to worry about them up front more
examples of different argument also
exist here or any pass arguments so
we're not gonna that the goal is not to
take functionality away from Jenna
server if you can do engines or you have
to be a litany to if you can't we'll
change that if the goal is to meet it's
easy to start as possible but that
everything that are after is also
possible so supervisor of some different
option so you get the idea now here's
another sort of human hit an issue with
early and that is the behavioral
difference between a simple one for one
and other via the other
oh jeez simple one for walking buried or
a different beast and unfortunately it's
just reflected in this one little Adam
difference you use a simple one for one
when you watch basically fire-and-forget
you want auto collect your children so
children stop saying it why don't I
haven't moved the other strategies don't
have that characteristic I thought
that's that's too implicit for me when I
discovered it was like a unique a moment
this shouldn't be a really good moment
it should be something that's described
up front it's a very common habit to
start children and for that that's one
of the best patterns you could possibly
have that beautiful application could do
that that'd be perfect awesome don't
want to keep track of things if you
don't have to so a test supervisor is a
simple one for one that is designed it
just is a simple one for one that works
with tasks so just someone syntactic
should not syntactic sure but it's for
epi conveniences to use the correct
supervisor for tasks and it's this easy
oh this is bad this isn't this is
bottled let me see what's going on here
I've been seen on hissing slider so the
dassault here is remove this not just a
mess the slightest mess I didn't do it
last so much longer there are examples
on the website so I apologize for that
but the idea here is that you started
easily pass in the model of the start
spec for for the child and then you just
call start task okay so though it's an
easy hassle isn't it that's sort of the
core that's sort of the core above of me
too and it's just a sort of summarize
what's going on there how are we listen
somebody's never use your leg I don't
care about teaching the syntax that much
I don't care about Adams pick this up
actually I want to talk about how they
resolve those big problems like going up
that big steep hill and I want to be
able to say hey look here's an example
of some rain home you have let's break
things now and give them some primitives
that our service totally obvious and
straight for that they can use to build
their solution I have done so yet but I
think hope if it's successful this
experiment works people will get excited
because they can solve hard problems
using very simple direct line of sight
solutions and it's all or like this is
just a way to help them to sort of use
more easily so in that same spirit or
sell a lot of facilities that help
common problems and this is a starting
point this will probably evolved a
little bit but what's that are currently
some logs of wood I bothers you may have
to say they are all otter under colon
info report it just bothers me you know
I've been meeting some people like what
would this in error that remember it's
an error logger why is it here i'm
logging in a phone message like that
just to me is like I just can't get over
that so those a long service is also
long to tighten and if you know so e to
log is just a nice short way to info you
know there is sort of sensible API I
just think that are a very hidden a mere
report is using a book report but the
model air roll over so it's using that
right I'm not trying to come in early
i'll say well i'm going to improve early
i'm not that i'm not that skilled i can
simple it because i'm kind of
stupid only if i can understand this and
it's probably fine but i'm not changing
anything i'm just sitting them later on
top of the stuff so it's a little bit
less owner it so difficult to get
started with custom log e is a little
bit difficult so if you want to load a
custom
handler relay it's a little difficult
it's not terrible but let's just try to
make it easier so it's an example of a
syslog law basically behavior and all
you have to do is handle one event we
have sort of in it functionality that
you would expect with Jenna source file
API but you're having 11 civil and you
don't have all the other trappings if
you lose some functionality is there
some data that that's getting lost but I
think for most of these cases is going
to work if you don't this doesn't work
you can always go to the agenda that
facility kind of air longer it's another
common issue is validation is truly fail
eff acid ignore error validating user
input and everything what kind of work
but your error users will get terrible
messages you know things that are
crashing with sort of but elated
problems would be good if you could
provide a good validation in the client
facing functions and a better easier way
to validate property lists you can see
that property lists are used extensively
in any too and i like to use them jones
it's a compaq how to requires like when
you get out that early paschal arguments
and you have options when your arguments
are required and your options are these
things that followed the same thing in
API design you can say function absolute
drop-dead required and then a list of
options they're very very in a great
deal of OTP you're like early what you
could use is that today a great deal is
not or e2 as a full design principle
uses it so in that there's a facility
there's a there's an OT n drop which
will allow you to define scheme say
something like this here's my schema is
a name
these are named property list so this is
the property strategy the legal values
in this case are listed that are
commemorated here there's a simplicity
which if you need something maybe simply
this one things about having it
specified as a as a strategy it'll be
applied any also those different things
you have called a function so it's a
little scheme is not as I meant to be a
big it's just a little thing that allows
you to do quick validation so if you
should seasonably take the scheme you
say et la peli here's my list provided
by the user here's the scheme if it
works you're going to get this structure
path which is ok odds and then you just
need your values from that so the
default values or property values are
missing the defaults are provided within
those little values out well this is a
valence and properties at this point if
it isn't if the if the input was invalid
you'll get an exception with some
descriptor you missing this this is
required back type that's one thing so
it's a nice little facility to help
users do more validating up front of
their other messages without this it's
actually a cody gets very very lady with
validation logic and gets it gets hard
ok so the the plan the plan improvements
aren't there's not much in my goal for
this is keep it small you know I have a
big sort of dependency fanatic in terms
of having the tendencies I hate hand
libraries but I'll need them I'm much of
leadership right you know the little
missing piece of functionality and use
that so if this becomes a big framework
then it's it's it's going off the rails
it needs to be small and trivial people
need to feel comfortable
and putting this into the project and
not feel like they're bringing in some
big heavy frame work with a lot of level
of dependency so there's no other
dependencies on it and it's small I want
to keep it that way so there's not a lot
fruit mostly my sort of interest right
now is to just help satisfy developing
these cases so tutorials examples like
how do I build up how do I in bed how do
i do about I mean my current it intro
tutorial is how to build a database ER
because they didn't want to battery with
this Web Apps database servers are one
of those big high had you know hill
climbing exercises that if you break it
down into small steps trivial solutions
too obvious problems that's not that bad
not that hard and that tutorial
illustrates that's only more things like
that help people solve particular
problems how do I monitor something it's
a very common problem or a good poem
furling how I do this so that's that
will get filled in so ideally you know
either you could go and learn something
that I'm assuming people in this room
are very comfortable with their the
patterns of development they use but you
may be working with people who want to
use it i am interested in and you just
know it's going to be hard for you to
sort of transfer all that knowledge but
this is a facility of tools that that
will help you please use that and the
more use cases and more examples and the
more we can find the target users
experience simplify that experience I
think we're going to get some more
developers I think we're going to see
more product sold out that's that's
really what I'd like to see there's this
in functionality that needs to be but
it's but it's quite minor so here's
possible things sort of implies what
it's not there there's some gems
too it's like for all out there I bumped
into one of the infamous Jenna server
tues there are good reasons for the
agenda or tues I'm not exactly sure what
they are but I know other people use
rationale that a different ways to clone
messages off the cute there may be some
options that we could throw into our
list to say hey Cole blesses messages
off this way so it's always you know II
to service and there's some behavioral
change and then maybe one of the covers
there's a gem server to or some other
you know Jenna server very that's
actually used but that's an important
some something that people can feel as
important we'll get that in there little
registrations are not in there don't
that I don't use distributed early and
that's a sort of personal philosophy and
I understand that it not at all going to
ultimately fly so i'm pretty sure local
registrations going to have to land in
this at some point because i don't use
it I don't want to put it in and say oh
it's in there I'd like to work with
somebody and make sure that it really
really works well so you know things
interested in collaborating and helping
out on the doors widely I also don't use
jamfest a lot of people do it's a
complete court under what they what they
were drawn so that's almost certainly no
man somehow I'm not sure I better just
don't use it I don't feel comfortable so
solving a problem because I don't
understand it so again if you have that
need to say to be great if we can do
this and then we're together to try to
make a really drop that simple approach
for somebody things like work rules
other kind of high-level abstractions
that are common but aren't available
in OTP I did not even talk about
publisher I don't think I did I love
that app there's a pub so polish
subscribe facility in any team which is
an ability very common pattern to
provide extensible functionality so you
have a broker you can receive messages
when you write them in and dispatches it
out to two handlers so if you want in
your application to make something
extensible you can do it and it's
different from janet event it's not
performance considerations its security
isolation consideration so a broker all
the listeners are they're not functions
that are running on the same process as
the broker they are separate so if they
crash they can just be restarted and
handled so that's a facility that's amet
that's an example of something that
probably ought to be someplace in the
early early low-level ecosystem that's
so calm such a common pattern and easy
to do in our line so things like that
and work with pools might be another
just not to get to turn this into a big
fancy framework again but just little
things little point solutions you know
it was cheap rock I think it's got a
land in here somehow so people can
publish getit istics and information
about their processes without having to
be pulled those are patterns are really
important so that type of thing probably
land down the road I think 0nq is a is a
really good fit for our line in terms of
actual like non distributed vote early
so that's another thing that's out there
ladies an idea that sort of where we're
at today and the thinking down the road
okay and then you know you want to start
it's everything is on that website so
it's easy to go and get everything so
that I'm done and hold it up for
questions questions yes so the question
is why would I use OTP and the idea of
stone up also there's two things number
one I can't just not smart enough I
wouldn't be able to do number two this
is extremely robust tested functionality
it's like the heart and soul of so many
production systems that are working for
so long why wouldn't you want to use it
these are features you know this the
interface to these may be troublesome
but the function the underlying delivery
the ability to you know operate is is to
completely proven so I want to celebrate
and use that make it easier
it's a good example for the genocide how
your question translates to the
microphone so i'll repeat is the
question in some of the slides i have
made it behavioral declaration so the
behavior is just a compiler warning i
use it to also signal things it helps to
signal content and design uh something I
did omit them from for some of the
slides probably hide it from by mistake
or to save space but I think in the
first example i'm in a minute i'm not
sure it possibly to to save space but
out which i forgot so there is a acid
all he has all of all of the e2e to task
e 20 they're all behaviors so you know
they're just an extension of the of
whatever you know Jenna strip really so
you know so that in terms of what's a
behavior how do i use this I mean it's
the same experience you just have less
implement you have less to deal with up
front then different interfaces for
starting and configuring things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
