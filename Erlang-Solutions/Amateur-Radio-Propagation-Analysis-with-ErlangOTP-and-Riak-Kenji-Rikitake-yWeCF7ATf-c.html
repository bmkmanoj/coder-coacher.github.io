I didn't realize this is going to be a
streaming movie stream so I'm nervous
but anyway good morning everybody my
name is Kendrick stocky and today I'm
going to talk about the ham radio and
how ham radio get data would be true and
would be processed with our product
react so the title is called amateur
radio propagation analysis with on tpn
react and these are my call signs you
don't know what the cosine is whatever
but these are at the national or
international identifier or my ham radio
stations so first of all if you if you
don't have time just stick it out check
the this executive summaries um I'm
going to talk about the how amateur
radio has turned to be sort of sensor
networks every station could be a sensor
sensing others their radio stations
transmissions and those reports are
gathered into a hub a big hub somewhere
in the world and it will be a part of a
big data archives so when you transmit
something on the ham radio you're you
have to be very careful young you have
been warned and I'm I'm just it's it's
not it's still less than two months from
when I started working for keeping bash
shell so this is sort of this is a
training exercise report of some sort of
a big data with our product of of course
react and a new search engine called
Yokozuna and my conclusion about the
this experiment is that reality of
kaduna fits very well for data analysis
this is a sort of obvious conclusion but
then you if you if you doubt about this
just try it Yokozuna can be built pretty
pretty easily from the normal reaction
github repo so and if you have
experience with attached this routine or
solar search engines you got to be more
easier
okay first of all let's talk about what
the amateur radio is amateur radio on
the FCC rules in the in the American law
I'm going to talk about the American law
though the in jab in Japan there will be
a different different rules Lulu set of
law would be applied in America amateur
radio is define us a radio communication
service for the purpose of self training
into communication and technical
investigations carried out by amateur
status do reauthorized persons
interested in radio technique so league
with a personal amen without pecuniary
interest this is a so big word so I'm
going to watch this you can transmit
signals when you pass ham radios exams
in certain frequencies you can build
your own transmitters you can build you
can erect your own antenna and you can
communicate with saying the people are
other amateur radio stations but two
important thing one number one you can't
do any business you cannot talk about
money over there if you are doing
business on amateur radio you're right
sins will be revoked and the UUP file UV
on the under you'll be fined from FCC in
the United States and the second one is
that you have no privacy absolutely new
privacy on amateur radio so what you're
transmitting or amateur radio will be
recorded were used or abused or even
even rebroadcast it or use what whatever
in any form so let me talk about the
historical perspective an amateur radio
hams role in technology yeah hams um
they do loves chatting and the only
thing they do on the air are chatting
chatting was most cold chatting with
computers or chatting with microphones
and on the airwaves there there are the
exterior ancestor i should say the
ancestor of online chatting culture and
the good thing about amateur radio is
that amateur radio is open for everyone
you don't have to have any certain kind
of certificate before taking the exams
around radio so there are lots of
ordinary people have joined the answer
rated community
in the United States there are
approximately about 700,000 or even more
how much radio stations station call
signs are licensed and there's a code
called most cold it's it's it's a very
primitive type of the digital signal
like when you say ABC is you say it dee
da dee da is a da dee dee dee is B and
da dee da dee is C then these are the
originals that I I say the original
digital because the it's invented in
more than 100 years ago and it's still
used not for the professional
communications anymore because all the
semen now use more sophisticated systems
but in still it's still being used in
the military and and of course it's
still being used in amateurs and amateur
radio has prayed a row or grandma's
emergency backup communication and there
are a lot of volunteers nation attrition
nationwide in in this country United
States and there will be some in Japan
but the I I find the most active country
about the emergency communication is in
the United States and amateur radio has
contributed a lot for disseminating
electrical and electronic technologies
to the general public for example as
yesterday I got the tutorial from their
own factory from the own solutions amuro
and he told he told us about the
raspberry pi and that kind of thing were
previously done by ham radio communities
and some hams in the united states are
now interested in arduino or maybe some
of them are already chattering into
raspberry pi or maybe all right and
hundred you off so the ancestor of nerds
and geeks and ET see these cultures see
what see this is a german amateur radio
QSL card crystal called stands for card
of confirmation or the greeting card
that to prove that you and
get contact with each other in a certain
timing on the second certain timing and
and you will don't you will not
immediately understand what these people
are doing with these strange type of
equipments these equipments are actually
radio transmitters and receivers and
this is me of a little fatter than now
it for 2004 and I I want to do took a
picture look like this and these are my
equipments actually I had Telegraph key
and radio transmitters device and other
gadgets like this and with my Japanese
call sign here so this culture amateur
radio has the same virtual same culture
although the 11 sad thing I got to
reveal is that the year the community is
aging so higher than than the hour our
culture and our culture of the
developers ok back to the explanation I
want to radio I rpd really told you
amateur radio has no privacy on there
are some examples about you all in the
United States first of all you must
identify the cosine at least every ten
minutes or well at the end of the
communication when you say goodbye you
have to identify that this is your m6
this is november six Bravo Delta x-ray
or something like that so you can't be
anonymous and maybe somebody in FCC will
be listening to your traffic your Wyatt
at your your wiretaps as default and
your mailing address is open open in the
FCC's database every licensee in the
united states including me and other
other other amateurs are their mailing
addresses mailing addresses are open
even though even if there are P or box
address or some recent residential
address they open so you can't hide it
so if you if you if you do something
something brave and under your call sign
you used to
be careful somebody else will locate you
and do do do you something very bad to
you okay and the thing is that this law
of the forty-seven code of federal
regulation number six or five section a
it says that the contents transmitted
Arbor amateur radio is not protected by
any law so um this can we use this
course and analyze for any purposes by
any means by anybody so this this
discount by this characteristic or you
can use direct on the information got
together from the amateur radio for data
a very training a good way to training
data of the data I'm sorry trying to
training data for the data analysis so
there are many kind of contents I'm
going to introduce to you from now but
before that let me tell me about the how
air waves propagate I mean short for
example the shelf life shortwave does
not necessarily directly propagate from
this internal to this antenna it will go
up into the air and will be refracted to
via through the ionosphere and bending
back to the ground like this so by this
characteristic you can commit you for
example you can communicate from Japan
to the South Africa or something for
some powdered Brazil or anywhere in the
world Antarctica or whatever the name
not even islands with very very
unfamiliar names or whatever and um
these islands ionospheric ionosphere is
a natural phenomena so it changes it
changes as magnetic magnetic magnetic
voicing magnetic disturbance occurs or
the change of solar activities lots of
other factors so
scientists are actually measuring how
these ionosphere ionospheric behavior
behavior change so let me show you let
me tell you about the some tools on the
I'm it's ready how to get the digital
data from amateur radio traffic this is
software called CW schemer GW stands for
most cold and this this software
actually skims the sound from the sound
input and it decodes all the the
continuous continuous stream of day and
dates and does and they call it to the
extra cosine we see they also said the
software of the also says using the
patient status statistic analysis and
sometimes in a very crowded band there
will be a hundred or two hundred or many
many stations under the bandwidth of it
a narrow bandwidth of 10 or 20 kilohertz
so and the good thing about this is that
when you transmit what your transmit on
your hand key will be detected by
computers and it will be sent back in
the central server and the central
server is called reverse weekend net
there's a notion of the world beacon our
beacons acting like a lighthouse it
sends periodic signal signals for
measurement and reverse weaken is that
all those stations around the world
gathering the information by listening
to the signals and with the automated
facilities and sending those reports to
the hub system for the data collection
so and so lots of so lots of stations
running cedarville skimmers are sending
our sending data back to reverse weekend
down at domain and each bolt includes
the location of the reporter and the
polar station this is location and this
is a reporter and this is the reporter
station for
example on this as a locator is in
Namibia and it rotates the station
transmitted from Hawaii you can identify
those information from the prefix of the
cosines and there were there's a
frequency information in kilowatts it's
about 140 177 q health right here and
the including signal strengths and the
transmission speed this kind of
information are all get collected
automatically 24-hours a day and there's
another type of protocol called whisper
WL it says whisper and this is a very
low bandwidth protocol um it takes two
minutes to send only 50 bits as the
speed is only 1.5 ball so and right it
sends hundred sixty two symbols tastes
110 seconds and the bandwidth is very
very small only six health and by this
characteristic this you can you can use
it at four as a telemetry system on for
example this is my antenna at home I
live in a condo and the length is about
six meters or something like that I put
this antenna with a fishing pole and
with wire and I put 55 watts 5 watts of
electrical power inside here with using
this protocol and I often confirm that
my signal rich too no way from Japan was
only 15 5 was so so with the help of
computers everyone can hear you and the
the report will we get together to the
there's a site I which I willing to
explain next uncle whispernet and this
product was designed by on
no Rory ate with a loser who happens to
be another amateur radio in sujets
called professors yo Taylor and his idea
about the synchronization of this
protocol is very simple you just send
them away from every every first second
of the minute so you don't have to
synchronize synchronize using the signal
you just use the absolute timing and
this is the kind of very ad hoc protocol
but it works very well so let me tell
let me talk about the wsp or net spot
database and you find a transmitted
cosine these those begins with kay and
Dario are or in the United States this
begins with Z and this in Great Britain
or a better year United Kingdom and this
DC stuff is from Germany and yeah those
kind of those kind of stations and the
frequency is measured on the older
health 16 or seven days not not all
station have this accuracy but
technology carry this is feasible using
a temperature-controlled crystal
oscillator or something like that and
and the reporters cosines also listed
and some people doesn't have the cosine
I mean that they don't have the resident
license but they can they can send a
report because listening to the radio or
arrow airwaves you don't have to have a
license so there's a signal code there's
a pseudo code cycle w 1789 seminole here
and there's another strain called grid
grid stands for arm certain kind of
encoding of latitude and longitude of
each station so when you give when you
give a grid grid strain for example in
somewhere in Japan p.m. 74 or something
like that that's where we convert it
into the location around
e 35 degrees north sat five degree knows
about latitude and 135 degrees east
longitude so with these information
services pianet calculate the distance
and awesomeness means the direction of
the wave how it propagates so to
summarize this on this kind of
information is also automatically
collected and gather it and has become a
big data and this is a real time
snapshot of a real time application map
lots of traffic between the Atlantic and
very few but some exists in the Pacific
and there there are traffic between
Australia and Asia or Europe or even in
South America or Africa so this is a
pretty trivial application of mapping
those data into google map so let's talk
about how big is the data but reverse
week Annette it's I'll show you the
extra data examples but uh but first
week Annette is about 171 million
workers gathered for past four past four
years and for that whispernet 125
million workers gathered for past five
years and I actually download it all
download them all and measure the size
and it's full gigabyte compressed and
the 2821 gigabyte when I'm compress
compress that's treated CSV data base
ESP files so can all the VMS care well
for this size I don't know maybe they'll
maybe they're well if you if you give a
bunch of memory like 128 gig are or 256
gigabytes but maybe not for all laptops
so I so I decided to use react
there's a little bit of disclaimer you
can see it on slide you can see it on
the slides but um time I got to tell you
I'm a bachelor employee so my view might
be biased but I am not so I I try my
best not to make make this your sales
pitch so why react it's written on OTP
and I and I've been touching our own TP
for past five years and I know how it
behaves and of course we are in our
factory aren't we so I'm trying aye aye
sir I I like to talk about the island
software and what it's what I've been
working for since last month febre 2013
and i'm sure and i got to tell you i'm
newbie i'm a newbie and move about this
so i'm still learning a lot of things
about it right right now so contents of
this presentation may may be far from
complete no I am so I welcome your
feedback or feedback or comments the
good thing about react is it's open
source it's open source no nothing to
hide you can try it by downloading this
repo and recently our sebring product
Audrey across service has already had
also become open source on the 2022
March so lots of things vasha provides
has open source and it scales it skills
very well when you especially when you
try to handle a lot of data if you're
using if you use react or other content
on any other kind of database which
which has a characteristics of
distributed storage you can prototype in
a very small data set yeah try first try
first by a small subset of data data set
and deploying it to the larger data sets
it's very easy so that's what I what I
try to do in this presentation and
before doing the whole thing I tested a
few strategies of the database structure
first I
just made react as a crowd not another
cross out a lot of distributed storage
just putting those files on the react
and trying to analyze analyze on the
external clients there are advantage and
disadvantage of the above this advantage
this is fast lighter load and rear
service but the disadvantages is that
the clients have to search individual
CSV files by themselves so this is some
kind of a no-brainer solution and not
really you not really using you you see
not you not really get the most out
debris functionalities of react so I
decided to choose this one storing each
event record with indexing by adding
index to the every data or every line of
CSV to buy the react advantage is that
it searchable and it's just it's even
searchable pretty easy as if using an
SQL DBMS was a simple search commands
but it's it also consumes a lot of CPU
power on the rear side and it will cause
a heavy load on those servers for the
pre-processing I mean in the technical
term reacted it is called pre-commit and
post comments but anyway I just chose
stress be of storing ichiban records
because react has its own search
facility called react search and
Yokozuna and reup can handle Jason as a
native data type and it is Jason is very
easily convertible from csv and i got to
tell you the to suggest very good time
was available prototyping external
problems maybe one or two days so i got
to do it very fast and i also had a
personal interest that i wanted to
explore what i can do was wear cologne
so let me show you about the data I'm
going to process
oops sorry
no I don't want to get excess start a
lot of that looks 654 yep this is the
raw data of a reverse speaking entry
it's just it's just a plain CSV file
writing and writing download entries and
you can see you at you have already seen
this as just as a as a part of slide and
for the gov respir whispernet the time
stamps is different this is actually
unix time on unix time seconds on
longing long integers 32-bit integer and
this is also csv file nothing special
about this so let's get back to the
slide
so let me explain about my testing
platforms I used the testing platform is
my good old laptop which I wrote which a
rod which is also used for the ironworks
of 2012 presentation oh it's a very
typical machine I 525 core i5 quad core
CPU with 2.3 gear house clock it's it
has 8 gigabyte ym and 500 gigabyte hard
disk and it run it runs freebsd and it
runs our OTP are 15 b 3 bo3 be three of
three on this unfortunately this is not
yet are 16 b because react is still not
compatible with our 16 B and I die I
director state of fishery bachelor only
supports our 15 b 01 so if you do the
production we recently after you using
our 50 BC 30 dash Wang would be of some
risk and I have a supplemental test test
environment it's actually actually a
macbook over here and actually I'm react
is running right now while doing the
presentation at the same time in this
map book so what is so little so what I
did first is to compile the ion or 15 b
3 bo3 with using Curl Curl is a utility
which allows multiple versions of our
OTP instances which is easier switchable
for each cell environment and I've
tested curl on freebsd ubuntu and OS x
in all of these environments crow works
marvelously very easy so if you if you
have to switch over many types of insta
many time many versions of our instance
I suggested you use grow and I installed
vanilla react first and try to run five
notes on just eight gigabyte of memory
first without data it were it worked
very smoothly but as a lot of data is
coming in
and each instance has become today today
is more and more getting bigger and made
500 mega or one gigabyte in the actual
memory and it causes swap space
exhaustion so I so I recommend you don't
don't do that on five notes if you if
you really want to use the ryokan on
this this type of system in the
production system so I reduce the node
number from five to three so three seems
to be a feasible maximum because react
has a default parameter of W is three
well what W consists is that the number
of copy to the each node of an of an
object to be made or to be stored on the
rear cluster so if you set W equals
three and when the whole cluster has
only has three knows everything will be
copied to all notes so this would be
robust although this could be throw on
the real little working system so please
treat this as an just an experimental
parameter and next I try to test
research research has soul like
interface and it mimics solar I'm a set
of the command list of the sir search
parameters and research has its own
converted conversion facility um Jason
fields to searchable it indices indices
or indexes in bachelor there there's a
discussion which which which you choose
indexes indexes but people are now using
indexes whatever the ground graph it's
Graham adequately correct or not so I I
stick and indexes right now and it's
sort of of CSP after converting CSV to
Jason and the vasa has its own pricing
client and and let me show you cold oops
here is so on this one yeah I all get to
do is impulses Jason and see svn import
react and in folding react and you
connect we have to yeah this is a
private pirate house moves in my house
and we have private private sir about
that down and with the pbc stands for
protocol buffer protocol buffer
communication and you make the bucket
for those who haven't heard about react
and there's a terminology in react
called bucket bucket stands for our key
value database a set of key value table
may is called bucket and it's also
technical work for Amazon days and s3
database and so you specify the bucket
and it's ready to get accessed because
its object oriented programming language
and you define feels like this cosine or
D means that originating prefix or some
date and I intentionally made this all
as strengths because the show for the
string data you can table virtually
accept anything and you open the file
here and you read the each record of the
CSV file with with this message and you
make a new object of be B stands for
here right here okay and you store just
under you you you write a full group
which is not familiar with probably not
familiar with our program is but you
write a full and you just close it this
is all this is what is all about the
storing data in to react with the rear
pass and client and it's it's very easy
and then
and the entire work will not take 20
lines so if you if you try it storing
your own data of the CSV just don't try
a Python client first so let's get back
to the presentation and before using our
research you have to tell the react that
we are going to use research on this
bucket so you have to build the index
for each bucket before printing putting
the putting in the data this command
will search command install bucket name
this is a real career command reading
the other line and so you just do it and
the and the you're all set for research
and for I I tested this for about one or
two days and this worked ok but there
there were certain problems it didn't
implement full range query and it was
hard to use for what i wanted to you i
want why i wanted to do and it was full
and consumes a lot of cpu time on the
rear react instances and getting the
number of each field member is
unfortunately not well supported on
react search and about the weirdness of
research is that this is a brown
processor p top screen and this is a lot
of rich a good old ex old output and the
legs hold here shows what is on the idol
cluster of react and it's very weird
that even react is doing nothing but
maintaining its own cluster in every 15
or 20 minutes the rolled average gets
high from one to three and the cpu is
high from zero percent 200 or something
like that and going up and down and up
and down up and down like this and this
continued for a while for more than five
or six hours so I thought I
no I actually don't know I'm I'm to
newbie to know this whether this is a
bug so I I haven't filed in a bug report
sorry boss sorry my colleagues but this
is not a normal behavior so so I decided
to try Yokozuna this is a news out still
alpha stage or better say software and
this is a traditional Yokozuna day sumo
prayer and Yokozuna and Japanese stands
for the real champion and the tuna means
to belt over here and the Yokozuna Yoko
means stands for horizontal this
direction so your cousin is about this
so let's quit about the explanation of
the origin of trivia and well Yokozuna
is all about it it's a cool name for
full text search engine for react with a
bathroom scene we've seen is a I'm sorry
bro pre-approved technology of the
distributive search in in Java and it's
it's well it will well equipped a lot
its support of course it support
research and lots of different different
things and why is and then Yokozuna is
an implementation or a rapper of a patch
a pass routine or solar on and these it
has always get a repository you can find
it over here and if you want to worm
Yokozuna you can try a branch of
Yokozuna in the react it's only this
wise emerged one point for all and it
requires a patch and this is utility for
java breathing java and it's running
it's running or it will automatically
download to soar utility and when i try
this it was four point one point zero
but now it's updated to 4.2 the latest
version and
as in there as in the research even on
the Yokozuna you have to tell you have
to create an index so that and to tell
the react or Yokozuna to to say that we
are going to use the bucket we're going
to use the index on the bucket so this
is a more crude kirkham and we're making
Jason index with the Yui G stands for
Yokozuna Y Z index and the name of the
index and and by convention name of the
index is the name the same name as a
pocket so you put a bucket bucket name
here as a part of the URL and for
grunting the adjacent records each Jason
record has to have the type of the
content type and applications Jason and
to tell data type for each Jason field
you have to add certain size certain
type of suffixes like high finance or
hyphen D or hyphen I it's documented in
source code area right here I'm sorry
source code Yokozuna right here and of
course your concern is running on the
Java utt you have to install Java
remember not all system on jabber jabber
gift for previously you have to install
the you have to compile the whole Java
kit from Java openjdk like this and and
full and full single thread entry for
single thread puts sequential puts on
the react server will not give you the
maximum performance and so I used good
new new parallel as a paralyzing shell
script of different files putting
different files simultaneously now this
is the easiest way so i recommend you
used to try try this and i also tested
near 4-bit cask enabled but
unfortunately this didn't make a big
difference because the most of cpu time
when you use Yokozuna or even react
search they are consumed by the pre
comet printmaking making index for
Yokozuna or research and zoning it
within our own being so that probably
and actually needs most of the CPU time
and this and i use protocol buffer for
useful the pipe from the price and
clients because it's more right weight
and more fast and convenient when you
especially when you use a pile of small
chunk of data and since react is kvs key
value database you have to make a choice
of keys and you can to you can you can
do either way use a predefined key or
let the react chooses key and for my
purpose of getting a stats of the sheer
speed records either way it could be
possible so I I just let rear cosine
keys and reverse reverse weakened data
and for the whispernet I use unique key
given in the whispernet whispernet
assigns every every different unique ID
for every different event and I observed
no performance use exchange between the
two so you can use the easy way as you
like so I the put test results is here
and despite I gather a lot lots of data
I could only manage to put only on total
war 1 million records in the laptop here
and at home due to the I think I think
this is the deed to the processing limit
of the performance movement of the react
itself or Yokozuna or other operating
systems and I crunched about 5 530 or
400 / 5 and 4 40 7456 thousands of data
of each set and I I also try to do the
back up and ate a it took hundred 70
seconds for 2.2 4 gigabytes
and just for that this packing up means
reading the data from react and
searching the older database through so
when you try to restore the whole stuff
it will take much much more time so you
you should try by yourself and on the
small set of data and and i recommend
recommend you to do that by yourself
before the four just blind rain blind
blind 3 i'm trying to do the battery
academy restore and the put speed is
about 270 records for a second I don't
know whether this is slow or fast but
the hour vati am from the empirical
value of the production cluster react of
thousand thousand foot for data is
considered fast fast enough so turn 70
was not that bad bad bar value and there
are other things i should note that very
heavy heavy loaded rare clusters we are
not serviceable this server may call it
may cause timeouts so if you are going
to use client light right to client of
your own and make sure that all react
data to be put into the servers you have
to deal with the time outs and one thing
I failed initially it was to you see
make Deborah Deborah option Deborah
copies all of job or archive files for
each instance so when you make us
through when you make a three node
cluster it makes a copy of three jar
files and this is not good I suggest you
to me use instead make stage there bro
this is this only provides symbolic link
for the necessary files and only may
only use one copy and so this uses much
less displace so let me talk about the
curry example right here and it's
turning about search
and given the bucket name here and
return value with jason and was in
denton and what role zero means that i
only want numbers no real date no real
data and this is a query condition that
about the band the band in memel house
will be 21 and there's a um okay there's
a function called faceted search this is
this is a additional search method
built-in on the solar and you can get
the salted result of a of the value of
the certain field under the under the
query condition so with doing this you
find this is a whole Jason result and
this is a number phone number from the
reckless phone it's sorry 3019 90 right
here and there's a risk of a frequency
of each record associated and for this
one it would be for this one will be 18
and I'm not going to describe it numbers
I just draw the graph and it's round
something like this I used to our script
simple script for this and this shows
that people tend to concentrate on the
usage of dia of each signal and although
the each although the the band are all
for this protocol is wider wider than
this like this okay so and I no no I'm
going to experience extra um extremely
another example about reverse beacon and
and I made about the continent analysis
of the word spots are from and what's
fast other stations are and i'll make a
shot because I'm because the time is
running out and it's performing six
searches I could draw this
of data and obviously our exchange
between Europe and North America is
higher than the than the restaurant role
so let me conclude them this analysis
presentation on the restaurant learned
is that if you are a few three if you
handle the database do start from the
small small data sets because you can
you can trust react or Yokozuna whatever
it is tribute database are handling well
and watch data for the pastor
prototyping the the most important
factor is how short the how frequently
you can you can reach out to the trial
and error so small data sets we would be
much easier to handle and consume less
memory and less time and I have to tell
you that laptop so not as powerful as
dedicated servers so don't try to to 200
million records into a rata and another
thing I learned is that use the most
suitable to for each task earn ldp is
best for servers um and the strength of
scale BTW and there was no crash on
react i I tell me no crashing reactors
in this operation that was very good and
but when you when you try to convert
some strength data poisonous price on it
has its own strengths and why don't you
use it yes you use bison for faster
prototype and when you try to analyze
the result of coming out to Jason our is
a convenient system for prodding all the
data so last but not least I'd like to
acknowledge these people especially for
ryans whiskey neo the ulcer iroko
Yokozuna innovative technologies my male
colleagues are all those people and who
helped me directory on during my during
my preparation of the presentation and
all the DevOps of the reverse we canít
and whispernet so sensual ah and I all
scripts are here and if you have any
question I'll take it
thank you you wanted to yep three so
typical production configurations only
have one note yes exactly exactly he's
after I I just wanted I just wanted to
see whether question i would get down or
up or something like that just just just
for my just for my curiosity low-cost
ithaca in typical production note and
the best performance will be drawn 111
note one on one instance one out that's
quite obvious yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
that's a good question i think i should
have tuned to 256 or anymore but i only
64 this time because I I didn't have
expertise or tuning but for the real for
the real production system you should
you should tune it you should tune it
maybe by trial and error
that's it
okay so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
