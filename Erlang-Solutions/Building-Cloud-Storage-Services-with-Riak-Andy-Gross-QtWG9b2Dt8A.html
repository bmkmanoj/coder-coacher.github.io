suggest it follow me
Oh
you hello does that work
all righty sorry about that
all right so yeah I'm Andy from Bosch Oh
I'm putting a microphone on to my pants
so building cloud services with react a
couple buzzwords in there I'll try to
cut through them this is part sort of
instructional on the parts of react that
are extensible and what you can do what
you can build when you when you extend
them in part sort of the the tale of how
we developed our most recent product the
react cs3 a cloud storage so what is the
cloud service cloud service is something
that's web scale and I know that's a
joke now cuz the 10gen guys wouldn't
 everything up but it it used to
actually mean something people used to
say that without irony and it tends to
mean these things highly available and
when I say cloud service think Amazon
ec2 s3 you know stuff like that
but people used to say web-scale without
any irony and it just means you know
things that are highly available
customers have expectations that's of
high availability that's why they
outsource cloud type stuff to other
companies has a global footprint you
know the web drives global commerce so
the cloud infrastructure has to be
globally distributed to should be
horizontally scalable for economic
reasons you want to be able to do the
standard Akamai Google Facebook whatever
model of buying commodity machines and
not really caring too much when they die
and writing software for them that can
tolerate and even anticipate or rather
be built assuming that that individual
servers will fail and also for economic
reasons you want it to be operationally
simple
the cheaper something is to operate the
the bigger your margins can get overtime
so react is web-scale I mean these are
all things that are true of reactive you
know mostly if there's some ways react
sucks but mostly I don't think you'd get
much of an argument at least if I told
you these are these are how these are
the features on which we sell react
highly available dynamo architecture all
the cap trade-offs availability for
consistency globally distributed in our
enterprise product at least horizontally
scalable operationally simple the last
two are really sort of come from our
heritage at Akamai and operating big
systems there so take the fact that
these are things you want to call
services and these are the things that
react provides it seemed fairly natural
to to use react as a foundation for
building new products I mean we're a
company you are not just going to stop
with a no sequel database so as you know
you think about the spectrum of things
that you can do and you look at the
resources you already have the code you
already have and you look at some of the
problems you face as a business and as a
project and as a technology and this was
a you know sort of natural choice this
model of building cloud services on top
of react so when you use react by
default or most no sequel databases at
least those are the the scale out
variety there's all these knobs all
these controls about low-level things
like consistency at least with react you
choose between backends the query model
is unfamiliar or more hostile to to
doing certain things then you know then
previous solutions or other solutions
maybe sometimes client libraries are
immature we're working really hard on
that at bash show now but you'll still
find libraries that support some
features while others don't and from a
business point of view this become
partially and mostly because of
this it's very difficult to sell if you
want to scale out a sales force of
people in order to really qualify use
cases and talk to customers you have to
know a bit about distributed systems so
as a solution we decided we're going to
use react as a foundation for simpler
you see a specific vertical services the
example for this is our cloud storage
product so when you focus on you know
sort of I'll call them verticals in this
case you know cloud storage but it could
be compute capacity you know if you look
at Amazon's suite of services that's
what I mean by vertical services things
that solve one problem in a predictable
way at scale vertical services can
provide simpler api's in the case of
react CS it's the s3 API which while not
an official standards body standard is
is pretty much a standard for cloud
storage today it's way fewer
configuration knobs you don't have to
worry about any values and quorums and
backends so it's easier to deploy easier
to operate and again in the case of s3
they have existing client libraries
sometimes if you know you're doing a
clone of something that already exists
and because of all this it's it's easier
to sell you know you need a pile of
research papers to go sell react you can
sell you know more fine-tune services
like there's vertical services like this
with just a one-page spec sheet mostly
and people in general want to act want
to interact with something simple and
that solves their problem so there's a
number of ways that you can do this and
we've actually been talking about this
for a while I mean at maybe the last two
are lying factories and other events
there's been a lot of talks about react
core and how you can build applications
with that this is really just another
variant
that same pattern and over the years
I've seen a couple different panel
usually I'd like to use the word pattern
but I couldn't think of a better one
I've seen a couple different patterns
emerge when people want to take react
and make something else out of it
whether that strip something away or add
something I've seen a couple different
patterns emerge and I'll just briefly go
through those now so before I really get
to the patterns this is sort of a
representation of where react allows you
to configure it react was meant to be
modular modularity was one always one of
our design goals and we've used that
modularity ourselves to build our own
products so in a traditional react or a
pre a car is an Erlang library we have
rebar plugins that will create the sort
of skeletal code you need to to create a
react or app react core is the
foundation of react Cavey the foundation
of react search and some interestingly
lately there's a company called 10 D de
te and D ITA that makes a software
appliance based on react or with api's
to languages other than Erlang which was
sort of the dream of the react or fans
of bash shell for a while but we just
really never got around to it and this
is typical this is here the structure
that these sort of react core apps these
are the types of things you've seen in
the past the structure that they tend to
take and it's also you know with a lot
of things omitted the basic structure of
react KP and react search so starting
you know making it to the API centric
react or is an interesting library and
that you kind of write stuff that sits
logically above it and logically below
it when you write a full application but
you know your your application your
service is going to expose some sort of
API so that's that's a component in the
case of react that's web machine and
protocol buffers but you know obviously
you need a way for clients to reach this
thing
at the very bottom you have whatever it
is your service does this is specific to
storage so I called it fou DB but it
could be foo actual work that your
application your service does
coordinating although that is a narrow
band process that's managed and spawned
by react or called a/v node which is
really the interface between all the
stuff above react or the API and
whatever the functionality that your app
provides and the V node serialize this
requests it it deals with topology
changes manages handoff when new twin
notes join and leave the cluster exposed
this bunch of stats about how the
cluster is behaving etc and you get most
of that for free when you when you base
your application on react or usually
after I mean you can call directly from
some API module into react or and send
commands around but usually when you're
talking about replicated services or
complex transactions or whatever
eventually you you end up writing some
sort of FSM usually a Jennif sm to sort
of manage the communications between
your application and all the real core
machinery below namely the v nodes you
typically write an FSM to manage request
to requests to and reply from replies
from those V nodes using react
courgettes do a whole lot of stuff for
free in addition to you know all the
functionality all the intrinsic
functionality you get the whole
packaging system so you can build binary
releases with rebar and part of that is
this sort of generic notion of a console
module that lets you basically write
functions that can be called from an
admin script so if you use react there's
react and react admin those are all
shell scripts with pretty easy to
understand templates of how to call into
the module that or the application that
you've written and along with you know
along with anything you add you get the
the join leave all the core
administration stuff that you'd want to
do with a with a distributed application
all the ring management ring joining get
the monitor progress of data transfer
etc so that's a real core gives you and
that's an example of sort of just custom
react or a pivot lots of these out there
in various states there's a lot of
mother and production actually I don't
know if I'm allowed to talk about where
any of them are but there's if you
search for react or tutorial one of our
employees Ryan Tedeschi has written some
good stuff about this so you can go to
that level if you're really not not
writing a database so you're not writing
a storage service you're writing
something that's really custom there's
some complexity here
but this is all very possible and doable
we try to keep the api's clean and
decoupled from any of the stuff that we
put on top of it when you also get nodes
and node and ring Watchers to respond to
changes in cluster membership etc so
really like as I said this is the
general structure of react AV as well
this you know hypothetical lab when you
use this react AV you get some extension
points as well you get pre and post
commit hooks the Enterprise replication
product that we sell is actually
implemented as a series of post commit
hooks so it's a nice clean sort of way
to integrate other systems you can
imagine if stuff was coming into react
and you wanted to put it in a message
queue and have it go somewhere else or
just in general interface with another
system commit hooks are a logical place
to implement that kind of behavior you
can write custom
kV backends the API used to be pretty
simple and it still is but there's it's
basically get put and delete that's all
you really have to implement you can
stub out the other stuff if you don't
want to support things like listing keys
or that
not a natural abstraction for your app
but the backend API in reactivity is
also meant to be extensible and as far
as replica placement and replication and
request routing goes react or actually
allows you to define a custom hash
function for a bucket so by default
react will just concatenate the bucket
and key hash those and then do the
consistent hashing lookup and decide on
a set of nodes to handle the requests
things you can do with the custom hash
function are stuff like you know maybe
don't consider the entire key if you
want to enforce locality of certain
objects and those objects have a key
structure that gets more specific if you
go from left to right
the more you lob off of the right-hand
side of that key the more things in
whatever sort of hierarchy you've
represented with that structured key
will end up living on the same nodes an
example from you know the cloud storage
context is if a file is broken up into
many chunks and the last element of the
key is a chunk number you could use a
custom hash function to lob that element
off and then get some more locality
among files so these are the basic
there's more and you can always write
Erlang code and you know get a little
farther up and its guts here but this is
basically the set of abstractions that
you get and these are the set this is
more than what we used for the service
I'm about to talk about so again I
mainly just explained all this stuff but
a real core application it's usually a
custom V node implementation in the
client API usually you end up writing an
FSM to just sort of manage coordina
communication with the virtual nodes
an example of this that actually just I
just saw on Twitter yesterday or the day
before something by John Brisbane which
is basically a react core app doesn't do
any storage for what it does is it
dispatches web requests to the Sultan
and there were some good-looking graphs
I don't know it might suck but it's at
least an example of I don't think it
does he he he has a reputation for
writing good stuff but it's example of
react or say as a load balancer if you
wanted to put it in cloud so to speak it
would be you know and yell be clone if
you if you will so there's many other
examples and we try to blog about them
when we hear of new ones here is the
approach that we took with with our
cloud storage products it's the
stateless proxy and it's implemented
deployed in a separate VM a stateless
client of some react cluster
uses you know to the extent possible
just react kv-4 any state that it needs
to store and from that you got all these
great benefits all these great fault
tolerance benefits because it doesn't
matter the machines aren't really using
their local file system for anything
other than running the process of course
there's you know various level I mean
you can put stuff on there you just
shouldn't necessarily care if it goes
away if the machine dies in this pattern
the proxies really have no direct
knowledge of each other the the react is
clustered using react or but the proxies
aren't which provides some nice sort of
decoupling from decoupling of the of the
thing that's actually delivering your
application and the backend database and
it allows and you know that property
allows it to scale independently from
react so you could have you know a 5
node react cluster and a hundred of
these proxies if you want to and then
just taking it you know to its logical
conclusion I guess is sort of the
clustered proxy as you know those
services get more complicated it might
not be enough to keep all your state and
react or there may be other reasons like
just more coupling between proxies for
clustering purposes you might want to
use react or itself to balance load
among some nodes of some proxy app
you've written on top of
me and if these applications have state
that they can't really store and react
for whatever reason you can use react
and all its consistent hashing goodness
for a distribution of proxy statement
and I guess you could actually take this
a bit further you could have a type of
node that joined a react cluster yet
didn't participate in in the claiming of
partitions and was simply basically a
listener of events but one that had
knowledge of where the data lives you
can do that right Jenna okay yeah so my
point is that there's a number of ways
that you can compose these all with
various trade-offs so what's an example
react CS this is our Cloud Storage
product we announced it Tuesday you
probably saw it on the Twitter's and
what it is it's an s3 compatible cloud
storage product backed by react and in
terms of the the different types of
services you can build on top of react
this is the stateless proxy so in other
words this is a horrible image but these
you know that's a react cluster this
part of it react is obviously all
clustered the react cloud storage nodes
don't know about each other don't keep
any state all they really need to know
about it's a little bit of configuration
for what they're gonna do and the
addresses of the react nodes that
they're supposed to talk to so it
implements the s3 API via web machine
how many people have heard of what
machine every I think people forget
about it sometimes what machines really
awesome and it allowed us to write this
API really well and really fast well we
didn't write David to copy the API so I
mean the problem here is that there with
storing large files in regular react is
that since we just use Erlang
distribution and FSMs and there's
three-way replication going on and the
fact that the object you know
in transit that's getting requested
needs to be fully materialized at many
different places in that request pass
that you know when you start talking
about a service that's actually getting
traffic puts a practical limit on how
big of a value you can store in react so
what reiax es basically does is it's a
another Erlang VM talking to a react
cluster large files or whatever size
files large is really the interesting
case here coming through the s3 API and
as a result of a file being sent through
s3 API one or more react objects get
written the first one is basically what
we call a manifest and really all that
is is metadata about the content type
very similar to their metadata that
react supplies content type content
length some internal stuff used by the
system and enough information to locate
obviously the chunks of that that file
is comprised of so as the large file
comes in react is react CS is splitting
that into statically sized chunks the
default is the Meg but it's it's
changeable and when you read the file
you fetch its manifest the manifest has
enough information for you to predict
the keys of the file for example if you
have the content length and the block
size and the manifest you can pre
construct all the all the keys that you
need and that's really it these are
stored in separate buckets it's also a
multi-tenant
API so there's users and identities and
there's isolation among users and all
that stuff is stored in react as well
things like user authentication data
usage data it has billing and metering
api's access control with data so all of
that is implemented in react CS mostly
via web machine and all the state is
stored in react I didn't do any code
line counts but the number of lines of
code in this compared to what what's in
react is
is minimal react is really doing all the
most of the heavy lifting so what worked
well one one thing that sort of happened
by chance but but was beneficial to this
project was that we got involved early
with the beta customer and and a very
minimal prototype and iterated on that
which we hadn't really had the chance to
do at basha before and I think that that
worked really well and there's plenty of
talks and probably a whole tract about
that kind of stuff but I'm not really an
agile guy we are keeping in real core
work great and I think it's it's a
testament to the flexibility of reactive
there were actually no code
modifications to react required to build
react CS literally all you have to do is
change the backend to level DB and
you're in your react cluster and that's
it we didn't have to change anything at
all react CS talks to react through the
protocol buffers API and we didn't have
to change the thing obviously as we
build more of these we will run into
issues with react or things and thinking
better and react will be reacts roadmap
rather will be driven more and more by
the needs of people including us writing
applications on top of it writing
services on top of it you know as
opposed to applications and because of
that the thing that you write for the
most part unless you screw it up real
bad inherits all of the great web scale
stuff about react you know horizontally
scalable fault tolerant highly available
ease of ops etc so our own stuff worked
really well
our tools obviously work great Earl and
of course rebar who likes rebar
yeah quick check is awesome if you don't
keep if you don't test your code with
quick check like either shoot yourself
or go in quick check because it will
find stuff that you will never ever find
in your code this weird thing with
software is that you know you write it
and you think it's gonna do something
and then you run it and there's some
observable behavior and it may happen to
satisfy a business requirement but
rarely is it actually doing what you
think it's doing there's a great post by
Hunter Thompson when he another bachelor
guy also sitting in the back when he ran
quick check against pool boy which is
our our connection pool sort of behavior
not ours we got it from the community
but basically every part of it was
broken in some way and yet it had passed
what was really rigorous testing on
batchest part in terms of how we were
using it so you know are those bugs yes
did we see them no but those are the
types of things especially you know if
the fact that we didn't really observe
too much of that behavior with a the
install base that we have is really a
testament to the type of stuff that
quick check can confer it out and all
the other basho open-source projects
that are that have become sort of part
of our tool chains part of the way that
we build apps things like lager rebar
rel tool all real tools in a relying
thing but you know - oh projects and the
whole sort of Erlang tool chain didn't
disappoint but yeah very quickly with a
customer should be frequently a small
crew closed team and team was grown
slowly
I mean gradually we added more people on
we did things right as far as you know
most process people would probably tell
you
so what's up connection pooling sucks
they say that caching and naming cache
invalidation I guess it is technically a
naming other two hardest things in
computer science you could probably
argue that connection pooling is just a
special case of cache invalidation and
it is hard and it sucks you know in a
large service the number of incoming
connections hopefully if you have
customers is usually going to be greater
than the sort of connection capacity of
the machines that you're running your
database on so you have you know n
connections coming in and M fewer kin
connections going to your database where
M is less than n so we started with a
naive approach just open a socket just
open a socket for every single time you
need to get something even if you're
doing that a thousand times per request
and and you know not pay too much
attention to overloading react and that
worked for testing and getting sort of
features going once
beta customers started pushing on that
that obviously wasn't going to work and
actually outsourced the job of sort of
managing a pool of connections to react
to some you know pry open source proxy
software that worked for a little bit
until it didn't the details of that are
fairly uninteresting it involves kernel
tuning and tuning of crappy open source
software and then we finally wrote a
proper connection pool which i think is
working and we've probably should have
started and just written a proper
connection pool next time if you know
you're committing to the project just
write the damn connection pool another
thing that this didn't necessarily suck
this is how things just go in an
eventually consistent world you know a
lot of eventually consistent use cases
don't need conflict handling code code
the stuff that's truly ok with still
data you don't care some of this stuff
in the real cloud storage product
however is you know is amenable to
eventual consistency it can be
implemented with a dynamo
style system that allows you to resolve
sibling objects but you really have to
cover every case in this case it's
mostly the stuff around you know
predictable semantics around multiple
writers to the same object in a s3 style
bucket inside our cloud storage product
but that was tricky it wasn't
necessarily suck it just takes a long
time and has to be really thoroughly
tested but again you don't get to get
out of this necessarily it's this is the
kind of thing that you have to do if you
take you could start talking about
capping and end up here that you know if
you're gonna lean to the availability
side then a bit somewhere you're gonna
have to write conflict handling code in
the future or you know when libraries
are around or when you know we get
around to to looking at this stuff more
things like C or D T's might help a
bunch of bash of people have taken
interest in that so if you read their
blogs they've probably done more than I
have with it and quit check for all this
stuff obviously saves the day another
thing that kind of sucked we got around
it but lack of strong consistency in
react I think by now we've every every
once in a while someone comes up with a
thought experiment says no I really
think I know how to do an atomic
something or other in react and you
cannot do it right now am I right about
that Jeff okay and some of the things as
per the F 3 spec actually require
serialization or some degree of
atomicity so we implemented something a
stopgap solution it doesn't have the
same availability properties that react
does but if I have my way react will
have enough of this consistency to get
rid of that by
and the thing that stuff probably the
worst stowed of evil here is customer
environments you know you're going along
for a couple years making software
writing software and suffers greatly
tested the crap out of it there's no
bugs in it and then companies go and
they've run it on computers and those
computers have hooked up to networks and
God you know and those computers have to
be acquired and deployed and provisioned
and then those companies have people
that go and that's with the computers
and break them since this is a service
and not just a product you know is one
sort of lesson learned is that your
product can be great but if you don't
account for the environment that it's
running in it can still look like a
piece of crap so you know as far as
ryoko's and bash o - o open source
projects who knows I think we'll
probably spend more time looking at the
whole sort of lifecycle of a real class
different bringing it up to -
maintaining it upgrading it growing it
and then shrinking it when that when you
go switch to Mongo for a web scale what
may suck soon larger LAN clusters
there's all sorts of folklore on how
many nodes are learning can handle I've
seen various numbers I've seen some
numbers that are lower than what we've
seen that work pretty well in react
deployments which I last i checked was
about 150 but i'm not really sure how
much further we can take that so we are
of or at least I am of two minds about
what the solution is one of them is
since it's a stateless proxy not bound
to any react costs there there's no
reason that you know stateless proxies
like the real cloud storage service
couldn't sort of shard among many react
clusters so you know make maximum sized
react clusters whether that's 150 or 200
however far the native or
distribution protocol is gonna go and
then shard among them and that might
have some side benefits too like you can
isolate problems to just one group of
customers but it probably has some of
the similar problems of sharding at
other levels or investigate a new
distribution protocol I don't know if
there's any official work going on on
this but and I know that some of the
stuff in the runtime really really wants
to have the fully connected network if
you want to do things like links and
monitors so I I really haven't taken a
stab at guessing the complexity of of
that endeavor
you know reeling the the actual
distribution protocol for for you know
one thousand ten thousand nodes but I I
suspect it's not trivial right well yeah
obviously yeah one sort of bullet that I
left out of here is relying less on the
distribution channel for some of the
stuff that we do currently react uses
the distribution channel for both
control messages and data messages and
if you know yeah you're actually a good
point because before we invest too much
in this we'll probably try to use just
straight TCP connections more and what
might sucks in in storage costs so right
now you know reactive replicates three
times within each cluster by default but
when you start talking about many many
data centers that gets expensive erasure
coding is a possibility everything I
read says that you know it's more
trouble than it's worth
do you do plication perhaps all these
things that a whole ton of complexity
for for a payoff especially when you're
talking about a general-purpose storage
cloud where you don't really have any
way to predict how amenable the data
being stored is to deduplication or to
you know what other solution you want to
use to to bring storage cost down it
makes it kind of scary to commit to
something that complicated
one year when you don't really know what
the the payoff would be and then smarter
global replication maybe you know you
could have objects with the notion of a
home cluster and then they're replicated
to a lesser degree elsewhere so I'm
running over my time almost conclusions
remix a great foundation for large-scale
Internet services though it's you know
just I mean again the fact that we
didn't have to change a thing in the
actual react code base to make you know
a product as significant as 3x es is is
really a testament to how flexible it is
Basho will make more of these people
again want to interact with simpler
things than a no sequel database
sometimes I know sequel database is
exactly what you want a lot of times
it's not a lot of times you wish there
was something else providing what you
did implemented on top of no sequel
database so you get the benefit you know
the scalability and fault-tolerance
benefits without the hassle of the
programming model and again lots of work
to do on these environments you know I'm
the customer environments that react
runs in as we go forward we've done
react control now which is a web GUI but
we just definitely need to be a lot more
top to bottom than just shipping to
packages a different software and that's
it I think we have a few minutes for
questions
the chunks the question was how large
the chunk size is and reacts yes it's
configurable but the default is 1 Meg
which is a perfect size for react to
just use and it makes the workload very
predictable on react as well since it's
all the same size stuff going through
yeah we have I do I mean I don't have
the numbers with me
but we'll probably be publishing them at
some point
yeah yeah I mean just took it up to
Devon oh and shipping we get enough of
their customers already cliff moon in
the first version the limit is 5
gigabytes I don't think there is a hard
and fast reason technically why it was
that I think it might have been the
first thing Amazon did so he did it -
but there's no sort of engineering work
maybe a little but I mean there there's
no like hard cap at that if you went
into the code you could you could
probably change that and and the current
version doesn't support yet the
multi-part uploads you've historically
needed to you know I think they have a
per object limit I think they just raced
it - it raised it to like terabytes but
you do have upload many chunks and get
chunk identifiers keep a little state on
the client and then sort of make the
file appear once you're done with the
uploads but that'll be supported soon -
Mark Phillips - oh is hiring an
excellent way to talk to some people at
bash oh if you're interested in working
for us would be to come to the party
that's happening in 30 minutes at ro
which is at Howard in Hawthorne it's
Howard Street between 2nd and 3rd and
there are forums of bash show people
there cool well thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
