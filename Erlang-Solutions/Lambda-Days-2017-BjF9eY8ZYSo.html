meet together with all these amazing
functional programming communities and
we just get to experience their ideas
their enthusiasm and their amazing
potential I very much enjoyed John
Hughes talk the keynote on the first day
because that was also about the history
of functional programming but covering
from a slightly different angle so it
fitted together well with mine it summed
up in that one hour and that opening
keynote what this conference is about so
it's definitely recommended talk if you
haven't seen it yet the videos will be
available lines you should totally check
it out
so the talk was named after an old paper
that I wrote 30 years ago
why functional programming matters which
was the kind of manifest over the field
which very many people have read and I
think that's the reason that we were
invited but we tried to give not only an
introduction to the ideas in that paper
but to some of the really key ideas in
the entire development of the field both
classics of the genre and also some
papers that have been very personally
important to the two of us
I got to meet all the people who are
into functional programming and not
necessarily on the f-sharp also all the
technologies using the industry and this
is great opportunity to meet up and you
know share experiences with other people
I'm elected a lot I met a lot of people
I I wanted to meet for a long time and
was finally able to basically talk to
them in person there's lots of
interesting ideas and good connections I
think the atmosphere is really friendly
and there's lots of interesting talks to
go to in fact too many interesting talks
all happening all at once so I've
enjoyed a lot of the talks that I've
seen
I've been to a lot of other conferences
I speak a lot and lambda days is one of
the the higher quality ones in terms of
raw academic content but also for me as
a practitioner material that can be
applied in my work trying to convince or
subvert organizations to do better more
correct work
I'm enjoying the atmosphere a lot I like
that it's such a mix of people coming
from various backgrounds various
technologies who are willing to learn
from one another and those communities
mix here exchange ideas I found it I
find it really valuable it's good that
some initiative like this is around and
I am advertising embodiments you are
advertising new approach to programming
so we are pianist
it's an awesome privilege to be a part
of this drove and to get to witness this
all firsthand
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
