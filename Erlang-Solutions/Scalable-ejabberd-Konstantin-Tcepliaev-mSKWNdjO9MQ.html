Constantine and I'm going to tell you a
couple of words about Yandex ii.jpg folk
and what we've done to make it make it
scalable robust and fault tolerance
first of all probably all of you know
about jeopardy jeopardy is stands for
LNG / demon it is an xmpp server XMPP is
an instant messaging protocol previously
known as Java it is written in ln and
for data storage it uses nisha for
temporary data news also can be used for
persistent data or persistent data can
be stored in ODBC data base while using
a jeopardy at Yandex while we started
using it we've discovered that it is too
naive when your installation includes
only two or three machines and several
thousand connections everything works
well but when your installation becomes
large if you use it on dance of consider
its faulty machines that you can fail
and you have hundreds of thousands of
connections then problems start to
emerge at the index we use each other d
as as an XMPP I am server obviously also
we use it as a became for our web chat
at Yandex mail we use it as a transport
for our mobile mail applications for
iPhone and Android and we use it for
push notifications for Yandex disk ow
cloud file storage service and the
issues with the Jeopardy that we
discovered are following first it uses
direct message passing to protest
identifiers without any current cheese
simply using exclamation mark
which probably of all of you already
know second issue is that memory
consumption of a Japanese a bit large I
can say that it is unusable bitten
because of it but each memory footprint
can be slightly less I'll talk about
that in I'll get in detail later and it
uses manisha based storage which as I'll
show doesn't really scale to first issue
and that is my message passing in ln if
remote node goes down and you try to
send a message to a process that is
suited on that note that message is lost
you don't get any acknowledgement on or
an error on whether the message was
delivered on not the same is for local
processes if the process itself had
already died you won't receive any error
or confirmation of delivery basically
there is no method to know where the
message was received by destination
process or not and when you use the
jeopardy in distributed environment that
becomes a problem our first thought to
fix this issue was to use synchronous
message passing sent events to other
processes synchronously but after some
tasting and some thought you discovered
that it obviously includes receiving
reply which is of course another message
it is synchronous so when you call that
process you need to wait for timeout
which is five second by default and we
decided that synchronous goals are
ceptable for this dusk our second
thought was to separate the messages and
beats to local those running on the same
note as the calling process and remote
using note functional obviously for
local messages we check the process for
a lioness and if it is a live recent
message directly otherwise we take
Sandfire fail erection depending on the
message and for remote nodes we sent the
messages to to the registered process on
that note which deals with that message
accordingly the same as with local
messages and in this scheme it taught
those released process EG BDSM session
manager can become a bottleneck to
reduce the load on the process we
decided to separate the messages we
separated them into critical which is
message stanzas obviously that is
messages client msgs not arrive messages
but I am messages they are critical they
must be stored in offline storage if not
mind the user / is available and we use
it that scheme with DJ per diem for
message stanzas and for IQ and presence
stanzas we used the old Kim with direct
message passing and each a BDSM can
still become a bottleneck if message
rate would increase some day in the
future now it's not a problem for our
installation and it can be obviously
fixed by setting the process high
priority or replacing it with some kind
of process pool
that's all about the first issue let's
continue with memory consumption Ln
client process client connection process
its state consists of four near 30
fields which person then are used only
during initial three negotiation you're
in user connection authorization and
they are not used during prods lifetime
later after a lifetime it's the first
issue the second issue that is something
called subscription lists are always
stored in state and that is pretty large
data structure and the third problem is
that receiver is another process
separate from situates that these two
processes / play / clients and maybe
they may be joined in to our first issue
is large state we decided to fix this we
decided to split the client brought this
into combat module is gone but not yul
into each with their own States we used
generic fsm for the initial string
negotiation and then we switch to
generic server using generic server and
the loop function notice the hibernate
option that gives us free bonus
hibernate option 3 guests garbage
collection on that process thus reducing
memory footprint slightly more
the second issue is subscription list
subscription lists is the data structure
that stores information about contacts
with which our quiet our user should
exchange presences presents information
and there is no need for them when user
dance doesn't send presences we have
technical connections for Y and X on
mobile mail for push notifications and
subscription lists aren't needed there
and we decided to implement the lazy
retrieval we currently retrieve them
only when presence is sent by the client
separate receiver process it seemed does
not in but receives TCP messages from
socket in this process controls the
sockets and since decoded XML messages
to client process itself that is
obviously an overhead and we decided to
eliminate that process and to let sit
Reyes grind process control the jet in
control the socket and do everything a
clean Kalinda colony XML and receiving
those TCP messages and after doing all
that we discovered that our average
memory consumption for 1 C 2 s
connection had reduced nearly 40-percent
to approximately half a megabyte let me
stress that this is not about process
hip or something this is just operating
system memory footprint of eloehiem
divided by number of connections on this
note
that is it includes import data port
drivers data it includes some system eg
stables I don't know and second that we
achieved here is that database load has
it had also dropped slightly thanks to
our persistent data base load thanks to
that lazy retrieval of subscriber
subscription lists
and that's all about memory now Tunisia
manisha actually is a transactional
database built-in into a line standard
package while using it we discovered
that as as long as it's transactional it
doesn't scale after some limit because
you need to propagate propagates all
your rights to all other nodes to return
from the operation it doesn't survive
brain splits actually after brain split
when you cluster machines due to some
kind of network outage see your clusters
become split into each part after their
joining they each part of the cluster
cannot see chrome synchronize with
another next no deaths a fatal to if you
your matching physical machine had
failed you cannot remove it from the
skin easily and add another and you
cannot reinstate those note on another
machine if your data is lost and
basically an inconsistency in Asia
Indonesia up is fatal let's subjective
that's all subjective to Yandex I don't
know maybe we can just we just cannot
deal with nigga but this is so and we
decided to replace it with MongoDB
probably someone view some of you
already know MongoDB it is a key value
storage with eventual consistency with
mechanisms for failover and load
balancing it kills itself after Prince
blitz by electing the master of replica
sets
and replicating data using a blog and it
has thanks to those replicas sets and
the Chardon it has a theoretical
unlimited scalability
well the first try with mongodb was in
late 2010 it was manga version 1.2 they
were still no replica sets there was
something called replica pairs involving
only two notes and they were unstable
shouting we will implemented manual
shouting in session manager using
allocation function on user names and
you will implement it a replica players
with mustard master to master scheme
with only one a replica active at the
moment that is all retail rights go to
only one replica and the other is used
as well as a failover and we also
implemented TTS education of local
sessions on each node net scheme alert
well until early 2012 when we started
discovering some issues with it actual
version of MongoDB that time was Mongo
2.0 2.1 and we discovered that our
requests per second limits manga note
those master notes in replica player
reached limit was reached and master to
master scheme has become obsolete to
that moment by MongoDB developers and we
started encountering strange very
strange replication deadlock in which
was very hard to predict and investigate
the cause of it and we decided to try
replica sets to discard master to master
application and to try replica sets all
database requests as we thought they
needed to retrieve all this consistent
data so we thought that we can not rely
on reading from replicas and secondary
replicas and we've kept them just for
failover but this moment ninja was
removed completely from a jeopardy
jeopardy stopped depending on it at all
and the problem with the requests per
second rate and master it was still the
same and statutory in continue to
encounter in requests on pics on load
pics and finally with after some thought
we figured that consistent session
session data user session data is used
is needed only here in one case from
while retrieving sessions of contacts to
send them initial presence and that all
other cases you may have inconsistent
data and that's okay that's completely
okay and we've implemented this scheme
using MongoDB slave okie version option
and after doing all this nearly sixty
percent of full request go to secondary
notes our all rights obviously accrue to
primaries with Charlene we shall Don
username and this cluster a jeopardy
cluster and mongodb cluster they both
easily survive for brain splits they
survive work out ages survive physical
machine debts and mice abuser reconnect
so let word problems and
after doing all this we see huge
potential for horizontal scaling of our
system and the scalar bit limit is
actually as I think sky high in case
that anyone has any questions feel free
to ask that's all with my talk anyone
why you use hunga to be at the if you
if you have some problems with scaling
and you actually don't that doesn't use
any transactional properties of database
why you use MongoDB instead of direct
for example we show in the will bring
would bring less
impedance between systems talking about
react yeah I back in 2010 react was
still not so popular and and mongodb was
gaining popularity that time and I
actually don't know why which we've
chosen MongoDB because we just didn't do
any tests a involving react and mongodb
this is so just just reused non-creepy
thanks
you
network solutions have made a broad
branch of a jeopardy that use only bit
binaries and they have gained about
thirty percent decrease in memory usage
do you use it if you use this branch I
know we use pretty ancient folk might
sometime in two thousand seven or eight
I don't actually remember and I know
about adding solutions they used beaner
is instead of lists across eternity no
we don't use that those branch
hi well actually I've got two questions
one specific on one more general so
about spittle equation if I got you
right when you are talking about solving
the reliable message sugar pop problem
yes you said that you have to take took
two different approaches one for local
messages and another one for you and for
local messages your first check if the
target node is life then send the
message using standard penetration rate
or we use we check that process is alive
and if it is we send using ! and send sh
and how's that solving makes your
message sending lab because the target
node may die right after you check this
one
that doesn't solve the problem
completely but it decreases chances that
the message is lost that decreases those
chances yes but it doesn't you cannot
you cannot be sure that message was
delivered unless you receive some
confirmation from from process some
acknowledgement and that's too cold the
cost is too much of risk of receiving it
and you need to timeout and I don't know
so you allow some messages just yes yes
that is trade-off between timing out and
delivery oh yes but and another question
apparently yandex uses erlang least for
one much oh this language is actually
popular inside yummies
and sorry oh how popular this man Jesus
he's accused while planning this
conference then there was a joke bahria
came to one of our employees and said
timpson longest are coming and Timson
replied what all three of them their own
treatin Ellen developers yandex and we
use it the on I don't know three
projects currently two projects so then
why we event is happening here
I don't know
I see thank
hello okay thank you for presenting us
this interesting results you know um if
it's not a very big secret what are the
numbers so what are the number nodes and
what is the number of requests per
second number of nodes is several tens I
cannot be more specific story and
requests per second rate on stateful
system and it is almost impossible to
measure that because you cannot think
about a request instead full system
there are persistent connections yes
there are several hundred thousand of
them but requests I I don't know what
what you can call request request in I
am server I say thank you thank you

Justin others like them while nipper she
lives lavage when you're touring don't
processor a slightly more message it's
rather poetic es el nopal at the get 70
palp because of very large number of
those monitors mmm when you have some
several hundred thousand connections and
you send a message through inclined to
so the truth doe station manager a
message had arrived from somewhere an
intro session manager that is one
registered process and you need to send
that message to someone known another
note if you try to set a monitor on the
owner on those note that involves
sending messages to and if I recall
correctly those messages are sent using
net colonel rick is the process of a
long vm which can become a bottleneck
those windows scheme and i've tried that
actually and it's just fails under the
load and the load
it is all
show us
