about how to export constant pool with
my own the problem statement is if you
have a large amount of State or data in
our application how can you deal with it
a couple of thing we can do or we tend
to do one thing is we can store the data
to a stable and read the data when it's
necessary but the cost of reading is
pretty high so it's not always some
ideal and then we tend to use a process
pool but still there are some costs
involved using process pool
and then so one thing we can do is using
constant pull the arm tongue little can
be stored into module and then the the
benefit of using constant purism there
is no copy when when we read the data
from constant pool and then it's grow
very accessible and then the official
document is also available so I
recommend reading it if you are
interested because um there is some
caveats about using it and then the main
about Mel Mel is a meta programming
library
I think introduced into our about two
years ago and then it's very expressive
and then we can turn some structural
data into module dynamically and then
this is our use case but we have a rod
set of DSL rules and then we are turning
those about 4,000 rules in to express in
terms of an external DSL into modules
so we running about 4,000 module
dynamically created and then in
production system and then those module
or those rules can be updated from time
to time not so freaking to it but su
walks and then the example of using now
is probably our EDTA is a prophet of
famous one but it's a a little bit
complicated so I I wrote a small example
to acculturate example and then this is
how it looks like this is a small DSL
that can express um some mathematical
formula and then you can take this as a
string and though it's like this you can
take some DSL stream and then tokenizing
and then pass it a name this is first
doing is it's compiling that path tree
into module so this is module name given
to the compile function and then at this
moment this Tara suddenly becomes cold
and then we can call the the module of
the function of the module just be
created so this is how we operating our
DSL and then that's pretty much it thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
