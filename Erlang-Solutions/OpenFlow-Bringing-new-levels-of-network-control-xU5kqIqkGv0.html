and clustered applications so there's a
paradigm shift from simple client server
applications to truly distributed
applications which many people in the
Erlang community have been well aware of
for several years that's starting to
appear in the mainstream enterprises and
organizations around the world as the
network becomes more strategic but that
creates tremendous challenges for
managing that kind of connectivity at
scale and providing the kind of
reliability and performance that are
going to be required so just imagine ah
excuse me just imagine a Hadoop data
processing type engine distributed
engine just like you find with a Erlang
like cluster you could have instances in
different countries you could have um
data spread all around the world and
given the multi-core options we have for
platforms how do we scale this to really
you know millions of cores uh and tens
of thousands of nodes distributing
across a very large organization at
Infoblox we have a similar system in our
grid but we think of this as a general
problem in scaling large-scale
distributed data intensive platforms
that's one of the things that brought us
to look closely at Erlang and find that
even with the tremendous properties of a
platform like Erlang there are still
emerging problems in networking to get
such a system to work well in a widely
distributed sense at scale so how do we
scale a thing like that well if we look
at amazon and
Google I think there's a good
understanding of how to scale in the
data center and how to scale in
distributed organizations on that hasn't
necessarily gotten to the mainstream
products that are available through open
source or otherwise but there has been
10 years of understanding of how to get
two million core type scale in only a
couple companies around the world and as
we all know in this in the early
community is a well-known an advantage
of Erlang the models for achieving this
scale requires a model that all hardware
is just failing all the time so you know
maybe we're at a paradigm shift from you
know the the Java world of write once
run anywhere I think for the to tackle
the complexity in the scale that we're
faced going forward on something like
write once run forever of course until
you want to change the code and so if we
look at companies like Google and
Facebook and you know we recognize that
most companies in the world don't want
to be the largest search engine company
on but there certainly have pioneered
networking techniques that allow network
to continue to scale with the rest of
the compute and storage infrastructure
to attack on distributed applications
like a large search engine in a in a
cost-effective manner and in fact that
these organizations Google Yahoo
Deutsche Telekom verizon have actually
come together to share their knowledge
with the world in an organization called
the open networking foundation what's
striking about this founded this
organization is that it's a standards
body that own that is responsible for
some critical standards in the emergence
of software-defined networking as we all
know software is always been a way to
combat complexity at a reasonable
cost so the open networking foundation
is driving leading standards in
software-defined networking but it's not
a vendor driven organization it's driven
by organizations that have real
experience in scaling networks to the
levels that are going to be demanded by
the mainstream enterprises and
organizations over time taking out of
just the cloud apps and really into
mainstream networking the primary a
standard that the open networking
Foundation has been pushing is something
called open flow and I think the easiest
way to talk about open flow is if
Ethernet has I think very arguably
become completely ubiquitous yesterday I
was on a panel at the 40th anniversary
for Ethernet at the computer history
museum here in Silicon Valley and it's
it's really tremendous the statistics of
what percentage of ports that
accompanied like Cisco ships that are
Ethernet in the 90 plus percent that
means Ethernet one and open flow
simplistically is a remote programming
interface to Ethernet datapads I'll talk
a little bit more that in detail but
basically what it means is that if you
have an ethernet enabled network
white-box remotely you can turn that
white box into a firewall a load
balancer a switch or some combination of
those network processing functions that
are tailored to your specific
application and you can do that across
you know a hundred a thousand or ten
thousand switches on with a remote
programming interface open floor and
this is a not a science experiment it's
in practice and working in some of the
largest and most traffic intensive
environments deployed in the world today
so um given my involvement in open flow
on the open networking foundation may
people ask me what is Software Defined
Networking I generally say I'm not sure
that's the right question I think the
right question is what is hardware to
find network and the striking thing is
hardware to find networking is an entire
industry organized along box function
lines so typically for many appropriate
reasons for the last 20 years we've
thought of building a network as we have
to buy blood bouncers firewalls when
optimizing routers and put them all
together to make something work on that
has worked well but the reality is that
as we scale the complexity of managing
that environment becomes the real
barrier it's no longer about bandwidth
it's how we manage the vast complexity
of all those boxes and their different
functions and api's and programming
models and deployment models that are
all vendor specific um it just doesn't
work at scale in a cost-effective manner
and also underneath the hood all these
boxes today are essentially the same
fast chief beneath our net which means
the consumers aren't really getting the
value of of that inexpensive hardware in
the same way you would get in servers
where the real differentiator today
technically is already in software but
we don't buy network white boxes like we
buy servers today um and we and we're
not really buying any independent
software like you by independent
software on servers today that's the
paradigm shift that Sdn is really a
market correction where the center of
value moves from hardware to software in
the networking industry giving rise to
new products on the software side new
capabilities and the ability to scale
networks well beyond what they can do
today from a cost perspective and again
you know as we uh infobox know something
about large-scale data intensive systems
since that's what our grid is you can
imagine on options we have today
to scale the core for instance include
InfiniBand but open flow over Ethernet
which may have properties very similar
InfiniBand on look much much better from
a cost perspective and for those of you
deploy knurling applications on
certainly some of the coordinate working
issues you can imagine remain potential
bottlenecks in scaling those so we're
very excited to work with Erlang
solutions and early on software-defined
networking solutions for scale so again
hardware Defined Networking says the
control plane is bought with the box
it's impeding the firewall rotor or load
balancer and then you may have some some
sort of vendor specific management
planning in sdn we say all you have our
network white boxes on this slide vendor
a B and C data planes are just Ethernet
processing boxes and at runtime they can
be turned into firewalls load balancers
or routers on a per flow basis and any
combination of those and there's a
standard interface that talks to control
plane software the blue box on this
slide and that can live anywhere and
that's a fundamental difference internet
style networking demands a certain kind
of control plane embedded in the box and
open flow networking says we have a huge
design space of control planes so can
many different ones and they can live
off the box and that's a major paradigm
shift in terms of architecture and this
isn't an eater and or conversation we
assume internet style networking will
exist for a long time but this is an
emergence of a new paradigm with a good
Ethernet cost point for tackling several
emerging problems in distributed
computing and scale on so again just to
go one level deeper on the technology if
you look at the gray box on this slide
it's just an Ethernet data plane it has
ports um like a ingress port a
and its egress port B or at port one
would be ingress a eager speed you have
packets arriving and the control plane
which can live anywhere it doesn't have
to be on the box itself it can be and is
potentially talking to not just one
switch but ten hundred or thousand or
even ten thousand switches can send the
signal to that gray box and say for
these matches and those of you in the
early immunity already are very familiar
with matching as a fundamental primitive
so that's very nice and one of the
reasons we liked Erlang for this
application for these matches do
something with the packet if you match
do some sort of action so you have
matched action rules and then send it
out port be so it's extremely simple
really a remote programming interface to
open flow I mean to Ethernet OpenFlow
being a remote programming interface
ethernet so now all these flows um
become a part of a programmable fabric
Ethernet fabric and that puts the power
of programming the network in the
software layer which is going to be much
closer to the application and really can
be at some level of abstraction the
application programmer themselves of
course that will require new tools new
compilers new buggers new abstractions
but i think the paradigm shift is most
programmers who rate client server
applications have the most trivial
network right it's just I have a client
a server and really my network looks
like a wire in the distributed sense I
already have ten fifteen hundred a
thousand nodes I want to have control
over that abstract network the
connection between those things and
great properties an open flow allows us
to do that at the right kind of cost
Steve
you
extra is this I just want to check this
webinar boxes now she's showing over to
top the slice okay thanks everyone this
concept of decoupling the control plane
from the data plane is actually not a
new one it's very much history repeated
so the telecoms world has done this
actually twice in fact but it certainly
did it 30 years ago the concept of
separating the control from the data
actually enabled service creation in the
telecoms world it actually created
things like free phone numbers and
eventually it led to mobile phone
network so actually gave the addresses
kind of mobility and I think the same
kind of separation from control and data
in the IP world it's potentially going
to lead to bring news services created
in the IP space and innovation so
effectively what difference does
actually data and control being
separated me I think secure sorry
touched upon it that there's a large
number of boxes have actually
proliferated into the IP world such as
firewalls and so forth which are as
effectively actions or policies applied
to manipulation and control of data so
actually fundamentally they're doing the
same thing at the data layer they're
moving package from one port to another
and applying walls and yet it's the
complexity of the control layer which is
actually generated all these different
types of boxes as a result we should see
much simpler networks in the data layer
and moving the intelligence to the
control layer will allow innovation to
increase so for instance if we take
traffic processing today if we have
traffic which requires low latency today
we tend to introduce things like load
balancers and so Paul to identify that
traffic and route it in a different way
today when we move to an open flow type
network
we don't need to do that the actual
control layer can identify that the
traffic needs a particular handling it
can route traffic in a particular way
using exactly the same underlying data
hardware we don't need to do anything
special about it
again if we look at things like denial
services attacks particularly
distributive ones today are in our kind
of hardware defined networking model
it's actually a very difficult thing to
intercept and basically plug all the
holes of the attack might be originating
from because it's done on a books by box
basis if we move to control a
software-defined networking model that's
something that can be applied at the
controller and can be applied
ubiquitously across the network so
actually leads to a much simpler
approach to UM defending the network
after all firewall is actually a
function not a box so I you
be wondering okay this open flow stuff
sounds good how do I go about learning
about it so the most simple thing to do
is actually go and build your own and
this is where the links which developed
by airline solutions come to the rescue
so the good news about software-defined
networking is that there are free to use
open place which is available and so you
can actually build your own open flow
switch using inexpensive hardware and
there are two paths this as a switch and
the controller and just as well there
are also open source control is
available too so you can actually
unbilled effectively your own open
source network to go and build an
experiment with I'm not going to go into
all the detail on this slide but in
broad terms we can classify are these
open flow products in a number of
categories one is educational so that's
exactly the tactic I'm approaching at
the one which was you're a newcomer to
open flow you can go away and build an
experiment with networks the others is a
kind of prototype which allows you to
build more targeted swards hardware
vendors to actually build a prototype
type platform to build viable products
from it potentially bootstrap is a
similar kind of active activity but
they're much more optimized for data
path activities so faster traffic flows
and virtual I switch which would be
deployed typically and say a data center
or virtualized environment giving
software only switching this table
illustrates basically the four principle
open open source switches which are
available today the first is open V
switch which was funded by VMware
there's indigo2 which is by a bit big
switch softswitch barks and research and
of course link the most important one on
to buy or bootstrap by Infoblox
so today we're going to talk about link
which is an airline based switch the key
characteristics is that it is a level of
protocol support with two protocols as
oh f stands for open flow in sports
versions one for 2 103 103 being our
most recent and a configuration protocol
which is ofc i can play config protocol
one dot one which it also supports the
beauty of link because it written an
airline is it exploits the multi-core
capability and it's very portable so one
extreme you could actually build an open
place which on say a raspberry pi so you
can build the cheapest open place which
in the world by using ethernet two USB
ports so for around fifty pound you can
build a full pool open flow switch it
also runs on much more expensive
multi-core hardware proceedings like
that I lyra card so the links which was
developed by airline solutions it's
completely free to download and use it's
been issued under the commercially
friendly apache2 license so it's
perfectly possible to go and build
commercial products of the back of this
as I've already mentioned it supports
all the latest versions of oak employing
standard and it runs on a lot of
hardware because of the flexibility of
airline airline has a number of carrier
grade characteristics which means it's
well suited to visit building robust
resilient people switch is in terms of
the choice of open flow controller again
there's a range of controllers out they
are available floodlights is available
which is from big switch beacon which
was originally written by Stanford
University roux which is written in
python by ntt and there's some other
controllers out there as well so it's
very simple to go away and build your
own network using so the links which
and open flow controller such as a room
so if you want to get there out get out
there and get started right at the
beginning you may have seen a logo with
a rhino that's full of the flow cording
to org so flow forwarding website khlo
forwarding the all website is a
community website promoting the link
open place which if you go to this
website you can download the software to
build joints which and so for instance
if you wanted to use the flood light
controller you can go to the project
floodlight com website to download the
controller so in summary open flow is a
new model for IP networking the key
principle of it is to decap all the data
plane and a control plane and that
enables a shift from a box mindset to a
function mindset there's plenty of
choice out there to gain build your own
network from switches and controllers
and LMK solutions can provide support
customization customization to link if
you require it we now move on to
questions well thank you for that and
I'm sure we'll all join in thanking
Stewart and Steve for a very inspiring
talk on open float we've had a bit of a
flurry of questions here and the time
that we have available to allow us to
answer four or five of them but we can
certainly follow up and we'll answer all
your questions following the webinar in
written form now to start with one of
those questions firstly students team
could you please comment on the
following guard Stephen from the
audience is asking what do you see
erlang being used across further open
flow projects outside of the links which
and also wonders why would that be a
particularly good thing and what are the
sort of benefits of using our land in
the world of open flow
so this is soo I mean I think partly so
the question is will Erlang be used
outside of just the links which with
respect to open flow so I think that
largely depends on you know the people
on this call in the community and
whether those who are familiar with it
it's unlikely um in the short term that
folks who are very familiar with
software-defined networking as it stands
today and very familiar with networking
as it stands today are going to run to
it after land that has you know I think
that over time as we demonstrate the
power of Erlang in any kind of
distributed application networking or
not um you know I think that has a good
chance of happening I think what the
Erlang community has is a platform which
is actually designed for networking has
primitive like the bits intact um and
the matching a kind of philosophy that
is just perfectly made for open flow
style networking and a problem set in
what you know if you think about
large-scale Erlang applications wouldn't
it be nice to have more flexibility more
properties on them Erlang you know OTP
program or had in terms of controlling
the network so i think there's certainly
a huge potential for Erlang to be part
of open flow controller architecture
because obviously while the controller
looks centralized from a kind of a
logical model in the same way say the
domain name service looks centralized in
many ways to the app it's clearly can't
be centralized must be a fully
distributed system any any robust
scalable controller must itself be
distributed and Erlang seems a perfect
platform to develop such things on so I
think both from the potential use cases
in distributed computing that erlang
community already was involved with and
the properties earling itself I would I
personally hope
erlang becomes an important part of the
open-source ecosystem around open flow
on much above the switch layer but I
think that'll be largely up to you know
the folks on this call in the ER line
community open source and the open
source community and embracing that idea
and developing controllers and tools and
tool chains with on Erlang unfocused in
this area Thank You Stuart to move on
and try and answer a couple of other
questions we have had a query from
Marcus basically asking whether there
are any example use cases for Sdn within
the service provider arena um sure I
think the most vocal service provider in
support of softwood of open flow
Software Defined Networking befall base
software-defined networking has been
verizon on and to some extent to which a
telecom Stuart lb the CQ of verizon has
been if you go search I think you can
look source to lb verizon CTO open flow
in Google I think you'll see some
presentations he's made and other things
that basically say tref cost-effective
traffic management and network control
for a service provider is is actually so
critical that if they don't have open
flow deployed in a reasonable amount of
time their entire business models
threatened so from a service provider
standpoint I think you know the general
consensus is here's an industry where
the whole business model is I'm going to
invest in a network and then monetize it
over time and if the economics are not
right on then that business model is
fundamentally threatened so I think for
service providers which one of the most
vocal groups right now software-defined
networking presents a you know a
critical on shift in economics and the
way they do business um and so I think
what we see in stn is both service
providers in
identity data centers tend to be the
early drivers and early adopters I want
Software Defined Networking product
management being the kind of core use
case in the telecom service writer said
I think I openflow has a potential to
lower the price point for networking and
I think that's probably one of the key
attractions for initially for service
providers is that it provides a new
layer or new opportunity to improve
their profitability fantastic will thank
you sir and thank you Steve the
questions keep pouring in and I'd like
us to address a couple of them here's an
interesting one man we basically have a
question about performance so for
example if books a is capable of running
a certain number of rules but Box B is
capable of doing just half of that how
is this addressed within the common
control plane yeah so I think that's
this is one of the most exciting
prepared things about suffer Defined
Networking is for the first time ever in
the history of networking um we may be
at a point where price and
programmability are more important than
performance in the same way that that's
now been true in the server business for
you know 15 years and so specifically to
address the kinds of technical issues
you're talking about an open flow fabric
says what we will if I have an ethernet
fabric which has n boxes right at a
hundred a thousand on boxes that are
connected by ethernet so and they all
presumably have even potentially
different speed interfaces at the
ethernet level and different amount of
processing power and at any given time
different amount of load but we have
visibility to the application so we
really understand the requirements of
the each individual flow OpenFlow gives
us a way to remotely program that
ethernet fabric to make sure that you
know if if three
ah if three apps that are talking need a
level of service that's required and one
box in the flow path is not going to be
able to give it they just redirect the
flow to different boxes and that's not a
new concept we've seen this kind of
fabric based control in InfiniBand and
asynchronous transfer mode what's um
different about open flow is that it's
based on Ethernet which makes it
extremely cost-effective but that kind
of typical attack on fabric style uh you
know application driven networking is
still relevant in open important and
open flow deployed networks thank you
for that Stuart here's a question that
goes into the very heart of the matter
and sort of addressing the advance of
open flow can you cite an example of a
small deployment being used in
production within a commercial
environment sure Microsoft Azure uses
open flow in a commercial environment
Google uses open flow in a commercial
environment and then in the u.s. there
are many campuses including Stanford
Indiana University that are on have a
full blown open flow based networks as
per their production network on the
computer science department in Stanford
and again remember that's where even you
know campus why tcp/ip came into play
and Cisco is born out of the computer
science department Stanford has been
running production open flow for a few
years and now that's getting rolled out
across many different departments I'm
saying with Indiana University has had a
campus wide open flow production network
run by Matt Davies for several years now
so we're well past the kind of science
experiment earlier you know very early
adopter phase and have you know plenty
of on very robust commercial experience
with opens love today thank you for that
there's a question from Richard are
there any specific hardware requirements
to run link can you do this through any
airline capable platform
it basically just needs to be hardware
that supports airline so once if you can
load airline OTP onto it it will run the
key thing to be to be useful is it needs
a number of Ethernet ports because if
there's only one even if caught on say a
desktop PC it's not particularly useful
so I I built an erlang a link switch
using a raspberry pi so that's a 25
pound $40 type piece of hardware that
only has one ethernet port so what I did
was buy for um Ethernet to USB adapters
and suddenly I've got an open flow
switch spur around 40 pounds sixty
dollars that's a really good example now
here's another question that's quite
interesting coming from the telecom
sector will it be possible for the
telecom operators to use Sdn with their
parallel network if yes where should
companies start from with a parallel
network is that the question s yeah
exactly so basically will it be will it
become possible for the telecom
operators to use Sdn using their
parallel network and if so where should
the company start off um that kind of
implies it it's it's a parallel network
rather than integrating with the
existing hardware which are it may make
sense to do that I think in a telecom
environment if i look at save mobile
operators the challenge that they've got
is declining profitability and
increasing levels of traffic they're
also has ended up a lot of complexity in
the network largely because this
hardware Defined Networking model which
drives costs so pretty much if your
traffic doubles the number of auxiliary
boxes that you need to handle that
traffic also doubles where is it I think
the economics in the logic of an open
flow prints
or what it means that it doesn't
necessarily have to be that way you
don't need double number of boxes to
achieve that it also simplifies the
layer of control so i think the
evolution from say a legacy network to
one that's initially a a hybrid fruit to
eventually an open flow will obviously
require lots of intellect and
intelligence to achieve that but i would
say probably the easiest place to start
is localized data centers would be an
obvious place to start with yeah and I
just said again I think one of the best
things to do arm and it's it's really
possible i mean this it reminds me of
the exciting times of getting linux
running for the first time is do exactly
what Steve said build your own open flow
switch with you know very inexpensive
network white boxes and open source
which is really available and i think
immediately you'll see some of the
powers which is because you're just
programming an ethernet datapads that's
all you're doing remotely programming an
ethernet data path for match action
rules you can easily just make any port
to port flow that the ethernet data path
itself the OpenFlow datapad so can just
be a wire at first and then you can make
it a tab and then you can see what kind
of performances and then do you want to
actually change a packet so I think um
the the nice thing about open flow as a
starting point for software-defined
networking is instead of having to think
about the overall architecture and how
we do it today you can say I can insert
these Network white boxes and strategic
places and start doing really
value-added applications in an
incremental way on at a very low cost
point and I and that's why you know I
think starting with open flow is
probably the right place to rip for any
organization um telecom or otherwise to
really understand where the value and
the economics are going to come in for
software-defined networking thank you
we will try and make time for two to
three more questions here's one for you
Stuart one of our members of audience is
wondering what are the top use cases
that infoblox wants to address with its
Sdn strategy so we're not we don't have
any info box today has no Sdn products I
want to be clear about that um we're not
an SDN company we've been in the
business of network automation for you
know 13 years on hardware to find
networks we're one of the very few
companies in the world that has sold
independent software into the networking
industry we're really a software company
in the networking industry we on don't
and have never sold any packet
processors and they like a router switch
a firewall on we sell solutions at the
kind of control plane layer of neck of
hardware Defined Networking but by
control plane we mean really the
endpoints the the applications that are
interacting together so we do things
like dns and dhcp and IP address
management and that's software which we
sell sometimes with a server but that's
just a server it doesn't detect it so so
we're really a network automation
company at the control plane level and
hardware Defined Networking we think
that on software-defined networking is
again a paradigm shift where the value
in the hardware below where the
solutions we have on is moving from
hardware to software so that's like the
end of the mainframe to pcs and servers
and that change is it gives more value
and more flexibility in the packet
processing layer on for our customers
day we've got about six thousand
customers worldwide um mainly focus on
the larger enterprise and so you know we
stand kind of um as ready as a trusted
advisor as this paradigm shift in
economic change happens in networking so
any organization can rationally adopt a
more software-defined strategy because
it's not going to happen I mean
hardware Defined Networking is not this
is not about technology it's a entire
industry organized along box function
lines it's the way the vendors are
organized the analysts are organized the
press is organized it's the way the
channel is organized and it's the way
teams are organized inside all of our
customers so you have a firewall team a
load balancer team around and we don't
think that's a bad thing and we don't
think that has to change overnight we
think that there are new opportunities
for that to change in a rational way as
the business needs it that software
defined and give better economics over
time that software defined out means
really a huge paradigm shift but that's
going to require some and help in
getting there and we deeply understand
the current way the networks are
structured we've been focused on network
automation from beginning so we think
you know what we're trying to understand
is how do our customers the market at
large migrate rationally or transition
rationally from the current hardware to
find network to a more software to find
that we're going forward and we don't
know yet that's one of the reasons that
the open source and all the kind of
hands-on experimentation seems
absolutely so critical to us and the
reason why we're willing to support that
and find that through organizations like
curling solutions fantastic thank you
for this unit we have time for a single
question that is left and elastic
question to both what open flow
controllers are commercials commercial
users using at this moment for example
Google Microsoft Azure are they perhaps
developing their own yes so I can't um
speak directly for them I can only kind
of speculate have some some knowledge of
those things but I think you can imagine
in the same way that they've built all
their own infrastructure yes that
primarily those organizations have built
their own controllers and I think that's
one way to think about where we are with
Software Defined Networking um we're
just at the beginning
because MO as Software Defined
Networking an open flow become
mainstream as Network white boxes like
the Intel sea cliff trail platform
become available and you know more
available in the market that's a open
flow supported Network white box you can
buy from you know companies like quanta
an adi engineering is that on network
white box ecosystem emerges the
mainstream organizations enterprise
telcos are not going to build their own
on they're going to look for products
open source vendors to provide that and
be help them get to be a little bit like
an Amazon or Google or Yahoo you know
most organizations don't want to be the
largest search engine company in the
world but they want to have products
that allow them to have better
efficiency and economics in this
networking space so we think that's
exciting I think what's really
interesting is that the value of
networking moving to the high layers so
something sitting above the controller
may have the highest value so maybe
there's gonna be something like an app
store that sits above the controller and
people can buy load-balancing apps or
whatever and i think that's that's the
really interesting area that there's a
she ate a complete shift which will
allow that kind of innovation to emerge
on tastic well thank you for that now to
close off I'm sure that you will all
join me in thanking Stewart and Steve
