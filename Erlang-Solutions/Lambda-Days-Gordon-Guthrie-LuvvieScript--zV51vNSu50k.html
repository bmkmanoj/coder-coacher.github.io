with conferences robot speaks that
international English is that people
coughing Swapna and start to be swearing
so probably most of you don't know what
I love years but I'm in Blighty and
lovely is a is a slang boyfriend actor
because actors was going down and
sweetie love it and so the reason this
is lovely Spector's because it's a
director in commenced actors in the
browser and they used to be a lower
offer like that all projects at up the
world the letters early then will the
word got men all of that so I thought
I'm going to break away and name it
something proper and the other reason
it's called lobby script is because I
really would like to be soothed by these
days of Kayla because that is the
pappases dream that be using fasteners
actress and if anyone knows a lawyer in
Californy please sit montanus so um the
first question he asks is why why would
you want to write a dialectical I wanted
browse what problem are we trying to
solve by the by writing browser and the
problem that we're trying to solve is is
the problem of delivering software
continuously each production of cheap
cost low impedance programming if we can
have a direct answer the browser
come back end we can have smaller teams
that deliver software so if you go back
to nineteen ninety nine when I was chief
architect if our stack if was javascript
in front end open up decon to a I is
server speaking be be dropping happen to
serve with a message handling and C++
well she picked up on the backend jtv
each container over Oracle and the
speaking of you see mr. three different
planes of mainframe operating systems
language Halifax had written in 1968
right so it ought to get a piece of
software production your minimum teens
lies about seventeen plus an opportunity
nor 12 and as a result we spend 200
million dollars so in the modern world
we're trying to reduce that and that we
do that by eliminating software
impedance and we kind of see this model
appearing ojs JavaScript both sides
closure script and closure with the same
language on both sides and so another
script as part of that move move towards
modern language stacks scratch on it now
pick up to language taxi rhythm rails
and coffee spiritual but I'm javascript
is how we are we would you start so what
we're trying to do with Lonnie strip
then is right a dong scripting language
for web pages that talk to her line ntp
servers so it's not only one on the v8
JavaScript machine you know at least
these be capable of on a client and
server side so you can present pages of
search engines which require creep the
people pages to operate for SEO so he's
get strict subset of our name should run
on client scientist Sir so if you need
to but it isn't an implantation of the
aisle in a virtual machine running in
the browser and it's not you know a
statement I want a javascript engine
humming and the reason to dieter
the operating environment you're in is
radically different at the back end
you'd expect a hyphen currency tens of
thousands you have very lightweight
concurrent processes your code is share
you have loading supervision on client
side you have a completely different
environment your typical concurrency is
one of the three 925 and objects at you
through current model on a web page your
crew comes across this high some web
work that where workers shadow state
emitter JavaScript you can't you can't
you can't control restart soco changes
by page refresh you have no better to
manage restart so the operating
environments of July are radically
different so what which I'm a surface
the same underlying stuff completely
completely different and this is a
roughly operating model a were
trying to build up and got very far
there but this is brothel or trendy
essentially you're from designing a
system that will be basically offline
first so it needs the typical failure
mode of a website is my transformative
tunnel it's not like from my phone so
you need to if you need to operate in
that environment and you put a variety
components in and the aim is that
eventually you can make the entire
browser appear like a c-note the back
end so you just send the message to
browser without knowing instead of http
um I'm going to go through these
components a bit more detail the key
thing with all architectures two
separate realities from realities the
entities are the things that we are
shown common reliable to scale it
availability and the allottees
functionality which is my allottees
different from your ality so we'll share
say milites and we all have different
penalties so in the world of allottees
everyone likes their own web page so the
part that matters is this schematic
affecting you see how I laying out can
come
seemed to work better as a header I make
body of something maybe some outward
boxes and a photo maybe a menu those
would be your concurrent objects that be
represented in the browser by web work
at the capillary based models and the
timing supervisor is that is the process
that decides how to name your page out
that page looked like a web page on a
mobile phone every single calling the
outputs we thrown away that menu will be
swapped for Omar menu so the time of
supervisors job is to say hey and I'm
running a mobile phone ordering it start
I did stopping in comas the match that
you'll meet other mailbox at handlers
message passing between workers and so
that's that's kind of this part is what
the end user would then be writing web
pages and the rest they we just did that
the box so what we have to do is a
language designs n is build the
remaining parts that would be used by
anybody so the address that you just
simply have JavaScript library sort of
didn't know Bob's timing the patron room
and then all you're caching the local
storage in your communication to the
backend and also the library that six on
top of cowboy on the server side that
receives these messages because you
really just want to be able safe send a
message to the main page of home country
and it will find my browser and its
character you just see the message so
let's be the some architectural approach
and it's an OTP ish dialect because then
we'll goods right brawler like
everyone's right service or can a
service file so you should be your
object should be written but they were
receiving a state object which contains
their model of the HTML mmm room they've
got a message in who is strong and they
will then
operates on the stage and hand it back
to the soup of plan be back in the
normal jen selter way and the retailer
state will then be rebounded on the page
trancefamily so the person who's writing
the front-end never talks to them
doesn't touch the dog doesn't know
anything I've done all I subtracted and
what you're been doing is normalizing
your the interaction works you have to
handle you don't have fun get called
back Simone have you written javascript
and people here crying writing
JavaScript okay so you're going to me
when I say call back hell and all this
sort of ghastly unreasonable blah blah
blah so what I says all the events I
need to be able to front end they should
be placed in the same way whether from
the Dom another word at all from the
backing so I just should just get
messages time and but the thing that
really makes us work all of this is is
illusionary until you get until you get
source Maps source maps are now support
you're standing on firefox for about six
months and in chrome so without source
maps you literally do not get the
ability to debug I'm just trying to find
them it's reaction
I still putting a website starting to be
two seconds I wasn't a shag okay we
don't have that okay um don't mind now
now stuck on a Mac I don't have to do
anything I like it when you know that
but if you go to luvvv alongside you see
a screenshot of the browser with a line
in the debugging tools right with source
maps with the source Maps basically it
generates a JavaScript that executes but
when you step through the JavaScript it
in massive black the original source in
early so you can separate points in
their name you can watch the Codex crew
to even apply trot so effectively it
becomes a development environment where
the browser is actually running her if
you don't have source Maps you get you
have nothing at all you have to do is
then browse I mean CoffeeScript kicked
off as the first compiled JavaScript I
always get popular without source maps
because it was a dialect of JavaScript
and so people who used it and recognize
could write in foam scripting debugging
JavaScript if you tried it out then I
thought up as you just heard by sometime
so so source Maps a quarter still there
the two biggest pain in an ass and doing
this has been getting source maps and
getting an Irish the name even though my
oldest human freestyle trying to get any
DVD to eight or ten weeks supply a
domain reseller who stores your password
in plain text part of my intellectual
property you guarding you Harper's but
anyway so naturally playing up and their
particular painting I'm because the
Domus intestines don't contain column
information so you have to manually add
that in there are some changes going
through can t arranged
EP 21 you can try to push those through
into ATP synthesis that make marketing
okay so how are we exactly going to do
this we do this by front do as little
work as possible and that means reusing
existing tool sets and basically what
we're doing is not writing a little
programming language but transpiring an
address and testtree in horror hangout
such as SG into JavaScript abstract
syntax tree this means i can use the
earlier syntax tools to do my legs in
passing AST generation then we set about
putting javascript i can generate a
javascript AST which might be ECMC
script 6 or whatever and then I can use
the very rich JavaScript syntax tools to
convert that to do things like putting
technical recursion which you generally
don't get in java strategy after you
take that programs do like these jobs to
do that that would write it and then in
the end I can make generate a JavaScript
on the AST so that's roughly the
approach we're taking now it goes
through coraline a couple reasons one of
the reasons is all coral and easy user
is a language which is designed to be
human readable but optimize the Machine
writable you can likes if I had that
many only does and it sits inside the
componentry as a target of compiler
writers and I going through the corner
and it means that when I obviously
working for Elmo it will also work for
the next year will support for our fee
for work for
classified so this is a simple airline
program and coraline is slightly
different it's highly regular you can
see how it relates to this pin I think
that it's the previous pages or program
this page is that top the same listing
so it's three to four times more
products than I but left hand it's much
much much more regular so it only has 21
primitives so we really flow control
crew to this case there's no statement
there's no girl wats they're all about
my case statements as much as my bike a
statement there's the two primitives in
the yellow who applied problems of
operation criminal are basically two
giant saxy stuff lots of early apply
across the function lots of the o-line
vm when we take his native code in their
line is actually just calling our life
functions and so you shall although just
up in there Biff's and lots of things in
the air language musica part of language
and primitive operations by GC that's a
little bit of stops talking as well so
it's not very very big language and it's
it's nice and regular so tickly separate
the plastic problem with our language
trying understand days when does equal
sign when is it because I'm left alone
is a pattern match and when is it an
assertion about you and sometimes it
could be both on the same time if your
if your pattern matching into pool or
one of the variables is prebound a
little isn't the equal sign has multiple
meanings well all that disappears in
Korea so so I'm get your call and then
the core of a sts
past also it looks like a series of
airline records if you look at this you
see down here see on school VAR and then
in the list is 8 than the firewall these
little these are the line numbers of the
original source to get source maps you
need to get column information in that
ASTC after you know to generate token
set math token set back to the source
code and then walk through and done
Rihanna tech is code with the color
information and that's a pain the ass
but if you do so a lot of wrestling for
that and then once I have this a STI
then how to do the old hangar and kick
it battery about and turn it into the
JavaScript AST which is basically a
large nest of Jason structure so that's
kind of this room the wrestling we now
have to entertain children does that and
it's basically working talking seven out
of 21 primitive our prayers and Colour
I'm I've got coded up so simply marking
working through bat in a systematic way
the test is pretty straightforward you
write 0 RS and functions of a ton of
value they compile it just ripped it
apart to align they're both executed the
results compared so you're looking for
identity testing pound sterling so it's
very nice to our test you just writer
and then I emotional clear it fails if
it once which isn't but now you get this
one it sort of spits out they doing them
DJ s but give my icon program JavaScript
program mode there's any ears can point
out well I know it's not
though some safety will be baking dirty
so you noticed uh producing this is
absolute compilation about Aboriginal
airline program you basically have to
put switched out in Central case stuff
and and just just go through things like
that there are some complications
because I'm in airline a function with
difficulties to your functions in
JavaScript a lot you functions function
it can take anarkali number of
characters and outreach number of
arguments and it's up to you they may or
may not have meaning tool in any way
anyways despite very very different
approach how I'm yet got to putting in
fun syntax and closures but i'm sure
i'll be leaving the closure script
source code a link to that and the
source map is a fairly ugly thing the
thing at the bottom is the numerical
Meyer transcode it's it's written in a
video compression algorithms make it
short as entire link on high school
these best patients in comprehensible
it's complete nightmare and the es con
generally does it for you as long as you
put come online in there AST so
something else is payment is more so I'd
run right out yourself is just just
build I mean it's a circus but so again
this is the actual the actual source map
the brain do it by using the native
structure beuerlein and I wash was pre
only contains three separate categories
of things
declarations Magna tree and ignored the
last three there has to be correct
nothing happens to it but there's their
attributes explore test and learn the
function declarations those are the only
three components and I'm film and the
attributes one of the sort of hidden
gems of early essentially though they're
after your hands on gchat a meaning
imputed them at a different point in the
software cycle so the standard ones
you're likely to see a defying including
export spec type of the day version at
any given point that hchildress take
part in the production of airline being
code will maybe use the map maybe you
sleep the attribute so finding a pretty
appalling expansion the second power
time attributes things I've altered
version of longtime tools the dialyzer
Chapman splash screen power use aspects
in a different way partly uses them and
essentially you can stick out like an
attribute so a lot of stuff that we need
to do to get running JavaScript system
we basically stuff we can start on two
attributes so because because web
workers in browser don't share code you
need specifying preload Orion tendencies
and doing a through require attribute so
anyway it's kind of legal fees you could
do quite a lot of stuff there to get
that done the other things which I put
the aim is to have a standard pure
functional data model which is what
you'll be mutating
developer and that basically you can see
from this definition thats a pig's ear
record of work it contains a list of
itself under the imageview unsur facts
video streaming services as opening and
closing tags so did spam page young etc
etc so an h1 tag can contain a list of
all the tags inside it which might be
dip style blah blah and you would then
subscribe to events on that model which
could either be done events like on
click or jQuery operate I gives you
pseudo events cross-browser events like
if you get unfocused and something
everyone change it presents it to you as
a as a synthetic event and so the aim is
that you will simply you taint on this
deck structure and the the presentation
CSS mapping resumption classes in the
first part will be bootstrap using them
that days without food truck passes they
give you one presentation that I think
the probably libraries that sits above
the basic model so that probably a forum
is likely to generate forms and you just
put in they see as it feels the types
and create a forum that matches that
quite worked out Allison work here but
but that last intentionally you survive
most ghastly don't stuff you know what's
going on you simply to operate on a pure
functional waiting on what which you can
then it takes over now that the issue
device types how to handle type so jar
script doesn't have an integer or float
type it has any number each is
represented by
I floats clearly there's a big man vs
32-bit issue there josh is my license
arrays kind of look like this but maybe
not how would your two cool about my
memories so I'm sort of wrestling with
with tight stock my thinking at the
moment is probably I'm going to define
JavaScript objects and that's an object
but this goes right now i can write
compiler cheaply and then it's some late
stage figure out how to implement an
efficiently but efficiency isn't my
primary viciously conversations and my
primary thing sighs of jobs that might
be I think the front pond so the roadmap
really is to get primitive work English
with the test suites which I'm working
on once you've got that that would
produce a snack busting by xml lang both
recursion sportbike calling itself
inside job stripped so you can go to
snack then i'll start finding the right
javascript transform like Rita they live
an expert ramp leading automatically
internal chain so it stops step busting
and then after that I'm gonna start
implementing server architecture and
then finally build the website system
that handles communications and there's
really some complications in Jacob I see
no it's not totally able to build a you
could do the nine things every browser
will have will be represented locally by
a poundin browser congrats into looking
back by a process to my online p ids
when we looking like I said Nesta to
should be proxies for mms on the web
page book I'm doing asking to work so
I'm probably going to abstract away that
process side of it so you just you have
an API like a gender brake lights and
that's just but you know users will be
identified by their signing
sessionid or their email account you
should go to brighten your o-line coach
send bill maher quick so calm this tuple
message that should just shred your
browser that's the plan we're going to
be pretty so we're going to Google's on
our plug so if you've got on Francie
students and also work on JavaScript
men's by people can't gain your alarm
code and glide see it go and don't
forget to follow me on Twitter you get
one of me and get a variety of stuff do
some airline and some Muslims if you
follow a lovely scripture mostly just
get lot of scripts in there and
sometimes I forget which treasure County
Minister small contd monsters and are
useless talking and you know me
sometimes it's easier to the dr cohen
vows injustice processes you need to
easy to see what 3d so you know I source
maps are deadly form yeah i mean so
Spencer I think so handsome American
Progress have to have to do that for
smart thing to watch the other is quite
difficult and if you language is basket
if you do javascript the whole what
constitutes work
to be quite painful but different going
forward I mean that the object comes out
at so different they will need to be
something but I kind of console what I
format to go anywhere so absolute
Vietnam but I know croc scripts been
resting like from every year so
it's getting better blue makes for fast
but they don't bother so I think I just
so I come I'm definitely this is that
your plan implement architecture this
for example if you wish to finish the
kitchen birthday so what's what's that
relational okay i mean the project the
moment still very very very very
primitive some lot of components on in
but i would ideally like I'd like to
move be roads up system where you could
define and then meet a record store a
little easier that we from our record
definition of generating and easiest
email a date object of form to edit
marked the web pages
to the lid and push that out and so that
I'd like to have a really easy way to
those simple form based websites so I
like together but it is still still a
lot uncertainty could be a lot
experiment to the weight actually
working website spot on thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
