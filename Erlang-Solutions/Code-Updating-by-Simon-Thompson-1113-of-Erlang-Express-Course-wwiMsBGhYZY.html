what I'm going to talk about today is
about hot code update it's possible in
Erlang to change the code that's running
in a module without taking a system down
so this allows you to this is one of the
features it gives our language it's six
9s availability and change running code
without taking a system down and
restarting what I'm going to do is show
you a short demonstration of how that
works and then talk through the details
of the technique so I'll talk about
software upgrade and they I'll then say
a tiny bit about the code server which
is the technology that underlies this
and the dotter Erlang file so let's look
at an example
in fact what I've done is I've got the
example here on the on the board and
what we've got here is a server process
this s sets the server going it spawns
from module s this module the loop with
no parameters and it registers it in
whatever name we want and what we're
going to do in this example is run a
couple of examples and see how they see
how they have different behavior so
that's the thing that starts the server
here's the the loop of the server and
what that does is receive typically
receives messages of PID and a number
and it returns to that PID the number
doubled I've highlighted that in red
because that's the thing we're going to
change when we do software upgrade well
you can also send to the to the running
process an update message and that calls
the loop again but in a fully qualified
format and we'll see that that has a
particular effect and finally we've got
a client code and what this client does
is send to the named process the clients
PID together with an X so this is the
clients that sends a message and what it
does is it simply receives a message and
and outputs out so there's the piece of
client code here's the server here's the
thing that in spawns the server here's
the loop that forms the body of the
okay
and what you can see in this in the
running example is that we've compiled
that module s that's the first step what
we do next is we spawn to two versions
of that server so we've called s : s
with two arguments the first is the Adam
server one and the other is Adam server
two so what we have is two of those
servers running with the names server 1
and server 2 and you can see that we've
tied those particular servers to this
this version of the code with the blue
arrows there in the in the graphic now
what I'm going to do is and you can see
the effect here
I'm sending as a client I'm sending them
something server one I said one two
server one I get the answer to I do the
same two server two I get the same
answer now what I'm going to do is
modify the code and what I've done is
I've replaced that code that said X plus
X with code that now says x times X and
let's see what we do next what I'm going
to do is compile the code you can see
I've compiled their module s and I have
sent to server one an update message
only server one not server two and now
let's send a message to each of those
servers and what you see is that the
results from server one is now one it's
X - 1 times 1 or as a result from server
2 is 1 plus 1 is 2 and you can see that
these two servers are running the
different versions of the code you can
see that from the from the graphic now
let's have a look what I've done now is
modify it a second time and this time
what I do is return the value X so the
first version of the code returned X
plus X the second version returned X
times X this final version returns X and
let's see what's happening so we've got
at the moment
server1 is running the pink code server
2 is running the gray code now let's
compile again and let's update server 1
again and now what you can see what has
happened here is that the gray code has
disappeared you can only have two
versions of the code in the system the
newer one is the green the older one is
the pink so now if we perform an update
and we call server 2 again we will get
an error so you can see here I've apt
the call to the server 2 inside a catch
and what we're getting is an an exit
there because that process is terminated
because the code has disappeared so as
code disappears is typically the erlang
mechanism is if something no longer
works
don't try and handle the failure but
just fail and let something else in the
system
handle that so I think what will - what
I'll talk about next is I think we can
see that server 1 here
server 1 is running and server one's
running that latest that data's green
version of the code if we pass the
argument for we get back in the argument
the result 4 so that's returning X it's
not returning X plus X or x times X it's
returning the latest version and you can
see you saw through this example there
were always two versions of it up to two
versions of the code available in the
system we started off with the grey
version then we had the grey and pink
and then we had the pink and green so
I'll talk through the mechanism for how
how processes update code how the code
is Cheri's is held within the system and
so on now but that's a nice example that
illustrates pretty much the basics of
what's going on with software upgrade so
two versions of a module can be loaded
in the runtime system at any one time
we've seen that I the the gray or the
pink or the pink or the green and the
process can run either version
it's possible for one process to be
running the old version for another to
be running the current if the process
running the old version has a
fully-qualified function call made to
code in the in the module that's been
upgraded the module reference will be
updated to point to the latest version
so a fully qualified function call made
to any of the functions in that module
will update all of them so the update is
on a module basis not on a function
basis and you can see here we've now
moved so the both versions both of the
processes there are running the current
version now if we have a situation where
we load we've got a 8 a module running
the old version and we upgrade to a
third version then the module that's
running version 1 will be killed and and
it will crash as we saw in the example
so there are only two versions so even
if there are there are modules still
running the old code they don't carry on
running the old code they are killed so
we know that the code in the system is
either running the old version or the
current version it can't run any
versions older than that and the system
as I said earlier what will happen is
other things that supervisory processes
or whatever we'll have to deal with that
process having died and we'll have to
restart it or whatever so it's important
to know how code is loaded into the
runtime system if you call the function
a modular function for a module which is
not already loaded that will load the
code for the module into the system if
you compile the module using C of module
in the shell that will load the system
or you can explicitly using the code
module which is a module which contains
functions that operate perform various
operations over the code if you call the
load file function from the code module
that
explicitly load the code and just to
remind you a fully-qualified function
call is a call of the form module :
function with the arguments rather than
simply function so you saw here in the
example I was talking about this is a
fully qualified call to the loop L I
don't need to to do that I could within
this module just call L at the empty
with no arguments but this fully
qualified call will mean to that if we
process if we receive the message update
we call the loop in a fully qualified
form so that will load a new version so
hence the use of the fully qualified
name there and not there so while we are
receiving messages but not an update we
use the old version but as soon as we
receive an update version update message
we load the new so the code server is
the is the mechanism that handles
dynamic loading of modules and the way
that the code server has a fixed
mechanism for looking for compiled
versions of a module and that's using
what's called the code path and the code
path is a list of directories list of
folders and those are searched
sequentially for the module that we want
to load and the first success so it's
loaded from the first the first place
that it's found if again another
function for the code module is the get
path function that will return a listing
of all the directories in the path and
that includes some by default it
includes the current working directory
and it includes directories in the sub
in the Lib subdirectory of where Erlang
is installed on your system
that's the dollar Erlang root variable
which says where the where the Erlang
system is installed now it's possible to
add to manipulate that path using
the functions add half a chance at the
beginning of the list and add pastor Zed
we chance at the end of the list again
those are functions which are in the in
the code module so that allows us
programmatically to change what's in
that list so here's an example if you
perform the add path a operation and
then do perform get path you can see
what we get back is a list of strings
and indeed the first string in there is
the C colon slash tools directory and
then typically you look first in the dot
which is the current directory and then
you look through the so typically you'll
look for versions of a module in your
current directory before you look in the
libraries so the code server can
explicitly remove an old version of a
module that's called purging and you can
see that there are two purge functions
in the code module the purge will remove
the old version and kill any processes
which are running it and it returns the
result true if it has killed any
processes so that will irrespective of
whether processes are using it or not
will remove that old version a soft
purge will remove the old version only
if no processes are running it and that
again returns true if that was a
successful operation so that allows you
to to remove it but only if it's safe to
do so without without killing any
processes so let's look at an example of
this in practice you can see here what
we're doing is we're compiling the
module s twice so if we perform a soft
purge we are we get the result true
there is an old version there but
nothing is using it now let's run an
instance of the server let's call it
server one and if we perform a soft
purge now we can't open sorry if we
compile it again and then perform a soft
purge the result is false we can't purge
that code because the server is already
running that code now we can send a
message to it and what we get back is
the is the result we'd expect the result
we see from here we get 1 plus 1 so we
get 2 running there now we can purge the
code and that's that's returned true
because there was a vote that was a
process running that code and then if we
try and call that server again we get a
we can see that the system has crashed
because what that will do is is purge
all processes that are running the old
code you can see that happening there
and now if we if we compile again and
purge we get the result false because
there are no processes running the old
version of the code ok
now there's typically in your home
directory there's there's a dot Erlang
file which in which you can place
expressions which are executed every
time the runtime system is started and
that's usable for a number of pieces of
setup that you can see some examples at
the bottom here you can see an example
of adding a particular directory to the
beginning of the search path you can see
an example of setting a cookie which is
something that can be used in when
you're using early distributed airline
and finally you can you can output a
message which says for example that
these things have been loaded and that's
the end of this section we've seen that
what we can do is in a running system
upgrade the code for a module and we've
seen the mechanism by which new versions
of the code for a module are loaded
interred by the code loader we've seen
that you can have two versions running
an old version and the current version
but only two so if a third version is
added the oldest is removed and any
processes running that will be killed
we've seen ways that we can handle and
per explicitly purge versions of the
code and we've seen that those can be
done in a way that either preserves
running processes or will kill processes
which are running the old version of the
code but in total this allows you to on
a large running system selectively
update whichever parts of the system you
wish and assuming that that interfaces
are preserved and so on that can be done
without disturbing any other part of the
system so preserving this six 9s
reliability that shelling is famous for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
