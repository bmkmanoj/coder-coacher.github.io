running over I'm gonna be really quick
so a little bit of background for the
last two years I have been really
focused on building the startup and I'm
gonna give a talk about that tomorrow
for various reasons most of them falling
under startup life we had to wind down
the company so I found myself with some
time on my hands and I hate being bored
so I started pondering kind of the
current state of things and start I
started noticing some patterns and I
started thinking about well what are
ways that I could try to to improve the
state of the world a little bit and and
some of this I think comes from like
I've got a daughter she's in high school
almost done with high school and I don't
want to get into politics at all but
only to say I'm not entirely thrilled
with the current state of the world
regardless of your political bent and
we'll leave it at that so if you look at
some recent Tisha events we've got
things like brexit the recent election
here in the States for folks that maybe
keep up in more international world
you've got the recent Dutch general
election and the state coming up of the
French presidential election here in the
next couple of months in regardless of
where you fall on the political spectrum
I think the rise that you certainly see
across a lot of countries of things like
populism are really symptoms of a much
larger problem and that problem comes
down to I think two things it's access
to information and it's understanding
and I think as engineers and a software
developers and UX designers we are kind
of uniquely positioned to help improve
the state of of how this stuff works if
you think about like public data the
first thing that comes to mind is it's
not exactly the easiest stuff to look at
or use or the easiest stuff to try to
wrap your head around yet we'll spend a
lot of time in industry making like a
Dan'l it
it's really easy to understand and grasp
which is where what made me think of
this quote from Jeff he's one of the
cofounders of cloud era and was a quant
on Wall Street before he found in cloud
era so I wanted to highlight just a
couple of things that I have an
extremely brief demo and then I'll be
done there is a wealth of information
already out there that's really
accessible
something I didn't know - like two weeks
ago the United States has a github org
go figure and there is a ton of stuff
already available under this org a lot
of these tools run in docker containers
so there is accessible is like
installing doctrine than doing docker
run and some command to pull down data
so here's another one of one particular
one I found useful from the same org
this is all the legislators that have
ever served in Congress current going
all the way back to the founding of the
country and just it's is it's you know
it's as accessible as a git clone they
have much more involved tools as well
that you can use to track like
progressive votes through legislature
and there's equivalent tooling I found
like in the UK and in the EU so some
ideas you know content analysis applying
things like text rank text indexing
sentiment analysis to statements that
are made in in Congress to legal the the
legal terminology in legislature I found
that some of this is actually open
research problems like no one has
actually found a great text summer asian
text summarization algorithm to apply in
the legal domain because the the
structure of the documents and the type
of terminology that's used is is so much
different from like just standard cloak
wheel English visualizations stuff like
voting trends by region by party by
legislature by topic all that kind of
these are all things that we know that
we already do in other domains and other
contexts and you know it just seems like
it would be a great thing if we found
some time to do this you know for the
public so here is where yeah all right
so this is something I've been working
on in my spare time and so this is based
just on the data from those tools I
showed you from the United States github
repo this is also a Phoenix app so I'm
doing my part in doing like the ER lying
elixir thing so you can pick you know
any state let's look at say well I'm
from North Carolina so let's pick North
Carolina and so this shows you this is
pulling from census data this shows you
the bottom is the percentage of the
population living at or below the
poverty line and the the red line you
have to use the axis on the other side
that's the actual state population going
back from 2000 up to 2016 and then this
up here is our as the current senators
and all the sitting representatives well
this is just getting started but I feel
like you know when you show people
information this way versus having to
wait for you know some some crisis or
some big movement to happen where that
information comes out in the news if
people had a easier kind of more
intuitive way to access this information
I just seems like it would be a really
nice thing to have that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
