evolution yeah I did kind of change name
a little bit viva la evolution for those
of you who don't know me I'm Johnny win
on the internet so i'm known as Johnny
rugger most people ask me why are you
Johnny rugger and not Johnny win on the
internet so i used to play rugby I'm
retired which is rugby speak for my wife
won't let me play anymore apparently
after you know knee surgery broken arm I
can tell you some great rugby stories
she's like you know you use those hands
for coding so and she's always afraid
I'm going to get head trauma so anyway
so yes some of you may know I've heard
of how many of you heard of the elixir
fountain so everybody's gonna go out
listen books are fountain tomorrow right
no y'all are is this not coming out
until Monday's the 12 episodes comin out
so yeah we talked mainly about elixir
but I also cover topics from around the
beam ecosystem I've had Joe on I've had
Robert on you're trying to get more
people on and you know try to build the
community not just a lick sir but try to
get everybody involved by day I'm a
developer I work for an enterprise
company I'm not allowed to disclose that
information well match I build mostly
back-end services today but we're going
to talk about something completely
different I'm not going to tell you
about all that kind of fun stuff which
is really boring because its health care
I'm going to talk about genetics and
evolution now there's a bit of a
disclaimer for this talk I am NOT a
geneticist I know it's shocking but it's
true but I don't even play one on TV
which is really bad so you're probably
asking right now why do I know our why
am i giving this talk well I do know
something about spawning child processes
yes there's seven of them for those that
are slow at math they are all mine well
I say that my wife and I have a very
unique situation so it's what's referred
to as yours mine and ours she had to I
had three together we have to can you
guess whose is whose may be made nom
it's funny because when we all go out in
public everybody almost always assumes
that there are all our kids now you know
there's a funny story so this is
Ricky my stepson everybody say hi Ricky
because he's going to watch this video
later and so now he knows everybody said
hi John so I was visited in college
because he's off at college he's going
to Florida State University which I'm
very proud of because I was born and
raised in Seminole I was hanging out
with him and some of his friends were
waiting to go to one of the football
games and one of his friends came up in
it's like ah you two look so alike
usually identified it and we both look
at each other kind of laugh like that
this is my stepson but I mean the funny
that you know some of it has to do with
I mean we've been around each other for
ten years and a lot of that comes out
you know just mannerisms you know you're
being around the same environment you
know we probably have the same postures
and things like that but we also all
have blue eyes and plus my wife and I
look fairly similar actually you we both
have brown hair we both kind of look
about the same that whole Irish heritage
sort of thing but but you know it's
funny about the blue eyes peace is so
you'll figure out a little bit more
about this later but so blue eyes is
actually a recessive gene so it's
supposedly going by the wayside you know
because eventually since it's recessive
it'll eventually kind of work its way
out of the gene pool I think our red
hairs another thing that's kind of now
by on the way out when it comes to
genetics could mean another 50 100 200
years but it just means it's going to
become less prominent but there's a
darker side to genetics and I want to
talk about this so this is ricky i'm
going to take you back about i guess
nine years i guess it was something like
that i don't know i'm a dad so i don't
really remember how he was in fourth
grade but we had had a great summer we
had spent the summer you know doing all
sorts of fun stuff my wife and i had
only been together probably about a year
and stuff and so we were traveling
around doing a lot of things but we
noticed that he was drinking a lot of
fluids like constantly Thirsty's like
every time we turned around he was
thirsty and then you almost immediately
turned around to go to the bathroom well
having had some trouble with like our
diabetes before and has his grandfather
is actually a type 1 diabetic you know
we started getting a little concerned
and so we went and took him to have to
get tested for diabetes and you know of
course you're waiting for the test
results here comes the first day of
fourth grade my wife who is a teacher at
the school that
he was attending was in class and she
gets a call first thing in the morning
it's the doctor's office can you bring
ricky in well yeah it's the first day of
school can we do it like say Friday
because you know I'm teaching I've got
the class that I've got he's just
getting us she was well when we say can
you bring him in when I mean like can
you bring him in this morning and not to
the doctor's office to the hospital so
he spent the first three days of fourth
grade in a hospital bed trying to get
his blood Sugar's down from 500 now if
you don't know what your blood sugar
should be how many people know what your
blood sugar should be yeah it's like 80
to 100 so the fact that he was over 500
was like really scary and they were
really concerned about it now obviously
because all the kids don't have type 1
diabetes this is this is probably a
recessive a recessive gene or I would
assume it's recessive gene now and
conversations I had I know I saw him
coming here somewhere yeah he's back
there he's a doctor he told me that it's
also possible that you know some type of
environmental thing trigger yes maybe
it's hereditary will they put your
positive it's red cherry but it may have
been triggered by something in the
environment because I got sick I think
what you said a virus or something like
that they could have okay so that's
still all up in the air but it brings up
another concern so my son who's in he
cute so this is my youngest he's five I
think this picture is probably for
notice those big blue eyes everybody
does so take the time let's all take the
time and look at it he's also drinking
Gatorade which is hilarious because I
just told you the kids were drinking
sugary drinks all the time but anyway my
wife is kind of concerned because all
the other kids seemed fine but he's also
young and so it's kinda like well it is
he gonna get diabetes is he gonna get
cuz i could imagine having to give him a
shot you know for the first you know
several years until he told Ricky got on
the pump he was actually taking insulin
so but this brings us to Gammy's so and
that's part of the reproductive process
where like when reproduction happens you
actually split your DNA and you give
half of it over and that's the gamete
that's passed on to the next generation
and so we don't know it could be my wife
could have passed that over
she might not have but understanding
these processes is going to help us
build our petri dish so what are we
going to talk about today we're gonna
start with covering a brief history of
evolution now we're going to look at
kind of what Darwin discovered when he
made his major voyage and found the
Galapagos Islands but we're also going
to get some simple genetics now remember
that disclaimer I'm not a geneticist so
I'm going to do my best and I'm going to
keep it simple we're wanting to showcase
kind of what OTP can do and some of the
ways that i use to create it but we do
need to have a basic understanding of
some genetic processes so that we can
make sure that we replicate them as
close as possible although there's going
to be some part from 30 minutes until
the doctor in the back to cover his ears
and then we're going to build stuff
we're gonna actually see some code
believe it or not I'm not just going to
sit up here and run my mouth although I
might set up here and run my mouth but
we'll see some code on the screen so
let's get started the world in 1831
everybody remembers that right well is a
very different world from what we know
today especially with our understanding
of evolution up until this point
remember that most scholars largely
supported the idea of design a divine
design in nature in fact Darwin himself
studded William Paley everybody knows
William Paley right Dave you met him
before right yeah well William Paley
wrote the I'm gonna have to read this
one because it's a it's a big one
natural theology or evidences of the
eggs our existence and attributes of the
deity now Darwin studied this a
Cambridge but in 1931 Darwin's set out
on a two-year journey on the HMS Beagle
he was a self-funded and very green no
pun intended naturalist on board the
ship but he wasn't even the chief
naturalist that job actually belonged to
Robert McCormick and he was the the ship
surgeon this was supposed to be a
two-year boys that turn into
five years hence the feature creep this
also sounds like some other story that
I've heard about everybody remembers
Gilligan's Island right okay I'm not
okay I know some people in here have to
so the interesting part of about the
voyage came when they discovered the
Galapagos Islands so Darwin noted that
mockingbirds on the islands although
similar to the ones that are found in
mainland Chile had small variations and
they even buried from island island but
it was also the tortoises each Island
had tortoises with very unique shell
patterns these variations would suggest
that although a species may have may
have originated from a single species
isolation and natural selection cause
variations to emerge that helped the
species survive in a given environment
now this is one of my favorite quotes
because it seems like it probably
applies to developers as well as I guess
natural selection the best developers
the ones that are responsive to change
now of course these ideas that Darwin
had and he's presenting go against most
of the what was commonly accepted at the
time is divine design and of course
Darwin would go on to publish origin of
species and pretty much be considered
the father of modern evolution or the
father of modern evolution theory so now
we're going to get to some genetics and
we need to understand some of the simple
genetics so we can see how variations
can go from generation to generation
Gregor Mendel now he was a monk at st.
Thomas Abbey and he experimented on pea
plants and the time was around 1956 in
1963 you're probably asking why p plants
pea plants are actually what's
considered now a model organism because
they're they're easy to maintain and
breed in the laboratory setting at the
time it was common thought that genes
were passed on through blended
inheritance now blended inheritance is
when the average of the two parents
traits get passed on let's take into
consideration height say we have a setup
errands like this now with blended
inheritance what we would say is the
offspring would be the average of those
Heights well as you can see with the
next generation everything gets kind of
close similar together now if you keep
going down this chain eventually
everything is going to kind of go across
and everybody would be exactly the same
height we can also see this when we use
limited sample sizes when we first run
our experiment today we're going to
actually have just two organisms that
start the whole pool and in a relatively
short amount of time where this seems
very similar make up to the identity of
each organism now men go focused and I
know this is probably hard to see in the
back but mental focus basically on plant
traits the trades are phenotypes
phenotypes is another word for traits he
focused on the the color the shape the
height the like the flower variations
and things like that and he noticed that
they weren't always an average in fact
he noticed that some traits were
dominant and recessive today has anybody
seen the punnett square awesome so today
we can use this to track Mendelian
inheritance basically what a punnett
square is is you take the parental and
the parental and paternal I'll get that
right eventually paternal and maternal
and you can actually see the dominant
now in this case we have two two
heterozygous I got parents where we have
the big G little Y big G little why
we're using these to say green and
yellow because we're talking about
plants and so the big G or the big
letter when you see something like this
is generally the dominant trait the
little letter is the recessive trait now
when we run through this we can actually
see that if these two parents actually
produce offspring we would actually have
fifty percent of the time we would have
green with a yellow recessive
twenty-five percent of time we would
have just green dominant and twenty-five
percent of the time you would actually
produce yellow plants well what happens
if we actually use a parent with homos I
got which would be the two of the same
and so we could take that and these
would almost always be one hundred
percent whoa in this case they would
always be a hundred percent green
because you would always have the
dominant green trait there now taking
this another step further we can do
multiple so in this case we take the
color trait and we also take the height
trait which big t little T is going to
be our height and so we're going to say
you know when you actually do at the
punnett square you actually come to a
ratio more like this where fifty percent
are fifty six percent of the time now
these aren't to the actual number of
these are rounded but fifty six percent
of the time we're going to have tall
green plants nineteen percent of the
time we'll have yell at all nineteen
percent of time we'll have yellow sure
sure yeah and then six percent of time
will have do so in a very small
percentage will actually produce short
yellow plans so it came from Mendel's
findings became known as Mendel's law
the first Mendel's law is law of
segregation when game its form meaning
you split a parent splits its DNA just
send over for reproduction the gene is
actually split and only one allele so
when you the big G little G or big G
little why I guess I used that would be
those are Eagles in each trait so only
one of those alleles is passed over in
the offspring the law of independent
assortment means that the selection of
one try one trait has nothing to do with
the other trait so the fact that you
passed over the green trade does not
necessarily mean you're going to pass
over the tall trait they're completely
independent the third law being the law
of dominance and this is where we see
the dominant and recessive traits where
we have dominant recessive traits and if
a dominant allele is passed over that
will always be the visible trait you see
now the funny thing about Mendel's
findings is is they went largely
unnoticed for 30 years until somebody
else independently discovered them and
then started actually saying hey wait
this this guy was onto something and
then basically was all rediscovered so
let's move on let's build some things
everybody ready to see some code yeah
yeah see we got to make the whole room
feel like it's full and actually for
those at home it is actually kind of
full so let's see some code hot you
thought you're going to see Co in the
next slide so let's actually just lay
out everything that we have first so
we're going to need to basically build
this whole system we need a petri dish
we need organisms we need to have some
way of having a gene pool that kind of
lives outside of organisms this is kind
of one of the problems I have but the
biological clock and the DNA store we
need a biological clock to live and let
this organism know when it lives in when
it dies and so that's actually the first
thing that we're going to build before
we worry about reproduction before we
worry about DNA storage or any of the
events that are going to be needed we
need to actually have something that
lives right so we'll start simple we'll
create our petri dish will add add an
organism which is a supervisor which is
actually going to supervise a set of
processes just like you know you
supervise all the processes in your body
and we're going to have a biological
clock which will be a gen server and
then we're going to use a gen event to
handle death so basically we're going to
send a notification that says hey we're
dead it was funny when I was playing
around with this i was using larger so
that i could see like when things were
firing off and stuff like that and I had
you know nothing lasts forever and then
that would die that's great all right so
let's look at our petri dish first now
couple things to note and this is one of
the things i want to highlight now we
have these organisms but you know what's
great about Erlang is it will restart
processes for you we don't want to
restart them we want them to die so we
say transient so that it doesn't start
up immediately we actually have to
trigger it to start and then we use
simple one for one strategy so that it
doesn't restart restart automatically
this yeah this will actually keep them
from automatically restarting after they
die which prevents any zombies because
we don't want organisms that are zombies
that's another movie and another another
talk probably at some point so let's
look at our organism now this is
actually in a module but I kind of cut
it because you know of course on the
screen it doesn't all fit so pretend
this is in a
because it is so here's our organism
we're going to actually initiate the
organism we're going to pass in some
information about the orders and
basically what we're to do is we're
going to pass in the two gametes that
are going to come together and form it
now we're using what's what's called
single gene inheritance which is a nice
simple way of saying we're just going to
take two genes and stick them together
and move on we're not going to take into
consideration x-linked inheritance which
has to do with like whether or not it's
on the the X chromosome or why currently
it this is just simple stuff we don't
wanna get too complicated but one of the
things that we want to say is we're
going to use a struct in our organism
because we want to kind of define some
things so like we're going to store like
the name of this organism we're going to
have the birth time we're also going to
have an easy way to say it to pass in
these games so we're going to have size
color and speed now when I say is speed
that's going to be our reproduction
speed and that's going to vary for
organism based on the trait that's
passed in now when an organized them is
when an organism is actually created one
of the things that we're going to do is
we're going to create the organism so we
basically take the gametes that came
into the organism at the time we start
and pass it in it's going to do some
stuff it's going to create a birth time
which is we just use Erlang system time
which is nice and convenient the name
everybody's going to love me but I'm
actually generating atoms on the fly and
using the process that i'm using plus
the birth time it was a nice handy way
for me to be able to communicate and you
know what this is never going to
production just this little but then
what we do is we want to combine our
trades so we want to combine colors we
want to combine speed and we want to
combine the size this adds to our
organism and so we can pass that into
our DNA we'll get to that in a minute so
see now the biological clock we want to
look at because that's our next server
so we need a biological clocks that is
going to actually kind of manage these
life processes at a different level when
we when we kick off the biological clock
it immediately if you see we do a
process send after so how fun is this
you know when you're going to die the
second you're born
you know but what I did was is so I gave
it a cap I didn't want to necessarily
say that you know all these organisms
are going to die at the same time but I
want them to die in a scope of time so
like everything else this organism can
actually go out and get hit by a bus
earlier than it was expected so I use
random everybody loves random right so
the death is actually setting so that we
send to we send to itself a message of
death who thought it was going to be
this fun right I'm telling you debugging
this thing was great so yeah so you send
a message of death at a predetermined
time based on a cap basically so they
could die at any point in time that it
did its living then we actually actually
yeah and so you see down here our death
function we're just going to notify the
bio events which is our Event Manager
for for all our events the death has
happened and send the organism so that
that way the petri dish knows that it's
dead now that's here till organism see
you get to write things like that that's
awesome so when it comes in is just
going to terminate the child process so
there we have it we have life and death
of an organism we have a petri dish that
now starts up an order or we tell it to
start it up it'll actually create a new
organism it'll put it in the petri dish
it will monitor it and then at some
point that's predetermined at birth the
organism will die so now we need to
store DNA so we're going to use asian
for this how many are elixirs in here
verse erlanger 'he's lectures
I thought everybody would raise your
hand all at once that would be awesome
all right now our lingers how many are
familiar of the earlier is with an agent
okay so an agent is basically a wrapper
around Jen servers just to kind of it's
an abstraction for a gem server and we
use them typically the liq store to
store state so we also have task which
is another wrapper around Jen server
which is more for single calls type
things now the Asia is not it's not only
going to store the genes for a
particular organism but it's also
responsible for sharing the Gammons so
when reproduction happens you're going
to call into the to the DNA store and
you're going to say give me a gaming
let's look at that so here's our DNA did
you think your DNA looked like this no
this is awesome so when you start the
link it's actually going to pass in the
organism and it's going to set the agent
to the organism so that it can later on
call it there's my process name which is
going to put a lovely Adam on there for
me but then I can actually go down here
and we can see where we're retrieving
the game aids now this one right here
we're going to split the pears so
remember what I said about the the law
of segregation and the independent
assortment so we're going to want to we
don't want anything to whether the
colors passed over we don't want that
any influence on the the speed of
reproduction or the size of the the
organism so we're going to split the
pair's we're going to split them
individually and so we also use down
here you can see where i use sit on this
line that's what pairs at random so yeah
i'm using enum random to actually grab
one of the two and just send it over all
right so now we're ready to move on to
reproduction
yeah so we're going to go ahead and add
reproduction to the to the biological
clock and if you see we have about three
functions in the middle of the screen
there where we actually based on the
speed remember we had those header or
heterozygous and homozygous trace where
we say if it's FF that means that's the
the dominant trait that's the fastest
one that it could be and so we're going
to we're going to reproduce also I use
random here to where I say that it's not
necessarily always but it's at the max
what 2.5 seconds so at some point in
time it's going to actually reproduce in
that amount of time now the recessive
the FF is the slowest possible
reproduction rate and then anything else
it's probably about it it's an average
of the two it's totally scientific trust
me I ran it past somebody don't follow
me up on that so we're going to go ahead
and we're going to add our biological
event so that the reproduction handler
is going to listen when when it's time
to reproduce it's going to send a signal
and then we're going to actually raise
this event the events going to be caught
and pass over its gay mates into the
gene pool and then hopefully everything
works so the gene pool and a spawn
handler so here's our gene pool now if
you'll notice at the top I have fitness
which we're going to actually use that
as a gate how many people are familiar
with genetic algorithms okay how many
people are familiar with fitness of a
genetic algorithm okay so we want to say
that this is our model or that like this
is the perfect scenario if I get this
gaming this is the the best possible
mate for any organism because everybody
wants to be really fast and I'd switch
these letters that C is supposed to be a
G but I did it kind of last minute and
didn't swap out the slide so just bear
with me but smaller organs so we want
something that's small and reproduces
fast and it's going to be of the color
green let's eat that's our fitness so
here's how we figure out the best match
we're actually going to call in to best
match and we're going to see we want to
get the best match if it's there but if
it's not there we're still going to try
to
juice because that's what organisms do
they just try to reproduce so ideally
we've got a pattern-matching there to
see as we're looping over the set that's
in the gene pool if it matches that
Fitness that perfect match it's going to
use that one and then if it doesn't it's
just going to grab one now if it doesn't
find any genes in the gene pool it's
just gonna it's just going to basically
leave the gene because keep in mind
we're basically building plants here
where you know and so the idea is that
you know it's like pollen in the air
sort of thing hopefully something gets
at some point but we do actually have
our event to spawn the organism which
we're going to call back out and say
when it comes time we're going to go
ahead and spawn the organism which is
going to tell the petri dish to create a
new organism based on the two-game mates
that it has and there we have it added
in there now the real question that
everybody's asking right now does it
work no no yeah seriously I've tested
this before trust me hold on so the
first thing that we're going to do is
we're going to actually give it to
organisms and I actually updated this so
remember all that commented out code
well it's not going to be coming out
anymore let's see here yeah let's see
hold on bear with me okay so here's our
code so we're going to have we have two
organisms that are passing in two
different gametes so we're going to go
ahead and we're going to spin up to
brand new organisms and let's see what
we see here no all right so you see the
DNA is actually spit out to the screen
now based on the time it looks like some
of them are slower and the anticipation
oh look we got a couple of yellow ones
yes these are all spawning new organisms
they're going through the whole process
of reproduction and the other thing is
if I can show you this yeah so if we can
zoom in this is really hard to do when
it's on my screen it's even harder to do
okay let's see I'm going to try to find
one
but keep in mind uh see this over here I
know exactly I know let's see what's
funny is is an observer at some point
observer just crap sounds like I'm done
you know all right let's kill bees
because we're going to go ahead and add
some more
all right clear all right ready oh I'm
trying to catch him quick they start
like blowing up and then if I said it'll
be slow at first let me see if I can
grab this in MO mmhmm yeah so originally
what I did was I had started down the
path of actually having like a petri
dish you could see and dropping
organisms in there the problem with it
is is most of it was in JavaScript
almost actually all of it was in
JavaScript and so I was basically having
to report through I'm going to see if I
can talk and see if i can actually
crashed my laptop because I know Joe
really wants to see a laptop crash in
one of these so the problem with it was
is there was like so much code i would
have to explain like how i actually did
that I was like okay and believe it or
not I was actually going to talk about
both mitosis and meiosis and I was like
okay I've got to cut stuff out because
it's too long most people are going to
just want the conference you know to
grab a beer or something like that so
yeah this is actually for Erlang it's
what is it boo boo graph yeah you need
to predators e yeah I know yes well
let's see what's fun is you can let you
zoom into these and somewhere you can
find the petri dish
ah no haven't now it's what it is is the
oh yeah they probably all so at some
point so the problem with this okay like
in a typical like DNA strand I mean we
talked about like humans you have like
oh actually I'm going to kill this
because I do have some more to talk
about and yeah they are kind of all just
the same so you'd have like a larger
spectrum of trace and things like that
so you would have more variation keep in
mind genetics is way more complicated
than I just made it it's just I mean
there's all sorts of things like even
seen a trait depending on where it is in
the actual chain like maybe if it's
closer to this trait that this trait
then it might appear if it doesn't you
know there's all sorts of like crazy
like logic behind it I I mean actually
it's as complicated as they started
working on it and correct me if I'm
wrong to map the human genome in like
nineteen eighty eight I think it was
somewhere like it was in like the 80s
you know when they finished it 2003 and
really the way they finished it was it's
as done as we can get it because we
don't know the rest is basically the
summer so you know exactly so let's see
oh see i just said let's see him this
sign says let's see all right well we
did that so we have more organisms so i
know what you're asking yourself right
now what was the point of the first part
of the talk other than the genetics
thing well there's really nothing new
here at all and especially i'm sure the
people out there in earlier is like okay
so you split up a few processes what's
the big deal well everything that i
built existed it was all there even
before elixir i leveraged OTP which has
been around since the mid-90s and Erling
has been around for more than a decade
before that but Mendel didn't invent
genetics and Darwin didn't invent
evolution what they did was they shared
the discoveries that they found
now this is something and actually
Dave's talk it was kind of funny sitting
in the Davis talk because it's very
similar to the talk that i'm going to
give so i started this my elixir status
thing I don't know if anybody's seen
that on the Internet people probably
what the hell is all this my elixir
status stuff well it's really about
sharing your discoveries the problem
with a new language is you might be on
in Argentina Dave in Texas and you both
find this great thing but you don't know
about the other person and you don't
know that it's there well if that
happens and that persists then how does
the language grip so the fact is we have
to share what we discover this is all
great tools this conference I was here
two years ago and it's a completely
different field there the community's
grown the communities gotten bigger
everybody I remember the first time I
was here you know elixir was like okay
yeah they lose your kids over in the
back you know don't worry about it but
this year we're right in the middle of
everything else and the thing is is the
community has to work together to grow
and the only way we're going to do that
is we're going to share the discoveries
we refined because the thing is is I go
out and I present to people and they're
like yeah well sure sure it's faster you
say it's faster well then Chris goes out
and proves it we can talk about things
we can actually say yes this is great
but until we prove it to people until we
show our discoveries they're not going
to make sense they're not going to
believe you and so we can either just
sit back and just enjoy our language and
just enjoy working on what we work on or
we can go out and share people and
convince other people that this is a
great thing and we should participate in
it so my lecture status if anybody wants
to know is all about discovery letting
everybody know what you're working on
and sharing it and you know I've had a
lot of great feedback on it I've had a
lot of people say you know I discovered
a lick sir and then I discovered my
elixir status and it made me realize
that there's other people using it so
that's all I have thank you
and my laptop didn't crash all right so
any questions yeah and so I mean so the
problem with the random is random and
there's only two so at some point if you
end up starting to get it you can get
stuck in a loop and what I found it is
i'm surprised that it did it with more I
found it happen more frequently when I
had less organisms to start with because
it was like I guess a shorter time you
would think now we could probably change
some of these and it would last longer
because but I mean it's it's kind of
like when you look at the the punnett
square where it's like yet fifty percent
of fifty six percent at a time but
there's still that six percent and if
that six percent ends up for some reason
just an anomaly and it happens more
often than you would think you know
you're going to end up running into a
scenario with this but yeah I had
several test scenarios the cool thing
about this is it's different every time
I run it sometimes it lasts longer
sometimes it lasts shorter sometimes
it's kind of like because it's it's
splitting and in there and there's no
there's no logic behind it it's like
it's either taking one or the other and
each one is separate so it's always
giving one or the other so anybody else
I do need to add predators the other
thing that I wanted to do was add food
because my thought was is I if I could
draw it all out and have it into our
food so adding to that biological clock
of saying that yes you might be ready to
mate but the the need for food Trump's
that so you have to go eat so you can't
reproduce until you've fed and then then
you can reproduce and so and if you
don't feed in a certain amount of time
then you would die and you would you're
you know the genes wouldn't so yeah you
can make this as complicated as you
wanted yes I didn't count yeah I didn't
actually get a count on them usually I
just let it run and watch it for a few
minutes and but I mean it's getting mmm
sure it gets into the thousands pretty
quick because it's too it's funny like
we'll start it up again real quick I
think we got time right
change the size of that I'm table yeah
yeah well here I want to show this will
be so if you notice like the first to
drop in and then they reproduce now this
rate right here is slow but in a few
seconds you're going to have enough
organisms and you're going to have a
shorter reproduction time on those
organisms into where they're going to
start like just like throat like yeah
probably any second now yeah then the
reproduction rate increases which means
your process reproduction alee somebody
asked me like what is this even good
form well when you think about it if you
wanted to have something that was like
spinning up to like test different like
fitness levels so like say you had you
wanted to test the validity of a system
based on certain scenarios and so you
wanted to just kind of bang on a system
you could do something like this and try
to figure out what the optimal settings
are for that system yeah see now it's
just taking off yeah so it does a lot
yeah it like I've seen this lockup I've
seen observer throw errors like it can't
write to observer fast enough oh that
one locked up I didn't even stop that
yeah I mean I'm on a laptop so yeah too
cool anything else alright I hope you
all enjoyed Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
