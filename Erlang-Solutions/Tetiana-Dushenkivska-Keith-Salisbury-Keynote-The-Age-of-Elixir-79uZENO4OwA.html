to be some of them would say oh I want
to be a princess when I was a little
girl I didn't want to be a princess
because I didn't like the idea of being
locked somewhere in the tower and wait
for some prince to come and rescue me
no no what did the prince wouldn't turn
up like I would walk there all my life
no it wouldn't work with me no I wanted
to be in control of my life of my life I
wanted to be a witch I wanted to have a
magical power so you could I don't know
just wave your hand and you could turn
the light on or maybe you it's not your
fingers in your house get tired be be
just amazing I saw this is the business
what I wanted and how disappointed I was
when I get to the age of eleven and I
didn't receive a letter from Hoggart so
I have to get over there get on with my
manga life finish school go to
university get my Ruby job work there
for a few years and only later find out
about elixir and the nurse and Phoenix
that's the moment they thought hmm
finally I have the power I dreamed about
when I was a kid I'm not a witch
well I'm an elixir East with Phoenix
channel I can build files of fun
multiplayer games but nerves I can build
my cleaning robot to my smart house
after the power I just need to learn how
to use it so how Alexia got me well when
I started to look at functional
programming concept I can understand the
much better than on the object-oriented
code content because I could relate to
them better when I was at university
studying electronic engineering my
favorite subject was boolean algebra
we'll know Jabra was introduced by a
self-taught mathematician George Boole
in his book the mathematical analysis of
logic and then in investigation of the
walls of salt boolean algebra deals with
operations on logical values true false
or 1 zeroes the main operation of
boolean algebra are conjunction
disjunction and negation boolean algebra
has been fundamental in the development
of digital electronics and is provided
for all modern programming languages
it's also used in a set theory and
statistics there are 7 operations in
boolean algebra I three of them from the
mental or not and L we can build boolean
logic out of implicit transistors are
used to switch electronic signals and
electrical power they are made of
semiconductors such as silicon our
thanks to silicon chip innovators now we
have Silicon Valley as we know it and
why am I talking about resistance well
they remind me over functions and
functional programming under this the
Hauser and meet the correct and based
and if you apply a current to base the
transistor will close in the current
will flow they look similar to
functional programming where transistors
like functions and current is a data
which falls through those functions then
if you don't mutate signals in
electronics you don't you take data but
transform it from one form to another if
you increase the base current collector
current will increase as well and with
two transistors we can build an
amplifier
let's electronic engineering
deletion transistors also used in
boolean algebra to Manila educate the
code case because they control the part
of the card the examples of using
composition to Bill different element
let's look at operation not so you have
an input and you have an output and we
have the logic table I think we all seen
it and this is a transistor so you have
an input in you haven't now to put and
this you could have your not gate so
when you get the current thought which
is going to be all and with transistors
you could say build other types of logic
gates or you can post those together and
with end gate if you you're going to
have the true value all only when both
inputs are true so if you get there only
one input you're not going to have the
output is one or the other one you also
wouldn't get the output for all you want
to together that one then you're going
to have the output is 1 or true and
similar way are always works so you have
one or the other in this case so you
combine those two business to builder a
logic gate you have either one value and
you get your output or another one or
both together and then you could keep
building up you could keep composed more
errors you could abstract away from some
things and you could out of those
watching games
build more complicated elements of
things like for example XO o traffic
light or digital clock or bit how are
you so this is in electronics the way to
abstract away and
in functional problem programming they
also use different levels of abstraction
also for what you get you could build
memory and then all together you could
be a busy ATP you cheat on this level
you abstract it away enough so you don't
even think about those little
transistors anymore where you think
about a specific component and then the
biggest component like CPU chip and you
could also combine all that together to
do some cool machine which is going to
Howard 4000 CPUs to the super spot a
single line functional programming you
start small and then you keep building
out composing things you abstract away
when you feel that things will get a
little bit complicated when you end up
with hopefully amazing system well as we
all do you end up with an amazing system
so in electronic engineering there are
levels of abstraction similar functional
programming you think about levels of
abstraction and it's important to not
obstruct too early and not need to wait
also relating our electronic engineering
is something I've learned at university
I think that it works and you could do
something physical and it works then
finding the functional programming and
learning about it concept this is what
hooked me
it started with Alexia nice syntax for
them looking at functional programming
concept than getting into an amazing
community so that's it I think I'm
staying in this place for a while and so
if you want to learn about that way use
some crazy things you could say for this
you're out question it just quite fun a
thing to do and now keep watching you
thank you
okay so before it just oh we gone again
hello check again okay so before I talk
about next year I want to talk to you
about the powers one little word let me
start a beginning so back in 2009 I
thought familiar disillusionment with
software industry ruby has been the
fourth language that I've learned and
this was just before the various bubble
so none of my friends were using Ruby in
fact there wasn't even the booming
well-paid job market
back then I hardly any one hardly anyone
on you had heard of it and getting hard
to work was tough so while I was away on
holiday cart surfing in Brazil I read
this this book is it along with good yes
like Danny was so having just read the
book and seeking a bit of a change in my
life I returned to the UK and on the
flight on the way home and saw an advert
in the in-flight magazine for an open
day accelerator and within six months I
packed up my bags and moved onto a boat
to start training so at one of my heart
and said yes and ended up sailing for
six years while chose aliens creating a
language and the last two were in the
Caribbean which was not but even a
thousand miles of water couldn't keep me
away from technology when you're
crossing an ocean folks are actually
jam-packed full of the really exciting
interesting technology when you're
crossing an ocean getting up-to-date
weather is vitally important many people
don't realize that mobile phones simply
don't work once you're 10
sure so in order to get access to the
latest weather information you have two
options
you either have hugely expensive
satellite communication or you can use
something called SSB radio which
propagates using high frequency radio
waves so does anyone know what this is
decision movie it's called a weather
fact and I downloaded it at the middle
of the Atlantic using my laptop a little
radiator report and a custom area of the
co-op's leave that I hung up the mast
it's quite a dark are literally drawn
line by line coming through the radio
and you've got to get the tuning just
right to get the to get the you know to
get a clear picture there's really
there's nothing quite satisfying of
seeing an image actually coming through
the great either through your laptop
when you're in the business Atlantic in
the middle of the night getting that
women so when I came back in 2015 this
is me programming but when I returned to
reading
I was only a huge fan at JJ his amazing
work in Ruby I'd read his books and
Binney and who can a great source of
inspiration over the years I often read
his code and which that I could watch
shows like that and course Dave Thomas
and prog-rock reading the fragmented
program I was one of the iconic books
that really resonated with me the
reinforcement of the UNIX philosophy do
one thing do as well began my love
affair his practical so in truth when I
returned from sailing it was only a
matter of time before I would before I
cross paths with elixir a friend of mine
Verity was good enough to run some
elixir workshops at the company that I
was working and then I met Phoenix in
the real account challenge and this is
really the hook that kept me going
I worked for six or seven years building
interactive website
and games using flash and the one thing
that was really hard always really hard
was to do multiplayer adduced Java C++
PHP Perl Python Perl all sauce but it
was always difficult it was it was hard
to do and then suddenly here with Felix
with the sheer simplicity of
bootstrapping libraries and the raw
power of Erlang I was able to build
multiplayer games that were fun to play
and that was that was really the hook
that that got me excited and got me cash
flow it was enough it was enough to keep
me motivated to keep me really
interested and give me the desire but it
was the hook to to build something that
I was passionate at that I'd read
David's book in one night thanks to a
guy snoring on a train and then I
watched all the videos online from the
recent conference in Poland so I was
really with it when I got I got an email
in my inbox sharing ellipses dominoes my
heart jumped I was really excited the
company that I was working for they were
too interested in new technology at the
time they've been birthed by angular
over the past few years so they really
weren't interested in new technology so
I knew that I think they found it myself
so I was wondering where in Europe with
this new conference feed so open email
and oh my god it was in the state
certificate of the Walter to consider it
I discussed it with Talia so at least
take unpaid leave but the flights
accommodation the conference ticket and
then because I was contracting I'm
losing money while I'm not working so
it's going to be a much bigger
investment than I really first thought
but it didn't take long before the the
extras that had taken me 33,000 miles
around the world to surface again so
that was it leaving very jealous Tanya
and
Wego flew off to Austin Texas on the way
I was desperately working online little
project is literally letters it was a
multiplayer fridge magnet game and on
the flight there I was definitely
working hopefully I could get it working
and I thought if I can bring one sense
to fight will include and fear of public
speaking or might even show it off so if
they are one and a half years since that
time and I now work for a week
contracting in the liquor and hardware
we patiently waiting to transition from
grieving to illicit so what I want to
leave in your minds today is the power
of the one little word the power of yes
so it literally is about saying yes
josÃ©e said yes when he made that first
commit dave thomas did yes when he first
started writing that book Chris record
said yes when he made that first
commitment Frank said yes when he made
his first commit justin is doing and of
course Eric said yes when he started a
xox and you notice it's called a ex flex
back under and of course Joe's own
episode yes boss so many of you have
said yes when you started your project
or submitted a talk or started a winter
or created a workshop yes is the reason
you're all here today yes the reason
we're all meeting today what I really
want you to take away from this is the
confidence to say yes to ellipsis so one
way of preparing for this talk one of
the ideas that we came up with was we
had this idea that the people that had
invested the most the people that had
jumped in head first into a lipstick
had got the lumps out of it so we
decided to create a survey to try and
try to ask the people that we could find
who had who is clearly invested the most
to find out three things really what was
not like before thee before they met
Alexia what was life like when they did
meet elixir and then what is life like
now having having met elected dualsun so
we've got what we've done is gathered
some of the quotes
so we got loads of feedback from all
these people and we've gathered some of
those party today so we could share with
you some of them so this is life before
we listen say hello copulated we've got
some really wonderful feedback so so now
meeting Alex
lots of art we got a lot of those lots
of our our moments
this is great
okay so now like with the licks here so
we gather a lot of those cut minute last
worked well she thought was quite fun so
a lot of a lot of the words that we've
got from people were passionate you know
expressive with love and you're great
this is you yo
wonderful
there we go passion and interesting
people that's you again
so the final question we asked them was
now that you have a little ear in your
life how confident are you about where
it's going and to be on it all of the
answers were were confident you know
everybody that has jumped in his birth
first strongly passionate that the
growth of the community and the strength
within it means that we have a bright
future ahead of us
okay okay let's talk about the nuclear
community in elixir terms in the liquor
term every person in the community every
one of us is a process an actor and all
together you form an actor moto one ox
is no active a common systems after the
completely isolated from each other they
don't never share memory so to
communicate you would send messages to
each other the old receive messages and
depending on the message we can create
more actions of processes or bring more
people into Alixe here to expand the
community then messages to the processes
which addresses we know change our
internal state each actor has an
internal state which can be modified
recipients of messages is identified by
mailing addresses which shared in our
case could be like email or Twitter or
name on our CE o clock the actor can
communicate with actors host addresses
health behaviors that's what process or
oxidize when a person's a message let's
look at example first is listened to a
feedback message and someone sent the
message it's rubbish processes confused
doesn't know how to handle this message
so as the result causes internal state
gets corrupted persons get upset Christ
then really get confused and and crushed
here is where why this crash Kowalski
country super violence which is looking
after that process notices that the
process crushed so it restarted with a
new happy state that's why it's
important that each of us is supervised
so we can be restarted from crashes
often to providers our family members
and friends their contributions to
a league days to get a three started
when we crush it's important to be
restarted with the new state and not
with the old corrupted space because you
just keep crushing well let's have a
look at a process message handling
example so if we get our feedback and
it's like default implementation we just
crush her so you can really upset and
crush when we hear hard to handle
comments about our work whether but I
need to talk but they survive very but
it's a poor request whether it's a
language let's change that default
implementation okay let's just think
about it so when the feedback is
positive then they're like okay this is
good but then when the feedback is not
to positive then you might think oh
either constructive is it's helpful and
then we could decide what we're going to
do with it this is helpful
well we just improve our work wherever
they if it's not constructive maybe we
shouldn't agree with that person who
said that this that feedback so here you
can see that it's important how we
handle common messages and protect our
internal state maybe at the guards who
also ignores our messages oh why do all
over
so it's up to us to decide her to reach
processes to which how to handle the
messages Nolan could tell us how to
handle particular messages so let's have
a look at some particular example let's
take an example of her personal Giselle
if you tried to send him a message
each did vegetables well he's not going
to do it because he doesn't like
vegetables so I think that his
implementation might look like that he
may handle message like that but if you
send the same message to burn marks who
is vegetarian then he might handle it
differently there you might sell process
a message and expect the response but
never receive it the process you send
message to may not listen to your
messages maybe your message is wandering
in the casual case there is all that
case when you send a message but person
takes to want to handle it it's probably
because that process mailbox has a lot
of messages to handle before it gets to
your message each actor can process one
message at a time so if you have three
tasks you better send three messages to
three different people so your job get
done faster well let's talk about
scalability let's say is great at
scaling up processes can talk across the
nodes so Ross is an immigrant can send
easily messages to process them United
State at the rest of time image in real
life so you might need to wait a little
for the process on a different note to
wake up and handle your message but it's
only in real life these humans need to
sleep as processing on a beam don't need
to sleep and always register
handle messages we don't have to wait
okay how it all started
well it's all started on January 9 in a
year 2011 with Jesus peace our init
process he is the one to spawn other
processes which encode elixir core team
members sports processes keep spawning
new processes which include all of us
people in the liquor community what
messages are listening to while elixir
from Co team members seem to handle well
messages like oh how can I make it
better
how can I make it faster how can I make
it more reliable and of course oh how
can stock Phoenix and nerves core team
members also listening to those messages
but often Phoenix and nervous Reapers as
well as sending a message to process
which address you know you could also
publish messages using the next year pop
subsystems let's talk about it so let's
say you want to send a message to
everyone who want to listen to it but
you don't know the addresses so what it
isn't
well you publish your message with a
given topic - pops up in Twitter you use
our hashtag my elixir status to send
messages who do you receive them well
everyone who is subscribed to the topic
licks the Arizer works the same and even
conference talks using same idea so you
have speakers who publish all their
messages to any click until 2017 with
their topic other process you may choose
to subscribe to the topic author craft
by attending the talk and we are
choosing what to do with the messages
coming in through after the talk we
could throw it away you could handle it
we could write it by marginal writing a
note something we could think of a new
idea got to fire to think how we could
change something in our project and
you're aware electrically
is growing amount of topics to which you
can subscribe is increasing number of
processes in the mixing system is
growing and greatest elixir is good at
scaling up and so far it's been quite
reliable to have strong reliable system
it's important to look after each
process in the system no matter how
important his job is each process is
important and every contribution matches
all of us have different talents and
combining all of them together makes
next a great system great community so I
think so far you get great job just
carry on like that and remember that
every process matters and if the process
gets him too corrupted state we just
need to restart it so when I was a kid I
let's play the piano and each year a
teacher would select one piece we'd need
to play in front of an audience for our
final exam week after week with practice
until the end of term when we would have
a final performance there would be parts
you could play just naturally part and
there would always be one tough part one
section that no matter how many times
you practice you stumble and the more
you practice the more you become aware
that this is your nemesis so this part
of the tour for me is one of those
moments I tried many times to explain
what was in my head to Tonya only to get
a blank confused look back
let's hope today the music flows so I
really want to convey to you the true
power of the liquor
it's not about features it's not about
concurrency and it's not about fault
tolerance it's about passion it's about
engagement it's about commitment and
fundamentally like functional
programming it's about transformation in
order to in order for me to explain let
me take a step back I'd like to share
three examples and hopefully you'll spot
right running through them besides the
mustache what do you think these three
people have in common so we'll start
with Alan Alan Kay so back in 1997 it's
LA Atlanta Georgia in fact during that
conference Alan Kay gave the seminal
keynote where he famously stated I made
up the term object-oriented and I can
tell you I did not have C++ in mind I
should have used the more
process-oriented turn friend so that's
interesting of course and we're lucky
that Joe Robert and Mike were already
thinking that way but today that's not
what I want to focus on later in that
same talk Alan began to discuss
something else and it idea that he
expressed in a more subtle and abstract
way this is the candy symbol for the
Japanese word Mar it literally means the
space in between the stuff between
objects the stuff we don't usually see
the sunshine through the cracks in the
West Alan went on to say we're focused
on the nowness of things rather than the
process of things the Japanese have a
more process-oriented way of looking at
how things relate to each other
computing is the exquisite blend of
between beauty and practicality so
following Alan's advice rather than
looking here we should be looking here
the space between the space between
contains the space between contains a
rich tapestry the space between is
filled with information so the space
between is something that juror Lang
creator Joe Armstrong highlighted in his
Erlang factory talk in 2013
lots of little black boxes he said
sending messages I think they've all
been looking in the wrong place that's
my Joey impression beau the messages
between the conversations that's telling
you how things interact that's truly how
you truly understand a complex system
the messages between the conversations I
don't know how your brain works and you
don't know how mine works we communicate
with messages with speech i saw a
brilliant visualization of this idea
recently some of you may have seen this
it's the Erlang performance left by the
Kawasaki I realized that the
practicality might be limited but from a
learning perspective a picture really
does say a thousand words so before we
move on to our last example I just want
to take a quick look at some examples
from nature where it highlights the
space in between so you remember how I
talked earlier about downloading a
weather fax from thin air so this
demonstrates beautifully how rich the
information inside the Mar really is
around us you just need the right
instrument to be able to tune in and see
you and I mentioned a short while ago
about music of course if we take a
closer look the space between the notes
the distance is very precise to provide
something called harmonics
it's what provides the pleasing sound to
our ears in fact it's something called
the golden ratio field which is found
throughout nature the ratio of balance
which enables the tree to grow leaf
after leaf branch off the branch whilst
maintaining balance nature's way of
fitting things together is via
composition
nature scales with composition this
golden ratio turns up in the most
surprising places so this helps us leave
this helps us lead to the realization
that there's really something quite
valuable to be gained by looking not at
the objects but the place between the
object the MA
speaking of composition let's move on to
our last example
hopefully Bartok for those of you who do
daily will know well great job this year
his bidding battle and learning learning
or following his series on YouTube about
category theory so category theory was
invented in 1940 and introduced
categories filters and natural
transformations as part of their work a
category is really quite simple T it put
its formula G's mathematical structure
and its concepts in terms of collections
and of collections of objects and arrows
a category has two basic properties the
existence of an identity arrow and the
ability to compose the arrows
associatively as I began to learn more
valise I often try to explain the
concept of tenor so put simply we have a
bunch of objects in one category a bunch
of objects in another category and some
arrows between them as simple as a
simple way to understand this let's take
a look at the category of a hat where
functions are the law fittings between
they provide a way to transform objects
for one
to another so here we have a category
string category Inc and appear to be
food and the functions allow us to
transform the objects from one category
to the next so let's take another let's
take a look at another category the
category of programs and look at really
clear programs so what might the
functions look like the arrows represent
well for me for example by reading books
I would transform myself from being a
programmer to being an elective
programmer and there's many books
available in fact this there's a wealth
of arrows in these two categories but
it's not the only way for us to learn
there's listening to podcast they are
attending meetups attending conferences
reading documentation creating projects
all these helped us move from being a
program being a normal program being a
literate program let's consider another
pair of categories let's take elixir
programs and professional elixir
programmers so this one's a little bit
holida really from one line the only way
to move from one from one category to
another is either get hired or start a
company can you think of any other ways
to move from one of those categories to
the other one perhaps there's actually
an opportunity here for us to explore so
finally before we wrap up let's look at
one other pair of categories so looking
at the elective programmers and ellipta
contributors obviously thanks to Jim
freeze yesterday morning you're ready
the fact that you turned up to this
conference makes you a contributor but
let's look at some of the other ways
that you might contribute so creating a
library obviously starting a meet up
writing a book
wearing a workshop giving a talk
submitting a PR creating a screencast or
reviewing a book in fact this list again
these two categories are packed full of
transit and transitions of arrows
relations and this is what makes elixir
powerful so all these things all these
arrows have one thing in common they all
require you to say yes so obviously a
legend category theory but I didn't mean
it like a degrees in here if you if you
are interested and I've encouraged those
of you that are curious minds to go
watch the bottle videos and learn from
learn the magic from someone who knows
exactly what he's talking about to me
the beauty astatically theory is that
we're able to express computation and in
composition in a way to transcend all
programming languages by focusing purely
on the mark the space between caste
theory is about composition and
programming especially and especially
functional programming is about
composition as we saw earlier using
composition mother nature is able to
build the most incredibly complex yet
stable systems maybe we can too so now
failure will show us one of the most
dramatic transformations that's happened
in the elixir community over the last
fall here by looking at the growth of
elixir wealth and meet us worldwide
