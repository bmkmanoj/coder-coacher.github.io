postgresql drives hello provide a little
overview of crystalline furniture for
public schools a particular one
and then I will focus on one of them I
will provide the value of its design of
with limitation about poison values
three about possible ticks that you can
use to overcome this limitation and then
I will introduce my experimental or call
visit of this driver and then I rotel
about is use cases
so let's talk about eternity if you try
to find something related to postgresql
and along on github then you will find a
lot of with all the others and as you
can see almost all of them are quite
outdated two years one year behind and
the only one driver that is relatively
stable and well maintained is a risk
we'll Bible grocer let's talk about
which is clay it consists of acid module
it contains several pay functions if you
compare the CPA functions to the
front-end back-end protocol then you
will find out that it provides very low
level interface so for every day
function you will find correspondent
message in a front-end back-end protocol
of postgresql when you start the
connection you will find two processes
run process is a Holden connection state
it's a jennifuh same instance another
process is the cogent data and holding a
circuit
this design has several limitations
first limitation is all your queries up
blow a'kin when you send your credit or
database you have to wait for result it
has some problems when you have very
large amount of queries and they're
relatively independent of each other now
the problem is the amount of network
round trips when you run a query from
pgsql model you will find that it used
to network round trips to execute single
query scandal would be enough one
network round trip from telecom protocol
of postgresql supposed to format of
result rows of columns and result row
first formal to the test another is
binary binary is slightly more effective
but text format the commented binary
format isn't convinced at all
if you do squeal users only binary
format
and what does it mean in practice when
you are on the same query that selects
for example one integer from database
you will get integer when you're an
extended query and you will get a binary
stream convenient ask ed presentation of
this integer when you run simple queria
because in extended for in extended
secures you can ask for binary format
but in simple query you cannot do that
and you will get text result but which
is quill cannot decode text results
another problem is partial time out
support when you connect to database you
know often won several timeouts one of
them are demoed to connect to database
another is time out to execute query
time out Kyle time out for collection
should be very short several seconds but
we might be weighed alone several
minutes but if it is green his only one
timeout spits fire that connection start
there are some useful tricks that you
can apply when using this driver one of
them when you have a lot of simple
queries without parameters you can join
all of them in one large steel and
execute simple query it will incur one
is account to send this wedged into a
database and to get results back if you
try to run them one of TG one or two
another you will get very low
performance because you will have to
send query to database wait for result
send another query wait for result if
you run one simple query with a large
deal you will see on this thing and get
lots of results
another trick is to send one large time
out at the connection time it won't cash
and the database lowness for
man it's low to connect clients but it
won't hit you when you execute very like
very long running queries if you execute
a lot of similar queries with different
parameters it's better to park where is
ahead and then use more extended
protocol to bind parameters to their
queries and to execute queries when you
try to do this with eco area you will
have to network round trips for each co
area when you use parse ahead and then
find and execute it will be faster
because it won't pass very each time
to overcome this performance limitation
I started an experiment I for stupid
risk will and I tried to make the VI
compatible so it can be used as a
drop-in replacement for original driver
because the same PG squared model with
the same function that means exactly the
same it has split facade implementation
it means that you can see ND acquire
several interfaces because compatibility
layer it was a synchronous letter to
send query and get results back as a
regular blank messages and it has
incremental interface which allows you
to get your results one by one row it
means that you will get a blank message
each time the row from your results yet
get the product of the wire
it uses single process for Holden
connection state and for the cogent data
can another circuit slightly less ever
had the original driver and it used
internal request here to a low request
by plane what does it mean front-end
back-end protocol of postgresql support
such feature when you can send a lot of
queries to the circuit without waiting
for the results from previous clays and
then get a bunch of the results so you
don't have to wait in this case you see
and query one of the year one of tina's
and that's all
and what is possible use cases for the
dragon when you have to load many men
you watch amounts of data there is no
use keys for the experiment was except
exception large stream of events whether
which I had to write a database
another possible use keys when the
action in your business logic requires
several queries and this queries I
independent by independent I mean that
each credit doesn't require results from
previous co idiom you can send all of
them without waiting for the result and
then get all all the results it includes
first Network round trips and basically
faster when you have several databases
you can create all of them in parallel
it also faster and someone might find
this feature useful I have made
basically because someone on the one
Croatian Marilyn mailing list asked me
for it it's a steering precision of the
result it means when you execute query
returns / result set we can process it
row by row you will get a message for
each row and you can handle it
oh that's all
thank you huntin for interesting it
presentation you know you've mentioned
that the decoder sits and the same
approaches that handles the socket yes
does it mean that two parallel coming
requests cannot happen no so it's just
one socket and if server is possible of
handling I don't know thousand per
second you will not get thousand in
parallel decoding you will get just one
by one
when we have one connection to the
database you have one tcp circuit
between your client Evan database when
you send your queria it simply by us in
teeth
it will be to get perfect in TCP bahas I
mean if we need their spare ll action so
if we have I don't know thousands per
second request to select something so
the server is very parallels we can deal
with them in parallel but then if we
have just one connection we would have a
bottleneck year but we here in this case
you will have to set up several many
connection till it's a big client
because for each client connection
server runs one process and process all
the queries in a single process one
connection one process on the server
side nice one for used so it's outside
the new driver problems with it up to
client of the driver to use the schema
it's up to client or out to open several
connections database that thank you
the variation especially that secures
procedure on a school girl's nails which
is to it EPG boo yep idea the therapist
postgres it exhibited Bullock's ve cho
mot leesia olympos beach place if true
approached by Jesuit reverse driver
administer push the process of a prince
peace and pursue postgraduate videos
passable let's start was pooling pooling
is outside of my driver you have
database driver and you have some kind
of universal pole there are universal
postal school almost everything and
there a specialized like postgresql post
my driver can be used with postgresql
pool
and about reconciliation reconciliation
is realized in quite is implemented in a
quite interesting way you have
connection you have co area that you
that you had send over that connection
and you want to cancel that Korean when
you want to cancel that Quarian you open
another connection to postgresql and
send specially formatted packet that
will say to cancel all running queries
on the previous connection this version
of dryers are both very conciliation but
when you use query pipelining you don't
often know which Grady I or insulin
you will cancel some query runyon on
this connection
Thank You uncle
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
