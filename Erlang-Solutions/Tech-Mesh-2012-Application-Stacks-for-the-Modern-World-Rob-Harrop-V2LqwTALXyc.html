thank you all for coming we're going to
talk about application stats today and
the reason why I think this talk is
important is because the last five years
have seen quite a change in what is the
typical stuck but more than seeing a
change in just the stack we've seen a
change in people's attitudes towards
defining stacks looking at what
technologies they want to integrate and
how they think about the technology
they're using my background I was a
co-founder of spring sauce which was a
fairly popular open source java business
that got soul to vmware in 2009 I've
done quite a bit of open-source
contribution Java on spring and in rub
it n key with Erlang and spent a lot of
my time between 2004 and 2010 looking at
this problem from the outside looking at
what our customers were using for their
stacks looking at where they were headed
what they were changing basically spent
six years of my life agonizing over this
problem and for the last two years I'm
back building an application now and
faced this problem myself what do we use
in our stuff what technologies can we
trust what can we not trust what's going
to be changed in the next four or five
years and I think it's an interesting
thing to talk about so I want to talk
about five things I want to talk about
traditional stacks what are people using
now what we've been using in the past
and what are the things what are they
that the changes in the industry that
are changing the way the stack looks
what kind of movements or technologies
or new practices are influenced in these
changes the traditional world I think
was quite boring and quite cookie cutter
there were a lot of people using kind of
esoteric stacks and so on and so forth
but so in the Java world and certainly
not net world there was a predefined
technology stack and it looked something
like this it was the traditional sort of
three tier architecture and but within
those tears what
you use was very well defined you know
Java the presentation tabled probably in
the browser occasionally maybe a swing
application or something like that or
silly towards the end of this kind of
generation people were using the Eclipse
toolkit to build their their rich
clients as well the logic tier was
almost always some kind of application
server some kind of java application
server towards the end it was becoming
glassfish and jboss they were they were
the big guys in big enterprise you would
probably still see websphere or weblogic
but that market got cannibalized by open
source and rightly so i think because
that's just a commodity and the database
tier was by and large with very few
exceptions a traditional relational
database mostly Oracle I spent a good
portion of my career porting people of
sybase and sequel server to Oracle for
reasons that elude me to this day for no
discernible benefit other than spending
of money and Richie Larry Ellison it
seems and that was the stack very few
people strayed from that perhaps the
only interesting thing to mix in there
would be messaging but even that was
very cookie cutter it would have been
JMS standard java messaging from one of
the big vendors tibco or IBM or
something predominantly it was Java
and.net there obviously were people
doing Ruby and Python but no one I think
can disagree that predominantly we were
looking at Java and.net and I think it's
fair to say predominately Java to Java
he did dominate for a long time and
still does but the way that it's used is
changing database vendors for as long as
I can remember Oracle has dominated
relational databases you know we we had
many customers moving of sybase tits
just seems to have effectively dwindled
into nothing now I know there's a few
people still using it but they've not
made a big business out of that
Microsoft have seen a real resurgence
with sequel server i think that's become
a really good product but all of these
products still fit in that traditional
category of relational databases and
even this is being cannibalized now
people like postgres which is getting
more and more popular all the time
more and more vendors who were doing
postgres services particular one that
comes to money to Roku with their fancy
postgres as a service you can go on get
a Postgres database they'll host it for
you you can fork it and all those kind
of fancy github herbs that all works so
there's a lot of a there's a big push
away from the big big databases and I
think you saw that when Oracle acquired
my sequel they recognize that those
cheap her light away relational
databases in cannibalizing their
business and really cutting into what
they were doing that's the software side
of things that's their kind of the
products that we used another important
part of this was the big data center
most of my customers had their own data
center and being on a consulting
projects I quickly learned that what I
had to do if I was going to do a
contract was make sure they had the
hardware available it was no good
scheduling to be in for a week's worth
of consulting if we had to then wait six
weeks for a machine and it was one of
the cons of things that constantly
surprised me was the the level of
bureaucracy and procedure and the amount
of time people had to wait just to get a
server one of my customers was a big
investment bank in in London they had an
average rate of six weeks to get a
machine but they had had an average
cross state center utilization of less
than sixteen percent those two figures
just don't make any sense to me at all
unless you mix into that big Enterprise
bureaucracy and there was no
collaboration between those two teams
they had almost had completely disjoint
performance indicators it was not in the
interest of the data services team to
serve the date the developers nor was it
in the interest of the developers to do
what was needed for the data services
guys so it was a very very strange
situation and you had these sysadmin
teams who had an immense amount of power
over developers you know over what you
couldn't couldn't do the same with dbas
you know I've been cussed been in
projects where the elites come from on
high all database access must be a virus
stored procedure and only the database
administrators can
tweak those stored procedures and even
seeing strange things like field names
must be coded so there's a code for the
field name it's not enough to have like
address line 1 no no no you'd have X be
125 and that would then correspond and
written documentation to address line 1
all these very strange practices and I
think all that change now at the round
the time that we were we were looking to
we were we were doing the sale of spring
source to VMware this was all changing a
lot of it at the time was changing based
on this idea of virtualization VMware
obviously being a big provider of that
but also Citrix with Zen a lot of our
customers were excited about self
service data centers the idea that they
could have some magic portal by which
development team could go on and say I
want six machines please and they would
do that and this is now I guess called
on-premise cloud because self-service is
not fancy enough and that is something
that is still progressing but I just
don't think has been delivered on but it
is definitely an important trend and
that leads me to talk a little bit about
cloud it's my opinion that cloud is one
of the most important technologies and
changing how people think about their
stacks and how they think about building
and deploying their applications I have
to really just do not like the word
cloud because it is such an
all-encompassing and broad term you know
I've even got my mom talking to me about
the cloud because she's storing her
files in dropbox which couldn't be any
further away from people who were doing
large-scale MapReduce jobs on amazon's
cloud or something like that so it's
this big all-encompassing work term but
when i talk about to in terms of
enterprise developers or software
developers i'm really thinking about one
main thing the ability to create compute
resources or other resources we need on
demand and manage them via an API
putting the power in the hands of the
developers there are quite a few people
who have started up cloud services
amazon are obviously the big player in
the marketplace which i'm not sure
anyone would have seen coming that a
bookseller would become the main
provider of cloud server
is but they do a very good job I think
their major strength if you will is
their constant incremental improvement
they don't set the world light all the
time what they do almost like a
juggernaut inexorably move forward with
their feature set and in X will move
forward their performance and their
prices seem to go down it is that unique
mix of somebody who is used to working
on variance slim margins and on large
volumes with somebody who has great
technology infrastructure Rackspace are
obviously a really big provider as well
and a giant join have a really really
interesting model because they have
their own OS the Solaris base smart OS
the key thing is that there's a massive
selection of services out there and
there are there are there are even
vendors beyond this the most likely way
that people will get into working with
the cloud as developers is through some
kind of cloud computing service this is
the thing that is making those six-week
waits for machines disappear you can go
online and provision a machine with
Amazon on this joining in the handful of
minutes and you can be up and running
with it and you know that can range from
a very very simple machine at Amazon
where you've got maybe six hundred mega
RAM all the way it's something that's
got 34 gigs of ram and multiple
processor cores or even now you can
provision machines with like dedicated
GPU processing so you can do fancy
algorithms like that the the breadth of
what you can achieve with the complete
resource is phenomenal and it has
enabled lots of different changes no
longer do I have to wait for machines
but also no longer is it hard for
someone to start up a new business or
start up a service and we've really seen
that happen is one guy in his bedroom
now can build a nice little service and
put it online because the cloud enables
that it isn't all roses though compute
is still not quite there and there's
still a lot of debate over whether or
not virtualization is the great way to
run things in production certainly in
terms of i/o it can be quite
unpredictable
but amazon in particular have taken some
steps to fix that they have like
dedicated io instances now where you can
say i want this many I ops per second
and helps per second I ops and you can
reserve that for yourself so you can get
much more predictable behavior now
beyond compute storage is probably the
next interesting thing in cloud and most
people think of this really in terms of
blob storage I've got some data and want
to store it somewhere where can I put it
s3 Amazon Cloud Files at Rackspace this
is really for me changed quite a lot of
the way I would think about some
problems my business is finance there's
a lot of documents to store online for
our customers agreements and so on and
so forth traditionally probably have
stored them in the database in big
binary columns just to make sure that
you were part of our backup flow now we
can solve them in s3 geographically
distribute them encrypt them and so on
and so forth but what I've seen recently
is a real put is a real move away from
just blob storage in the cloud towards
other kinds of cloud storage so
relational databases in the cloud is a
real and practical service right now
you've got Heroku who are doing the
postgres amazon who've got their RDS
product where you can get oracle my
sequel sequel server that works really
really well more and more people doing
this and then there are beyond that even
more interesting things amazon have got
their dynamo product which is a no
sequel style database that they offer
for you and they have this long-term
storage where you can store your data on
tape with them from the manage system
that they call that glacier and it's
really changed the minds i think of
developers that there's no need now to
worry about long-term storage or data
warehousing or all these things you can
get them for pennies an hour and use
them kind of on demand as you need them
it's a real change a long time ago if i
was doing a start-up i would not have
expected to be able to access large
scale data warehousing hardware for a
couple hundred dollars a month but now
now you can do that i would not have
expected to be able to access simple
manageable tape storage that i didn't
have to put things in a safe my cell
often although but now you can access
that so this is having an impact on
stacks by allowing us to take advantage
of much more sophisticated technologies
that traditionally have been reserved
for larger applications in our smaller
simpler applications and cloud is much
more than this there's so many more
services you can get like we've built an
application that runs entirely on Amazon
Cloud the number of things that you can
just push out to your provider is
phenomenal dns content distribution
messaging alerting monitoring all of
these things are available in the cloud
and that's just at the infrastructure
level beyond that and i think
interestingly there's this real push to
have these kind of hybrid cloud
structures where you've got some of your
data on site in your data center and
some of it off site in the cloud or
you're doing some of the processing of
sight in the cloud this is definitely an
emerging area it's still coming along
but I think it's going to be probably
the typical architecture in the future
where you can keep some core processing
core data on your own systems where
you're not worried about data locality
any of those issues and you can just
burst scale in the cloud kind of the
Holy Grail that people are looking for a
lot of this infrastructure already
exists I'm not seeing a lot of people
using it yet but there's definitely a
lot of interest and a lot of vendors are
trying very very hard to get something
meaningful into the market this is all
very interesting and it's obviously
great that we've got all these products
and we can great we can use all these
things but how does it affect the stocks
that we're building how does it affect
the applications we're building well I
think the first thing that people have
realized or certainly seems to that
people have realized it again is that
architecting for failure is probably the
sensible thing to do certainly it seems
that cloud resources are not as reliable
as necessarily the resources in your own
data center so you're seeing a lot of
architectures that were traditionally
have been three tier quite closely quite
closely coupled
moving towards much more loosely coupled
the ability to take individual
components ow not having the system died
and it's quite an interesting
architectural decision we took this in
our business our origination system for
all our incoming applications it's
completely decoupled from our servicing
system so we can take one offline
without affecting the other like
completely and in fact within those
systems there are separate subsystems
that can be taken offline completely
traditionally a system like that would
not have been built that way it would be
one big monolith or maybe two big
monoliths but we're in the cloud we have
to assume that failure is going to
happen so we have to architect for that
this is seeing a lot of a lot more
messaging usage I think a lot more rest
usage a lot more into component calls
over some kind of bus I think rest has
really taken off as been a kind of a
major player in doing this kind of
architecture and enabling people to to
build our systems that can cope with
failure a lot more
that's this kind of cloud this kind of
infrastructure as a Service Cloud is
really just a traditional data center
behind the API that's really all it is
you know you get controlling of your
networking you basically get full
control over everything especially if
you're using something like Amazon
what's interesting I think is for
vendors that go beyond that and offer
you a platform you don't worry about how
it's deployed you don't worry about
where it goes or anything like that they
give you a set architecture and you just
build your application so Heroku is
probably the poster child for this they
have this great platform where you just
say here's a war file here's a ruby
application here's a Python application
push into get go and deploy it and
they're taking care of everything behind
the scenes and that I think is
definitely where Chloe's going to head
where all of these things that we want
like databases key value stores
messaging will just be available kind of
ephemeral II in the cloud and you'll
just be able to hook into them with an
application you won't need to worry
about how many instances are like fired
up at amazon how many database instance
if I fired up where are they in the
geography of my data center you all have
to worry about that so it's going to be
couple you from thinking a lot more
about what is underlying your
application Heroku could not be simpler
I don't think it really is a two minute
job to get something up and running on
there on the internet what I think is
interesting about this and what's
concerning and what is definitely a
challenge in these in these spaces is
how do you accommodate people whose
application isn't just a simple monowave
so far I haven't really seen a lot of
these vendors working with
multi-component applications that allow
secure communication between those
components and I know that's something
that certainly at VMware with their
cloud foundry products they're agonizing
over that problem
I think cloud is still in its infancy
and there's obviously a lot of
negativity towards cloud out there
certainly in the early days performance
was terrible and a lot of these
providers like dreadful and definitely
still predictability is a problem you do
get very unpredictable latency in i/o
very unpredictable load on the machines
you're on and it just it very it does
really differ depending on where you are
what I am seeing those people are kind
of taking it on board kind of embracing
that chaos and then learning to build
applications around that and Netflix is
a great example of this so they run
their entire business on Amazon on ec2
and there I guess kind of guiding mantra
is to just assume chaos they have this
thing called the chaos monkey that in
their environment just randomly kills
things so they're not waiting for it to
happen they're actively making it happen
and that is kind of the attitude to take
in cloud is that things are going to
break so don't wait from to break make
the break and if your architecture is
resilient to that then then great you
have to assume that you're going to lose
things on a regular basis chaos monkey
is a great idea I think the cloud is a
really good base technology I think it
enables an awful lot of things but it
isn't I don't think what's delivering
the direct value to developers I think
it's the things that take advantage of
cloud that are delivering the direct
value and probably the most in fact
definitely the most exciting thing for
me has been DevOps six years ago i did
not get involved with bombs five years
ago I did not get involved with Hobbs
even four years ago i did not get
involved with ops at all I ostensibly
knew what was happening behind the
curtain with the guys with the data
center but it just traditionally was not
a thing that developers got involved
with you probably knew some unix stuff
and you could probably do a deploy and
things like that but the the magic of
the production environment it wasn't
wasn't kind of apparent to you and
likewise the ops guys didn't really get
involved too much with finally all the
developers were doing how they were
instrumenting the code
diagnostics were all those kind of
things it was very loosely based
probably around a handover of what the
structure of your log file was and I
think DevOps is interesting for two
reasons one definitely the increase
focus on automation I can definitely
attribute most of the problems I've
encountered in my career to not
automating something that should have
been automated and now whenever I look
up from should I automate this yes yes
because chances are i'll do it again and
i really do like the increased focus on
automation that DevOps is bringing
however I think that there's been too
much focus on that and DevOps has kind
of become the term for just that for
just automation and is ignoring the more
important part which is the increased
focus on integrating operations and
development teams together it's really a
delivery on the promise of agile you
know these kind of cross-functional
teams are all working together great
very great very great DevOps is a
realization of that it's saying you know
what it's not just important to have the
business owner in team it's not just
important to have the developer in the
team in the project manager we need to
have the guys who are going to run it in
the team they can help say what the log
file should look like they can tell you
what the output should be when there's a
problem they can tell you how they want
to instrument a monitor and manage that
the software you can discuss production
environments with them so it's not just
a case of automation it's a case of also
integrating more closely with your with
your team and I think this is taking a
lot of different forms and probably the
most important one is this this
integration into agile teams I've not
seen DevOps in particularly well in in
waterfall almost by definition it can't
happen in a waterfall environment cuz
the ops stage is quite far down the line
from where the development stages but in
our jail if you're doing scrum or Calvin
or something like that already and
you're not getting ops involved with
your project that's something you should
change that is something you should
definitely make a change on because you
can benefit almost immediately by having
some
one from your production team on your
support team looking at what you're
doing some people are going very far
with this involving vendors in their in
their scrum you know if you've got
someone who's doing managed hosting for
you or looking after a database for you
or whatever you can involve them in your
scrum as well and get them on board it
what is your doing that can be quite a
hard introduction that can be hard quite
a hard process to deal with getting
these people to do this and I think this
is why the focus has been on automation
cuz it's quite a quick win you know a
few machines start up and I can automate
them or I can automate my development
machine or whatever so if you're not
doing automation with your develop stuff
now you really should be and the
landscape has really changed in the last
few years the number of things you can
you can use now to automate your your
environment I'm pretty sure everyone's
familiar with puppet an everyone
familiar with chef I have no strong
opinion about either one we use chef but
we use Ruby so it's kind of why we did
that combining something like this with
the cloud it's a very powerful pair you
know we can completely script every one
of our kinds of machines this is ready
this is my sequel this is rails this is
you know whatever and then it's just a
case of start machine up and have chef
run on it we don't have to worry about
repeatability we can even write tests
against it you know start an instance or
does it do this does it have this on
there never before have I been able to
create an environment where I can test
that my production machines are correct
in CI so we make a change of our recipe
the CI server starts up and it does the
tests it's great you might not be
familiar with this guy it's really hard
to tell because it's the vagrant guy
this guy's a vagrant who's using vagrant
okay everybody has to go and check out a
vagrant this is definitely the best
technology i have seen come out anywhere
for a long long time essentially it
works on VirtualBox which is the
open-source virtualization technology
for your mark or Windows or whatever and
it combines with chef and puppet to
automate the creation of local
development boxes so in our environment
we run on a bun to in the class
old and we have the ability to create an
exact copy of all the different kinds of
machines in roughly the same network
layout inside VirtualBox using vagrant
and it may be takes 15 minutes to start
up that is something that two years ago
I could not have conceived of you know I
always thought the virtual machines were
for testing bugs in IE now I'm using
them because I'm running on Mac but we
have to find a Linux oh I've got Linux
machines running in my virtual box and
all scripted via vagrant no need to keep
doing the same things again again again
and the integration with Chef for us
means that it's exactly the same recipes
it's not going in an apt get installing
a bunch of stuff each time we need to do
something or storing very carefully
snapshots of these machines at each
state which was my previous usage of
virtual box was right this Windows
machine is working now that is a very
good milestone snapshot that make some
changes snapshot that you don't have to
do that you can automate everything you
can even automate windows which is which
is great so if you're taking away
anything from this talk it should be
that virtual box and vagrant is
something that you need in your workflow
this was something that I dealt with for
six years please sir can I have a
machine so when I when we sold spring
sauce I went to work for VMware and I
expected things to be great VMware they
have virtualization software great if I
want a machine it should be trivial we
were we've been there for about two
months and we applied for like a big es
Xbox to run some of our tests on I left
12 months later still did not have that
es xbox I went back to the office the
other day to visit the guys they're
still waiting for it it's like two years
down the line this is at the company
that makes ESX and we couldn't get your
sector to test on that's crazy and it is
just this kind of pervading bureaucracy
that you've got to request and very
carefully specify what it is that you
want in your machines and we want Oracle
it's got to be this version with DevOps
you don't need to do that the team's
integrated you can
automate all that you can work on it you
can iterate on it you know I didn't
realize how much I missed being able to
iterate on my environment until I was
able to do it I was so used to being
able to iterate on the code right my
tests incrementally improve it that that
was something I just craved for all the
project you know we tried to do that to
our process we tried to do that in our
business we weren't doing it
environments and then when I finally got
to that point where I could write a
chef's recipe test it on vagrant locally
made some changes test it again run some
tests against it deploy it in the cloud
and have it work test it test it test it
and this was a day's worth of work to
maybe build a whole environment it was a
real epiphany no more please sir can
have a machine get an infrastructure
that allows you to do on-demand machine
creation as I say devops has probably
been the biggest revelation for me I I
really like it it's fun I think that's
another thing that's interesting as well
as it's like fun for developers to learn
new stuff and brown Xiao I think people
do not get into development as a job if
you don't like learning new things and I
have definitely found this to be one of
the most exciting things to get involved
with to learn to develop my skills on
and as a start-up you know the
development team is two guys and the ops
team is me so it's great to have that
integration and it's just so much more
practical now as a small team to do
something big you don't need to worry
about having big data centers by
combining cloud and combining DevOps
you're getting big big bang for your
book you're putting one-time effort in
and getting complete automation we run
three copies of our environment in AWS
it takes conservatively about 35 minutes
to start the six machines link them all
together start the database created from
scratch all that kind of stuff 30
minutes and now we're thinking god
that's a long time we've gone from six
weeks being something we tolerated to 30
minutes being something we can't even
bear you know now and our holy grail is
that we want to treat most of that as
disposable obviously not all of it is
the database is still very
very very important you don't really
want to be just throwing it away and
doing backups and trusting that all the
time well certainly a machines security
rules load balance there's all those
kind of ephemeral things you can just
chuck away and recreate as you need them
no sequel I really don't like this term
I just I don't like the name no sequel
because it kind of already assumes an
implementation that they're going to be
no sequel there but sequel really isn't
the thing people want to get away from
here and I think it's the bits a bad
name for a really good movement to me no
sequel is its choice it's allowing you
to use the right tool for the right job
I think everybody now knows that
relational databases are not the right
tool for every job I think we went
through a phase where everybody thought
the relational databases were the worst
possible thing in the world that seemed
to be a lot of what I was hearing that
was a lot of the hype the all new system
should be built on MongoDB but I think
that's past and people are getting a
little bit more perspective now and
realizing that the right tool for the
right job and I think that attitude has
been the biggest change in stat
definition in the last six years is it's
no longer you must use Oracle and wedge
your system into that it is it ready
sees the right choice for this
particular problem then we'll use Redis
and people are not afraid to use Redis
and Oracle unmon go together anymore
that has become acceptable so what's in
the name well it's not no sequel it's
really no relation or no relations and I
think it's much better just to call this
alternative data how can we store our
data in different ways one of the really
interesting approaches i think is
document storage so couch and manga and
I know there's been a lot of backlash
against manga recently an obviously
couch went through some really strange
like project level reorganizations these
are still good products they're still
best on motoring along and they've still
got a lot of potential I think a lot of
the problems have come from people
believing the hype and applying these
things kind of ovary Glee in areas where
they're not suit
document storage I'm going to come back
to the architecture in a minute because
it's really interesting get a key value
stores cash is that kind of thing
memcache probably really the pioneer
here ready so obvious ease them is the
big elephant in the room right now great
products but again they can have been
overused in the past and they really
have a little niche they fit into some
more obscure ones neo4j anyone using
that graph database in Java very very
targeted to a particular problem space
why would people want to use something
like this why not just use a relational
database well my view in all honesty is
that your default should be to use the
relational database it's kind of a known
entity we're using my sequel for our for
our system and we do use it for pretty
much everything because we know it it's
easy to operate it's easy to backup all
of those things that are really
important it's easy to do performance is
definitely fit sufficient some people
are doing some really exciting and
interesting things with my sequel
friendfeed made their own document store
on top of my sequel which was basically
just an ID column and blobs during Jason
and they like speak very highly of it
and really love what they did with that
they were building some simple secondary
indexes themselves but for them my
secret was predictable unknown entity
easy to engineer obviously it's got
using use of backing behind it and I
think this is one of the interesting
things is the main benefit of people
seem to focus on with no sequel is
performance it's faster it's faster
that's not always the case and it's not
always important I think the main
benefit for using a no sequel datastore
has got to be does it fit the particular
use case better is it an easier solution
don't worry about the performance right
away is it easier to solve my problem
with so document databases for example
one of their interesting kind of
features is that their scheme Alice so
you can very easily change the schema of
your your data we do loan applications
processing and credit checking and for
different products the set of data you
need to capture changes so I'd
document story is a great fit for that
because we don't need to predefined a
scheme and that has all possible fields
that we could ever want to capture and
we don't have to do like big scale
database migrations and things like that
we can just migrate the schema
dynamically as we go through it things
like lettuce have really good behavior
for sort of transient data or things
that you're not necessarily all that
bothered about keeping not great for
long-term persistence but great for
maybe session storage or you know kind
of transient like cart data or whatever
and that's that's the key thing I think
with with no sequel is thinking about
what are the use cases where should i be
using these things why should i be using
them not just thinking about my sequel
is slow and mongodb is fast let's let's
just use MongoDB and don't be afraid to
use a mixture in our architecture we use
my sequel and Redis we use Redis for job
queuing readies for session storage we
have a little bit of session storage we
share between some machines we use Redis
for search data we index some of our
stuff in medicine in Redis and a bunch
of other kind of things we're rebuilding
the data or losing the data is
unimportant so we don't even treat those
racial machines are special we don't
back them up or anything like that
they're just they just there our
intention is to move to using Mongo or
something similar for our application
for an end because that data is so
variable and changes so frequently that
the scheme Alice aspect brings a great
benefit to us but at the back end once
you've got alone all loans look the same
once they're being serviced and run
through their account so there's no need
to have something that scheme lyst there
and actually the transactional nature of
my sequel then serves a great benefit
when you're recording payments and so on
and so forth so we want that the back
end and that's been my interesting
revelation has been this this real
desire and this real comfort with using
a mix of products there's no longer one
big database in your data to your data
take can be six or seven different
products for the right job so very very
happy with that and very comfortable
with with doing that
moving on to the final thing that I
think is important and I guess you know
it's kind of evidenced by this
conference is the emergence of poly got
Polly polyglots programming get my words
out I think three or four years ago a
conference like this would have been
very niche and you know I look around
today there's quite a lot of people here
there's obviously a lot of people from
the city and polyglot has really become
acceptable now added I think it happened
a lot earlier than people realized and
it happened because of JavaScript seven
years ago javascript was definitely
hated by almost all developers like it
was something you went on to the
internet and you found the snippet of
code you couldn't paste and you know
include that in your in your system and
then try to make it work with ie and
Firefox at the same time it's not that
now it's a serious language people using
it for serious serious problem solving
obviously there's a big movement for
people to use it on the server side with
nodejs I have no idea where that's going
to go people some people seem to like it
something ability that seems to hate it
but it's fair to say that javascript has
become the language of the web it is the
language that is kind of pervading all
the browser applications and with the
move too much richer front end
applications in the in the browser using
kind of Ajax calls away from simple post
back javascript is getting a real
resurgence and it's become a skill that
developers need to have now you need to
be able to code in JavaScript you need
to understand it and there's been a lot
more work done on rationalizing the
model understanding the model because it
is a strange language but people start
to understand their and for that reason
alone I would say that most web
applications are polyglot even if your
holy jar on the back end or holy ruby on
the back end or whatever chances are
you've got a non-trivial amount of
JavaScript code in your code base that's
certainly true from my application it's
mostly Ruby but heavily JavaScript
certainly for our internal systems where
are we taking a lot of advantage of
a lot of the html5 features we do a lot
of JavaScript but it's not just using
two languages in two very different
parts of your system there's also a real
push to writing no discrete components
of the same system in different
languages and one of the kind of key
enablers for that has been this notion
of the JVM language it's a very big
thing for java night now is then is that
we have very very good alternatives to
Java that run the JVM and integrate well
with Java obviously being here at this
conference I would say the closure and
scholar at the two big ones scholar
certainly seems to be getting all the
press right now but groovy has been
doing this for years successfully and
has got quite the large following it
couldn't be more different from scholar
I don't think if it tried but if you
asked me three years ago that I thought
this was gonna be the way it is i would
have said no i thought no this can't
this can't continue to work there's no
backing but now we've got companies like
typesafe which are backed by big VCS and
that's always a tipping point in my mind
your roots if you think back to 2003
2002 jboss getting big vc funding that
was a real tipping point for open source
java when it became serious business
that's when you know there's going to be
something in it because people are
gambling money on it I think the same is
happening here you know that's a big
organization typesafe isn't just two
guys messing around they've got a lot of
developers a lot of money and big
ambitions they've got a great board full
of people who've done this before so I
think there's a big future for Scarlett
whether you like the language or not
there's definitely be futuring that and
I think that then means is a big future
in JVM languages and it doesn't have to
be that you just write your entire
system in Scala or your entire system
enclosure you can mix and match beyond
that there are other languages that are
getting great like I think really
getting a lot of popularity Erlang is a
particular favorite of mine did a lot of
working languages on the rabbit team
it's a language that I really do love
and miss when I
not coding in it it's got some got some
quirks but it's a lovely language same
for Haskell I really do enjoy her school
and I think the attitude is that you can
fit in the light of the right language
in the right place anyone use what's up
yeah it's sir it's all right to chat app
for the android or iOS or whatever and
the talk right now is going to be bought
out by Facebook they have some like a
billion users like something ridiculous
and their server back-end is all Erlang
and I think that front and front end is
Ruby likewise Twitter a lot of front-end
stuff in Ruby a lot of back and
something Java this notion of mixed in
matching the right language for the
right job is definitely being taken on
board by a lot of people for us
Haskell's on our radar we we have the
risk engine that we've written the first
prototype was in Ruby very quick or easy
to do it's very hard to ensure the
correctness of something that critical
with Ruby where's your Haskell you know
we can build a lot of the real checking
a lot of the correctness into the types
so we're going to look to move to that
in the future I'm really surprised by
the resurgence of other languages like
our in particular like does anyone go
and stack overflow frequently like a
deer horn Stack Overflow a lot more than
I should in phases and I just constantly
surprised at the large number of our
questions coming in there and it's
something that's really become apparent
to me because we're doing this loan
business now and this finance business
there's a lot of statistical analysis
going ons we've hired some guys who do
this kind of thing I've got very little
exposure to it but I kind of thought it
was dead and now it's nice like massive
again it's great obviously Google go
these kind of I one calling the niche
languages which is probably a bit
disingenuous but they've not got massive
exposure right now but they're getting
more and more and more and more people
are writing specific bits in that
language recently somebody built this
thing for Ruby called something to do
with Norse gods and the name has escaped
me anyway this cool little thing that
was like a rails pre booter so rails is
locked it takes a lot
time to start up like horrendously
amount long time so they built this
pre-boot so that you can like just
restart just your application in side
rails I was really good but they wrote
that and go so it pre boots Ruby written
go so it's really interesting that to
say that they've done that and obviously
I had to include go because this is by
far the best programming language logo
I've ever seen I was on like google
searching for logos for all these things
I did you know go lying logo that came
up and I just thought absolutely not
that is not the logo and so it is
brilliant there is there are two main
technologies that I think are enabling
this move to polyglot beyond just the
existence of these languages and their
tools obviously that's required but
what's really required is a good way to
integrate between Java and Haskell or
Ruby and Haskell or whatever you need a
good way to do that a lot of people have
experimented I think with like in vm
cause there is a ruby thing that allows
you to call it's a haskell and like in
the same process it's kind of stagnated
projects and I'm not sure that that's
the right way to do it on the JVM
languages that will probably work but I
still don't think is the best way the
best way I think is to build discrete
components in discrete languages and
wire them together somehow and I
favorite way of doing that is rest rest
has really become a big thing it seems
that you can't be a start-up now without
having the REST API even if you don't
need one it's just kind of like a rite
of passage to have a rest api but it
does mean that it's very easy for
systems in disk disparate languages to
communicate because HTTP supported
everywhere seems that Jason is supported
everywhere now so you've got a very
simple very easy to understand interrupt
language there but rest isn't perfect
for everything and that is where I think
messaging fits in and messaging the
messaging landscape has really changed
really changed five years ago it was JMS
tibco whatever now the so much choice
there's RabbitMQ which is you know
broker based very kind of austin's with
traditional but has much more flexible
routing is fully open source you can
dive in there and deal with it it's got
all the h.a features you need which is
great but then there's something like
zero
key which is completely different like
sockets on steroids and you can choose
what's right for your application and
mix and match we use rabbitmq button
arms on the rabbit team so it's easy for
me to do that some people think well 0
and Q's is easier it's kind of easier
for me to get started with the key thing
is that your stack can be now composed
of all these disparate components in
different languages communicating over
messaging or rest so why is all this
exciting why why does it even matter
well the most important reason that this
is important that this matters to you is
because you can use the right tool for
the right job you don't have to be happy
with this cookie cutter or Java Oracle
stack or all c-sharp sequel server stack
or all Python and my sequel stack you
can do basically what you think is right
and you can use the right tool for the
job and that has become an acceptable
and practical approach now not saying
that necessary your organization will be
happy with that now but in two years
time it won't be something that people
think twice about it will be the norm I
remember when we were starting out with
spring sauce it was very hard to get
open source java into large
organizations just very very difficult i
went back to see some friends at a bank
of the day they using groovy now they
just made that decision on their own
there was no one there to sell it to
them or no one that to Shepherd them
through it they just went online
downloaded groovy got Grails going the
whole thing going the mindset has
completely changed there's no longer
those massive I don't anyone can evolve
with this these dead long processes
where an open source product goes
through this this approval cycle I
shepherded open source projects through
those processes of banks hundreds of
times and they were painful it doesn't
happen that way anymore it's acceptable
to use open source it's going to be this
thing with this it can be acceptable to
use Redis acceptable to use scholar and
Java acceptable T's Haskell and Java
people are going to change them
infrastructure on demand definitely
rocks it's been the biggest change in my
life has been able to get machines when
I want them get databases when I want
them configure firewalls by an API all
those things are great scripting all
that automating all that
it's it's liberating I don't have to
worry about calling Rackspace and saying
please can you reboot my machine do it
myself an embrace polyglot if only for
your own sanity and only for your own
enjoyment it's boring working in one
language all the time it really is I
enjoy working in multiple languages
there's definitely some issues with the
grammar like occasionally write Java
code and put commas at the end because
I've been writing so much airline code I
forget what the correct punctuation is
but it's like speaking multiple
languages in the real work in the real
world you you get used to it and all
these things will enable you to build
systems faster build them more enjoyably
which i think is a very important part
of software development in developers
you are having fun doing better work
I've seen that time and time again over
the last 13 years and you can use the
right tool for the right job did I I'm
not just right
some hate these things I work for one of
these really boring corporate you know
and then I saw your beginning your slide
I could have cried because I've got
exactly the same problems you off but
couple of things because of what
football and corporate is how are you
managing things like auditors if you've
got you know all these clared instances
I'm not coming down and where your data
may or may not be how are you finding
auditors are dealing with sure so we
have exactly the same problem because we
were holding financial information we
have to deal with auditing the first
thing we did was make sure the cloud
provided we chose was certified for all
the relevant things that we needed
Hundley amazon is class one data center
so they they would they said they were
certified and that just that removes a
lot of the worry ought already you need
to choose a vendor who has the right
locality for you so amazon was flexible
for us because we could put the data in
ireland not worry about us for our
business us would be difficult which is
why we didn't look at joy and other
people like that who only had us data
centers but then beyond that it's much
the same as everything else
documentation processes all that kind of
stuff and in actual fact because so much
of it is scripted it becomes a lot
easier because there's no way in our
process for an environment to diverge
from the script people are not allowed
to do that it's kind of band and all the
same things apply we have all the same
tracking tools all the same auditing
tools logging everything cuz it's just a
machine it's just about making sure that
you're not hobbled from day 1 by
choosing a vendor who can't be PCI
compliant in our case or who can't be
you know am DPA compliant you've got to
get that right and then the main thing
that we're doing for data is encrypted
all the things that sensitive because we
don't want them even if they're in
Amazon and we trust them that we're
encrypting it anyway and you would do
that as your own datacenter anyway break
just it's a bit more important I think
when you're sending data out and for
data at rest in things like s3 we're
encrypting that with public key
encryption and we keep the private key
elsewhere so that we don't there's no
there's no chance of that happening
we're not fighting too bad so far it's
just about making sure that when you
when you start you choose the right
vendor from the day and while the worst
thing to do for us we're going to choose
cloud vendor get all set up and then
realize that they were going to pass PCI
order and then will you be stopped dance
your question any more questions all
right thank you very much thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
