audience's I'm asking questions has just
responded for hands eastham idea where
your heads are at the perspective where
the top goes how many people mobile
device that's kind of an obvious
question how many people know I Filner
am
how many people have ever owned a mobile
device from have to pull an antenna
Wow pretty good so it's talking
resonated most in unions I'm going to
kind of go through a little bit of the
history of mobility and specifically
mobile data is significant the US and
demonstrate how there have been some
pretty interesting inflection points
over the last 12 years but give you a
sense of where it stands today and why I
believe that's significant opportunity
specifically for early that's how the
story I'm going to tell them hopefully
it inspires all the early developers to
God's start building the software will
help us mobile industry which I think
will demonstrate is going to need that
help so going to way back to year two
thousand seems strange to say to
thousands way back it is especially with
respect to gold industry it's kind of
the unofficial birth of cultivated in
the US so theoretically the first mobile
application that was launched in the US
for some people thought it was in the
late 1990s it was launched by the newly
formed AT&amp;amp;T wireless company that was
formerly the cost cellular and there's a
horrible failure
Philly River boy have you really used it
and it really doesn't represent my
moment of birth old age because it was a
significant misstep but it did have one
success tight I didn't stop about if you
have a switch a little swish on the
following to go from voices low today
too that's how it works in distance I'm
sure about was that it's that it kind of
the attention of a company called docomo
from Japan and so they came over to the
Seattle area where AT&amp;amp;T Wireless was
Edward and look very intently to what
was being done at walking dead extract
extrapolated from that the whole concept
is for the mobile internet went back to
Japan and very quickly quickly of years
launched some people library which was
probably the first significant global
mobile data service ever launched after
the success high road they think that
the US and decided they wanted to help
encourage the US marketplace also read
try to launch mobile data and so
drinking that company that started with
poppy net and delivered this vessel 10
billion dollar gift right on top of the
level of reef into RS lick that 10
million dollars locomobile two boys free
things they want to AT&amp;amp;T Wireless to be
the first carrier
launched 3g it's called UMTS at the time
they wanted AT&amp;amp;T Wireless to launch
something equivalent to either terms of
the day service they important and they
wanted AT&amp;amp;T Wireless to form a separate
division within a company focuses just
on mobile data services it's called
normal multimedia services that's where
I started my mobile career at AT&amp;amp;T
Wireless in the mobile community
services space my responsibility being
to launch the first US data portal that
would at least in intent simulate what
kokomo did without so at that point of
time over there was born that ten
billion dollars was the sort of infusion
that wired it was acquire carriers to
feel comfortable that they can kind of
try again and launching motivated in the
US so it was successful I mean it didn't
just drive to a mobile internet search
it drove a huge object text messaging in
all sorts of interesting services on top
of the portal things like finding things
your bicycle location-based services do
new ways to interact with pools and
friends because we're maintained inside
the portal email became much easier so
we didn't call I will be cold
and it was the first legitimate US polo
data service that was launched it was
fairly successful I mean for 12 hours
and 49 a sense you could get up walking
two megabytes of data per month they
also one of the things that the mobile
multimedia group David AT&amp;amp;T Wireless was
they cut across text messaging
mainstream and one of the ways they did
that was they partnered with American
Idol which was this brand new show that
was wildly popular in the US I think
introduced his concept of text Cody had
the first time they engaged in that I
was season two was eight million votes
cast as part of the Boxcar initiative by
the time I got to season eight it was
almost 180 million votes being passed
through text messaging so while we
popular we all know what's happened the
text messaging in the US was just
exploded worldwide as well but all of
the success brought the need for scale
and skeleton honestly who work very well
prepared for when we set out on this
course so the surf Hurley dynamics
around how we had scaled what we had to
scale this list here full this way
representative super friendly it was
basically all that technology so at the
heyday of the system we were approaching
15 million users I was built
Tom had da rod launched a horrible at
loss of Java code and the obvious way to
scale that was lots of hardware but load
balancers in front will distribute the
load effectively that wasn't the only
thing to do there was about gateway into
the scale equally Wow plus the early
wireless protocol for the internet and
it was effectively a web proxy another
wisdom components within the packet core
of the network was things that make
radio communication actually appear to
be IP communication light gets into this
part of the network the SDS and the ggsn
do those things that are cheap g + 3g
mobile network without of course
messaging infrastructure so SMS CS or
the things that make SMS messages
basically working static static so
there's a subset of nantes to get to
scale just to match the success we were
having with a miller with messaging and
they all need to scale where they
depended in or drones or systems and
they all have their own dynamics they
all resented this interesting level
about scale so I remedy the executive
vice president of mobile multimedia
services when faced with this dilemma of
coercing heard from every group involved
that more and more hardware and more
space to support them are married more
more places with that
versity and this comments was
interesting example this continues we're
going to need you know a data center the
size of Safeco Field and those who don't
know it's a POC is a pro feelings about
this big on the screen it's bigger now
it's the baseball stadium its job and of
course his perspective was if the answer
of scale is always going to be born or
partner then more this grows with more
the sixties more space for many how is
that Hardware he used to Safeco Field as
the example but it's really not that way
and there's good reason why yuh the
covers really kept their arms very
Knightly rather they're dating services
there yeah there was a term called the
wall learn what's familiar with that
term it was essentially carriers
restricting where you could go but we
got into sort of mobile internet that
they controlled the neighborhood so
before the iceberg operators were
hurting subscribers into these walled
gardens and a lot of the standards of
being driven to enable these
capabilities of mobility were created
for the benefit of the operator not for
this tonight from the operators when
one's pain
ultimately but then after the iphone
tremendous shift occurs Apple has the
dramatic effect of shifting the focus
away from the operator and away from the
device manufacturers and on to the
customer lots of the development and so
they focus on customer experience they
focus on nailing developers very
effectively good things like this rich
estoque and the apps for a way to
monetize won't be building and they
change to gain maintains be interrupting
their approach to mobile internet was
not specific mobile protocols like lap
or XHTML oppose hey you're going to be
able to develop like you would for any
other web system full-blown HTML full
fidelity drink and as a result the
operator that was always good life but
was trying to be controlling and having
that pipe because the done by the
process they lose big control over how
they can build up this market this is
industry up to this point
think I have a pair for is the dramatic
impact that Atlas approach would have on
their network and so for those that
remember the first launch of the iphone
AT&amp;amp;T network was getting killed they did
not sighs the network for the title
volume of traffic the iphone is very
quick to take so Apple really upsets the
operators part of the result and you
know gone are the manager portals to web
content going are the operators revenue
streams for wallpapers ringtones gains
tax also through their own branding
storefronts gone are the incremental
revenue those brought be on the mobile
service and it used to be where device
manufacturers an app is a device
manufacturer really where they started
history device manufacturers would sort
of having brand the operators experience
on to their place which meant they the
backseat Apple changes that they do as
well that was a very much in the
driver's seat with respect to their
aquatics so you know they brought full
fidelity web browsing below and and they
replaced via the operator storefronts
with you know I schools an absolute and
they made tremendous revenue as a result
was stopped doing in there 100 billion
we've got the bank this is largely why
and the operators again become relegated
to the dumb time dr. Heatly readers
would cling for some amount of time to
their future phones the portals of the
storefronts that they can offer on those
but it really was the beginning of you
ok so the operators focus yeah is
largely on providing the best number ok
and that presents a significant
challenges but going back to Safeco
Field and it turns out that eating via
AT&amp;amp;T Wireless wasn't all that off base
when he said this continues we're going
to need something the size of Safeco
Field in fact other companies that have
missed or scale problem like Google
right they've got this illegal Oregon
that's always going out here over
200,000 square feet facebook also an
hour ago right across the street
Google's actually is over 300 square
feet that was just built their big
Center Chaz's itunes of any expert in
North Carolina at 500,000 square feet so
I checked they're not quite Safeco Field
April fields technically is over a
million square feet but if you just
count up the turf which quite a bit what
he was thinking about Julian hundred
thousand square feet so it's a place to
stay he was very prophetic you guys
then we're going to need something the
size of Safeco Field to support my study
in fact out with us how to build a
pretty much Tedesco
so Apple with iOS of course what quickly
followed and his now surpassed sampling
of have brought at least the two largest
US carriers into a fairly receive your
circle which I've called 100 million as
of the past year both nominating US
carriers that surpassed a hundred
million subscribers about the AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon have over 100 million
subscribers and combined they have more
than hundred others swap smartphones
which are by far the largest consumers
of the device perspective global data
services and so network analyst is being
consumed at a phenomenal rate and
network utilization which used to be a
concern operators is no longer a concern
in terms of memory organization now it's
how can I build more faster so
scalability is no longer addressed in
terms of you know millions it's naive
intensive ability to town operators are
looking at scalability in terms of
hundreds of millions and i'll show you
how that's gonna dress soon that
presents a problem we're going to
mention how the revenue streams ball
how the operators have been pushed
basically being tightened and there's
been this inflection point and I think
within the last year data services have
exceeded boisterous war worldwide and so
now because that's a pretty significant
problem or a business that obviously
needs to have revenues that exceed costs
the big dilemma new mobility today is
the traffic is growing exponentially the
revenue streams are all done reduced to
providing connectivity of the buying the
whole service and the costs associated
building up the network every to keep up
with the traffic are starting to exceed
you've got already exceeding revenues
that will be available from the traffic
now that's a huge problem because no
business can sustain no business can
sustain costs that outweigh a reference
for a long period of time businesses can
make the investments show what the
authors are doing hoping you get paid
out those investments but they have a
very careful local vestments they made
careful that they they don't fall into
this this thing called the scissor a
fact which is the bane of the mobile
industry that's what they seek to avoid
but it's the reality of where things are
so there's a tremendous amount of
motivation or mobile operators to avoid
risks I'm going to talk about how they
hope to do that where I think that
that's out in terms of opportunity any
questions up to this point everybody
still tracking so what's an operator to
do faced with this severe effect well
clearly they can continue down this path
right through that they have to find a
way I will lower the costs or increase
my wealth Mars is excelling at our
pressure mental deficiencies absolutely
key you can build a network that can do
more with less and solve this problem so
how would they expect the managed
network utilization today following a
depressed probably seen these things
referenced an alliance you probably see
it referenced in the context of a
lawsuit being taken against operator
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for the longest time
initiative at the launch
so unlimited data lines now never never
never truly prospect ways you could
never use an updated up to sort of blow
up your cat so we'll call it eliminated
will charge it as such well all of those
plans are gone they don't sell and
there's two reasons why they don't first
people really can do a significant
amount of damage to a whole new level I
mean a high volume dating think i read a
statistic summer specifically for AT&amp;amp;T
where eleven percent of the highest one
percent of data users representing
thirty-six percent of the overall
network utilization it's pretty extreme
and so you can imagine what are not
great with african in the circumstances
well obviously they can do away from
limiting things but they also have to
throttle excessive users and they've
done that and some of those users have
fought back and taking legal action
against companies as a result they also
throttle them aside all the services go
early on when people were trying to run
skype over the mobile data they would
they would prevent that we just block it
completely verizon is over that
Christ embracing the plank for not
perspective but there are things they
still probably peer-to-peer file sharing
that's always going slow because it's
its purpose police probably because I
the effective just gobbling them down so
today the operators are restrictive
behavior in order to control the
utilization of their network but what
they really have to do is figure out a
bit more how to build more pacity to
meet the ever-increasing connect f4 key
ways they can do that they're not
mutually exclusive in fact probably need
to pursue all four there are certainly
Gentiles to do all of it was for our
boost network capacity so for throughput
and that's based on what the issue both
in terms of spectrum they can also
acquire whore spectrum so then they can
build more on top of the new spectrum
they increase the network intelligence
in ways to sort of guide how particular
services use their network in a way that
it was not bad as how that utilization
occurs over a 24-hour period and the
last is to deploy eating them
that's more efficient so I'll talk about
each of these a little bit network
capacity is clearly challenged I think
Chuck you know my recording this term in
one of our sessions but spectrum unlike
money you can't drink water that's
absolutely true lose eliminated on the
spectrum and right now the operators in
the US hold the following shows of
spectrum in each of these four
categories but then the reality is it's
really not block I mean if you look at
it clear water is building with no
spectrum in the US and how many people
have a clear library service nobody ever
that huge crowd look if clearwire never
succeeds with their wives their value in
terms of the spectrum people is
phenomenal but the characters are very
much committed by on the amount of
spectrum available today that Verizon
just told the FCC because verizon's in
the process of trying to piggyback off
of cable companies spectrum they told
the FCC that's starting next year they
will be out of capacity they will start
at capacity by the year 2015 they will
be completely out of the past so unless
there's more spectrum they available to
them their network will reach its max so
it's not clear that the operators
believes or current spectrum holdings
are going to get up open up so what's
the next entity well the next thing to
do is to try to get more spectrum if you
ever seen this chart it's pretty
daunting but this is literal
the state of spectrum in the US so the
FCC manage is how this spectrum is
ultimately allocated they auction off
portions that they can free up but if
you look at it there's really not a
whole lot screaming out on available get
all of this spectrum is purposed in some
way shape or form these kind of two mil
marks or them sort of best spectrum for
mobile operators as they move to to a 4G
and there's there's not there's not a
lot for them to get their hands on your
meaningful way the only way really to
get more spectrum is 230 so you know
pass things have been done to do that at
the old uhf band on your TV you can't
have that anywhere that spectral has
been redeployed its global industry and
you know when you hear things like
agency wants to acquire t-mobile for its
spectrum they're literally willing to
take a company existing company like t
mobile buy it for several tens of
billions of dollars throw everything
away and just keep this better that's
how about you ladies but of course that
can succeed as a result
sort of spectrum swap their paying
college of it it's incredibly share with
you trying to get respect so it's not
clear that that's going to be a way to
solve this problem a little bit more on
the spectrum dilemma and this is
specific to sort of compare the u.s. to
other countries if you look here this is
sort of they call effective efficient
use of spectrum it's a number of
subscribers serve her megahertz
especially in the US the operators are
easily two times any other country
listed here in terms of amount of
subscribers for vengeance of spectrum so
they're already significantly more
saturated than the rest of the world and
we look at the available tension
spectrum in the pipeline Philly 50
megabits available to them versus the
rest of the world which has easily three
four five times that so special is going
to be a huge issue and it's really not a
lot we can do in this row install that
so we'll move on to some of these other
areas where we can help opel operators
kannada decision you have soon
nunc intelligence I say theoretically
speaking because I know the networks are
not very intelligent but there's this
concept of becoming a smart light and
it's it's a clever journey because
everybody calls operators done types
their calories for Berkeley because mark
I think that's going to give us all the
money we need to overcome the scissors
bak'tun I'm not lying a ton concept but
there is something to be said for
another fatality insane it's largely to
help operators manage their networks
effectively and it can manage to more
effectively I think that they can
squeeze additional capability capacity
out of those networks but as I said for
right now the way they're doing that the
level of intelligence they've
implemented a self equal deep packet
inspection so they're looking to the
package them look through the packet
core now they make decisions about how
that traffic should be treated and right
now it's almost all these predictable so
it's almost always identifying that
stuff that they want to slow down or
stop completely that goes for services
as well as users so the problem with
this approach to them
although it helps them manage to network
more intelligently because it really
that out customers that ultimately will
won't pay for their services probably
not only the bad press associated to a
living plants not really even limited
people who thought they were buying the
limited I've got problem that that's
really not positive presses for
operation so I'm not sure there's a ton
of things they can do near terminal to
that what we tell is the side of things
to solve their problem which brings us
to the last op should they have it sheds
a little light why the operators are
doing so the last option was building a
bigger truck and if you're in the US you
know pretty clearly that there's been
sort of a war of marketing around 4G and
LTE in fact as it turns out the US is
ahead of the rest of the world with
respect to fortune although US carriers
were way behind getting 2 3g
eighty-seven percent of the L
worldwide are in the US and the build
outs happening at a absolutely furious
pace and there's a good reason for it
initially a lot to do with you as a
customer but everything to do with their
need to go to passing and do so
cost-effective so when you hear LTE you
know there's there's definitely some
confusion in the marketplace as to what
that is it's based on the specification
from the 3gpp agency standards body that
drives these things for the mobile
industry and although it's being sold in
the US as Forge technically doesn't meet
the definition of fortune technically
it's about 3.5 but operator spectre
roundup so we'll call but AT&amp;amp;T
interestingly enough is selling
something called 4g that's not a TV it's
actually something called hspa+ which is
an increment on top of 3g that drives
bandwidth fairly comparable actually to
what horizon is launching
delta p so you see for gtown the u.s.
means something different than what it
actually means / the 3gpp competition
and so you're getting you have agency in
plus the assault is 4G and LTE be
installed is 4G there's actually a
specification called lte-advanced which
doesn't meet the definition of 4G so
you'll probably see that under eyes but
this is a great extent today so what is
it well it's certainly faster than 3G
right I mean whether it's LTE or hspa+
that's faster 35 times faster and it's
also this is the key for the operators
it's a simplified all IP architecture so
if you look at the way the architecture
run a mobile operators network today 3g
world existed very complicated and what
LTE does is simplify zhing dramatic and
as a result being all idea opens up a
significant amount of opportunity to use
means that the movie before but it also
creates to indicate cost efficiencies
and that's what's key to the operator
they can buy a glinting LTE of the cost
for one third of what it is today /
Megan I'm hope now I'm cost savings is
great but again they can also get
probably at least four maybe five times
the amount
in ever so vitamin C LTE they can get
almost a four-fold increase in capacity
and a reduction to one third of the cost
pretty significantly low fee I mean it's
the way they have to go and so that's
why there's a big motion tremendous
investment taking place in the u.s.
around on the t-80 so much mattress
scratch again say well why would arise
go to hspa+ well they could their 3g
implementation it was built on evdo
which is not upgradable hspa+ VS AT&amp;amp;T T
which is like wcdma which wasn't great
HSPA off so a CNC has somewhat of an
easier time in that they can operate
their existing infrastructure to get to
their definition of 4G verizon has to
roll on a significant amount new
infrastructure which they've been doing
and they had a head start and I'm
clearly the leader us around Ltd today
Oh AT&amp;amp;T is launching LTE as well select
cities scare you so I captain
so I guess the bottom line is is LTE
something that you want or something
that they need and the answer is both I
mean everybody wants a better mobile
experience and lgb will bring but don't
for a minute think they're doing this
because of you this is absolutely
critical for their ability to succeed
and we demands they're being placed on
the fold so there's two main components
penalty what is the radio access network
which is this long set of words that
actually have afternoons they could
reduce back the key piece for a crown
jewel is this thing called you've all
got before that's sits right in the
middle of an LTE implementation it makes
the whole thing it basically is the
conduit between the devices and the
whole new IP infrastructure that's being
deployed as a result the same time we're
appointing this they are going to
inhabited for about the last five years
some people diagrams like the multimedia
subsystem which is it necessarily local
eccentric it's being driven from the
needs of mobility but it's a divide
assets to provide support for any all IP
based multimedia services so what are
the interesting dynamics here I'm not
sure how much people really thought
through this besides that the outer
space is what I asked clearly
enables one and you're moving you're
both living structure to all-ip then you
can do voice over IP over mobility as an
operator and supplant your own through
mobile services with something more
cost-effective but here's the dilemma
right there already struggling keeping
up with demand for date if they're going
to then swap out their voice capability
and basically make voice a data service
their problem just about that much more
difficult to solve so how they get a
soul well that's really the question
wait
and it's as I started out saying it's
not really problem they've got and not
stop dollars because it's following
closer to the billions in terms of where
it's going to cost but the EPC has much
pretty critical functions policy of
course with hockey field training
flow-based charging session medical info
those are the four key capabilities last
one here diameter rally is something
that's calling about after the fact
diameters the protocol that is
implemented as a result of implementing
the EPC but they found is very
complicated interfaces and interactions
between those who are capabilities you
don't have something in the middle
rather so they've already introduced new
katana tree diameter around me one of
those to help allow this to scale more
family but all of these functions need
to scale to 100 million users just to
start starting then again pls cal
clearly well beyond and it's absolutely
essential that but they built in the
wall pocket court can scale in the
hundreds of millions and as you'll see
going green they have that really
commodity marker and they are doing that
sloping respect equality hour which is
the chips that's are going to continue
to get more performance and that the
pores on those chipsets will grow in
terms of the propensity so they appeared
beyond throw a marker at an approach
which you know that's great we've got
software that can leverage it but if you
don't because if he doesn't work so my
prediction now even the average basin
room I'm not anymore how they were tried
and failed to scale they're going to
give it the current state of
technologies and to be clear operators
work with a handful of key donate
vendors typically that are swerve in the
networking space companies like Cisco
juniper an f5 but those companies really
don't even have bpc capabilities in
their box to eat so they're they're
getting those technologies for other
companies like
traveling's and tech allowing other
companies that have had the foresight to
build these capabilities and that's what
we said today given these technologies
and they're finally they don't scale so
other like that is just us and then are
attempting to solve a problem by
throwing hard with that but even that is
not solving the problem so they continue
to blend the vendors and at least one
operators attempting to know their tell
me installed the scale problem early to
control the effect of it but there are
attempting to virtualize each of these
functions in the eec with the theory
game kind of isolate the problems of
failed function like a creative director
of anyone using LTE on verizon know over
the last six months i think they've had
about three or four significant
nationwide outages not good but this is
why so what are they going if harbors
not the answer of virtualization
probably isn't and the vendors are
delivering solutions that solve this
problem in then what's the answer and
that's what gets us to the opportunity
spider which is operators need to walk
very valuable to avoid this is perfect
they have to build out this new network
infrastructure and have to build out the
functions inside the EDC behalf of those
services that are more intelligent but
there's a lot of stable reliable stable
scalable solutions to that so that was
the time of grief
and to be clear out of the operators are
really focused on rethinking their very
offended upon software developers
assistant developers and solution
developers to create things and bring
those through there are full of vendors
in order to to to adopt new technology
so you have to be able to sell erlanger
say to a mobile operator however you can
sell them a policy internets bill Donner
like or a diameter rather that's going
to fund our life throughout the telework
built on but if it can scale bill by so
really not unobvious question how do you
deliver Network baseball for services
that can scale to meet the needs of
hundreds of billions of gracious users
and leverage this investment operators
made multicore multi-drop harder my
perspective earlier the technology
and there's a significant opportunity
that I see firsthand untapped to build
these types of functions these types of
capabilities that are absolutely
critical to be able to get success of
mobile operators on a technology like
earlier which seems to have the right
dimensions to fit the problem and I'm
not here to say it's the right solution
for everything but I do see a gap the
demand for scalable solutions and things
being produced in RS that demand longer
boat building these things around I'm
almost out of town I got one more slide
shopping then he can take you off the
stage looking forward beyond of all the
content I've thrown at you around where
we've been calm today as this
perspective of where it's going there's
this concept to sort of subscriber
saturation which says you know once
you've sold a device to every they have
a little child and some accident pets in
the US demand on the network will start
to finish that's simply not true there
will be growth beyond subscribers there
are now very many cases of subscribers
with multiple mobile devices got an ipad
right there are emerging devices like
telematics mountable gaming devices and
machine-to-machine smart we areand
inventory fleet management devices these
all had additional levels or the network
so the problem within the next less than
five years isn't going to be another
building problem it's going to be a
fiber so that doesn't underscore the
need for scale here I don't know the
other interesting point we'll leave you
with is this isn't just going to be
about wireless in the future once they
solve this problem and they have it
effectively built in running EDC an ims
for fixed wireless and wireline the move
there as well so almost all networking
wellman operators effective path flowed
through these systems through these
functions which you can imagine we'll
race that 500 million call me now so
that's the end of my talk to take my
time I appreciate just the same how many
questions all linear in here at once hey
what's two guys
oh there's 22 to repeat the question
please happening after 4G the 3gpp
continues
to read more and more
capability going forward but right now
the packers 4g or army to fight over
that chick hspa+ or ultimately that LG
next plateau an LTE advanced than that
at that point I think the focus won't be
so much i'm doing more speed
right now what's happening in the u.s.
specifically is it's a race literally
operators on racing customers they're
trying to get support you push they're
doing that in two ways building out the
infrastructure and changing the
marketing message and hopefully kind of
leading the arts
beyond that that's a big big set of
question marks about how did they get
here beyond that I think he'll probably
start to sort expand their respective
across other
you'll see these sort of usable crazy
pre-screen approaches where it affects
our seamless connectivity
and wire I think they made a tremendous
amount of investment
the IFS technologies in their network I
think they will start to soar 11 Chapel
problem that's why
another question
although us are here they are right
organic leaders in early and marriage
standpoint but going back to the opening
note with animation would you say that
the operators are relieved the taking
you say that have all opportunities to
develop applications in my life but my
experience is that unique like the like
a metal and naked and movie yeah there
is no such technology or even if it is
if you have to venture somewhere where
it's very very degrees
I I don't want to stand here and say
it's an easy path between recognizing
our leg and help solve this problem and
convincing operators dividers because
it's not in fact of our recommend to
someone a path to take I would say go
talk to the vendors that have the
solutions today that are getting blamed
by the operators are not being delivered
scale try to find a way to help them
through the use of early I mean you
could rally all the resources that were
at this conference for the next six
months and building pcrf noch amol
industry globally
but but that's just not realistic so you
know the reality is you're going to have
to first understand the problem
understand the space how you go about
solving some of these things and that'll
work with vendors
is almost a lot of these companies are
coming out of a world where they had
purpose-built hardware and they're
trying to deploy
but the operators have invested
tremendous amounts of money
they're all offering cloud services as
part of their infrastructure which but
they built a tremendous infrastructure
that they want to just sell in terms of
computing cycles people they also want
to use that themselves and so if you can
provide that a solution that means their
needs from a networking perspective but
we do so on this commodity hardware
that's kind of a perfect storm
and you know there are companies out
there doing that but I
men are currently inside of the operator
space selling any function for all cocky
boys and I just look at the size of a
scale problem they're facing I think I
need to rethink the technologies are
built
unfortunately they really put that on us
on the members probably the best place
to start I also think what's going to
happen is when when the first sort of
BBC solutions were introduced with
literally an entire ball back across and
they quickly realize they need to
separate out those functions treat them
as separate
just to be able to scale in 10
I think that trend they continued it may
be that what is now is worth body
functions that people
to get further disaggregated to smaller
cultures
you know it's we're right in the middle
of this problem today you can go to
repress how the operator illustration
you know the US leading the charge of
LTE right now but as the rest of the
world follows
and you know you think our ability
problem is challenging in the u.s.
magical
nature
or any tremendous
the other going to be billion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
