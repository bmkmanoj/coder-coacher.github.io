want my name and we're all floating
around the conference right now we're
domain registrar and lately we've been
working on responsive design and using
Phoenix and working a little bit with
elm and other JavaScript libraries and I
just thought I'd take my thoughts on how
channels and elm help us with responsive
design patterns now first I know it's
largely back-end crowd so what's a
responsive design pattern this is this
is the winning lotto it's an art museum
and recently they wanted to unified
their branding and across all platforms
and they commissioned this and they call
it the responsive w and this is how they
design the branding every time and for
every ad they have a responsive design
pattern now this is seems quite simple
but sometimes very hard things seem
simple as chris about presents but this
is what they actually design so you see
all the angles you see the data they're
trying to put in to their logo so that
they can make advertisements and you can
see what they're thinking about while
they're making new ads and be able to
produce them quickly now how does this
apply to web design well this is
probably banging your head against since
well since iphone came out but more
constructively since with 2010 and i
just want to get into how do annals and
kind of Elms capabilities you can do
this in ohm and react as well I've done
it but Elm exposes this API a little or
this strategy a little better so the
first thing that Elm has which is really
nice is you can embed it into sections
of the website so you take isolated apps
you embed an L map directly into a small
section which it read Rawls this is
great but the added benefit is you can
pin channels and tune them in two very
discreet amounts of data so you don't
really worry about a view layer you
don't
about anything else you just have data
coming in and then you design around it
the static typing actually helps when
you're talking to a designer so if
you're passing in some sort of float
they know what it is immediately let's
say it's money and there are certain
design patterns they can be taking from
the real world on how to handle money
how to display it to a user and this has
been helpful because as they're
designing multiple iterations as a
pattern to display data it is helpful
for them to think of it as it is kind of
at the database without some extra
layers of interaction and the templating
is really really clean templating in Elm
is directly hinged into the model you
see the model you update the model and
then you get new templates out of it or
new data do that but this abstract way
is very similar to the Whitney design
have you have ideas of models you put
them in and then you have a design that
let's say reacts to what's going around
and that's it again on my name I did the
tagline don't tell our copywriter all
right I'm done thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
