flow software switch written in Erlang
it's a project I've been working on for
the last three months and it will be
released as open source and two weeks
some of you may already heard of open
flow but I will start with some basics
so the idea of open flow was born at the
Stanford University few years ago as a
way for researchers to experiment with
new protocols in a campus networks and
the goal was to exploit the fact that
most modern switches and routers contain
flow tables and that run it line rate to
implement things like firewalls and qos
and to identify a common set of
functions available in those flow tables
and provide an open protocol to control
them in a unified way independent of
vendor or internal implementation and
there's a good white paper called
enabling innovation in campus networks
explaining it in more details so I
encourage you to read it as a good
starting point for learning about open
flow at the moment open flow is the
leading standard for something called
software-defined networking and we call
this software-defined networking because
all of the important computation and
logic is handled by a piece of software
called the controller and comparison to
traditional networks where you have all
the protocols like STP ospf so on which
have to be implemented on every Network
device and so the most important thing
here is the separation of the data and
control planes and open pole switches
doesn't have to interact with each other
or understand the topology of the
network then there are very simple
devices doing whatever they are
by the controller and the second big
difference is that instead of vendor
specific interfaces for every device you
want to use open flow gives you a common
API in front of open flow protocol and
so all the devices whether is a software
or hardware switch for from a certain
vendor and they all speak the same
language and another difference is that
instead of having different devices for
different network layers you have just
one open flow switch which uses flows
match on headers from layer to layer for
one thing to remember about often flow
is that it doesn't let you do anything
you couldn't do with a network before
it's just another method of configuring
the switch that may solve particular
problems better or easier than
traditional networks currently the
OpenFlow standard is research and
developed by the members of open network
foundation consisting of over 70
companies you see here with giants like
H attack on Facebook and Google the
important thing is that most of the
those companies are not network
infrastructure providers they are users
of traffic intensive networks looking
for a way to benefit from the idea of
open flow okay so let's take a look at
how the open flow switch actually works
it consists of two parts a secure
channel a responsible for talking to the
controller it implements the openflow
protocol and establishes at CP
connection to exchange messages
and the rest of the switch includes a
pipeline where incoming packets are
matched against flows and the generals
switch logic responsible for handling
messages received from the controller
and so on the two most important aspects
of flow processing in an open flow
switch our actions and instructions when
a new packet comes in it has an empty
action set and then it goes for flow
tables and one its match on the flow
entry a set of instructions associated
with those this flow entry is being
executed and those instructions include
adding or deleting actions from the
action set and also forwarding the
packet to another full table and when
the packet has nowhere else to go the
action set it has is being executed and
actions include changing the values of
different fields in a packet adding
villains and mpls tags and sending
packet took particular output part so
this was a brief introduction of the
basic functionality based on the
OpenFlow 1.2 specification which is the
latest one so I want to talk also about
the previous versions and versions
version 1 point 0 of the specification
is as you can see over 2 years old and
it had suffered her only one full table
and a very basic set of field in version
1.1 and multiple full tables were added
and a group table and a support for mpls
nibble on tax and latest specification
is open for 1.2 and it includes
extensible matches and ipv6 support or
and control the role management and many
other features version 1.3 is already
approved by the open network foundation
and will be released soon so looking at
the existing solutions implementing open
switch open flow sorry we have switches
like open V switch which is written in C
by nasira it has a kernel module two to
do the switching it's based on open flow
1.0 with some additional features from
the later versions Anderson Oh F 1 2
soft switch which is an attempt to add
one point to support two and switch mate
in Eric zone called traffic lap there
are some offer some hardware switches
from HP and neck implementing open flow
as an additional feature and there are
controllers during the development we
looked at flood light and flour the
first one weight by big switch and job
out the second one by traveling in
airline but there are not controllers I
would rather say they're frameworks
because you can really write a general
controller this is very
application-specific and those
frameworks and gives you everything you
need to implement a controller for a
particular solution other things include
for both tests which is a set of Python
scripts to test an open flow switch so
the main problem
with all those implementations is that
with few exceptions I told you about
there are always on open flow 1 point 0
and none of them is really up to date
with the current specification and
that's why about per month ago together
with the company called infoblox we
start implementing link which is a pure
openflow softswitch we had two main
goals we wanted to create the first
switch with full support full all
features from openflow 1.2 specification
so that could be used as a reference
implementation and we wanted our switch
to be easy to use and extend and a way
to learn about open flow in general and
one of the ways to achieve this goal was
to create an API for the actual
forwarding backend which I will explain
more in a minute while our lung well
we're using a long mainly because of the
excellent development speed we as I said
we start three months ago and we created
a fully functional switch with support
for all features of 1.2 the the code is
easy to read modify an extent which is
the second goal we have and a blank is a
great match for this to other things we
let's say learn during the development
is that along is great for implementing
minor protocols and open flow protocol
is a binary protocol and behaviors and
callbacks are a great way to make things
modular so first thing we implemented
was the OpenFlow protocol library it's a
set of along representations of all the
structures and
enumerations from specification encoding
and decoding functions for all the
messages and open flow protocol are sir
and we also start implementing support
for older versions so this is sample
code from the header file we have the
main FB message record which has a body
and the other records are has the ofp
message body type you have the simplest
messages the hello and equal quest and
flow mode which is a message to modify
flows inside flow tables at some point
of development we wanted to test our
switch with some existing open flow
controllers and we choose floodlight and
as I said earlier it implements only
open for protocol 1 point 0 so
unfortunately we had to learn that those
two versions are not really compatible
the first thing was the message
enumeration unfortunately in the 1.2 day
edit new message in the middle of the
old plans so for in version 1.2 and one
point or the port mode message is number
15 and in new version is number 16 so
the the OpenFlow open for protocol match
structure is flat so you always have to
specify the values for all the fields
and you use wildcards to specify which
values should be used for the actual
matching and in on the floor protocol
1.2 you have the extensible much fields
so you just specify a list of fields you
want
John there were some problems with the
fact that there's in one point oh
there's one field for the TCP and UDP
port so we had problem when encoding and
decoding it for example I don't know why
you'd like to do this but if you have a
match on tcp port number five and UDP
number six then you don't really know
how to encode it on one transport
protocol field if you don't have IP
proto in in a header I mean in the image
specification the other thing is there
are no instructions in the one point oh
so all the actions are the actions are
associated with with flow entries and
you can only match on the flow entry
ones and execute those actions and there
are a lot of other small
incompatibilities we have to deal with
that's why we created an online behavior
called jen protocol which is a very
simple behavior with two callbacks and
called end code and we convert all the
structures from all versions to one
common representation which is based on
1.2 version and it's transparent from
the switch point of view this is the
entire gen protocol call back
about the supervision tree for the hour
along implementation force which as you
can see it consists of three parts the
supervisor for the receivers which are
communicating with controllers the
supervisor for an abstraction around
port at the moment we support the
hardware hardware parts and purple tub
devices and actual switch logic which a
consists of two part come on switch
logic which communicates with open-toe
controllers imagine manages the roles of
the controllers and the basic switch
configuration and handling simple
messages which are independent of the
actual forwarding logic so for example
echo messages change role messages and
stuff like this the other part of the
switch logic is the forwarding backend
API called jen switch it's also an odd
behavior and it separates comments which
logic from the actual forwarding engine
and you have to implement the flow
tables group table packet matching and
all the stuff as well as all bags to
handle open phone messages received from
the on the controller we're thinking
about creating different implementations
for this behavior and we started with
the user space one don't anticipate any
questions about the performance of such
an implementation I would like to say
that we value the ease of use and X
stability / performance and I hope this
will change in the near future and we'll
work on the kernel space limitation or
some hardware implementation as well and
actually I was talking to owner about
implementing Quebec and on one of his
embedded devices so we may have to a
chance to work to air on this another
thing in the process of implementing the
links which we're thinking a lot of
about testing it and currently we're
working on creating a set of tests using
property based testing and cubic squeak
check if you're working on anything
involving open flow I hope you will hear
more about this soon at the moment we
implemented an open flow protocol
library with support for versions 1.2
and 1.4 going to work on the version 1.1
which is not very difficult because it's
something between those two versions we
implemented the logical switch in pure
along with matching engine for all
fields from 1.2 so this includes ipv6
support and we have suffered for almost
all instruction actions and other
features of the OpenFlow 1.2
specification and as I said we're going
to work on different forwarding backends
in the future if you want to know more
about open flow I encourage you to read
the white paper from Stanford and take a
look at the lightest specification and
what's more important for us is get
involved the flow forwarding dark come
inside and link will be a lunch
around June eleventh link will be
available on github as open source and
the flow forwarding community will
continue to promote other projects
related to open flow and that's it thank
you questions I'm using this to route
data now or Europe have you had
experiment yeah we set up a single note
with virtual machines and a link switch
connecting them in it's something based
on let's say open the switch
configuration and and yes we started
fully routing all the traffic we can
generate yes yes I'll just repeat the
question for the earth whatever what
have you got running on top of it that
we do the rolling I don't really
understand the question because the
switch itself is doing what you call
switching or routing and it here it's
called forwarding and there's nothing
really on top of it you can match on any
fields from layer 2 3 and 4 and output
the packet to a specific part based on
that
so yes this is the controller part you
have to have a controller that setups
set up the switches and tells them where
they should route specific traffic
forward specific traffic no we focused
on implementing a switch so the
controller is something different and we
for the test purposes we have our very
simple open flow controller but but
that's all yes oh I'll just be do you
have any plans for hardware support
global ready oh we have plans on
implementing though the backend using
some hardware but I can really tell you
much about it right now
yeah yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
