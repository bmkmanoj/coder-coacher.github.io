this is the topic that is really
interesting to me recently and I found
that other people feel the same and you
have a lot of resources about building
system using for example event sourcing
which is I mean of fusing events as a
main source of truth in your application
you can find a lot of resources that
describe how to build micro service
architectures using events and how using
events make this services more decoupled
and you can have a lot of different
message queues and even stars and this
whole approach is basically amazing with
Ireland character and OTP but then I
started to wonder why I really like
events and understood that this is not
the point
this doesn't matter if you have if you
have some message queue it doesn't
matter if you have this event processing
a synchronous or not because you see he
worked at a company called up unite and
we've been using elixir for more than
two years now in different project both
small and large and of course we love
the elixir because it makes our code
much better and much cleaner and often
hear that because it's very functional
you don't have this additional
complexity of our languages so you can
often hear or read that in elixir you
don't need any patterns because it's
just modules and functions right but
then
I looked at the code of the project I'm
working on and I used the new mix xref
functionality that allowed me to
basically render a graph of dependencies
between the modules and I saw that and
this is actually not the whole thing
because the whole thing was so big that
it didn't fit the screen it's about 1/2
of one of the applications in our
umbrella and we have like 15 of them
right now
so it's messy and maybe it's our fault
but you see building software is quite a
complex task because because it requires
not only a lot of technical skills and
technical knowledge but you have to
really understand the domain you're
working with you have to communicate
clearly with your teammates with the
clients and the users and to be honest
we are not so good at communication as
developers mostly but even though
building systems is so hard and so
complex it turns out that changing
existing software is even harder because
we make all of these assumptions about
what are the problems what are the way
that we are going and what are the goals
we think we understand our users and our
clients but it turns out that we don't
and we often buy them blame them for
that and we shouldn't so this is not
about thought about using some different
sourcing mechanism this is not even a
talk a talk about using LTP because I
like to think that this is a talk about
building small things that are really
independent because I strongly believe
that when you have such system
system consisting of rings that are very
small and not coupled with each other
you can have this freedom to change and
when the clients wants to change
something or ask it want to change
something because you start to
understand your domain better you have
the ability to do this without making
the work harder than it should be so I
chose an example product and we'll be
thinking how to build basically an
Airbnb clone so in this application we
have some-some person that owns an
apartment in the distri hadn't chicken
basically announced to the world that
the apartment is free then the guests
can look for the apartments and if they
like anyone they can make a request they
can try to book this apartment and based
on for example how how long the dictator
the owner can accept this booking or
reject them so how to build this thing
and from my experience on what I have
seen in different product I think that
and not only our projects as a wrap unit
but on different blog post our books I
think the most common approach to build
this system would be to start with some
apartment context and you don't really
have to really dig out because it
doesn't really matter but in this
context you'd have some function to
create a new apartment he would have
some other functions to acquire the the
existing apartments and return some
results based on the query that the user
provided for example you want to create
a query by location and the price and
the number of
etc so then I would have to make a
booking so you'd trade a booking contact
in which you have a function that has a
guest allows you to send reservation to
make a reservation and then you need a
function to reject the reservation as
the owner or accept it and it's quite
nice because it sure is nice and allows
us to write this code but there's a
problem because when you make this thing
when you accept the reservation a lot of
things have to happen you have to first
of all notified the guest that his or
her reservation has been accepted you
have to transfer the money from the
guest account to the owners account you
have to mark this apartment as taken in
this period of time so it wouldn't
appear in the search and it wouldn't be
possible to make the reservation again
so you have this disconnections
and as you can see they're sort of
couple because we might the D context
connected together and apart from that
we make multiple contexts depends on the
same data because now the apartments
context and have to use the reservation
table to filter out the apartment that
are taken so we have this coupling and
most of the people I think think about
only one type of coupling because you
have the most obvious obvious one you
might have a dependency on the code
itself but what is often not considered
as us so bad
it's there almost all the time is the
coupling on the database so in our case
we have the booking context writing some
data to divert the patient's table and
the apartment context reading the data
and where is that and I think that in
most in most of the systems we have a
case when we have few entities but a lot
of different use cases in our case we
have this basically free entities
because we have the user we have the
apartment and we have the reservation
but on top of these entities we build a
lot of different use cases and actually
when with a space with each requirement
you probably will make this entities
bigger you make this entity more
connected with the rest of the system
and this means that when you want to
change something you have to touch
multiple multiple parts and actually if
you look at this example that I showed
you before in the middle there's a
module with a lot of dependencies and it
is of course the user schema so let's
try to take a step back and forget about
all the things that we know about
computer science forget about the data
and the databases and try to ask ourself
what is really important and what is the
problem that we are trying to solve and
what is that our users want or our
clients want and let's start with the
use cases so the basic thing that we
have to do in our application is to
allow users to audit at the apartments
and to search for them so let's start
with that
and let's create some piece of code that
is responsible for managing the
apartment so for example for adding them
and what we want to do this the user can
send a command then the comment is
validated and if everything is ok we
just publish an event saying this that
this apartment has been added and we
have the parts at the apartments
completed basically because now we can
when we want to search for the apartment
we just add another module another piece
of code that subscribe to this event and
every time the event is added we just
update our local state and the nice
thing is that we have single
responsibility here I hope you attended
solute elixir tag before so if you did
you know that there are two two first
roles we have the single responsibility
principle and open-closed principle and
this way we can have both of them
because our apartment management contact
is responsible only for one thing and it
is really closed for modification we
when we want to add a new requirement a
new feature we just had another code
apart from this one that we have already
created so I've said that we publish an
event but what what are those and what
purpose do they serve and events are
basically fact they represent something
that has already happened in our system
and that's why they are available
because once something happens you
cannot really undo it you can published
some other events to update the state
but the fact that something has happened
is there to stay and this is one of the
reasons that
that they are quite easy to understand
and to reason about but the other thing
is that they mop pretty closely to to
Diggle that we are trying to accomplish
because they they use the same
terminology as our clients as our users
they use the same words that we see in
our application so for example we might
have an apartment at that event and this
is really important because what the
users want to see that they want to know
which apartment apartments were added
and not how we store these apartments in
the database apart from the events you
have comments that are basically a way
of representing the intentions and they
have because events can have multiple
handlers because when something happens
we might have few different parties
interested in this fact but comments are
easy in this bug in this case because
they have only one con 1 handler so we
always know where these comments should
go and they can be rejected if there's
something drug so what about the code
because I showed you these pictures and
they were cool in my opinion but you
obviously want to see some elixir and
the thing is that it's quite simple and
there isn't much to talk about because
we now have such functions that are just
pure logic without any side effect that
take the command validate the command
somehow and if there's something wrong
we return the error and if there's
filters everything right we just return
the list of events and this is nice
because we have despair
functions that are really really easy to
understand that are easy to test and you
can clearly see what are the business
rules that you have to follow until then
you just rub this this module in in some
other module that is basically basically
a public interface and it's only job is
to invoke this function and if there is
a list of events returned it publishes
all of them so then we can see that when
we want to search for the apartment we
just handles this event and we cite this
information somehow in our own private
database and the nice thing is that
previously when we had this first
version of code every time the apartment
was added we saved it in the database
and it looks unharmed full but actually
when you save this information when when
the comment comes you make a lot of
assumptions about what this data is
going to be used for and I often got get
asked by my co-workers how should we
store this data should we normalize them
or store for example JSON and I try to
always say well it depends how will you
use this data and the last thing is
about this approach is that you can
decide later every time you want to use
this data for something you just write a
code that handles some events in the way
that makes your task easier so to sum up
the out part we have three functions
representing the business rules that we
have to follow and this is nice because
it gives you all the benefits on a
functional language and you can
you have side effects only caused by
listening and handling events so the
other use case is that we have to to
make it possible to make a book in the
book web book around and we do this by
creating another piece of software or
code that accept the recommend if
everything is right we just save the
information and publish the event and
then I think you'll remember but sorry
not this slide then we have to can have
some piece of code that notifies the
owner and then when you accept the
reservation as an owner you notified the
guests and this basically solved the
problem that we had before because now
the the booking contact is no longer
responsible for notifying the guests
it's only responsible for handling the
booking so we can easily add another
handler that updates this information so
I've said before that once the booking
is accepted you can you have to make it
so in the search so the search wouldn't
return the depakene apartments and this
way it's easy because the search apart
the apartment search context know what
its job is and can use the data that is
flowing through the system to make it
useful to use this and accomplish its
goal so the next part is payments and
it's also easy because it requires only
adding another piece of code that is
responsible for payments and its job is
to basically know the the data that is
used to be linked
and every time the apartment the the
booking is accepted it charges the
credit card to the guest so now instead
of this one booking context and this one
reservation entity you have really small
parts that are really autonomous because
I've been talking about how the search
context have to know which apartment are
taken but the point is that it's not its
job to to to make sure that the
apartment won't be booked twice in the
same period of time his job is to
basically ensure that the results won't
be returned but if we mess up this part
and if we return the apartment that is
Titan it's the the booking context job
to ensure that that there won't be
reservations twice in the same context
so it's nice because it allows you to
have all the rows in the one place you
don't rely on the apartment search
context to guarantee that the apartments
won't be booked at again you have this
whole business role in the one booking
context so I'd like to basically I read
it in some blog post but I like to for
each part of the system forget about the
data and start with the question what is
the job of this part of the system and
once I know what the job is I can wonder
what data do I need to know to fulfill
my my responsibilities and only then
when I know which data do I need I can
ask myself how can I get this data so
for example for the apartment management
my job is to verify the
and the comments coming from the user so
the only data that I need is it's right
there in the code because I need the
rules and there are encoded in the code
itself as for the apartment search
context I need to know which apartments
are available so I listened for the
apartment he had that event and I can
also listen for the booking except that
event to modify my style as for the
payment context I have to do the same
job I have to ask myself what is my
responsibility and the job of the
payment context is to transfer the money
once the booking is completed so I have
to know how can I charge this money so I
have to know the billing information and
I have to know that the booking was
accepted and I do this by keeping
billing information in my entire private
state and I used the the event stream
and use the events to know when to
actually build this person so what about
the pub side because in my total
description there was a part about
building the pub subsystem in the
lecture using the design server and
method passing but actually what I would
recommend you to do if you if you want
to start is to use something like that
because every time you publish an event
we take the static list of handlers from
the config and just invoke handle event
function of all of them it's fully
synchronous so you don't have to deal
with all the problem which hasn't
Rinna's message passing but it can have
its own problems so
if you need something that is a
synchronous you can basically use the
new nuts on you know actually registry
and its dispatcher functionality to to
dispatch the events to different
processes but as I've said this doesn't
really matter because I strongly believe
that if you want to use events to to
model your system you have to start with
the good domain design first and only
there start to solve all the problems
with how to actually deliver the events
and this is the part that I would really
love to talk about with you but maybe
after the talk and of course if you need
you can use something else like Africa
like RabbitMQ to us your event stream
you can use the knowledge that we
learned today at the keynote to build
some tasks system and use that but the
the important thing is to model the
domain first and one more thing that I
would like to tackle is the that don't
repeat yourself role because it's one of
the most popular roles in our in our
case and it tells you that you shouldn't
have any duplication that every parts of
the system should have only one
representation and if you look at the
diagram you see that we have we have an
application we have the application we
have the same information about bookings
in the two databases so why and I think
that the important part
the part that is often overlooked is to
understand what each row that we know is
trying to accomplish and what this role
is trying to prevent us from doing and
if we try to look closer we say we see
that don't repeat yourself role is about
eliminating the need of having to change
different parts of the system when
something changes and when you look even
closer you can find the content that is
saying that oh sorry that it's okay to
have textual an equal representation as
long as you know which sort of the
trophy is actually the manual and where
you can go and look for the true
information and in this part it's
important to understand what we are
doing and the data used by the apartment
search context is used only to ensure
that the results don't contain apartment
that are taken and that's why it's it's
not a source of truth because even if we
don't have this information the system
will still works fine work fine
according to the business rule because
the booking context will prevent the
user from booking twice so this part is
actually something like a cache that
allows you to do your job but it's not
necessary and the nice thing is that in
the beginning we can start with one
database and we can use one particle
database to basically use it in all of
our contexts but then our system can
grow
and it might turn out that we need to
scale somehow so we can turn we can take
this apartment search database and it
you can use for example sharding to to
have apartment apartments from different
regions handled by different databases
you can decide that
Postgres is not longer enough and used
something like elastic search and we see
that sometimes having having this
duplication allow us to change easy
easily and allows us to basically change
only one part without affecting the
other so to sum up I think this approach
has a lot of benefits because it helps
you create parts of the software that
are really small really focused and
autonomous it reduces coupling between
different parts of the system because
they don't rely on their internal
representation this approach creates
better boundaries between the systems
and between the components which is
quite nice when you have to change and
this approach is actually more scalable
because if you do this right you can
basically take these parts and extract
them out of the mono if put them into a
separate release and scale it
accordingly of course you'd have to
switch the synchronous pops up with
something like message queue but it's
fine and you can easily do this
and it's also easy to change and this
was my goal from the beginning to find a
way that would allow me to change my
software easier to adjust to the needs
of my client my users so I think it's
doing a good job of course any approach
has its drawbacks and it's not the
exception so it requires some more work
because you have the duplication
sometimes you have to do a more more
initial work to make this happen so it
might not always be worth it and you
have to consider if you need it and it
would help you it also introduces some
something less familiar so you may have
to take some time to adjust but actually
when I talk to the new team members that
are coming to the project are seeing
these events their opinion is actually
quite nice because they have this small
part of the system that is responsible
for one thing only so they need to just
know the events and hear what they need
to do and they can do this easily and if
you take this approach and you you scale
it and you start to use message-passing
you start to use Kafka or RabbitMQ you
would probably have to deal with message
loss you have to deal with events being
delivered more than once so you would
also have eventual consistency so it's a
bit further but at least you have this
separation because you have on the one
hand you have the demo model
and its problems on the other hand you
have the problems with message loss and
you can tackle this problem separately
and one thing that is heart and there's
not a lot of resources is how to use
even versioning because when you scale
when you actually use micro services you
have to think about different versions
of the system running and what happens
if some old part of the cloud sees a new
event and this can be quite challenging
and one more thing is that you would
have to if your team is big enough and
if your system is picking up you have to
find a way to somehow share the
knowledge about the events in your
system so the other parts of the team
can do its job
but like I said all approaches have
their drawbacks it's not the exception
so you have to deal with that somehow
but there's more as I've said you can
use even sourcing to basically make the
event log the source of truth which has
a lot of nice benefits you can use this
approach to build micro-services
you have a lot of different storage
options and this is the topic that is
really interesting in terms of the the
Ireland and elixir ecosystem because you
can use database but you can just as
well use applying files to store some
information and this is actually nice
and actually can improve your system and
make it a lot simpler
oh sorry
for that you said that I shouldn't touch
this button I would like you to think
about the behavior and not to focus
about on the details because we often
start with the when we want to
accomplish some goal we often start with
the database schema and I think it's
wrong and it leads to different problems
that can be solved when you try to put
yourself in the users perspective and
think about the problems that you are
trying to solve so as I've said for each
part of the code that you are writing
think about what it what is the
responsibility of this part only then
think about the data only then think
about the source of the state because
it's much more important than the
representation of this data because
users don't care about the way that you
store data they care about what is
happening and the last thing use your
tools wisely and don't try to don't
focus on the roads because when you try
to read about even first thing when you
try to read about using even first thing
with secure areas when you try to read
about micro-services
you see a lot of people giving you these
hard rules that you have to follow I
think it's not a good idea
focus on your users and I feel I think
when you do that you will make yourself
a much better developer you'll make the
project better and you'll be much
happier thank you
okay anyone got a question hi thanks for
your talk
you know I wanted to ask about the event
model and the coupling part where after
successful booking there were three
things that we needed to do to
notification than the payment so what
happens for example if they are actually
coupled for example if the payment fails
we need to cancel the booking does it
mean that this event model will be much
more complicated or do you think that in
such cases should we actually take it
like in one module yeah I actually hoped
that someone has with the question about
the payments because the traffic that
there is no good answer because the way
that you handle these guys depends on
the business model it depends on the
user experience that you would like to
have in our your application so for
example you might have a requirement to
to charge the credit card and return the
error right away you may have for
example some discount codes that would
make it possible to always succeed but
one solution for example to what you've
said about that you would like would
have to return an error would be to not
notify everyone when the booking is
accepted but notify them only when the
booking is accepted and the payment is
done so it actually works quite nicely
because it is now the requirement that
you have so you have
unless accept sorry in Detroit you don't
send a notification when the booking is
accepted but you sent when the payment
is done and this is your business role
and I think it's it might quite nicely
and as as I've said there's no one right
question right answer because it all
depends on the business requirements
that you have any more any more apricot
question come on drop at time okay band
of applause thank you
