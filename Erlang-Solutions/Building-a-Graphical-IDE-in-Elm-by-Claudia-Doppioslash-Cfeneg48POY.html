writing a graphical IDE in Al and I'm
coded blue slash I'm a functional
programmer in the game developer I'm on
Twitter also P slash and they've write
about functional programming on lambda
cut and they work for pasty single GmbH
where we do embedded Erlang for the
industrial automation industry and
automotive so I can only have guesses
about why you are here one probably good
guess is you need to do some front-end
code and you hate JavaScript anyone fits
that almost everyone thought I was going
to do that you might be also be
interested in asking like languages and
this would fit a bill or you might be
have might have been here the para talk
yesterday and you were promised an ad
with them but that's not gonna happen so
just know from the start and so what
you're getting is a working progress
postmortem so why we my what project
what it is about why we use them why we
made the choices we made what went right
and wrong and enough fun to understand
what's why we did the things we did and
yeah and also them all of the it will be
a demo just not the hardware of the
final IDE so this is not an Allen guy
they wanted to use on just a little bit
but it will tell you what you should
look for if you want to make a project
with them if it's unfit and also it's
not a latest and version we talked about
a little later
so our projects and then pass the mic to
pair I think that's my part I'm here
yeah so the the problem domain is
industrial transport controllers so it's
like basically conveyor belts and we are
making them smart smart conveyor belts
using embedded nodes running airline so
this is one of the research projects we
were on this is part of this runs on
15-yard notes everything they control
everything in this whole area actually
it's a little bit longer it's cut off
these normally these convertible stuffs
and and industrial processes are
programmed in stuff that's called PLC's
okay and then PLC's are like weird
little computers that are used all over
the industry for everything and there's
a whole group of programmers the only
program PLC's and there is almost zero
overlap between this group here and
those those programmers the different
world but they they want to have their
own PLC languages which are basically
domain-specific languages to the thing
and to make the conveyor belt stuff
programmable by the PLC programmers
because we don't want to do them for
every convertible to like ourselves we
built a PLC compiler in Erlang that
compiles the column and basically runs
one class of PLC's which is having event
flow and data map styling process MS
it's just basically C programmers like
to have an IDE and that's why we need to
build an ID on top of this thing and the
IDE runs out of the embedded node the
demo broke just before the yeah that's
that's a function block you will see
these blocks you see that these blocks
are flying between them we don't have
the lines yet because there's some graph
layout problem to be built in along and
which is fifty percent done yeah that's
the device actually so that's that runs
along it's like this size and it's
basically the boards did I hide on the
table if you saw me Babu there so as we
said it's a visual idea for a PLC
language which has got this nice little
name at the end I see whatever a lot of
numbers and it was inspired by the top
from BetVictor inventing on principle
anyone has seen that No okay to people
but it was basically about making better
interface for programming so the you
might have seen a bunch of like the time
travel in the bugger for Elm
anyone a seed
few people the other was inspired by
that talk so this goes on in that
tradition so this is our project look
this is just a screenshot but we'll see
the project later and it's got the
function blocks that you just saw and
those at the side they are the variable
changes so if when a variable changes
value you see all the all the graphs
that are supposed to track that and if
you look at the screen shot down there
it looks a bit similar so that's you can
see the inspiration there so the
requirements for this project were that
it should run on many platforms included
iPad pro and you need to have decent
performers good enough to visualize
those notes and quite a few want a lot
of graphic stuff graphs and stuff like
that but 30fps would be probably fine so
instead of going native and making like
one up for iPad one up for Mac and that
would cost a lot and be very slow so we
went with but web technologies and that
would mean JavaScript CSS and SVG and
possibly WebGL but let's not touch other
state so we didn't want to do that at
the time which was more almost a year
ago now there were a few viable choices
like a closure script and CoffeeScript
anti script we do prefer functional
languages when we can so you know what
that went but if we were to choose now
there are quite a few more there is pure
squid fiber reason backer script
everyone is making their own functional
language that compiles to JavaScript
it's very crowded so why did we choose
an actually I think our main reason was
functional reactive programming because
Elm was based around it until the
version before the current one but now
it's gone so and then good error
messages that you might have heard of
them they're quite famous the Great War
Admiral messages and also the northern
time exceptions claim is fairly true
ninety percent of the time it's true and
also it had some concept that are
somewhat familiar to our land and we're
going to see them later
so what is Al has anyone done some Alma
ready I don't have to play much then
well it's purely functional
we typed you get evaluated which is not
like Oscar which is lazy compiles to
JavaScript and adduced to have
functional reactive programming as the
base of it but in 0.17 they got rid of
that it's got ask allies syntax but we
doubt the squiggles so you won't see
dollar signs everywhere it's also very
small it became optimized for learning
curve so you should with the zero by 17
you're supposed to be able to learn it
quite quickly so it's similar to ask but
you don't have any advance time it
doesn't have typed classes you don't get
to build your own moments and stuff like
that and one nice thing about elm well
maybe it's not sad enough is that
unpackage which is a package manager
enforces semantic versioning when you
publish the package if it's field didn't
version it right it will complain so the
pros compared to JavaScript is that fit
compiles in mostly work it might be a
bit of a fight to get it working it
might take some time but then you don't
get equal compile but then it will work
and you're also confident when you're a
factoring because the types will catch
most of the problems that you shoot we
laugh and it looks very clean at least I
like how it looks and it usually can say
the same things express the same things
in less lines of code and yet the famous
error messages which are good before
because they are contextual so they show
you your code and where the bit that
doesn't work is which is something many
people have copied now the rust is doing
that now and it also correct they also
correct common errors so they will catch
if you are miss naming another tie well
record name but we didn't talk about
records and also they are putting a lot
of effort into it by having people send
errors that are not great to a git
repository and then optimizing them one
by one but when you have a big elm
application you will find that the
errors are a bit less nice because they
assume that when you're for example you
define
rather big pipe somewhere and then you
use it in 30 other places so if you use
it wrong in one place it will tell you
that the definition is wrong at least
this is 0.16 even tell the definition is
wrong which is not very useful because
you want to know where you use it wrong
but I think it's up down to some
implementation of the time system type
system so probably they can't do much
about it I don't know if you seen the
talk what about JavaScript you probably
saw that array 16 equals to 16 commas
and stuff like that so you don't have
that in Allen you know so that's that's
a plus and there are also a few cons for
example if you want to wrap a big
JavaScript library say you have d3 and
you want to use it you won't be able to
just wrap it you have to make use of
ports which has they sound like element
ports and they are somewhat similar but
in basically they are an interface with
a type and you can only send a type
that's same value of the same type
through that port that goes to the and
then you're an application so it used to
be even less flexible because you could
you could only have ports on the main
file of your application which was quite
inconvenient in 0pi 17 it's more
convenient you can have ports everywhere
so that's a bit better but still it's
you can't just have a huge JavaScript
library like react and drop it into an
it's easy to adopt Elm into react and
also it's a new language is still 0
point X and so the may be a problem but
if it's only that so it wasn't that much
comes also I've been babbling about 0.16
0.17 just just to disambiguate that
there was a jump between 0.16 and 0.79
on 0.17 is the current version there are
6 months between them and they basically
removed functional reactive programming
which means they remove mailboxes
his signals and fold piece and also the
time travel in the bugger doesn't work
yet and it might change it might not be
quite as time-traveling as before so we
were we had we were using 0.16 and then
when this changed it didn't quite work
the porting as we expected but we talked
about it later
I also have been saying stuff like
mailboxes and parts they are concept
similar to a link so I'll just
disambiguate them now before I talk
about them more so mailboxes are send
signals through addresses signals a
stream of values and fault P accumulate
state and ports are like doors into jes
of a certain type so you just don't
believe they are the same as a link but
this is all 0.16 so you don't need to
know this anymore I'm not going to
interrupt into it so this is our project
the structure of it as you can see
there's a PLC board so everything that's
in the PC board block runs on the
hardware which runs the beam and on the
beam it runs the PLC program which was
compiled to the beam and kowboy plus
bullet so the police program runs it
sends debugging information to cowboyed
and Cambodian bullet bullet sends it
through WebSocket to the browser which
has got the bullet-dodger es bit which
threw pots talks to al meringue which is
our WebSocket library to the PLC IDE so
it's doing a bit of a roundabout and the
word you want to talk about this so now
we have the demo so this is you can see
it's moving it's been running for a
couple of hours now this is simulating
what you would have they firmly would
have from actual boards sending
information to this so yes a function
block you can see them up here are the
events in the upper side you can see
them
firing red when they fire and then below
there are variables which you might see
are changing doesn't need to be bigger
or can you all see it slightly bigger
see if that works
should work yeah but so I can for
example I want to know what this
variable is doing with this others
variable it's doing and I can just click
on them or remove them if I'm not
interested in them anymore so this is
the last 60 seconds plus a bit of
variable values so you're able to see
what your program was doing for a little
while and it's supposed to get better
you're supposed to be able to actually
edit those function blocks and also you
don't see the lines because we haven't
done those yet so that's basically it
for now and now we're going to talk a
bit about how this is structured because
it's rather big an application so this
is the structure we have the PLC device
which sends um rank which sends to the
decoder which decodes the messages and
blankets and sends them to the renderer
which has got the update and it keeps
the state and then renders the state to
the UI and then in UI interact to the
browser so the UI so anyway interaction
you get with that all the clicking of
variables it sends back to one encoder
to Jason then to unrung again and then
to the PLC device now having the oldies
are all components and talking about
components in Albie's a bit of a
controversial thing but for now we're
talking about 0.16 so it's not this is
our solution and I don't so don't you
probably won't be able to do it so these
are actually each single one of them is
a startup startup used to be the
implementation of the Elm architecture
for 0.16 anyone is familiar with the Elm
architecture
quite a few okay good with this 0.16 one
yeah yeah okay so each one of those is a
start-up and then we wire all of them
into the startup to rule them all and
they are sort of these components are
equal and you can send messages to and
from them to the FRP so startup is as
some of you know action model updating
view and action is just a union type for
example yeah this is a code for counter
and that's increment and decrement the
only only two actions you can do and
then we have a type alias that basically
so it's a counter so you can only have a
number for the state so we giving it the
alias model to remember that so this is
the update it's a fun just a function
that takes an action the action you're
just done and the model and returns you
the new mode for the next set of the
action and then the view used to take an
address it doesn't anymore but see this
is 0.16 and the model any we render that
model so this is a very quick overview
anyone needs more oh that's fine you all
need to know this stuff yeah so there
are four startups connected by mailboxes
in the structure and they're wide into a
parent setup so we have nested startups
and this stretch particular structure
was invented by the github user focused
on it and one of the nice things is they
are easy to expand it's easy to add
components and if you have effects in
one component you don't have to change
all the structure of your application to
accommodate for effects everywhere they
are just stay in that component and the
a mehrangarh web socket library is built
to be wired into this kind of structure
so so you might ask well are we still on
0.16 this is because we use FRP heavily
and there are a few cases were port into
syrupy there are a lot of cases were
porting to 0.16 is easy
because you have one startup and
everything makes sense in that case but
in our case the the 0.6 17 change came
very late in our development process so
we couldn't really backtrack and do a
turn about and that structure isn't
really very portable it's not obvious
how to do it and the original author
gave up on trying to port it so we're
not trying either we were a bit
frustrated with lack of communication
because there were no the professional
warnings that were like there are six
time months before me
between 0.16 and 0.17 and in those six
months there was only a two weeks time
period at the very end what which was
for beta testing and that's when we knew
about this so if we had been told
earlier we could have it was of public
money earlier we could have changed our
direction but it was too late them so we
are waiting now for an evolution to
stabilize and not port into 0.17 and I'm
gonna talk a little bit about al-imran
which is the casualty of the FRP Wars if
we want to call them and so it's a
WebSocket library which is mostly nel
and it wraps the bullet library which is
a library for cowboy which does
WebSockets and more just using n parts
but it also includes the JavaScript code
some JavaScript code to wrap it so we
can't send it to unpackage because the
policy is not to have that sort of thing
and unpackage should we put Purell and
then package should be pure elm so we
were meant to open source it but then we
never did because anyways it relies on a
wrap structure which you saw is very ad
hoc now and 0.79 has got its own
WebSockets anyway so don't know if
anyone wants to see it we might we can
open source it
yeah just ping us on Twitter or
something yeah
Seifer we don't want it anymore but it
works for us it's working so why did we
do it at the time when we started there
was no working WebSockets library none
there was only a very old one which
basically wrapped
whole lot of JavaScript so we wanted to
do it in a nice way and in a compatible
wait with particularly good way to work
with that long so we wanted to use ports
and to wrap bullet so that's what we did
that's why we did that so now I'm going
to talk a bit about the production
problems we had making a big up in elm
and making it work with Alan
well the main one is how to organize sub
components in a bigger map I don't know
if anyone ever had the problem but there
are a lot of articles around about
components in alum so it's a bit of a
topic and then since we have a
dependency which is Earl meringue which
cannot be on elm package how to store it
and how to keep it up-to-date without
making our workflow annoying and also
where to put the elm source code
especially if you want to use more than
one long app which has got their own elm
application within them well done we
never ended up using and that much in
multiple in multiple Erlang gaps but
that was a problem at the beginning so
this is our way to structure every
component if you have done some unto
trees but not a big app you probably
have every component in one file but
that doesn't really scale so this is how
we broke hits you will find online many
articles of people theorizing how to do
this in a different way but this works
for me so I'm keeping it so action has
got its own file model as well and view
as well and update as well and then
feature is a file specific for this kind
of structure you in the feature is of
sort of a constructor of the start up
and then you wide everything in yet
another file which we call up to ten and
then we feed that into the main I'll
start up
so about the dependencies which we can't
keep keep on that we can send on
unpackage we keep them on wrappers and
then we we have a makefile which fetches
them it stores them in a subdirectory of
the Ellen project to which they belong
and then it moves only the end files to
a subdirectory of the un-- project which
shouldn't be under elm stuff because
then you're gonna break your own
dependencies from L package which I
banged into I upon a wall yeah this is
the way to do it and then you include
the sub dealing to end package so we can
find your own files from this library so
it's a bit of a roundabout way to do it
but it works and also if you we have a
so to to compile the urn and have it in
where you want it we keep an unsub there
in the along project and then we compile
the young files to prove maybe under J s
so it produces just one J's file we can
then Y into the HTML file and that's
easy enough and that was it for the
production problems and now I'm going to
talk a bit about rendering which is my
favorite subject probably so we had a
bunch of choices we could have gone with
WebGL we could have done a 2d rendering
engine on WebGL which would have been
lovely but we never needed to do that
because it's fast enough the way it is
we also could have gone with SVG we
don't without CSS layout animations and
an HTML as well we could have generated
HTML all from elm without using any CSS
or having all our animations but that
was like the last choice so what we went
with is SVG with CSS and we can do CSS
because we have CSS CSS and SVG person
on call and she's an expert so when
something looks strange and we can't
figure out why in Firefox it looks one
way and the chrome he looks another way
on sulfide just explodes we can call her
and she
fixes us in half-an-hour so that's very
useful if you want to do this you
probably like better to do that so we
try to do as much as we can with CSS
because animation L can get complicated
because you have to keep a lot of state
the more complicated your animation is
the more state you have to keep because
you have to send it around so it gets to
be a lot of work though there are nice
libraries for it that is not a great
thing to do we know it's a bit
complicated we also keep our separate
styles CSS Styles separate in separate
CSS files though there are libraries in
al which you can use to sprinkle your
CSS inside your code if that's the way
you want to do it so one good thing
about almond generating HTML and SVG
with them is that I really love the
syntax it's very clean if you have ever
done any closure it looks a bit like
hiccup might look it's the same style of
stuff so you have your tag and the first
set of brackets is your attributes and
the second set of brackets is your
content and that compose is very well
it's also based on virtual Dom so it's
fast you will find online many
benchmarks about how fast Elm is so
that's useful so now I will give you
some conclusion about how good and how
bad was working with them on a bigger
project so I think the first suggestion
the first bit of advice is be aware of
what does best which is any if your app
fits into the Elm architecture that's
perfect then you have a lot of people
doing that and you can profit from that
experience everything works fine the
workflow is optimized everything is
great if for any reason it doesn't fit
the Elm architecture you may get
boilerplate and annoying and stuff like
that so before you start if you're doing
a demo if you're looking into it if
you're having fun it's probably fine
it's great it's a great way to do some
front-end stuff but if you have a bit an
app that's a bit more complicated you
want to think about it a bit before
diving in
also native modules if you have those
big JavaScript libraries that were
mentioning before if you want to wrap
the tree and stuff like that it's not
the best way to do it so and the
ecosystem is young so there are not that
many libraries so sometimes you will
have a bit a big bit of functionality
you want to put in and then becomes a
bit of a choice but you will find new
articles from Evan about integrating and
react so if you want to do that there is
a way to do that an own way to do that
also keep in mind that elm is
experimental this experimental so there
can be big changes they may not be
sufficiently advertised before they
happen so you should expect to have to
rewrite some code and also there is no
roadmap really there are short beta
previews before a new version lands and
you can't keep up by looking at the
changes in the compiler repository which
is a bit I don't know I don't like doing
that I don't know if anyone likes doing
that but recently Evan started doing
like weekly or bi-weekly update about
what is thinking of what is doing so
there is a bit more communication going
on now and they are on the island have
mailing lists so for us the next thing
to do is yeah we're gonna give 0.17 a
pass for now and maybe we're gonna take
a look at that when it's a bit more
mature and now we're looking at pure
script and maybe closer to crypt or any
of those languages that we listed at the
beginning which may warrant a good look
so I'm gonna explain you a little bit
why purity is a good next choice if
you've done a null project and as you if
you look at that it's the first four
lines are exactly the same it's purely
functional strongly typed eagerly
evaluated any compiled to JavaScript
it's also got an asking like syntax but
you get the squiggles so you have the
opera starship operator and you have the
dollars everywhere so beware of that
I've grown to lengths to like them
actually
it's also generates readable JavaScript
and it has got no runtime now in a lot
of stuff going on goes on in the run
time which is in JavaScript so you can't
just from your code you don't know
what's going on exactly but in pure
script you have to do whether it there
is no runtime to it there is no magic
you have to do everything which is a
good or a bad thing depending on how you
look at it also there are the advanced
types alum stops at type classes it
doesn't have typed classes it doesn't
want them either they will probably
never come if anyone wants them would
anyone want them no okay so yeah be
aware of the type classes the community
is very nice it's very open it's very
small which makes it easier to being
open but they got like an online meetup
remote meetup which is pretty fun and
they also tend to keep a bit of a road
map for where they want to go and what's
the next things are which is useful if
you need to plan so why pure skid is as
you saw it's quite similar in sort of an
evolutionary step if you're doing stuff
that requires some features that and
doesn't have so the types were good
enough at least I like them they work
for me and and stop the type classes but
you can do much more abstract stuff
which looks like fun learning and it
might be useful and it's useful for some
company using prescriptive production so
they do use it and they sell it so it
should be okay for production also for
pragmatic reasons like if you want to
implement your script in L you cannot do
it it's just not a general-purpose
language at the moment it's very live
the use case of web apps is very
optimized for now so it's focusing on
that but you can implement the whole of
elm as a library in pure script and
there is one guy was doing that yes it's
happening it's real and the spirit al
it's on github you can find it
pure script - shell so it's actually
taking the effort of
going through the JavaScript code in Al
that implements the runtime and
rewriting it in pure script which is
very interesting because it makes it
functional while it does that so it
becomes purely functional it's I think
it's an interesting thing to look at and
as I said the community is nice and
communication still works so it's fun to
learn so if you were dozing off this is
the summary album works fine with the
link and if an compiles it works 90% of
the time
boilerplate can get annoying don't
expect I mean fancy types bonnets no no
that's not the thing we do and it is a
skill students with less kringles and
the unexpected removal of FRP was a bit
of a bummer for us and now if we're
gonna talk a little bit about our Grist
board which we probably have seen it was
just beside the main room so it's a
board that runs along and it runs it on
her hard real-time operating system the
specific for embedded and if you
subscribe to the mailing list you can
get one that's a raffle going on so I
don't know if you're interested in and
by the stuff that's the thing you might
want to do so questions before we get to
the questions I think we should give
them a resounding roar out of law
all right we do have time for questions
anyone so thank you for sharing all
books really neat I've played with it
just a teeny tiny bit but what what made
you rule out a typescript if sort of
maturity and stability were primary I
only know that because I look at that
whistling wow those are all really cool
hard looking functional languages and I
know typescript is kind of like this
more accessible for folks who are not
serious functional programmers but we do
prefer function it's a lot more
conscious it were very mature we
probably would have looked at pure
script but and also FRP FRP was a big
engine of this decision
cool thanks anyone else everyone
compiled to JavaScript have you seen
this project JavaScript yeah I think the
author is in the room yes I was working
about three to five in Stoke and I was
stuck in the middle of nowhere so I
started in there and it was to go to
lamda days but I am now back home in
Scotland where I have a life so my
evenings are involved in politics it was
quite fun I was trying to make her actor
model an option I have it so it all
moves seamlessly and it was quite
exciting but I guess this is this is the
perfect time to give a shout out to
elixir script which is out there hint
hint
not much how many people working on the
project so how was how did you find Elm
as a language that multiple people had
to collaborate with me
I was only me doing the client and
there's person working on the person
working on the wrong side so two people
yeah I'm the two different-sized
so ya can say that excellent and what
else a heifer remark I mean the plug for
the grass board is there because the
demo intended to actually have the stuff
run on similar embedded boards which
belong to a company and so that was the
natural extension so now it's little a
little bit slapped on so that wasn't
intentional so but still still get get
get into the raffle it's a cool board if
you want to run the island on the
hardware chance to win free Hardware now
that's too good together give up okay in
that case thank you very very much for
sharing thank you for everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
