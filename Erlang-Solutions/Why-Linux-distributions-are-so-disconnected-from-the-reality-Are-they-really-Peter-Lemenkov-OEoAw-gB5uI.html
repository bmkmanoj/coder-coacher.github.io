first of all I'd like to apologize for
yours for a native English speaker
because I can I can't even imagine how
much pain will deliver are you
initially I was about deliver some kind
of propaganda for use for you to talk
how great the situation overall but they
cut all my time I discovered what my
time was quite limited will be quite
limited so I decided to cut almost
everything interesting and just make a
small coffee talk about the current
situation actually I don't believe it's
so bad as some one of you might think
okay
intro imagine situation so some of you
will download some application for
instant instant messager media player or
some game or something of like that and
you were trying to read how to install
it and first of all you found what you
need to install the latest JCC because
your distribution has a very outdated
one well it sounds really really strange
but it's exactly the situation we have
with a rank in right now in most of the
English distributions except 18 I hell
then the envious talk I'd like to
restock his consists of several parts
first of all I'd like to talk why we
here second what what could we do with
that then the prediction part latest one
every so what's the difference between
JCC just for example GCC and along first
of all Berlin is quite amazing however
some of you already know what all was
developed since 80s and open source 90s
but I believe that it was truly open
sourced in november two thousand nine
way it was registered at github and
afterward we have a huge del well almost
at the time we have a huge explosion of
interest to tolling people started
sending patches of san felipes previous
patch application passion was quite
complicated and almost nobody sent
patches yet contrast with what we have
now there are several problems because
since we have a huge explosion of
interest so the rural platform becames
quite unstable I mean unstable not
in terms of stability reliability but
unstable in epi some functions
introduced some function stitched
functions were removed and the
registration made the upgrade from one
version organ to the navigation quite
complicated furlong doesn't have any
backward compatibility what means what
if you build something this belong
healthy for air 14 or 15 you just can't
predict that it will run on earth 20 or
not so what could be a problem
now why people don't use digital distro
specific versions of them
well since airlock is major then we
still image there are not so many
popular libraries popular education
further major ones are from multimedia
guys from Marshall fellows and get
strapped but they're very little there
are many other applications are not but
are not so popular and probably
distribution maintain yrs just don't
know about him so we don't include them
in two distributions so if you deliver
some software if you deliver some salted
was a client just can't rely on what
already exists on the distribution well
I thought I missed one part when I
registered wed and conference where was
one question from the registration form
what was my desire audience I think my
desired first of all I believe my
desired audience was white with white
white however later I narrowed it a bit
I believe what all my dog should be
available for those who like to deliver
some software to the clients the outside
your house in forum software houseman so
keep it keep it a mile second problem
which produced by the distributions is
frozen the oceans package my antennas
very shy and not so brave people and if
we started from complaining we it's
better for them not to do anything
rather than doing something gradient
because every change school is quite
controversial so we try to avoid as much
as possible so since I told the other
but great between your chances is quite
complicated they don't want operate
without serious serious reasons but
that's why we stick with some may be a
bit outdated reactions of libraries and
apps among those view which are already
presented in your distribution of choice
maybe it's not a problem you know we
have or lock itself we have a wonderful
pool area bar which could build your
application which could deliver some
dependencies and the you you just tell
people you must rebuild very latest and
greatest one and install it somehow and
the aisle pull some software for you and
Google install if you believe it's evil
ask max luxion because he tried very
it's best just to rebuild or one
statically I mean statically revealed
against the way just leaves against not
yet sir if max here he run away ok so
it's quite complicated but the problem
is not about complication of that
process but
really what developers want we want to
deliver reliable method to deliver for
delivering the applications the people
or target host outside where what the
building platform second we would like
to ensure that it's up to date for what
killer client won't complain regarding
from the plane with outdated notions of
his software so we need somehow updated
and brewed work river has nice
integration with the several unit
testing facilities like ye unit testing
common testing its trap so it sounds
quite double oh it's not a bit of
history every language so far at some
point create their own incompatible with
anything else stripped down is the
latest version of package management the
it applies for before doral for air
language of float languages so people
came up with the idea at some point but
you know convenient package managers are
complicated the process of inclusion
soft waste over repeated as well so we
need to build something small which
reaches capable only deliver libraries
and application specific to what
language government is not the next one
exception here Iran provide several you
just what kind of simple similar well
some people believe that girl reebok can
handle x the extension get dependence as
well some other created some kind of
directory directory services with their
loan applications like zan and egg near
to name
later but later every language will try
its best integrative a homebrew package
manager in to commit an Indian big one
package manager because of several
problems which way encountered weight
after public introduction of the
homebrew homebrew package manager dates
and delivery so we return to what the
developer say require low price would
like to have well I wouldn't talk
anything about users because it's simple
to understand what users want they need
a reliable stable as software which
doesn't break switch which works so
let's focus on developers because i
believe almost of real school at health
risk and conference are developers
developers would like to create the some
kind of blob with the reborn or with
some kind of with some other tools
the problem is we don't know really for
sure whether it works at for client or
not because although rubber could handle
some manual specific specified
dependences fails to handle the border
cases yeah I'd say it water paces no
more than current projects doesn't
consist only from ethnic software from
beam files but also they probably have
some kind of nif stuff like so library's
board libraries see notes and yet yet
try all of them are require are unveiled
on system-wide software well for there
are two different approaches here for
instance bunch of folks decided to
bundle everything within the software
which requires which occurs external
stuff however for instance Koji beat
that does the opposite they explicitly
require some specific versions of
software which must be installed for in
your system before we run koji be for
instance what's the problem rebar
generated release doesn't have doesn't
know anything about what user will have
on his system no you may build your own
software is Ubuntu always given how our
user will have some vintage stuff like
hl4 principes absolutely different set
of library with totally different
compiler and etc so if you run every
every test from your industry bar you
ensure that it will work for you and you
deliver to the user to the customer and
the you
you surely have a complaint from him but
you know it doesn't work for me because
because of some political sorry
so I propose the different approach
somewhat somewhat more complicated when
just delivering something this rubber
integrate rubber and your favorite
distro package management system it's
much better much
so as I told you the rebar doesn't
handle package dependence as well
however distro package manager does so
if you would like to deliver a software
in a reliable way you mastery use
package manager you must use it as much
as possible let's let's let's there are
a few different stages actually there
are few different stages of software
delivery first of all you should prepare
your hardware to build some stuff I mean
you need to install and JCC you need to
install well a little one on your own
machine in you to unit get you need lots
of tools for example second stage is
expected building where probably lacks
is interesting convenient two hours and
people still use albertos later if time
permits I will tell why the next stages
is building a package which also can
could be done with the rank or oval
three bar quite well next stages is
dependency calculation deliver it to the
client for the land and the installation
upgrade remove as you can see later
later stages can be really managed by
rapper because he already does his job
and quit for instance you build some
quite good software product with me lots
of new files within it and delivery to
the plan so 5 and looks unfortunately
well unfortunately because you should
know about that assumes puzzle client
agreed his machine without without any
warns with or several missions without
any warnings because your package that
will we will not wasn't integrated with
the package manager so an packages we
upgraded nobody Lee
really found the problems and after
reboot if if he upgrades camo after good
he found word now we know nothing works
for for now so if you deliver him not a
simple zip file or something like their
package or RPM package with dependencies
specifically assured earlier where won't
be such sorrow case for you
Oh different stages sorry I missed stop
repair and package manager so what I
would like to fail is everybody's
doesn't manage the dependencies is just
a build tool like photo tools it's much
more frenzied convenient for your
language when how the tools because it's
just simple its various it's ultra-easy
superior easy to drop some stuff and the
rebuild your prey by the package however
you could do encounter some issues if
you start building an IFV that stuff
especially if you would build not only
for for you for specific hardware but
for different hardware for powerpc for
chile era i heard with folks from IBM
and experiment with nolan on power
architectures probably with RabbitMQ
also i know with some folks from
australia experiment with still era
boxes it's different i early different
architecture so we just you just can't
rebuild that stuff on your machine for
them you must provide some convenient
rain way for them to get the software
so river is a bill to package manager
kingdom could be dependencies which ever
can do unless you specify explicitly
however well no every time when you
specify something manually you probably
add a room for father and works of other
issues so I'd like to avoid that
completely but like should do it for you
well not but with me later explained so
how to create dependence chain with from
within our own packages well I would not
say anything about dependency population
management from see projects I C++
project what was already just described
it loads of times you google for that
however for long is a bit complicated
maybe not so many people really dig
inside the word what's inside what's
inside the skin of prolong where there
is a interesting application beam
library beam leap application which
could offer you a convenient way to pray
compose and controls back beam files by
analyzing each beam files from your soul
from your software package you could
build a list of dependence build a list
of expert advances in the model air
function eregi format you could also
build a list of expert functions in that
format as well it can't handle situation
with apply ma functions function calls
but now there is no perfectionism in
that world so you need all you need is
to provide books specific books to the
package manager of your favorite Easter
I've am aware of bad stuff from within
I'd linux distribution how I don't know
how far away we go with Ray Dante I've
heard what folks from debian did some
research in that area they built a quite
interesting dependence milord dependency
co-creation system for long we in fedora
project and as well as hpl project the
beautiful and goals this is a similar
goals and we in process of building
software I dependency co-creation alone
project and if if everything will go
right if time permits when probably to
the next the RPM package manner will
reduce something at work pokey k
well there are some carrots I'd like to
warn you before you started following me
first of all you should unbundle every
third party library you are bundled so
far well it's it's not rocket science it
was described at multiple times and I
don't ever waste my time and describing
that again and it's the right thing to
do just just do that stuff second came
from with the union well you know i'm
not the Isle of a unit as well as most
of you I believe however I'd like to
warn you what a unit operates on
different set of files different beam
files when Rose which you would like
deliver because Italy compiles
everything with some specific debug info
with some specificity defiance for
instance with export all for example we
you might be I was very surprised how
many rows I found so far just body just
basically analyzing or being files from
quite quite no well known software
developers because we just didn't spot
that before because they compile
everything and running tests and he in
the test 10 without errors so we believe
that everything was working so it's not
because we don't we missed some
experienced export functions which could
lead to some problems actually I believe
that it up a library is underestimated
so big and resonated because you know
every time you find some news about
prologue you you may add work insulated
because no we created is elated built to
River just for one we created related
set of unit tests just rollin we created
a solid red and this little red it up is
not is a wait up
allows you to run pests from the ground
from the very very basic stuff like Jay
lips with in some cases it could be
interred just in some case however I'm
not opposed to the unit i love you as I
told you already so this archive it how
about release well as you might know
luck is a great tool because he builds
released simple before Allah rebar
before rebar were building releases well
quite painful and almost everyone just
skip that part I'll will deliver it that
old school way we don't want to hot cold
alone yet Sarah or build their own to
sweat for instance yeah hello many rebar
could build release quite well huh so is
it possible at all to integrate building
release it's just a blob of data it's
not so nothing really complicated into
the boat was already done with the
package management for imagine the
situation where every you need for your
project already available is from within
your distribution so can you just
rebuilt release one from what you have
well probably at not right now problem
is what the dependence generator which
is not yet released but it it should be
already fixed because release require
specific exact specific versions the
same is the sum of you already know is
the same situation in a camel because if
you build a camel not like FML don't you
get just one stating library if you
build it properly well no problem other
way if you build it now in the other way
with a set of namak reload all the
libraries you surprisingly found that
the single change in the library singles
the fixed in the library
ruins entirely API so you need precise
version requirements we in fedora build
a single hash for each library and the
dependency chain is intact until you do
something really horrible so the same is
poor along the same they is required for
long dependent sick generation the
release generation so if you deliver a
release on how we need to build the
tight version dependence is not like
previews new popular ones require this
version of higher like enjoyable for
instance
beyond it well the problem general
another one problem is can we store more
modern version of software no it's
molinos smoker great sing-along liver
pate require that you have at least
three versions of Berlin current
previews and the version in you Erich we
are about upgrade to its possible almost
every package manager I found so far
given package management adventure RPM
and there Mac Mac with 68 stuff allow
you to install both more on one version
so it's it's doable however you need to
fix River as well see it's in working
process as far as i know because blanc a
bottle tries to read and write into the
right into the system library via normal
user can't simply right into the the usl
lib or lung in stock so it eats diable
but double but this time you need some
time to give something proposal so my
views the parts both i cut almost all
everything interesting from them so I'm
cause I've read watch myself what its
last time I'm apologizing by the way I
I'd like to convince you with the
situation what was bad you need to work
the world you need to move towards
package manager Park a package maintain
it as i told you i shy and not so brave
torsions just throwing a little help and
maybe just shows sign of interests nine
don't well most people can't really well
handle and personal abuse except me
maybe because people are trying to be
polite with me so the to fix that
situation you should participate in the
in life of your party only in your
particular favorite distribution because
it gives you great advantages it will
fix it will deliver your clients
reliable delivery is a reliable platform
on which you could build a great
software if when stuff otherwise you may
skip that part why really well the most
important the most important motivation
is I get because I can he as I told you
you're already probably do some stuff in
that direction you are building some
great stuff and delivering the plants
why not to do it in a better way I'm not
to ensure that I not to run a robotic
test some kind of automatic paste which
are which could ensure what your
software will be delivered in a better
way rather than just providing a zip
blog with Henderson but also you will
bully borrow some expertise for free
from the grid guys because when just the
one story which I had he's a situation
which CouchDB as I told you already
cochiti require specific version of
javascript javascript interpreter
library unfortunately we in fedora
upgraded to the next version from a1 dot
7 dot x 2 1 dot a dot X which complete
the rules the entire on functionality of
CouchDB I I don't know what to do I
didn't know what to do a jaw and I asked
help for the grid guys for poor capable
of doing bad stuff what well very well
familiar with internals of JavaScript
and they fix of it so we delivered a
coach to be based on next version of
java script about a six month before
everybody else everybody else so well i
believe that what sounds quite the
interesting just to borrow something for
free from read
expertise from you guys predictions oh
that's fine fun stuff it was a nobody
will blame if predictions if something
goes wrong I just say just very
adjustment I predict that deal about to
see a bad integration of rebar and
convenient package management we are
about to see further expanded along
support and auditors I don't have time
for photos you may ask me in private
later what ails also one is a feature is
a session I absolutely sure you'll see
very soon is a some kind of library or
location would you with the gif files
directly probably written Python maybe
maybe because I already see people
expressing interest in that direction
because they trying to manipulate or log
files being files without not link
itself it's have some user case forth
thanks that's all any questions
look
we simply activity was over maintaining
up I get really dirty a probably you go
pro so the school committee blemishes
toy is poison if I get of GMO is put it
in your I know what about 40 minutes
that's why so great how well you know as
I told the other idea I don't have much
time for my topic also I have right not
so great no and so foolish so I cut
almost everything so just believe me
it's great well I think no one
particular one particular field and I
couldn't tell you is reproducibility of
the results know if you deliver
something to divide audience audience as
well as total you're right testing
machine maybe you put ensure that
everything works as as you plan if you
just build it and drop some zip file as
Apple sometimes you just don't know
whether it works or not ask max option
he tell you the spitter truth regarding
how complex is just the building some
zip file and deliver the device
isn't on the contrary if you build it
within your distribution if I
redistribution you just point user with
the distribution it will work I prove it
it's a reliable platform maybe I don't
know what save it so I believe it's
better when just just don't participate
in ball isn't the Carroll sandbox enough
for delivery
either flirtation is put in your son
soon works of the superhero Pitons
googled oh and Elliot who would disagree
enter well regarding Carol and it's be
honest I didn't dig into details I got
in car but it's the same it will face
the same problems if you upgrade for
change underline libraries and her long
as it depends on underline vibrates
especially if you change or remove a
gradient strap underlying vibrators from
the new file from the board for
libraries from in see notes it will
probably ruin an application your
application probably probably not who
knows we don't know however if you
control all that stuff with the package
manager you will if you it won't a user
to mess with the dependencies want even
I do it does something thank you Peter
