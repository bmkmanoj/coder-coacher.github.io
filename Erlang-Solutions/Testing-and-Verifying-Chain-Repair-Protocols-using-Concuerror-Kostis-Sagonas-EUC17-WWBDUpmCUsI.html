and the lightning books adventures in
Corfu
testing and verifying change repair
protocols using Conqueror and this is a
joint work with Stavros and with a guest
star that you will find out during the
talk I would like to start with a bit of
geography this is the coral island in
Greece it's in the northwest of Greece
pretty between Greece and Albania as you
can see on the map it's a pretty big
island and immediately below to the
South there are the Paxos islands and
paxos is as we heard these quite
expensive actually which is true
Corfu who is not so expensive it's not
very cheap place either but it's not so
expensive as parcels and it's a very
picturesque place and I would love to
just tell you that I went there and I
had very beautiful mornings drinking my
coffee and looking at something like
this and then in the lunch time I had my
very much like to actually caboose or
for luncheon this is true in the summer
only in this looking at such beautiful
scenery and in the evening you can have
a very nice lunch in places like that
one but as a matter of fact this talk
started after vacations when I came back
my student
Stavros informed me of a tweet that he
had seen while he was on vacation and
this - it was this one I was all ready
to have a celebratory new algorithm
works tweet then the DPR model execution
with conqueror found invalid gates ouch
and it so happens actually that I'm not
in Twitter I don't really care about
with her and over the last few months I
came to realize that I probably should
not pay too much attention on what
imported Americans write on Twitter but
this one is actually special it's a it's
a very knowledgeable person part of our
community is Kotlik Fritzie who
describes his also on Twitter as a jack
of many big centric trades many of them
along flavoured and he has worked in a
number of companies and has done quite
nice projects and software tools and you
can see here what he has been working on
in particular just in case you did not
know it he was the one that contributed
the first version of the trace that you
can support that exists in OTP and this
day she is working on corfu DB and
that's where he is at working at VMware
and he is working a project called corfu
DB and that were the connection of
adventures in corfu comes in it's not so
picturesque as pictures I just showed so
si s where my actual talk actually
starts I will talk briefly about chain
replication and chain repair then I'll
talk about systematic concurrency
testing and the tool we have built on
conch which called conqueror some of you
may have seen it in other talks or in
the tutorial yesterday and I will do a
very very very short demo and then I
will try to discuss how we can how we
actually use Conqueror to verify
algorithms and protocols that people at
the anyway
have been distracted designing actually
so it wasn't like they took an existing
protocol out there and we just verified
it and as part of this process actually
we found that we could improve certain
things on conqueror and I will describe
also about these things so let's start
with basics what is chain replication
who has got to change replication here
before some people but not so many it's
actually not a particularly difficult
algorithm to understand how it works
it's a variance it's a variant of
master-slave replication there is a
strict chain order and to just simplify
things let's say that we have three
servers a head server a middle server
and a big server so all the right
requests start from the head server and
they propagate slowly to all the other
servers and a right is only appears only
when it has propagated to all the
servers it has gone to red tail ok so
that's when we can all agree that the
right exists there so since things are
happening in this in that order all the
read requests should actually be
serviced by the tail server so all the
read requests happen at the tail server
so this is a fault tolerant in the place
of failures and of course we have to
worry about how to repair this chain in
the case that failure happens so if you
want all the reads our sequence at the
tail if this is linearizable
at any point if you want realizable rage
you can read from anywhere and dirty
reads you can read at the head or middle
if you want if you have dirty thoughts
you can do that sort of thing I not
recommended but anyway
so let's say that we want some failure
happens and we want to repair this chain
so let's say that we have a chain of
just three servers just to simplify
things and one of them crashes let's say
the blue one crashes and we are left
with the remaining two servers in the
chain that you see here with the key on
and whatever other color deals that
happens to be in your screen I cannot
see it from here from here it looks like
brick color so you copy the tails update
history - now the repairing node and one
way of doing region repair in the
channel application protocol is to put
that repair node at the end and once all
the update history has gone to the to
the repairing node then you have
restored the chain now while the chain
is being restored all the reads go get
serviced by the tail but not the
repaired chain the repaired server ok
the in in this picture is the middle the
brick color the reddish color server
that services all the reads until the
chain is fully repaired in which case
now there will be a point of where the
chain will be declared repaired and now
the green one will be the new tail that
would be servicing all the reads now
this is not dark arisen publishing news
leaks many years ago and has been
implemented in various systems among
other systems in hibari
DB which is one of the database systems
that scope has been working
while she was working in Japan and she
body is sort of similar to this one but
places the repelling note directly on
the chain and reads go to the old came
here okay so so you can have some
variations and you can have various
protocols of preparing this chain one
things go bad so there is a new system
out there initially developed by
Microsoft research called corfu these
days is developed by vmware co and it's
called corfu DB but the main idea is
that it's a variant of general
application but it has three changes
there is possibility of replication I'll
go to the client not the server's an
actual clients do not communicate in any
way with each other and all the course
chair servers implement right one
semantics so you never update values
here and it the protocol or the corfu
identifies its chain configuration with
an epoch number and all clients and
servers are aware of this epoch number
that the server's reject client's with a
different Epoque number and a server
temporarily stopped service if it
receives a newer and epoch number from
the client so everybody has a chance to
match will go to the new epoch and
continue from the point on ok so the
engineers at VMware what they were doing
they were designing channel chain repair
our goals for Corfu and of course in
Scott is one of the engineers that had
worked on chain repair algorithm before
he said ok let's try to do this body way
let's try to put a very paired node at
the end so that's one of the protocols
that he first tried so they were sitting
around there in a white board or a
blackboard or I don't know what
they were discussing really and they
were trying to see whether this he body
way of fixing the chair where the chain
will actually work so they do something
like this one let's say that they repair
during a poke some approximate paper
could be back 5 let's say and we have a
client that is writing a new value to
the cluster for a data with an old value
so this new value of course propagates
from the head till the end so it's
conceivable that during at the point of
epoch 5 you will have the new value on
the head then in the previous tail
server you might have an old or a new
value and of course in the one that you
are repairing you will have an old value
okay so while this value this new values
get propagated let's say that somebody
decides that it's time to change a
netbook and in the new epoch when you
change you will have also of course a
new value in the previous chain that you
didn't need to repair and in the tail
that now in the new tail you might have
an old or a new value okay depending on
whether the new value has arrived there
or not so if it is the case that
somebody sees a new value at the
previous tail in an old value now in the
new epoch this is a violation of
realizability property and actually this
is possible you can you can sit down and
think really hard and find the case
where this is actually happening and
that's what the engineers of vmware
found okay so
but this body way of fixing J chains of
repairing chains doesn't work for Corfu
it works for he body but doesn't work
for Corfu
so they I don't know exactly how many
days they expend in this but how or
perhaps an hour or doesn't really matter
but they found the case that this didn't
work so let me then they said ok let's
try to have some other protocol but at
that point
Scot who knows our work quite well said
ok this is totally pointless why do I
have to be why do we have to spend all
our time thinking about these algorithms
and trying to find counter examples why
don't we just program these algorithms
as concurrent programs and have a tool
like Conqueror to try to see if it can
find counter examples so what is and of
course what it started is with
programming this particular one that
they knew it was buggy
so if contro can find the error here
then at least this gives some confidence
that the tool is not totally crappy ok
it can find the error so at least you
know the what they have done spending
time thinking can be automated and then
perhaps they can program the other
protocols that they had no clue whether
they are correct or not also in the tool
and have the tool find the counter
examples ok
that's exactly what it did and this is
exactly the adventure I'm telling you
here but now I have to take a detour and
discuss how Conqueror works and actually
how stateless model checking works
stateless model checking sometimes is
known as systematic concurrency testing
this is testing on steroids you test you
really test very systematically but very
very very systematically until you are
sure that actually you have explore
or everything okay so this is not quick
check like testing this is not pulse
like testing this is verification okay
you have a guarantee that you have
explored everything if it terminates of
course okay but at least if it
terminates you have a guarantee it's not
like oh it didn't find any errors
now what so how does it work let's
assume that you only have one scheduler
back when I grew up where we had single
core systems so then you ran an
arbitrary execution until it finishes
and then you backtrack to a point where
there is an alternative where there
could be some other process that could
be scheduled there and you pick say
let's say the latest of these
backtracking points and from there you
continue with another execution and you
keep repeating that until all the
choices have been explored it
conceptually is as simple as that
okay now let's do it in an example here
so let's have some airline program it's
a relatively simple airline program it's
a concurrent one we have a main function
and which spawns two new threads p1 and
p2 and this p1 and p2 are calling some
code from some other module the good the
bad and the ugly module in this example
I will only use the good and the bad and
then there is a receive statement that
checks whether it has received good and
then there's a lot more computation and
you know things are ok if it receives
bad it does we'll do some more
computation but a bag will be hit so it
will be I will show this with a throw
error if it receives some other message
let's say
the ugly one then it would do some more
computation and things that okay and
actually it will also check if it gets
to the point of the receive and it has
no messages mailbox and things will be
okay okay so all of you I guess can find
out that this program there is a way of
crashing this program I hope this is
clear to everybody okay so whoever
doesn't see that obviously hasn't
programmed concurrent airline ever okay
what is not going to be very easy to
answer for you is how many interleavings
there are here that conqueror needs to
explore what's the minimum number of
internal it exactly that need to be
explored anybody have a guess not
conqueror developer but let's find out
okay so I actually have this program and
I'll show you how easy it is to run
conqueror you run conqueror by just
typing conqueror with the name of the
module that you want to test in this
case it's called foo and the function
that you want to also test and this
function better not take any arguments
because if it takes any arguments then
you have something else you don't have
only in the concurrence in turn
determine ISM you also have input non
determinism and conqueror that will
generate inputs automatically okay so
you run this and conquer does it magic
automatically so what has done here it
has instrumented the i/o lead the gem
server the module foo that we run the
module airline and the module bar that
recall we were using to get the messages
from the button a good and bad the ugly
and it has explored five Intellivision
total and one of them is error
News and it so happens that I have them
here and I can just oops
I can just show them how it this is
generated by conqueror by this option
that suggests so the first interleaving
we are calling the we are executing P
direct continuously until it finishes we
are entering the receive and nobody no
other process has ever sent messages at
that point so we are going to the time
out of the receive so P exits normally
and then the p1 process does its job and
sends its a good message but there is
nobody to receive it at a point well
this exit normally and the bada the same
thing this is okay
another interleaving is to start by
executing the two spawns they receive
and then have the other order of
executing p1 and p2 namely P p2 gets
executed first and p1 gets executed
second there are some other and
interesting interleavings and is the
last one which actually is the one that
causes the error which is we are
spawning the two processes here then we
are not going to the receive but we are
going to say p2 that sends the bad
message and then we are going to the
receive which receives the bug and goes
there to the case where the error is
troll okay so this executes all the
interesting interleaving that it can
find here which are five in total
okay so we have this five in the
living's showed them how they look
okay so conquerer is a stateless model
checking tool the transit tests are all
possible conceptually interleavings it
detect abnormal process exits
you can put arbitrary assertions at any
point in your code and it will crash if
these assertions in violated are
violated and reports all the events that
could lead to the crash so you can
actually see how the process getting the
lid so that you get to the point where
things crash now you might be thinking
okay is it really all the interleavings
I mean there are really too many too
many right so it turns out that actually
not all the pairs of event are in a race
so we only have to reverse to reversal
or to check holding the livings on
things that race not from say what
processes process local executions are
doing and actually we only need to
explore one in the living pair class and
for this kind of audience I will leave
what a class of in the Linux is
unspecified by but take my word for it
that there is a very clever algorithm
that we have designed that new chala
called optimal dynamic partial order
reduction which is the first algorithm
ever to do partial order reduction in a
dynamic way in an optimal way so the
algorithm works at run time that what
the dynamic means it reduces the set of
interleaving that has to explore by
exploring the past by by taking into
account the partial order of all events
and it's optimal
it's probably optimal it will explore
only one in the living in each class
of something called Moskovitz traces
that you should not really worry if you
haven't heard it and you probably don't
want to hear about it but believe me
this is a very strong algorithm it has
appeared in purple some years ago and it
will appear at within the year JCM this
is very good stuff
so we now on top of that the tool comes
with ways of actually exploring even
less interleavings so if you can put a
bound you'll see that I want to only
explore to two points of pre-empting its
process I don't want to check that all
my process can be preempted any
everywhere so you can put a bound and
you can put you can select vary between
various bounds this is not a tutorial of
the tool so I will not explain all the
possible bounding ways that you can
bound stuff but let's say we want to
test our example here with b0 do I need
more I'll find out so rather than 5 it
has explored only one ok because this is
what you have to do if you don't allow
any way of pre-empting of any anyway you
think of interrupting each process that
is running all you can do with one and
we'll find a bit more interleavings
three of them in total don't worry why
they should be 3 or 4 or 5 but they are
less than all the number of interleaving
that you need without a bound now in
this particular case where you are using
the bounding you have absolutely no
guarantee that you will find all the
bugs
but you have a pretty good chance that
if bugs exist you will find them okay so
let's go back to the Corfu adventure so
what the engineers at VMware did is they
designed a model for the system remember
that they didn't even have a system okay
they were designing the protocols at
that point so the model is that some
servers let's say one or two would
suffice for what we are doing undergo a
chain repair to add to add one more
server to the chain and concurrently
with that there are some regions and
writers let's say that two other clients
try to write two different values to the
same key and we need two different
values because we want to test that the
right ones property of corfu is
maintained and then we have another
client that was to read a key twice why
twice so that we can see whether there
is no possibility that we can read first
the new value and then the old value
okay those are as a violation of
linearizable so the two properties so of
course modeling Corfu is straightforward
in Erlang really straightforward you
don't need to know you know formal
methods and you don't need to know any
modeling language and whatever else
complicated you just model the server's
and the clients as Allen processes and
all of course they request model as
messages and it so happens that here you
need the following processes you need a
central coordinator so that checks
what's happening it's like God's here in
some sense you need the log servers of
corfu two or three will suffice
you need the curve layouts
a core for reading client the to writing
clients and something that changes the
layout and the data repair process okay
so you need quite a lot of processes
which actually make the number of
interleaving that you actually really
need to explore quite many and they
tested with that one three different
chain repair methods the first one is
the one that they knew it was buggy they
add repair node at the end of the chain
the one I showed you and they knew that
there is a there is a counter example
that this doesn't work in the other tool
they did not know whether this algorithm
work the second one adding the repair
node at the start of the chain is the
one that surprised Scott to the extent
of writing that within Twitter okay
because he thought that this would work
but the tool found a counter example and
a third chain repair method adding them
per node in the middle and when you add
stuff in the middle you have to worry
about whether you are adding to a chain
with only one element or to a chain with
more than one element let's say two
while you are adding to easy easy you
just put it in the middle when you're
reading into in the middle of something
that's just one well you need to do some
logical split there so you have to model
this thing in some way okay so they did
is in control and what's happened here
oops
so these are the these are the number
that we got actually they did some small
bugs in their modeling which we have
worked with them to fix them so these
are the numbers from the correct models
but basically what's happening here is
you're using bounding you find the bug
very very very fast
in under a minute with the first method
and insert just seven seconds Conqueror
will find immediately after exploring
sixty five only three traces with a
second method adding to the head and you
find no bugs for the third one but
that's with bounding and I explained
already that if you you cannot verify
things with bounding because you only
explore a subset of all the possible
interleavings so in for the cases where
there is a bug the bounded exploration
will find it very fast so you can you
don't have to think four hours around
the whiteboard you can just write a
program and in less than a minute
Conqueror would find you that's when we
find the bugs in your algorithm for you
now what you cannot do in this way is if
you have an algorithms actually happens
to work and it doesn't have a debug then
you have to wait because in order for
you for conquerors will tell you that
your algorithm is correct
it has to explore using optimal DP you
are all the possible ways that it can
reduce given be the optimal of the PIO
algorithm but still there might be to me
and as we see here in this table there
sometimes there are many so for example
to find the bug without bounding in the
first method that we know it's buggy
it's a tool in first needs to explore
three and a half million different
livings and that takes about it 1144
hours
this is on a standard desktop and
actually five years ago desktop but
sometimes the tool is actually very
lucky in its exploration for the second
method it finds it in just 26 seconds
without bounding in the cases where the
algorithm might actually be correct it
might take a while like 750 hours and
the tool hasn't finished yet yes yes
unless you use the minus K option which
surprisingly doesn't stand for coasties
but it stands for keep going ah yes but
if you find the bug and you want to sit
you can't if it stops it stops foot if
you know it's more it's more than that
it's all all of them have many many many
many million states okay so we have what
we have so far we have 12 them that we
know they don't work and one that might
have a chance to actually be correct now
that's where we actually started
becoming interested in what we can do to
actually optimize the tool so I will now
use the ugly message also so this is a
variation of the previous program but we
have responding three different
processes p1 p2 and p3 and each of them
is sending a different message the good
the bad and the ugly and we have a
slightly different receive actually as a
matter of fact we have a combination of
two receives here one which just checks
for good and one good just checks for
ugly
and in both cases here
actually it's things go okay but let's
this is not the point here the things
are okay the so the question is how many
interleavings does Kankuro need to to
check and the previous version of
conqueror was actually needed to check
six different in their livings and you
see them here I will not explain them in
detail and this is the because of the
all possible ways that sending three
messages can be received by two receives
okay and it need to explore all the
possible ways that messages can arrive
but this is where you know I thought
about it for a while said here we can do
something better
this receive is the first one say it's
blocking so it all it's only interested
for the good message to come we don't
need to check all the possible ways of
messages arriving in its mailbox okay
because it's only interested in the good
one and similarly for the second receive
we are only interested in the ugly one
so it turns out that actually here you
can do much better and you can optimize
this type of thing and do some special
modification of the algorithm that is
still not in the in the public in the
distributed version of the tool but we
are working on making it part of the
distribution and this will cut down the
number of different of the number of the
number of in the lives of need to be
explored even with optimal dpor based on
the fact that we know the patterns in
receives
now treating this blocking especially
avoid exploring a possibly exponential
number of interleavings and this
something that we did by hand for Corfu
because it was actually happening quite
a lot in the model
it was the coordinator we're receiving
you know this client is done the other
writer is done you know many messages of
that for me so that's one optimization
within the tool then we did to model
refinements one based on conditional
rate remember that we had two readers
that we're trying to read an old to
values and check whether it's never the
case that we did the new value first and
then the old value second so we avoided
these really neat operations that were
sure not to result in violations so for
example if you ever read the old value
first it doesn't matter what the second
one is because it will not the linearise
ability property will not be violated so
we changed the model to do this
conditional read operation and for
technicals I will not explain right now
we converted one of the processes to an
X table now given these two small
changes in the model that were done by
hand now we could actually verify method
3 and method 1 even without bounding it
finishes in just 19 seconds and find the
bug in just 19 seconds
even without the bounding and Method 3
is now verified so we have actually
verified using concealer but unless
there is a bug in the model that was
written by hand the algorithm is correct
and this verification now finishes in 40
to 8 hours and needs to explore less
than 4 in
young places in total that's it so this
is a talk about how we can use a tool
that we never we design for a totally
different region we want to find
concurrency Rose Nyland programs but
somebody clever enough like Scott went
and use this tool to actually do
verification of protocols and algorithms
that were not even implemented and he
found the result surprisingly enough
surprising enough to actually spend some
time in playing with the tool and
refining them and you know this encoding
that they're all three different methods
in the model and you know just showing
to his fellow intelligence fellow
colleagues that hey you know this
algorithm that you think it might work
it doesn't have a chance because it
here's about registration that does work
so conquerer is a tool that can be used
very effectively to test concurrent
programs and concurrent al Ghul's in
general and occasionally it can even
verify their correctness I would like to
just repeat that this is not quick check
like testing okay here you get
guarantees which you do not get with
quick check okay or with proper for that
matter and conquerer is a very is a tool
that has a lot of potential both in the
airline world and perhaps elsewhere it's
not something that you can use
immediately it requires some patience
and
requires to play a bit with it and get a
feeling of how it works but if you have
some interesting algorithm that you are
not sure whether it's correct or not if
you have a program that you really want
to find out that it never crashes it's
an amazing tool to actually find you
these things if your program is crashing
conker is very very effective in finding
it quickly the problem is if your
program doesn't crash okay because it
might take a long time to find out that
it's not crashing so all the code is
available on github and of course you
cannot remember this one by heart but it
will the slides will be there at some
point and this is an open source project
so we welcome contributions of any sort
that's it
for any questions yes yes the question
is whether you can estimate it good
enough yes there is this thing and
conquer does come up does come with
something that estimates the number of
places the problem is that estimated
only to the point that has looked okay
only to the backtracking point that it
knows about notice the backtracking
point that has not seen yet okay but has
it can get some some reasonably
reasonably precise not always but
sometimes actually this estimate works
it's an estimate okay
any more questions yeah but what you can
do is determine I know this is not
asking your is not answering your
question but what you can do is you can
start with very small bounds
where it will actually finish very very
very very fast and get some estimate of
your own how how the how the numbers of
places increase by increasing the bound
most most likely with a bound of three
or four you will find the banks and you
will have a good estimate yourself at
that point how many that will be with
unbounded one yes now could be paralyzed
yes absolutely and I have a student in
Greece who is supposed to do that but I
don't know perhaps he will go vacations
in Corfu and sit on the beach and have a
nice time and paralyze it any more
questions
okay does it support testing processes
that are running on different nodes that
is in a distributed mode or is it only
in one focal node so currently not it
doesn't it's only for a single node okay
because it needs to take control of a
scheduler okay and how to do that sort
of thing with multiple nodes is not so
clear but it's it's really an
engineering issue okay okay thank you
any more questions
yes so there is one more thing that I
have not mentioned in it's crucial I
think so
conquer and stateless model checking in
general works only for programs that
terminate for tests that terminate so if
you have some test that doesn't
terminate in some trace Conqueror we'll
actually explore it until it doesn't
terminate okay so but that's generally
you know it's generally how you test
programs you will typically write tests
that terminate yes it does it work if
you have a tcp/ip connection so if you
have some process test that actually
uses that to test your system so you
need to do some
you know walking or some way of you know
handling the external environment in
general if you are doing if your system
is severely complicated and it's calling
some things that are implementing see
Kankuro doesn't know hire how to take
control of C code and it'll leave it
with the soil you need to have some way
of doing smoking for that but yes it
supports pretty much all of the OTP
libraries the Katyn we specifically
think about is a few testing server by
actually writing a client directly in
your test sorry I cannot hear it alright
sorry is the best if you are testing for
instance a server by writing a simulated
client directly in your test that that
uses the TCP protocol for instance would
put that sort of work if you are just
testing the TCP protocol and you have
model this sort of thing in your line
controller is ideal for that so you will
actually find out any issues that you
have there I'm not sure that this is the
question though but we can take it
offline but you know if you have to if
you want to just test an implementation
of your TCP a the protocol that you have
implemented then it's very good for okay
final question oh we are done thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
