about in this chapter of the the course
is about going
and you know which of course is one of
its major selling points we've got two
parts to the to the chapter what I'm
going to talk about first of all is how
you create processes and then talk about
how those processes communicate by
sending messages so that's the main part
of the of the course so processes in our
langar very lightweight you can run
twenty thirty thousand processes in a
virtual machine quite happily so very
different from running threads in a
traditional language and the other thing
to be aware of is that processes are
don't share memory so each process has
its own memory separately garbage
collected the only way that processes
can interact with each other is by
sending messages so what we need to find
out first of all is how you create a
process and that is done by the spawn
beef and what spawn does is it's passed
an argument which is a module name
function name and list of arguments just
like apply and what happens is that
creates a new process which runs that
function from that module with those
arguments as it's code processes are
identified by process identifier and
these are called P IDs in our line so
you'll see variables called PID one and
so on all the way through this this part
of the course what we'll do in when
talking about concurrency is to identify
processes by their PID so instead of
saying process with PID one will just
say PID one instead of saying process
with PID two will say PID two so we'll
talk about pids sending messages and so
on it's just the simpler way of doing it
so what's the effect of a spawn look in
the diagram before the spawn we have a
single process running in that process
we've called spawn
after that we have a second process
which runs the code that is a module mod
and function func with the arguments
applied in that argument list the other
thing to be aware of is that the return
value of that spawn is the PID for the
new process so the only knowledge about
that process is contained within process
P I with PID one that has the knowledge
of how to get the handle how to interact
with process with PID - one final thing
to note that the the function must be
exported from the module in order for it
to be spawned in that way and as I said
midway through this discussion our
convention all the way through this and
all the way through the rest of the
course is it will identify processes by
their PIDs so we'll talk about process P
with PID run or just PID one okay so
what we have now is we have two
processes running what's running in PID
two is this function func what's running
in PID want is whatever followed that
spawn command okay so now we have two
processes running what happens if the
function if we call spawn where for
whatever reason for example suppose the
function isn't exported from the module
suppose it isn't defined in the module
what happens to that spawn call well in
fact that the beatab if spawn never will
fail the spawn will always succeed but
what happens is that the process
creation may terminate abnormally so if
the process is the function wasn't
exported or didn't exist what will
happen is that they the process is
created and then immediately terminates
abnormally
otherwise when does a process terminate
well we've what we've asked it to do is
execute the function func in the module
mod and what will happen is that that
there's a certain amount of code in that
in that function definition and when we
get to the end of that code that process
will terminate normally this is nothing
else to execute so we get normal
termination when the process runs its
course well we get abnormal termination
immediately when we get a runtime error
and we were getting a runtime error for
instance if the module doesn't exist
it's a function as it doesn't exist in
the module or that function isn't
exported from the module so now we know
how to create a process using spawn and
we found out what happens if if if the
process fails let's see what we can do
about passing a message between one
process and another the construct we use
is a the exclamation mark or pling
operator what you put on the left is the
destination of the message and what you
put on the right is any valid Erlang
value typically these things are tuples
but they don't have to be tuples that
we'll see at an example later on where
you send a function as a message so any
valid Erlang value can be sent as a
message from one process to another
message sending never fails so we know
that in the PID in the process that ends
the sender wants to send a message that
operation always succeeds but if a
process doesn't exist if the PID were
using is not an active process the
message is simply thrown away but if the
PID does exist if the process is running
the message is put into a mailbox for
that process so what we have here is
what's called asynchronous
message parsing we don't have to wait
for the message to be received and
handled by the recipient in order to
continue in the sending process the PID
one sends the message to PID two in this
example and then does whatever is next
in the code in the example you see on
the slide one other thing to be to be
aware of is we've sent here a message
which is a tuple with two items in it
the second is the atom foo but the first
is a call to the BIF self takes no
arguments on what that returns is the
PID of the process in which it's
executed so in this in the example here
what that will evaluate to is two PID
one whatever is the process ID of the
process that's sending the message and
this is a typical Erlang construction is
what we're doing here is we're sending a
message to process two which contains
our PID and what that allows us to do it
allows PID to to get information about
us and so send us a message back and
that's we see that all through line code
which which does message passing we have
explicitly we're using process IDs to
identify processes we have explicitly to
pass those around so that one process
gets knowledge of another's processes
PID okay so just to summarize what I've
been saying here
PID 2 playing sends a message to PID to
the message here is going to be PID 1
paired up with foo and it will get
stored in the process mailbox so PID 2
has a collection of a number of messages
potentially waiting to be processed what
we need to think about after we talked
about how messages are sent is what we
do when messages are received
now we see the message being sent and
here we see what's going to happen at
the other end we've got a receive
construct which looks very like a case
construct it looks very like and if
they're else
it looks very like pattern matching what
do we have we have the keywords receive
an end which delimit the construction we
have a number of clauses and each Clause
has a head and a body the head of the
clause is a pattern the body of the
clause is a sequence of of expressions
clauses are separated by semicolon of
course there's no separator at the end
of the last four spree the separator
rather than a terminator and what each
pattern represents is that the shape of
the message that we're expecting to
receive so in the example here we're
seeing two patterns we are expecting to
receive messages which are pairs and
we're signaling them we're switching on
the value of the first field which is an
atom here again that's a typical we've
seen that with data structures we've
seen that we see that now with messages
so we've got a research message and
we've got a shutdown message and it's
the Atem at the beginning is telling us
which of those is to be dealt with now
you can see here that we're pattern
matching on these messages were using a
an atom in the first field and we have a
variable in the second and as you
remember from pattern matching with case
typically that variable is not bound so
that will match any value but it could
be bound so we'll talk about in a few
slides time
but so typically here what we're doing
is receiving a message about some board
if we get the message reset we match the
variable board on that on that second
field and then what we do in the body is
to send is to to invoke the reset
function on that particular value so
we've got message passing we've got it's
very powerful pattern matching primitive
to allow us to choose which message
which message to process and to choose
it have different processing for
different messages good here's the
general pattern when you execute a
receive Clause I think I talked through
this all all this does is show you the
general pattern that you have a number
of patterns a number of clauses each one
begins with has a pattern as its head
and a sequence of expressions as its
body if when you execute a receive there
are no messages in the mailbox then the
the process will suspend until the
process receives a message and as I said
earlier on message passing is
asynchronous we don't have in the sender
process to have to wait until the
message is processed by the recipient
the sender simply sends the message and
carries on doing what it wants to do so
what we'll talk about next is the detail
of how this receive statement is
executed so let's have a look at this
example we're in PID 2 we have a receive
statement that has three possibilities
we can receive the atoms start we can
receive the atoms stop we can receive a
pair whose first element is a PID match
on the variable PID and whose second at
element is the atom food now what
happens when we execute an expression
like this what we do is go to the
mailbox and look for the first message
that's in
mailbox if there isn't a message there
we will suspend until a message arrives
but assume there are some messages in
there what do we do well what we do is
check for that message whether first it
matches the atom start then we check
whether it matches stop then we check
whether it matches it's a pair whose
second element is a is the atom food so
we check the clauses in sequence for the
first message if none of those holds
none of those works we go on and do the
same for the second message and the
first message will stay in the mailbox
so this is what is meant by the phrase
that they are selectively retrieved so
we can check for those the first message
for those if none of it is if it matches
none of those patterns we move on to the
second do the same thing in sequence
checking for a start or a stop or a pair
whose second element is foo and so on so
we run through the mailbox until we find
a message that succeeds we process that
message by processing the corresponding
body and then the receive statement
terminates the message is that we passed
over remain in the mailbox finally if
none of the messages succeeds none of
the messages successfully pattern
matches with any of the heads in the
receive statement we simply suspend
until more messages come in but this
allows us to choose which messages we
want to process at which time we're not
forced and this is emphatically the case
we're not forced to process the messages
in the order in which we receive them
and that makes for very good modular
practice in programming concurrency so
here we see an example if we send the
message PID 1 foo from PID 1 to PID 2
we look at the reception of that it
won't match a start or a stop but it
will match the third clause and so will
succeed will process that according to
whatever is in the body of that cause
and continue I said I'd come back to
this a bit later on let's look at that
receive statement in PID - it contains
two variables
today is a variable PID and the variable
digit both of those begin with capital
letters remember it's perfectly possible
for PID to be bound already and that
means that the effect of this receive
statement is only to process messages
that come from come from that one
process whose value is in the variable
PID remember you can have bound
variables in pattern matches this is
very unlike traditional pattern matching
in other languages but this is this is
the case in early
so if PID was already bound in praat
stitch it wasn't what this would do is
receive messages of that format with any
value as the is the second argument of
the pair but only with messages from a
particular process ID and if that was
not the same as PID one then however
many messages we sent from PID one to
PID - they would never get processed so
we have to be aware that the pattern
matching statements may not process all
the messages that we receive in a
particular process and so it's possible
for mailboxes to grow arbitrarily large
if we don't process all potential
incoming messages
now let me just remind you about
selective reception suppose we are in
process PID 3 here and we know that
we've got two other processes that are
going to send us messages PID 1 is going
to send us a foo PID 2 is going to send
us a bar but we don't know the order in
which they're going to arrive now if we
had to process messages in the order in
which they had a row had arrived we
would need to have code that would
handle the two cases of fool arriving
before bar and bar arriving before foo
and you can imagine with with the more
possibilities for for non determinism in
the order in which measured messages
arrive the more complicated code has to
become what's nice about the airline
code you see in PID 3 it says we choose
to process these messages in the order
foo first then bar and that happens
irrespective of the order in which they
were sent as I said this gives us a lot
of power a lot of control in the way
that we deal with interaction with
concurrent processes particularly when
we have interaction between more than
two processes we're in PID 3 were
expecting messages from a number of
others we can't predict the order in
which they will come even if and this is
a point I should make now even if in
time we know that the message comes from
PID one before it's it's sent from PID
two we can't guarantee there is no
guarantee in airline that they will be
received in that order
for example PID 1 and PID 2 might be on
different points of a distributed system
there are no guarantees in Erlang that
timing between processes between two
separate processes will be preserved in
the order in which they go into the
mailbox however
if we send two messages from the same
process we can guarantee that those will
arrive in the mailbox in the same order
in which they were sent so timing
between messages from the same processes
is preserved order a title order in time
whereas between messages from different
processes there is no guarantee just
contrasting the situation we were in
on the previous slide if we want to
process the messages in the order in
which they arrive we don't know whether
the first message is the one from PID
one which is a foo or the one from PID
two which is a bar so what we have to do
is have a receive statement that much is
on an arbitrary message and then
processes it in an appropriate way so
the variable MSG in the receive
statement will be bound to foo or bar
depending on which one has arrived
first so that gives us non selective
reception so we can choose we want to do
if we want to choose to process the
messages in in the order in which we've
they've been received we do a pattern
match on the variable msg and then
secondly what we might do is just show
it here we can say receive MSG once a
and what we do in there is receive much
on MSG - and we can be sure that MSG one
will be the first message to be received
an MSG two will be the second and then
in there we will have to process those
two messages okay let's move on
I mentioned earlier on that the way that
data gets sent the way that's processed
data and process IDs gets sent is as
part of messages we've got an example
here of some of how process IDs can
spread through a system of communicating
processes what we do you can see here we
have a ascending PID a a corresponding
receive in PID B and one int also in PID
C so let's see what happens here
first of all PID a sends a message to
PID B and that is a pair which is a
message transfer and its own PID its
self if it's called
has arisen the value let's call it
capital a so in PID B we have a receive
statement which expecting a pair whose
first element is a transfer Adam whose
second element is some variable and what
we do on receiving that is pass it on to
PID C just pass the same message on and
when we're in PID C we're going to
receive that in fact this time we're
matching on the variable PID a what we
do then is send now we're able from PID
C to send a message to PID a because
we've received its PID indirectly from B
and now we can send a message right the
way across the back to PID a so that's
how that so now each of the processes
has the PID for process a a had it
through calling self it sent that on to
B be sent it on to C and so C could use
it to send a message back to a so that's
how the information about processes
travels through a network and here's an
example of some code now let's have a
look at this got a module called echo
and it exports two functions both of
them with no arguments the go function
and the loop
the go function is the function that
does the does the work it the first call
is to spawn it spawns the the process
loop in the module echo which is a
process in the loop function in this
module with no arguments and the PID
gets stored in the variable PID so now
we have this another process running the
loop code and you can see the loop code
is on the on the right hand side of a
slide what the loop code is going to do
is it's going to in a receive loop
expect a message from somewhere it's
going to get a pair and we're going to
interpret the first element of the pair
as a PID and what we do is in processing
that pair we send a message to the PID
which is in a variable from the message
we send is whatever from sent to us
paired up with our PID and then we
recursively call loop otherwise if we
receive a stop we simply terminate and
remember the loop will terminate at that
point because we've run out of code
let's look now at what happens in the go
process what we've got there is we've
sent the message to PID and now we're
going to receive a message and what are
we going to receive well it's going to
be a message that says um it contains a
PID and a message and what we're getting
back from that is the message that we
sent and what we do is simply print it
out after that receive we send a final
message to to the loop and what we do is
say stop so that's tidied everything up
that will stop the loop process and it
will stop don't mean that go will
terminate as well so that gives us an
example which pulls together a spawn
which created the new process the
message passing through PID excellent
case exclamation mark message and the
receive statement where you have a
number of clauses you
which has a pattern which gets matched
with the incoming messages and a
corresponding body saying how to process
them so that covers what I wanted to
talk about here creating processes
sending messages receiving messages and
the sort of data that gets sent
typically the message but also
information about PIDs so in a few in in
a few seconds I'll move on to encounter
line two but for the moment what I'd
like to do is show you a demonstration
what we're going to do now is take a
look at a number of examples of small
programs that use concurrent processes
message passing between them so to get a
feel for what for how it works in
practice our our first program is here
on the Left we have a module is called
Kong zero and it exports two functions a
start function there's no arguments in a
main function with one argument let's
take a look at first of all what the
start function does what start does is
simply call spawn and remember the
purpose of spawn is to create a new
process and what the process does is run
the function main from whatever module
is here now what we've used here is a
macro that expands to the name of the
current module so it will run the main
function from this module with initial
argument 0 and remember what it does is
it will run that until that function
terminates now let's have a look at what
the main function does it's got an
argument T and its body is a receive
statement that with two clauses first of
all it can map on a match on a PID
paired with the atom's stop and remember
that we process these things
sequentially so only if that doesn't
match do we match on a variable there
and what we're assuming here is that
what is passed in is an integer we could
of course use a guard
is integer to check explicitly it is an
integer but we're just assuming it is
for the purposes of this example if you
receive a message from call the variable
their PID we're assuming it's going to
be a PID we could also check that as
well in fact but assuming it's a PID and
it's a stop how do we process that what
we do is send a message back to that PID
saying we've stopped and then we
terminate so indeed we do stop
however if what we have is a PID paired
with a number what we do is add that
number to the running total T the thing
we passed in and assign that to next so
the next running total next value of
that is next we output that value send
that message value as a message to PID
and then we go into the loop again but
with a different value so our running
total has changed and we passed that new
value in as the value for the next
recursive call so as this loop gets
repeated many times the value in that
variable will change will increase and
it will contain the running total and it
will carry on until the loop receives a
stop message at which point it will
terminate okay let's have a look at this
in practice now so let's fire up the
shell let's compile the program and then
what we're going to do is call the start
function now what we can do is to say
conch 0 colon start and we could call
that now what that's going to do is
return the PID of the process that we're
launching and we need that PID in order
to send a message to it so what we will
do is make sure that we can
that return value that value and keep it
in the variable PID so now that variable
will have the PID of that new process so
now we've got another process running
and we can send messages to it
so um and what we want to do when we're
sending those messages is we're going to
need to send our own PID because the
shell is itself just another Erlang
process let's catch capture that and
stick it in the variable self and we do
remember we get that value by calling
there's the bit itself and you can see
you can see the return value of that
it's a process
PID contains the number 32 whereas the
earlier one contained 39 so now we have
we've got our own PID and we've got the
PID of the process we spawned so let's
send a message to that PID and the
message we're going to send it is self
paired with the number 5 and but what we
get as a result of that is the message
that we have sent and you can see that's
that's a pair so what we should do now
is um because what they the main program
is going to do on receiving that message
is it's going to send a message back to
us so what we need to do is is to
receive that message and let's just
stick it in a variable at R as one and
you can see that the message we've
received was indeed 5 now let's let's go
back up here and put in I don't know 17
send a message 17 and what we want to do
is again we want to receive we receive
the message should be getting a message
back from the other process so we could
use this now we've already put the first
message in the variable R as one so what
we're going to do
is put the next message the message we
get into the variable res - and you'll
see now that what we've got back is the
running total which is 22 so let's
finally send a message to stop we do
that we're sending the message again our
own PID to get paired with the atom stop
let's send that that's gone and then
finally let's see what we get back as a
result we're going to stick the result
in variable rs3 and what we get now is
that atom stopped and that has happened
because we processed the message using
that clause and that has given us the
result and now the other process will
have terminated because the code ends
there so what you can see is that
running within the shell we can use
receive to receive to treat our messages
as they come in we can send messages
using the primitive message send
construct but it's a bit of a mess
because we're having to use new
variables for each receive clause and so
on so what I want to show you next is a
way wrapping these things up in
functions to make it much easier to deal
with message receive and send let's take
a look at what we can do instead of
writing receive and send statements
within the shell let's see what we could
do as an alternative and what I've got
here is is the alternative we've taken
the program we had before and we've
added two new functions and what these
functions do is that they deal with the
two cases where we want to send a
message to of the form of a number to
the other process or a stop message
let's look at the stop case first so
we're passing in as an argument the
process to which we want to send this
message and what we do in the body of
that function is we send the message
which is a stop and then we receive
whatever message comes back and return
it as an okay so what we're doing there
is we're doing that pair of things send
a message receive the result as we were
doing here
if you look here on line 8 we sent the
message on line 9 we received the result
and if you look at the general case on
line 4 we sent the message received a
result on line 6 we sent the message and
receive the result when you see that
pattern encapsulated in the add function
so add takes two arguments PID and a
number assigning in this case we're
assigning the value of self to the
variable self you don't have to do that
and then we send a message to that PID
with our PID and the number and then we
receive whatever result is sent back so
this encapsulate precisely what we were
doing on lines four and five on line six
and seven in that example so let's take
a look at this in action
we'll start the Erlang shell will
compile konkwon and what we'll do here
is first of all we launch that new
processes at PID because conk one
current start we get that PID back and
now instead of what we did on lines four
and five here sending a message
receiving the result will call the
function add with the PID and the value
five and you see what we get back is the
value five now because this is enough
this receivers in a inside a function
this will get each time we call the
function we get a new variable read so
we're not in this situation of having to
have a different variable for it to
handle each message so that did that
covers what we did on lines four and
five if we replace that five by ops by
817 we should do get the effect of what
we did on line six and seven and indeed
we're getting back the result there
twenty two and then finally we can call
konkwon stop the PID and what we should
get is the effect of lines eight and
nine and indeed what we're getting is a
result okay because what we're doing
inside the stop function is saying
whatever message we receive
we're going to return the result okay
but of course that is going to have
stopped the other process because it's
run out of code so there we're seeing
precisely how these functional writing
these functions on top of the sender
receive pattern allow us to to interact
with our other with this other process
in a much cleaner way than than doing it
using Bare receive and send
okay so I think at that point arm I'm
going to stop the demonstrations we've
had we've seen how to launch a new
function and new process that's using
spawn message passing to the product or
process using exclamation mark message
received using a receive statement
potentially with multiple clauses do
pattern matching and we've seen how in
order to facilitate communication we
send pids as parts of messages so in
this add function we send our own PID as
the first half of the message so that
inside the other process we can use that
