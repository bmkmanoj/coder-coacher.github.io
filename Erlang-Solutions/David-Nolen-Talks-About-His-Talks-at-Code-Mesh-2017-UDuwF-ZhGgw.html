the tar pit which was you're looking at
what what is the biggest contributor to
complexity and software and this paper
out of the tarp it talks about state has
been one of the biggest contributors I
think if you're into programming
languages functional programming is one
way to address that issue having a lot
of state stay fill up things in your app
but my talk was that you could take that
philosophy and apply it to something
that you might not have thought before
which is your database so we build
systems using functional party millings
on the client and on the server so we
also use a database called atomic which
can basically treat us like an immutable
value in the cloud basically
I think the hardest thing is to to paint
a narrative that get the people curious
enough to try a different approach I
mean that's a lot of a lot of my public
speaking is simply that there's a
different methodology one can use once
once it's about to do software and
having tried that at least the
mainstream way for quite some time and
then a more functional approach I'm more
convinced the functional approach but my
assumption is that people don't know
that much about it
so the challenge for me is often just
putting into the right words and the
right narrative so that it seems
compelling to people who aren't
necessarily familiar
I think that part of the reason why I
enjoy coming to places like Co - is that
there are so many unsolved problems and
you know you want to get a sort of a
sense of what that is I definitely think
that there is a theme and the theme is
that you know a lot of these talks are
about ways to build simpler systems I
mean I would say that a practical level
that's I think when everybody is really
trying to say when they talk about
whatever topic in chosen so I think
that's that's important I also think
that another one it's like it's also
hard for me to say because also there's
for me there's always a sense that we
don't know that much you know
so I also really think that we're still
freaking out both how to do how to be
better what we're doing now what we're
still you know discovering how far we
can go I don't you know I think they're
- they're really two very different
things how can we improve what we're
doing today and then what does the
future look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
