spent two days poking at alternative and
non mainstream disruptive technologies
and what better way to wrap it up then
to get a few representatives from the
industry he had a few language event to
sit front row and have them real each
other you know if we look at history
well the lesson that we learned nothing
from history increase max CPC to step
forward one step back and step back is
usually going in and reinventing the
wheel trying to solve problems which are
rarely addressed and sold and doing
surgery so badly and they will be
perspective of actual programming
languages that the ACM to have a
discussion over 18 or making these
mistakes and have glue alderman what
does the future entail we've got no a
panel right here we introduce each other
great yourselves now introduce yeah I'm
Chad you order this target languages we
get ourselves everything isn't meant for
languages you use
I use Chad and plunder list and i used
the Ruby guy so that's what people think
of me actually mean any other names and
I've heard you're really a ruby and not
really actually I usually use in a given
week Ruby a school closures no early a
check this yet cetera and it really is
like that fella and now closure and I
play with
hello yeah it's epic I'm a professor at
University of Nevada Las Vegas I do a
lot of work on how ferghal images impact
human beings or communities or people
very strikes I guess in certain
languages i use like mostly right now
waiting for nowadays I mostly work on
the outer corner which is written for
which reason that surprising but it's
not a program in any language for
decades pick your poison I'm Victor I
were protecting peg tenses do the
majority of my work in Scala today's but
it is be one of these things were one
days of Java one days in a basher Apple
script or something like that for for
some weird reason but yeah it's tends to
be a lot of different things but the
dirty cell
I'm Steve mouse keyboard professional
technologies like the apartment in C
working on the airline virtual machine
so with airline see long time sequence
programmer started in 1988 with that but
just a whole bunch of languages like
everybody else okay so let's start with
the first one we're still having the
debate between your static typing versus
dynamic typing vessels the neverending
story I think just thought of me to know
but there's a lot more evidence today
than it was five years ago when it was
effectively done so well I think I
macular is that one day for 19 77 which
also should say thing that's the other
 everyone agreed attention to be
clear static taking my virginity at
least after the first three years
between half a year and three years so
my gosh so technically we don't have a
set of examples between that half year
and third so it could be that there's
like that it goes up or down or
something like that but no depth
estimates
stop typing can mean like you know we
interesting Haskell syntax or something
like that and it could also mean like
you know generics with really crazy wild
cards and all sorts of stuff so but most
developers think about it like i have
types on my method declarations and
stuff like that right that helps right
so having types on your method
declarations is a very strong predictor
specifically predicts between thirty to
fifty percent of variance in samples on
privilege but for generics the issues
quite different you know if you're
writing a generic I'm sorry if you're
changing a class which you know accident
there's a tenfold decrease in
productivity that's right tenfold and in
fact it's only ten fold because the
study kept a time time when they cut
people off true story it's in himself
and then but if you're using a generic
it gives you a slight bump so okay so
come by like to comment and I think you
go I'm currently working on a project
that has a lot of C and a lot of airline
in and the number of what we're working
against a common interface and when
there's a fault about 50 times more
errors are in the city than the airline
see is typed learning is dynamically
typed this doesn't I know I can't
generalize my personal experience to to
the heights of research I think if
you're if you're looking at type
language you can't make these general
sweeping statements about all typed
language I'd like to see the division
between type languages that are garbage
collected like Java and type languages
that are not garbage collected like see
and I think
once you start partitioning it up you
you won't see a clear difference also
kind of wondering about the thing you
wish to optimize I mean Microsoft became
the richest company in the world by
producing buggy software early so so
actually the desire of producing correct
software late would not film the big
company like mike says they're hardly
likely to be interested in technologies
that stop them from producing buggy
software early I wanted to do more of
that so I'd like to keep can make
sweeping statements about types because
there are so many languages indeed
though you know the word type in you
know polymorphic strong typing in high
school doesn't mean the same as word
typing in front all those I think that
you need to be a little careful because
I didn't make a sweeping statement when
I said was that we ran formal
peer-reviewed randomized controlled
trials right so these are scientific
experiments these are not like me saying
static typing is always better in fact
any time someone did say that I said
wait wait wait wait there's a caveat
there's this thing under this
conditioner does that under that
condition it does that so I need to be
careful there's a giant difference
between I like static typing it's better
or I like dynamic typing it's better it
reduces bugs it's faster it's wonderful
i love it and hi We're am a randomized
controlled trial with human users we put
them in a room we measure their
performance we had a peer reviewed by
scholars and experts in earlier and we
publish the data on the methodology
there's a huge difference between that
so could you tell me what languages what
programming languages are being used in
that study there's about eight studies
so you have to go read them well the one
you're referring to we did you did which
with yeah there's about eight that's why
so I see it always the same languages no
those are already so which languages
were used I don't remember about to top
my head so I said she's going here in
Turkey and if you if you if you will not
result from one language can you infer
results in another language from that I
did it show that across this set of
studies there's like eight or nine or
something like that and we get
effectively the same answer every time
well there's a lot more
just between C and our line besides
typing and see didn't score very well in
the syntax studies no that's absolutely
true no actually we test see the syntax
studies we tested many see variants
right but um yeah obviously like you
know that the reason why you might have
bugs in a language may have any number
of causes right you can have a memory
can you see I mean I'm sure that's never
happened to anybody here it may be just
me but yet so of course if that's what
you're saying that you know there's many
things besides type systems that can
impact your productivity and absolutely
that's true but under scientific
conditions with reasonable tests that
get looked by scholars it does impact
your productivity under the conditions
of the tests that we've done which is
true it's factually correct there's also
a strong versus weak typing right that's
the big difference with C and Erlang I
don't know if you studied that but
probably be worth doing as well isn't
the real thing though like I can I can't
think of how many times I've had
problems had nothing to do with typing
they have to do with distribution types
don't save me across the network they
usually cause me problems across the
network you know problems I'm dealing
with an earring my virtual machine a C
code but it's locked in concurrency
types don't save me there that's why I
think the whole argument sort of misses
the point you know there's other things
that affect productivity and correctness
and quality than static versus dynamic
typing yeah that's true of course I mean
the plate goes that we don't know much
about what they are but the example you
mentioned about concurrency is good
because tomorrow's there's only one or a
small handful of studies on concurrency
initial exactly what you just said that
if you
dreadlocks it's effectively a disaster
the specific result is by chris ross
back out of UT Austin I wasn't involved
in that study but I'm very sure and this
was what I think this was students over
a cohort of three years ago about the
top my head I think I found on Eightfold
increase in valves or threads and locks
versus software transaction limit not
compared to like the total whore models
I've CSP type stuff or anything like
that but nonetheless I mean it's not
surprising to probably anyone that
that's true but nonetheless obviously
that's a huge productivity impact but
unless we've also shown that static and
versus dynamic typing is also going to
be impact is not mean one thing it's
going to be a whole hell of a lot of
things but we should document that so we
all know right it helps us open is this
one a comment on this that Alan strongly
typed and sees weakly typed without a
dynamically type to see statically typed
so you getting here you got this
moisture a mixture of these things so
trying to work out what what actually is
not just thinking calm intervention for
that they have to actually document or
type their methods how much you notice
the actual typing of the methyl just
affected that they've they're forced to
write down the type of the method in
that sense it may just may be just a
form of documentation so they can see
what type is supposed to have rather
than what type the system will then
checked it has strengths but already I
understand the question is the question
whether that if you have documentation
of the tab if that just a comment in the
faculty soon they are forced to write
down the time of the method how much
know is the actual is the typing itself
that does not just afford the fact that
it was documented loads of the type
itself
the method its own physical
manifestation as in the fact that it's
in the file does actually matter yeah I
don't know physically moving your
fingers I wouldn't think we're better
but yeah in the file it makes a bit
we've actually tested that it does
matter if it's not in fact let me be
specific it needs to be in the method
declaration that's the key but it's not
universal across developers specifically
if you have a novice there's a 90 well
let me says carefully ninety-two percent
of novices actually screw up types in
method declarations but the thing is if
you leave them out for people with more
experience they get this negative impact
of opportunity so it's one of these
trade-offs where we have documented
evidence that it has a negative impact
on novices but we don't really care
because once they learn it they get a
productivity bump so you can sort of
look at it as a trade off across the
spectrum yeah there's a nut moment with
just two how much it's actually typing
itself compared to the fact that you're
actually writing down the time the
documentation for it's just a quick
question no no that you can actually say
it sit there in the file you can see
that this method has this pipe was the
fact that that matters that matters I
have a puzzle and that is the least you
can hire level for a moment cuz we were
talking about this whole two steps
forward one step back is it I remember
like maybe a little over 10 years ago
there was this big movement and people
like this conference probably within the
people really pushing for dynamic typing
and typing
miss Ruby a playful and small talk and
we're laying all this stuff and was
arguing about how that was the way you
don't need it was strong versus weak was
the big thing it's strong dynamic typing
person saying so now we're all sort of
pushing force typing category theory all
this fun stuff but it's the same people
which is funny and so far it looks like
the project's still suck just as bad and
the software still sucks just as bad so
maybe it's like two steps forward two
steps back in general for the things
that going on oh 1.9 I eight steps
forward and back right what would we do
that we're planning to think positive
here sorry be bussin I guess to time
what Steve said I think there's an
interesting difference between
structural static type systems and
nominal static type systems especially
when it comes to concurrency stuff
because if you need to ship around the
definition of the type with the data
that you send around then it becomes
trickier so step is structural type
system sorry i don't know of any tests
on that that actually tried to
investigate that scientifically but
maybe we should talk to swing end up
dynamic static there's a million other
move back
we learn something yeah I mean at the
end of the day when I hope happens and I
won't get my wish but I hope it happens
anyway is that people start collecting
evidence on this stuff or and more and
more because this pendulum swings are
good to a certain extent in the context
of because we can explore various areas
but if we start pulling down and be
really specific about how we're testing
this stuff for the methodologies and
we're thinking a lot more carefully if
we do that then when we're developing
with murio change in oven which but when
you're developing new one when you say
ok there's a hundred papers on the
impact of productivity I've chosen that
I care about that and as such I plan to
follow the evidence that we can
explicitly decide not to but then you
have the choice that one hundred papers
part I think that applies to the point
of the panel of for justice complaining
that we reimplement the same things
badly and but you know what I think it's
a problem really to do the same work
again because we might learn something
new and everybody can't be every paper
um steer so here from fasho did you see
on Turner the other day um a for a path
keansburg was ripping on reacts are not
having read some papers not real
there was a particular person that said
who needs to read all these papers I
built a day of days on my own I didn't
read any papers that wasn't a bachelor's
but then you know the whole debate
started but that was an interesting to
date and I think generally people said
well you really do need to read the
papers because these protocols are so
hard and Victor noses that you just
don't want to reinvent the wheel but how
do you find that previous work ask ask
some people that work there still like
Leslie Lamport still around you can ask
but I think there's there were talks
here like read Draper gave a talk on
kind of building distributed database
and included a piece about our pc versus
messaging had some some good mentions of
old are our seats from the seventies
that talk about these problems in
distribution and i have a big slide deck
with like seven pages of references to
old papers and distributed systems I
mean we are Google we have search
engines no it's not like you used to
have to sit in the library actually find
this
for that respect to the naming earlier
wasn't the whole thing to keep in mind
tunes that when I mentioning papers in
this context is I'm talking about
somebody that wants to have a language
that is in production that is used by
other people which I don't think is all
the developers but I agreed you
completely that it's pretty much
impossible read out the academic papers
I mean even as an academic I mean Dean
over of papers per year does published
is far beyond how the number of papers
that is published in a month is probably
far beyond what any human can read in a
lifetime so I it's impossible so so
someone thought there is that I find
personally that not only reading papers
but by eternal icing and so getting up
to the speed to where the researcher was
when you wrote the paper that's a big
investment and then asked you eat
multiple papers you need to sort of you
need to internalize them all and to find
like how they fit together are they sort
of contradictory in any way there's
there's a lot of mental models and
understanding that need to be recreated
and each person that reads these things
but I think perhaps it's the medium that
could improve to facilitate that better
I have an answer for this problem all we
do is you take all the big papers and
put them on Stack Overflow because
everyone goes there and look for how do
i write this thing and you know if we
put it up there problem solved actually
you know I really love it if that
happened but unfortunately that they
there be lawsuits because those don't
tell whoever's rapid
this is how this works if it's it's
horribly stupid but it's not my fault so
don't you know what they might even yell
at me I don't care services or
governments around the world they'll pay
scholars and academics to write epidemic
papers academic institutions they're
usually judged on not the quality of the
papers but the number of them that they
produce which is idiotic beyond words
but it is what it is and then when those
papers are published they go to a
publishing company and that publishing
company gets paid for the research so
think about it like this you as a
taxpayer payable to the fence so that
scholars get nothing to produce work and
then publishing company literally takes
every single dollar of revenue informant
but they contribute absolute zero to any
part of the process I smell bad this is
true they provided an upload button and
you click Submit taxpayer dollars at
work so there's a lot of those lots of
 academic papers to you so yeah
we've discovered this cool system that
helps with that it's called open source
yeah thank goodness we have the
opportunity to contribute to work this
out there I've got a question for Victor
you're currently working on a
distributed framework for acha and
follow your tweets hey I'm getting on a
plane about six academic papers to read
through and that makes flight to the
states variable over guess how do you
approach the work you're doing and how
do you combine new ideas with all the
ideas so this is a really good question
it's super hard it's or off to
give an answer to but I think what was
helped me the most is to start from
scratch like really don't even think
about computers especially for
distributed systems don't even think
about computers like how would you even
solve this problem with people or like
any other thing I mean there's a lot of
moving parts that if we can remove them
out of the equation it's easier to gain
an understanding before we sort of apply
it to that more complicated domain I
think I think that goes with a lot of
research I mean computing is just a
thing I mean there's an observation that
I've made is that the more I learn about
fundamental problems I just start to see
them everywhere and it's a lot of things
are not even sort of I sort of had
pigeonhole them into computing until I
realized that this is like a fundamental
problem and once you understand and see
this really what the possible solutions
are or what you can't do once you have
this problem it also sort of limits or
pushes your solution in a different
direction so it's can see your log work
in learning sort of fundamental issues
like queueing theory for instance
there's a lot of things that you can you
just see okay this is a human problem
and what once you learn about potential
solutions are different solutions to
this problem space now you're equipped
to solve this problem no matter what the
domain where it manifests itself so so
do you think it would be better for the
industry of more people spend time
learning
versus learning new programming language
languages and stuff I think that's a
good question i think it needs to be
like the fundamentals I think they need
to get more fundamental I think we might
start the entry point into C's education
at a to specific or too narrow level
perhaps there is more to computer
science than we that we we sort of teach
people at the beginning because it tends
to limit people once you set the base
level I think there's a lot of people
that never sort of peer through that
base level they just built on top of it
do you think anyone even knows what the
list of fundamentals to learn is best
probably I don't know that anybody has a
full list so that's why I asked so I
don't do that let me clarify that first
but um there's a group there's two
groups of scholars and are trying to
adjust computer science education in the
United States I can't speak for burton i
know that's a different different system
but in the u.s. there's two things
called I'm ecs and Explorer which is
about exploring computer science there's
no one called computer science
principles in the you know so basically
what's happening is that in the u.s.
there was no standardized way of doing
CS education right there is it like a
standardized high school classes there
is it AP class it's in Java and a lot of
people are kicked a lot of people hate
it and you know as you would normally
expect on a discipline right but
interesting they have tried to come up
with this list and you can imagine the
infighting about it right like the
number of possible topics some people
think that you shouldn't even touch
computers where we start is that CSM 12
and that's good and whatever be notified
and then other other groups would say we
should talk about
at first or the group so that we should
build robots at first and effectively
there's no movement across the board so
it's a question for the audience so see
someone was going to do a talk on cue in
fundamentals they read a couple of
papers and wanted to share with their
friends this insight that they learned
that apply to everyone else how many of
you have a user group in your city or a
meet-up that such a presentation would
be accepted at maybe a third that's
pretty good so that's one way we can
share this information it gives a lot
yeah papers who love that's true that's
totally one of those in those are
spreading yeah and if you don't have one
you can start your own with very
question here from the audience so
following up from from Andy's point
about the academic publishing business
and and Jessica on open source there's a
there is a big argument going on about
open access in publishing so I've got a
question for the for the for the panel
and the audience here the audience here
a lot members of academic institutions
when so can you get hold of ACN papers
does the fact that they are generally
behind a paywall although sometimes
still freely accessible on all those web
pages and so on does that put you off
does that stop you access in the paper
or does do find ways around it you just
google the title and you find the copy
on the author's web page anyway and so
the the Faculty's behind a paywall
doesn't cause you any problems so can I
ask for whom that would sort of block
block the paper for you you would never
find that you never be able to
caliper and we would find the paper
anyway you get through google okay so
there's no less of a problem on the
phone it's not so much finding one
particular paper that you'll always find
but it's the ability to go in and search
an academic database based on keywords
and that's really I think what they see
em you know library duck does that's
real power instinct well it's better
than your google because at least the
material is really focused I just want
to mention that sounds you can find
really good Katie dissertations or and
such that like aggregate together
everything under a certain domain often
better than hunting through papers and
piles of references another one person
reads dissertations
so I just want to say one of the big
barriers from me is PDF as a format for
papers is awful and needs to die and
it's our practical level I want to read
a lot of papers on my way to work on my
phone and web technologies work on
phones they automatically resize to work
with the device width with reading pdfs
on my phone I've got a sort of scroll
left and right all the time to get to
the end of the column and back again and
I think that's a bigger barrier for me
than the pay walls though I don't like
to pay walls either but but this is a
PDF problem where see the layout problem
like i don't personally don't like the
two column layout thing did he make
sense but that's an issue for me plus
side when when you give academics the
opportunity to write single space with
two columns on each page you can imagine
the kind of crap that gets in there
right I mean really you know there's
just like so many references and some of
this stuff because it's all like site
this person's like that person when
sometimes it's not even necessary I
anyway this is all whole other
conversation in the papers are just one
source of this information that we need
to somehow spread around the industry so
that we can all benefit from it when we
can't possibly take it all in there's
also open source projects for instance
how do you find when you find yourself
solving a problem how do you go out and
find how other people did
capital if you know the name to search
bar well i think that the argument about
having a name for something that you
search for i think this isn't this is
not really an issue like most papers i
have seen have something called keywords
and they usually get indexed so you just
you know if you I don't know if there is
a some aspect of Q theory or whatever
that you want to research then you just
try to like describe the problem just
just an observation yeah you might as
well try so a long time ago I was
writing tests and I I figured out that I
could create programs that would create
input for my tests and then I wouldn't
have to like hard code a bunch of stuff
and I had no idea that what I was doing
had a name and that if I had known what
property based testing is what
generative testing is or the name of
quick check which is what everybody
calls it now I are going to learn a lot
from from that and well one thing I
should have done back then is go to more
conferences but other than that how can
we educate or do and also more
experience reports or even research on
why things doesn't work right so we
don't repeat the same mistakes over and
over because there is a fundamental
reason why it can never work that I I
would find that extremely interesting
yeah actually that's a that's a very
point because oftentimes in academic
publishing posting negative results is
actually much harder right so there's
the old if you hear and the problem to
use the stage
so if you run an empirical study and you
find nothing then by definition you
found nothing but doesn't necessarily
mean it doesn't work but it might so he
could it be record that stuff but
oftentimes accurate publishing is a big
mess as what it is I just kind of I
think your chance slide he showed we're
mostly sixty percent of all software
projects failed to a certain extent and
there's I mean I it's very yeah I mean
it's about sixty percent and the problem
is there in D&amp;amp;D you know that the big
projects that felt really nastily I've
been involved Robin chose quarters of
some of those and might certainly my
employer at the time guess but would
have never actually said that the
project failed in any way it was a great
success but due to mark changes in the
market had been down prioritized and
wouldn't admit to any failures in this
project i'm not going to be exactly open
with about you know because i don't the
shareholders to know about me losses
that have been good in projected a fail
test it's not in their interest to
participate in this and they were
actively and those are my mind when
we're talking about sharing failures is
that most of the interesting ones
probably aren't even technical we all
know
when it comes to doing projects you know
that's not the same it's like
researching languages and so we're kind
of act two conversations here he's kind
of everyone maybe everyone else is
having another way but I think people do
share things that fail a lot do you
write it like certainly you don't like
to share your failures you don't like to
call what you're done bad but we do it
so much it should be pretty easy to
collect them that's basically all we're
doing what the time is failing and then
sometimes we get lucky Francesco can you
make this conference next year call it
fail mesh all talks have to be about
failure we just remind me puke on London
had once one year track over you know
majestic failures and software and I
think one of the keys one of the
speakers was Sir Anthony whore who
talked about the null pointer and he
called the talk two billion dollar
mistake because anybody yet that's
probably what ended up costing companies
if you think about your own experiences
you guys or people in the audience your
major failures or the projects to fail
or whatever or the technical things like
can you think of a technical things
people were immediately shaking their
heads they probably are some people who
would say yes but like the big failure
is usually not a technical thing do you
have a technical thing but I agree with
you that most problems of
problems because we can sit here all day
talk about the languages and how they
interact with the computer but in the
end the underlying theory about how we
get work done has nothing to do with the
computer software is built by people and
it's the people we have to study if we
want to learn how to get more work done
if I was google plus i would say plus
one but what was interesting is that the
present world to which thing you want to
after you the cost right because i think
it's so easy to take a technical problem
attributed to the person who wrote the
code she's using with that geez we might
blame the person of the people working
together yeah it smell like what is the
definition of a technical costs like a
technical problem or is a human error
but I think it's too easy to blame
humans as well for things that should be
better in terms of technology like if we
take example of the splendor thing where
it was feet and should have been meters
or something like that I would see that
as a technical problem or the type
system didn't check whether it was
looking four meters or adding feet to
meters or something like that which
would have been caught right but it's
you could point and say that okay it was
the programmers fault it's a human error
that makes sense although like to plug
that hole it reminds me of the way the
US government plug security holes in the
airport like one person puts stuff in
their shoe so now that all it takes off
their shoes and one person have liquids
and I can't water you know there be so
many of them it ends up
by the way they did it it ends up just
not working so that Terrace will just
obviously go around you know okay open
their shoe anymore in the problem that's
a really good point because it's that
the boundary the people interacting with
the technical solution a better a type
system like f sharps with unit would
have prevented a person from making that
mistake and so it goes both ways I mean
I was nodding my head about the
technical problem but what was their
technical problem well really we were
using big couch and it didn't work as
specified but the people problem behind
that was we centered our entire project
and every piece of functionality inside
around this database what were we
thinking and we didn't properly test it
so I remember taser figures nothing line
takes on the failure rate of large
projects and it's something like sixty
percent failed I also saw that about
successful projects I think less than
half on average of the requirements ever
gotten plundered wonder are we doing
better nowadays or is it still just as
bad I can imagine that if you use an
agile approach and you never write down
all your requirements in advance well
then you know coulda find that we felt
implement more than hospital so make
that up do you think we're doing better
than others I'm glad you said that
actually just because when you look at
some of these ways that they try to
measure a failure they're actually the
methodologies not as I actually looked
at this recently just because I i teach
software engineering and I was really I
using a new text books this year by this
fella named cool this probably fired
textbook that he was mentioned some of
these failure rates and he was solving
some paper from 90 94 which is called i
think was 94 it called the chaos report
right and they have very similar
learners and so i had to finally turn
it was a 4 i've heard decided a million
times turns out it was like a for profit
group they had a vested interest because
they were selling consulting fees there
are surveys to managers but not the
technical workers so so I'm just
imagining company X sub Marseilles yeah
he's very requirements or the developers
are like yeah you're an idiot you know
so it's funny that evening measuring
Ferrars is pretty hard I think and
really do that very well it's a tough
thing so yeah everyone sort of knows the
Standish thing is II it's been
known for years that like the one that I
showed was from 2013 what makes it seem
like it's worth showing to me is it's a
validation of what I already know and
what you already know you know when
you're in the industry you see that we
suck and we have continued to suck in
almost exactly the same way for many
many years that's what I showed it to my
class too but you know I just I was
reminding everybody that it is
II can just a quick question how much of
these pages actually caused by the fact
that the original project itself was
completely stupid something else
guaranteed to fail from the very
beginning
I email the colleague of mine in area as
a friend and I asked almost an identical
question those projects estado de
potenza because their depravity projects
I mean that would be fired alright so
good pressure washed over quick question
on fellas due to technical problems
versus people problems in teeth other
until obvious had a major fail where
they implemented an update and it broke
down at natwest and rbs and people
weren't able to withdraw cash for like I
think it was a weekend and that was a
big fail so would you described as a
technical failure or people versus
failure and yeah that local into that
well I was going to say this when when
Victor is talking about the Mars Lander
as well because I think you can look at
that as a people failure as well they
didn't have a process in place to verify
cold like I'm sure many of you have code
review processes in place jealous mess I
think that you see mmm so they have a
it's pretty careful no but I'm you know
Mars thing is the world I mean my
argument there was you could call it a
people failure I really did about the
head sir but uh I think in that case
it's similar right it's like who put
these processes together did they
practice them was their trial run was
was you know you're supposed to practice
if you read like John all spa DevOps
type stuff you're supposed to practice
this stuff you know practice having an
outage practice doing an upgrade and if
you're not doing that then how do you
really think you're going to pull it off
live like what you're talking about to
me that's a process failure people
failure
the coffin Cisco CEO glucose go to my
sternum both FC and Netflix
representatives talked about the way
they deal with failure is one don't
blame anybody to everybody comes up with
ways that they or their work could make
that failure either less likely to
happen faster to diagnose when it does
happen less impactful when it does
happen you can fix a failure at about 18
different levels including at the
technical level the testing level the
people level the system level the
process level all of them and if you
have pulled that kind of retrospective
and really fix it at all levels you're
not just fixing that one problem fixing
a lot of things but one last question
here one of the things that's occurred
to me is that we tend to often have poor
role models for people who are getting
into the industry so we might fetishize
the 25 year old Silicon Valley you know
male programmer who writes an iphone app
and people look up to that and they
don't look at someone who's been in the
industry for 40 years and reads papers
and sort of learned slowly so what can
we do to advertise and press for better
role models for people getting into the
industry Joe in a purple velvet jacket I
brought the pictures
citroen fine I've seen my wife I'm just
good that's a hard position pictures of
you in a purple velvet jacket think
we'll leave it at that okay a big thank
you
