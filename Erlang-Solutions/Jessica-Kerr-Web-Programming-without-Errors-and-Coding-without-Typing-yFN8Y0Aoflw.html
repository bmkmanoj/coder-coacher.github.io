which is weird because I'm totally a
back-end developer however once in
awhile I really do want to make a web
page and in the past I've like attempted
to do this and as soon as I get into
JavaScript and I keep getting undefined
this out of function and this properties
not to find it I'm like I do this I go
back to the backend but now we have elm
how many people are familiar with them
most of you okay so I'll skip like some
of those super intro stuff also you
understand people know Haskell a
ridiculous number okay I don't really
have to talk about the syntax
what matters is about elm is that I get
rid of errors and by errors I
exclusively mean runtime exceptions I'm
not talking about bugs you can always
have bugs the types help you some with
the bugs but x and y are both integers
and I totally get them mixed up
but still I never get undefined it's not
a function and I'm super happy I can
live with that and without too much
typing is the other trade-off that's
interesting in this talk and by typing I
totally mean finger typing that's what I
don't want to do I don't want to do like
changes in five places for one
conceptual change but that's totally
necessary in Elm because it's purely
functional and completely explicit and I
like that except when it means too much
typing but I totally don't mean too much
static typing because that I don't think
there really is such a thing at least
not at this conference ml has a lot of
static typing not as much as Haskell but
way more than JavaScript so it's a big
improvement in this chop I'm gonna do
some live coding the good news is you
can use this stuff now and some of the
rest of it soon Elm is in production in
dozens of companies I made that number
up you can tell because it's really
vague but it has its own conference and
so it must be real
I'll you Elm is like totally legit and
you can use it in your apps and you can
use it in part of your apps or you can
use it in all of your apps and I'm also
going to talk about some code editors
from atomists and those are well the
good news is you can use them in any
language you don't even have to switch
to a different language the bad news is
they'll be open sourced in a month or
two all right let's get to work
Oh oh right and I work at stripe and
it's stripe I work in the backend and I
totally don't work in Elm I work in Ruby
but stripe is awesome and we sponsor the
conference I'm super happy about that
okay if nothing else out of this talk I
want you to get something about the
trade-offs being made and how we can
think about those and how we can make
them not painful of course on the
spectrum of do we want our errors at
runtime or at compile time
Elm falls falls very far in the compile
time spectrum at any other conference I
would have it all the way at the right
but we've seen a dress and Agda here so
let's be a little more reasonable
what matters is at once my Elm compiles
it's going to run in the browser it's
going to do something chances are decent
it's going to do what I wanted it to do
unlike JavaScript where you can run
absolutely anything but chances are a
lot of those things don't work the other
trade-off and in work
I really really appreciate this one is
the difference between ease of writing
and ease of reading and I don't mean
reading like English like cucumber tests
or something I mean reading like code I
don't want my code to read like English
I want it to be code and I want to know
exactly what it's doing at every
function call and I get that in Elm
for instance Elm has monads but it does
not have the generic Mon ad it has lists
lists and maybe and all the like normal
useful Mon ads and if you want to map
over a list you call list dot map and I
can tell exactly where that function is
defined and I can go to the code and
look at if I need to there's no implicit
so Scala is also way over here where you
can make macros and you can make
implicit in all kinds of other magic to
me
it looked really cool when you're
writing it and by you I mean you
specifically the one who wrote or
imported and studied that library I
don't mean me who comes back and
maintains it later and in some of the
Ruby code that I've read it stripe I
look at it I'm like how is this even
executable and I have no idea and I mean
I dick for a little while but there's so
many gems and layers and layers of gems
and 1l code just loaded I I just ask
somebody you know like oh yeah we do
this method missing thing over here in
this class six gems deep you can't do
that in elm I mean you can you can have
libraries but you have to call them
explicitly and I can tell and I'm so
happy about that the negative is that it
leads to more typing and I'm totally
cool with that so the interesting thing
here is what I'll show with the editors
there's a language called rug that is
performing transformations on the code
so that I can add a feature that
requires changes in five places as one
operation using code that I wrote about
how to modify the code this is a level
of abstraction that's very different
instead of making my code abstract I've
just subtracted the operation of
modifying my code
it's abstraction without indirection so
whoever comes along and maintains it
they're perfectly free to change it this
is fine and they don't even have to know
that I cheated also haha automatic code
editor is great for live demos
okay so let's laughs some live demo
all right here's an empty directory
except for a readme if you've ever
thought about getting started with Elm
but haven't it's super easy we'll do the
simplest possible thing let's make hello
world and then we'll evolve this into
something like maximally well something
close to what I want you have to say
module and the name of your module and
you have to say what your module exposes
because we're being extremely explicit
here
and then let's try mayonnaise hello
world maybe that'll work
because Maine wild Maine is a constant
this is a purely functional program so
Maine it has no it doesn't ask the state
of the world this is going to be a
static page so that that's pretty easy
given an elm file you can type L met
make and then the name of the file make
means compile I wish it said compile but
it says make it's not a build tool it
just compiles it into JavaScript except
of course that we have a bad main type
oh I forgot before I hit yes Elm is
going since since this is an empty
directory and I don't have like my
little dependency definition Elm is
going to create it for me to make it
easy but before it changes any of my
files it asks me whether that's okay and
yes it is okay to install Elm Lang
Virtual dong and now we have the pretty
compiler so in Elm just totally like
makes the trade-off less painful by
making the compilers less painful Connor
talked yesterday about how the work of
making these error messages good isn't
any fun so nobody does it well Evan does
it Evan writes Elm and he is trying to
make a language that makes coding in the
browser pleasant that is quite a
challenge
but one way he does it is by trying to
make these as explicit as possible so in
L my kind of practice compile error
driven development and in this one I'm
like okay well I know I needed something
so I'll just guess and the compiler
tells me that no you need an HTML or a
graphic or a program but you give me a
string yes I did give you a string so
now let's give it something more useful
what I actually want is an HTML of some
text and then I'll need to import HTML
and that should work good it does work
now what do we have here we have an
index dot HTML so by default the own
compiler gives you like the whole HTML
file because this is a quickest path
from a program from an elm program to a
web page that you can open and look at
and say
hello world it also gave me a couple
things the readme was already here but
own package.json is like the actual
definition of my code of my code of my
dependencies so the dependencies here
one thing that's interesting is that it
used a range of versions
it says anywhere between 405 and 500 is
acceptable for this light this library
significance here the 405 is the current
version and Elm is totally certain that
it can use anything between there and
500 because it enforces semantic version
at package publishing time so if Evan
tried to publish a version of Elm Lang
core as 406 but it actually changed an
API that would be rejected if it adds an
API it has to be for one and if it
changes or deletes the any available
method yeah any available function if it
changes the type of it that's 500
because it would break compilation of of
my project so B gets by some enforcing
that at publish time it makes it easy
here and then if I import two libraries
that both want say Elm HTML Elm will
find a compatible version that's in both
their ranges and if they don't overlap
I can't import both those libraries so
there's none of that ambiguity it's very
explicit and this says that my source
directory is my project root and I'm not
ok with that
so before I do anything else I really
want my project to look like a real
project and not just a little pile of
source at the root so I'm going to use
one of my editors to do that this lets
me start my project where it is as a
working working but pathetic little
project and jessa Tron Elm template
organized with a project name of code
mesh and please run locally so these are
my custom editors that I have created to
run locally and this one mean it doesn't
like mean ok I can fix this I'm going to
go over the my animus directory and run
it from
instead this is fine rug edits in code
code mesh omec hood mesh so run this
editor on this project and the editors
name is organized run it in local mode
please
so this editor is going to move my
source into the source directory and
change the elm pocket JSON to match it's
going to give me a real index study HTML
because in real life I don't want my elm
to compile to index.html I just want to
compile it to JavaScript and then I'll
include that in my element dot HTML so I
got tired of oh yeah a project name blah
blah blah
right I want my elm output to LJ yes and
like a target directory or something
sensible not my root directory so this
just does all that stuff I like to start
a lot of elam projects because it's
really fun to just play around with it
and I get tired of organizing them all
so now I have a program that does it
there we go commit that actually add
stuff commit that okay now I have a
source directory I have a resources
directory i'm gonna copy in some stuff
from above and now my resources
directory has like some graphics in it
and some CSS and now we're good okay so
now I can I have a dot get ignore that
ignores my Elm stuff and my target
directory let's make sure I can make and
I have a build script that deletes
target copies the resources into target
just those usual stuff this is fine now
I can edit this let's make sure it still
works oh that's because I put it in
target right which is a much better
place for it anyway okay there's that
and now I can like do something
interesting with it because I'm willing
to because it's organized in like a real
project okay let's put okay so my
objective the thing that I always wanted
to do in Elm that kind of triggered me
to like man I wish I could do you.why
development was
I would like them I'd like to take an
architecture diagram and like add labels
to it and then like to zoom in and add
more labels and zoom in and add more
labels but it has to be infinite zoom
because that's how the architecture at
stripe is nothing else is deep enough
and so we can start that up today now
we're not gonna get as far as zoom I
would be thrilled if we get as far as
actually making a label but whatever we
can start it'll be fun so let's put this
in an aside and the general structure of
the HTML elements in Elm is elements as
a function and this is a list of
attributes and this is a list of
children in addition to an aside I'll
have a main which is main tick because
mean is a keyword in Elm no attributes
and then it's no children yet to put
those together into one HTML elements
which is the return type of main I will
need a div okay and then inside main I
would like to have a canvas and we'll
put the diagram there we'll just give it
a background URL which is gonna be I
need to give it a style which is in HTML
de attributes and I can since I'm gonna
use that one a couple times I'll go
ahead and expose it even though I hate
to do that in two demos style and the
argument type here style accepts a list
of tuples of two strings so key to value
what's key to URL whew okay when I save
this Elm format kicks in an elm format
is part of the elm language system
because let's face it we don't program
in languages with programming language
systems libraries and build tools and
everything all together and part of that
nelma cell format which saves me from
arguing over how many spaces I don't
have her argue over spaces versus tabs
because it's whitespace sensitive so
tabs or syntax errors they should be but
I don't have to argue over spaces or
lines either because Elm format makes
those decisions for me and I am
be okay so we've got a canvas with a
background image that might work it does
not work and it tells me that Maine
wanted a list of things but I gave it a
list of lists of functions of things
oh my but what did it ok Maine tick so
Maine tick I've given it a list of
children or of attributes and then a
list of children with attributes but I
forgot to tell the canvas that it
doesn't have any children better all
right this should look like something
okay good because I totally cheated and
like put CSS in there great we have a
diagram oh and what I want to show you
about this is that the the actual HTML
you can kind of see that that winds up
in the page is very very closely mapped
to what I output from my main so there's
a div with the main and a canvas and an
aside with some text and that's it it's
just right there it's such a direct
mapping that there's a program out there
like HTML to Elm that you can copy your
page into and it'll spit out the Elm for
you and you can use that as a start to
convert a page to ohm because the the
mapping is very direct which is nice
Evan didn't intend for the language to
output HTML initially the name Elm comes
from elements and you were supposed to
say when I want this above this to the
left of that and it was supposed to be
like nicer than CSS but then it turned
out that what people wanted was CSS and
HTML because that's explicit we know
what that does as much as we can know
anything about the browser and so Evan
changed it because he's not he's not
writing this language for his own
research he is writing it to make people
happy
and by people I mean JavaScript
developers which is why which is why we
don't have the generic mana so this is a
pretty straightforward transformation
but at the moment the type of main is
it's actually HTML of HTML has a type
parameter and that type parameter is the
messages that can come back from the
interactive components in the HTML I
don't have any interactive components
this is
page so I can use the type with no
instances I need to bring in the HTML
type from the HTML module and then this
is the optional type declaration which
is super helpful when you have an error
and then I put them in there so I see
where I'm wrong okay in order to do
something more interesting I need to
move from a static page to a program
like say I want to be able to like
change the diagram that's displayed
enter URL
I'll need like an input and a button
we'll add the button first because it's
easier but before we can do that I need
to be able to put interactive components
in here and like respond to them
I need a program let's say commit that
whatever it is so I'm going to come back
to my editors and run upgrade to begin
our program I like this because it lets
me start with the simplest possible
thing and like build something and then
gradually get more elaborate with it
without having to do the same changes
over and over and all my wee little
projects and then the program okay so
change my main and now I have a beginner
program mein is still a constant because
this is a purely functional program the
constant provides three more pure
functions the model is just the initial
value of the application state the
update defines how we remodel and the
view says based on that state what
should the HTML look like and then the
Elm Elm will like magically make the
browser look like whatever the output of
view is just like react does but faster
it's a different implementation so
here's our application state to start
with it's an empty record which we give
a name to and then here's our messages
we can do nothing but nothing and we
respond to that by doing nothing and
finally the what was our main function
is precisely the view now so now that we
have a model coming in we can make this
diagram into application state so this
will be URL + we'll put the model dot
diagram your
and then the clothes Perrin and while
we're at it let's make hello world part
of the states model dot message okay so
then we have to put those in the state
and sure I have to give them initial
value diagram URL is that thing but
without the plan but with the quote and
the message was going to be hello world
how I spelled it that time okay and then
since we put it in there we have to
change the state or the type definition
that's the string and this is also a
string and something is unhappy and
because the home format doesn't work but
the compiler will tell me what it is
that's unhappy mm-hmm close
I missed a close Paran oh look there's a
Paran
there's not a parent I deleted too many
this is fine we'll just give it one and
then I'll know goes here all right
this is fine I thought that at compile
time which makes me happy okay no change
which is as expected but we're just
we've got this stuff in the state
instead of in the hard-coded in the view
that's nice of us and then we can add a
button so in the aside in addition to
the text let's add an HR with no
attributes or children and a button and
the button can have the text of a new
diagram but in order to do anything it
needs to send a message oh look we've
got a message type this says what our
button can send so I can say events on
click send a message what a new diagram
whatever and then I can make that be
part of the message and this is Union
type so we'll give it a new constructor
a new diagram lalala I have to respond
to that here new diagram
and then I don't have anything to update
the diagram URL to so I can't say give
me the model such that the message is
new diagram time instead of hello world
so this is like a record modifier syntax
kind of a copy constructor oh I forgot
to important on clicks so here's
something that's fun I can actually if I
pick my favorites sometimes I get tired
of going in and importing them so one
thing I can do is take the build output
and parse it and pipe that to an editor
that adds the import which is not yet
fast this is in very alpha but what I
like about this is that my code
modifications are not tied to my my
texting tool so they're not part of the
IDE I can integrate that with Adam I
haven't done that yet or VI or Emacs but
the concept of how do I work with
element is outside just like Elm format
is triggered by Adam but it's not in
Adams so I'm not linked to any one tool
oh good it actually worked I was a
little worried when it didn't work
earlier but so now we have the events
thing yeah great okay commit that stuff
and we should be able to push the button
but first I have to build because I
don't have any life and load stuff set
up oh we have a button that's great I'm
happy to see you button and if we push
it it says new diagram time oh wow and
interactive app yay
all right now to make it do something
useful I need to add a text input that
turns out to be a pain in the butt in
Elm it's it's five changes it's just
there's just five places you have to
change to add a freaking text input and
rather than make this magic like a
JavaScript library so many JavaScript
libraries do with like stuff happening
behind the scene I'm just going to
generate the code to keep it fully
explicit so we'll call our input name
new diagram
and that'll be good enough and then
let's look at the editor the editor for
add text input is here and it says okay
we're gonna add something to the model
that's another editor that I've composed
in which is going to add something to
the model type and something to the
initial value based on what I put here
and then I'm going to add a message
because I need when we push the new
diagram button we're going to want to
update the URL well what are we going to
update it to we have to have that in our
application state but in order to get it
in our application state because we
can't just go query that input field and
say what's in it no that would be
accessing the outside world and these
are pure functions so to get it into the
state I have to respond to an event so
why so you have to set up the on input
event for the text input so that every
time I type it changes my application
state which you can do cool things with
like screw with the text input and
change it on people while they're typing
cool but more often you just want access
to that later so we have to add out a
message that can receive it and that's
gonna put it in the model such that
input name is body blob and then I'm
gonna import the things that I need just
in case and then I add a function which
let's not look at the JavaScript that
generates ohm let's just look at the
function it didn't happen where is it
oh man add text model yeah that I wanted
to call it next diagram in but anyway
this is actually add text input I was
close okay so this is going to create a
function then that I can just stick into
my view wherever I want the text input
if you're if you use Elm all day you
don't feel the need for this kind of
thing but if you only use it in your
spare time and you're like what all do I
have to do to add a text input and
that's five things plus possibly some
imports I just get tired of forgetting
the bits so I really like having it in
one place and also the other day I
needed an ID on my text input and I was
like oh you know why don't I just add
that by default everywhere so I put it
in the editor and suddenly my like
coding standards have changed throughout
the project and every time I do that in
the future it's just there
I would love to be able to do this on my
team so that our code stays super
uniform and that the that when the code
is boring I don't have to respond by
adding indirection and more complicated
libraries I can just respond by
automating the coding bit so I like that
all right
it worked this time let's see it here's
a new function next diagram input and I
can take that function and I can put it
right where I want it before the button
and give it the model and we'll save it
and build it and now I'll have a text
input Oh
but this time I'm going to remember to
actually do something with it so now
that we have that the next diagram in
the model when we do when we push the
button we can say that the diagram URL
is the model dot next diagram great
right did you do we built it let's look
at it okay we have a text input I can
type in it I can say give me the get
beginner program architecture um
nope it's a pain yay okay so this
diagram describes the architecture of
our elm beginner program its beginner
because the only interaction so we
receive are from our components that we
created so here's the initial model it
goes into the update function which
receives messages modifies the model
that model goes into the view and
creates the view the model also goes
back into the update function for the
next round with the next message and
messages are created by the user
interacting with my components that I
created and do traditional Elm wires
those back to the update function so
while that wiring is done in the Elm
runtime and my two functions and one
constant are completely functional and
for pita Bowl and reproducible and if
you send it the same list of messages
then you get the same output every time
okay awesome
now I want to be able to like label
these things as yo this is the model
this is the update this is the view this
is the person to do that I need to I
need to like put a text input like where
I click which means I need to know where
I click which means I need access to
something from the outside world the
browser knows where I clicked but my my
two little components over here don't so
I need to upgrade from a beginner
program to a regular advanced own
program alright let's just do the editor
that is over here so we're gonna upgrade
to program this is often the next step
in this as soon as I need subscriptions
this is going to let me subscribe to
events from the outside world
very explicitly and turn those events
into messages that are my message type
and then send those through update and
we will get farther ok great so let's
look at the program what changed here's
what changed
I'm HTML app DUP program instead of an
initial model I've got an init
constant that returns both a model and a
list of commands because by upgrading to
an advanced program I gained not just
access to subscriptions which is how I'm
going to get the mouse clicks but to
send commands out to the JavaScript so
the JavaScript integration and elm is a
very strict boundary you can send
commands that go out outside of elm like
in your HTML you can so you can like
connect the JavaScript to those messages
I'm not going to do that today but we
might get as far as sending a command
also you can send commands from update
so the type of update has changed and
every place where update returns
something now says here's my model and
do nothing
this is a syntax that turns this into a
tuple of the model with a command that
does all the things in this list which
is nothing and I really like it because
it's easier to search for okay so our
update has changed our view is identical
there's nothing different about that but
our subscriptions function at the bottle
bottom here is where we can add mouse
clicks so we need to add mouse clicks
and you know what I'm this is gonna be
faster if I do it with the editor so
adding mouse clicks is something that I
do pretty often there's a flaw in this
editor which I'm sure everyone here will
spot immediately subscribe to mouse
clicks because I need to add the
subscription to my subscription function
I need to import the mouse I need to add
a message that that the the subscription
gets translated into a message of my
type and then I need to add a something
to the model to store the last place
that I clicked and what did I go to
subscribe to clicks okay I was close and
I needed from oh and I need to add the
mouse to my own package JSON which I
always forget so grateful live coding
this will work
that we can look at the editor for that
as subscribe to mouse clicks I was close
yeah I've got a generic subscribe one
and this sort of specifies all the
different things that's the message
we're gonna get I have to give it an
initial value let's see if that worked I
should have something my subscriptions
I've got mouse clicks and I've got
clicks and my message includes click and
with the click I get that mouse stop
position which is a record of X&amp;amp;Y let's
commit build that and yeah I approve of
this plan now we're gonna get the clicks
but you're not gonna see anything
because we haven't done anything with
them so I better add them to the view
okay phew
in addition to the canvas I would like
you to show me the last click point
given the model and I can cheat and
paste this in last quick point model is
give me my favorites and that is gonna
be this one where I have this style in
the position:absolute if I brought an
Elmo CSS this would be a lot prettier
because this would be typed and I
wouldn't have to like to string my X&amp;amp;Y
so I would have to to float them but
that's okay we're we're we're giving a
div for giving an absolute position
we're putting in an image with an ID
that i have in my CSS and a source and
then a label with some text which is
just going to show us the value but it
thinks i clicked at okay work yay okay
now you can see the flaw i haven't
clicked yet and yet there's a click yet
so clearly i should be using a maybe
here and you know i vaguely tried to
implement that this morning but i didn't
i didn't know but when i implement it i
will implement it in my editor and then
every time I add mouse clicks it will be
as a maybe and it will be correct and
yeah I can click around awesome we have
four more minutes before I need to get
to conclusion and that means we can
probably add a text input yeah why not
it's going to have the same problem of
not being a maybe and we should wrap it
in one and I won't
get to that today but Elm does encourage
that okay ed urges add another text
input text input to program input name
equals next label and then after that
runs I'd like to show you the diff
that'll be here but I didn't commit
stuff so the diff it's gonna be useless
ah I've added another text input which
is exactly the same operation and now I
just need to put it somewhere let's put
it here where is it it is next level
input right here BAM
we'll just stick it in here in place of
this label next label input this thing
and that should be good
Oh build build just build ah done - done
oh man so it wanted this particular and
I gave it a model to HTML message did I
pass it the model I didn't pass it the
model doesn't just pass it itself I
passed it itself no wonder is unhappy
okay we have a text ah good turn okay I
can't click on it without power without
clicking so um oh and it doesn't
so I really need it to put the focus in
the text input as soon as I bring up the
text input and and I could set autofocus
is true but trust me that only works the
first time it comes up and not the
second and the third and the fourth so
in order to tell it that I want the
focus to be there that's the JavaScript
thing javascript does set focus fly
revived and I can't do that in my pure
functions I only have expressions I do
not have any statements like sit focus
so over another editor and this one is
just going to give me a way to set the
focus so to set the focus - I call it
set focus where's my list of things here
it is request focus maybe take it Jess
would you call this thing do you see it
I can't hear you focus command thank you
you're right
awesome thank you okay focus command so
for this I'm going to need to send a
command out to JavaScript when I send a
command out to JavaScript focus command
come here
there you are to do so I have to have a
message to receive in case of error and
I have to have a message to receive in
case of success this is all very
specific and a lot of commands like
total you need those but in this case I
don't actually care what focus success
I'm not going to do anything with them
but for type safety I have to do all
this because this nice Dom dot focus
method is going to give me the tasks
that I need but the task is just
something that you could perform in
JavaScript if you sent to the command
and so it's super complicated but so I
have to say tasks that perform the Dom
error and then the focus success and
they need to import DOM and I need to
import tasks and I need to make sure
that Dom is in my Jace on my own package
so JSON because even though it's a
transitive dependency of both mouse and
HTML which we already have you can't
call your transitive dependencies in elm
that would not be explicit if you want
to call something a Dom we have to
declare the Dom so here
have to add it to the package Oh Jason
yeah the Ellen package.json and finally
I can add this little function so that I
don't have to remember how to do this
over and over which makes me happy okay
builds oh and then I need to call it I
probably need to like call the function
somewhere that would help and that's
going to be when we click I think
where's the update at some point I would
like to start dividing these up into
files and modules by function not by
component Elm says there is no component
the geographical area of the screen is
not the unit of modularization the
function is do do if we click we want to
set the last click and that is going to
have the effect of moving the field so
in our little command list we want to
request focus on our what did I call
that next diagram input I think and out
it was not a min out make sure that's
correct
no it isn't it was next label where did
I put that because it was wrong next
label input okay that would have set the
focus to the wrong place every time
build and Chrome and refresh and now
when I click it doesn't work that's what
we didn't work dang it I don't have time
to make it work date okay I don't know
why that didn't work and I didn't put
error handling normal in real life I
would make that error message update the
this thing over here so that I can see
it that does it oh and while we're here
elm program dot ping this is our
architecture now and this is as
complicated as Ellen programs get with
one caveat you could pass in initial
arguments
so there's your own it there's your
update both in an update can send
commands to the outside world and the
output of that just gets back into the
message stream along with the
interactions from the people in the
subscriptions that you've asked for
specifically from the browser and that's
it that's as complicated as an elm gets
and it's all depth from there the in
conclusion I want to give you like some
sort of status Elm is production-ready
you can totally use it it's got some
pretty good tools I think we could do
more on text editors and II's because
it's so well typed and Adam is as part
of that and then the community is really
good there's a slack with like 5,000
members or something the atomists
editors you can use now the currently
published ones which are in here and
they are closure Java and Python so if
you're working in one of those languages
you could potentially use a de missed
editors now by joining the community
slack and there you can say hey Adam
ist's run this editor on my project and
it'll give you a PR with the changes
which is really cool and someday we're
going to be able to do though somebody
soon we're going to be able to do those
across multiple repositories so you can
make related changes in multiple repos
and I'll just be happy when I can
publish my own editors and everyone can
run them from the command line
for testing so this is exciting and
there's going to be a lot more to that
too you can have reviewers that check so
that if you've got your coding standards
and coded in the editors and someone
violates them you can find out yeah I
will push this up to gh-pages before I
fix the bug and then maybe you y'all can
find it if you can find it before I do
and if you want more info go to Elm Lang
or Adam is calm or the readme at this
repository thank you
and we have one minute for question
there's one
it's more not like a question but I
think for thought I really a lot of
people putting effort in inventing new
languages or bringing Haskell to browser
or something similar like a strong type
systems to browser and making new
editors for them and it takes a lot of
effort in my opinion while there is this
other thing called LLVM and possibility
to compile the bytecode interpreter and
with the languages like Haskell and
rusts with powerful McCrone type
supports I wonder if you could use the
tools from Haskell or rust and if
somebody has any information if that
works and the how stable is it I will
not hear it because it's it really seems
the way it's all waiting to simply like
choosing choose your tools you are stuck
you wish and have some intermediate that
because probably solve a lot of problems
and you you you wouldn't get languages
or tools that are better than the
previous one but you can get kind of
option to choose from let's say I think
just the font what's your name Yanis
yawns okay um I have no idea and if
anyone here does have an idea about how
we can have more compatibilities and
choice of tools please find yawns and
you'll have a good conversation thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
