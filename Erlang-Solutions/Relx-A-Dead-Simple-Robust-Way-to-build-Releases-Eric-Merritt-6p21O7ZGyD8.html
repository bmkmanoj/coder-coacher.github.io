moment so I with richard carlson and
martin logan wrote a book so i didn't
write about myself no it's all good yeah
everyone should would kill you so I'm
going to cover a few topics in this talk
and these are basically it so this will
be somewhat of a review for a lot of you
but it's critical to understanding how
relics work so I'm going to spend a
little bit of this talk going over
applique OTP applications and OTP
releases what they are and why they are
important especially releases then I'm
gonna talk a little bit about how relics
build releases and then I'm going to
talk about a little bit how you
configure relics especially how you can
use relics to to help you develop your
applications in the context of it
release and then I'm going to talk about
how to extend relics for those of you
that may want to extend the
functionality I have one goal one goal
only there in this talk on what you walk
out of here with the ability to build
releases so many of you have either open
source projects or projects in your in
your in your company or what have you I
would love it if you guys could in the
break sit down and in five minutes have
your stuff converted releases and it
should be completely possible let's um
let's get started talk a little bit
about what relics is so obviously as we
talked about it's a tool to build
releases it's also a tool that's
designed to fit into a unix-like suite
of build tools now I'm going to give you
a little bit of the history where relics
come from as Torben mentioned of them a
while back actually starting in 2006 up
until oh no 2011-2012 I was working on a
build tool called sin on sit on was very
good tool and one of the nicest features
of sin on was how it built releases they
do basically it would introspect the
directory structure of your project and
just figure out how to build a release
and do it for you without you giving it
any further information that was
gorgeous after a while some maintenance
became an issue and by that time rebar
had pretty much won the kind of build
system market for for Erlang so I trans
I deprecated sin on transition my
development to rebar and everything
worked fine except for now I had to
build releases with other things besides
sit on it was a lot more effort and a
lot more lot more confusing I couldn't
imagine how crazy confusing would be to
people that didn't like have a good
knowledge of how releases were didn't
have a good knowledge of releases in
general and I missed really really miss
that functionality that I hadn't sent on
so I started thinking about the problem
and I thought it would be really nice if
there was a suite of unix-like tools for
for for building Erlang and I figure
they're probably three different areas
that those tools could cover by
unix-like tools I mean small tools focus
on a specific problem with well-defined
inputs and outputs so that you could fit
those different variations of those
tools together as you needed for your
particular build process so I sat down
and I thought okay there's probably
three main areas of build for Erlang the
first one is its package management
right being able to get OTP applications
on your box somewhere that's currently
still an open area of development
although we'll say or wear which is kind
of like the open source company that I'm
a part of just got a google Summer of
Code projects way you haven't a google
Summer of Code inter and working on that
so maybe that'll happen the end of
summer will say it's going to be
interesting so anyway the first one of
that is is packaging second part is
built like taking your lying files and
turning them into beam files and the
third one is packaging that those
compiled applications into a release so
obviously for the build we already have
we have rebar we have make we have other
kind of less well known things like
tetra pak that's that's well covered you
can use any of those to build these OTP
apps we didn't have anything for it for
for for the releases so I spent a ton of
free time last year basically porting
that functionality from sin on 22 relex
to fit that model of having one tool
this focused on one problem in this case
release building that takes standard
inputs which is it tasty OTP metadata
that comes in the app files and
producing an output which is the release
structure and so forth it actually
turned out quite well I use relics this
fair number of other field are using
relics now and it just works it fills
its niche well I think so to move from
there into into a quick refresher for
OTP applications so for release
management there's a few things that are
that are important OHV applications have
a well-defined structure OTP
applications have a an explicit
well-defined lifecycle what I mean by
that is you have start and stop
semantics that are important to how the
application functions and though it
actually has implications for release
man lifecycle and useful metadata that
includes explicit dependencies that's
critically important for for Alexis will
see shortly so by well-defined structure
we mean that has a name and a version
the OTP application of talking about
built applications now the kind of are
consumed by releases that you see if you
do an LS in your lot in your user local
library lang live directory always has
an even always have a name dot app
metadata optionally you can have doc it
can have proved it can have included it
can have source I'm of the opinion that
sources not optional but Erlang doesn't
require that by well-defined lifecycle
we means it has start and stop semantics
this is the application behavior you
will always have a
art for your active relying applications
you'll always have a stop and finally
useful metadata you have meditate about
what's in your application name version
what's interesting for us is
dependencies applications and included
applications which gives a list of the
direct dependencies for this Oh TPM what
that means is those are applications
that that this OTP up depends on and
these are applications that must be
started before this OTP app has started
and of course each of these dependencies
have their own dependencies transitive
dependencies in the case of this
particular app so we have these OTP
applications they give us a lot of rich
metadata that we can use to to to to
build releases unfortunately that's not
usually what happens because still
there's a lot of confusion about
releases in the community people tend to
focus on OTP apps and actually this is a
huge improvement back before like 2010
used to see people just write a line
code that wasn't in the structure of app
so the fact that most of the stuff we're
saying is OTP apps is huge improvement
but we haven't made that next step so we
often see things like this where you
have a general module and has a manual
start and someone somewhere is stepping
through and manually starting what they
believe their dependencies are and then
you'll also really often see something
like this which is a little star script
that calls that function we just saw
that manually starts up all of your
dependencies right so what do we end up
here we so we don't we're not having to
be happening where we have a system
because we have the main app we're
talking about the thing that provides us
our functionality and then we have its
dependencies and so all those work
together to provide a system for us so
so there's the in this relying system
the dependency information is haphazard
we've defined it in our in our inter
application metadata we've pretty much
ignore that and we're starting our
things up manually and we're trusting
that developer knows what all have his
direct dependencies and all of his
transitive dependencies are and he's
starting them
and in fact in the example I showed you
it's there's got a bug because at least
two of those dependencies are not
started and usually what we'll see also
is we take a system where the component
parts are spread around the file system
right some of those parts are in maybe
an user live erlang live some of them
might be in faro up something or other
and and we're doing a bunch of things
like trusting that those versions are
the versions of things we think they are
that the version of the Earth's that
you're lying runtime system basically
relying on the disk is one that we've
compiled for all this kind of stuff is
extremely extremely spread out and we're
lucky if everything's even there so
around the world we have lots of systems
that are assembled really poor League
like we just talked about we see these
stuff commonly deployed by tearing up
and SC peeing out to the individual apps
out to a tarball and we see dependency
information kind of haphazardly to
spread around the system what we
actually need is something that manages
and we get where I can read it it's not
so good up there some of the manages and
provides clear semantics around start
down start up and subs and shut down
something that uses that dependency
information that we described in our OTP
app metadata to manage dependencies for
it's it's there it's described we just
want it to be used and something that
assembles all this correctly and then
something to run that thing that we've
assembled correctly in a way that's
coherent for the system and the reality
is we actually already have all that in
the case of something that manages and
provides clear semantic surround system
startup and shutdown that's Erlang OTP
releases they've been defined since
before or language open sourced for
something that uses the Pennsy described
and manages where they occur and when
they are started again or language TP
releases we have a release handler built
into the system that will do that for us
as long as we give it enough information
to
to do that something that does the
creation of packaging of that of those
relying systems we've had several of
those sent on in the back of the day
reloj tool that exists now and then and
relics the the newest one that I'm aware
of and then again something to manage
the start up of those systems is
erlanger ectopy releases vast majority
of this is built into the system that we
already have by far the vast majority of
this we provided one additional feature
to assemble things in the right
structure and these are relying releases
OTP releases so let's talk a little bit
about what a release exactly is so
release is a set of built versioned OTP
applications that represent the direct
and transitive dependencies of your top
level providers a little bit of metadata
that describes those applications and
their startup order and this kind of
thing to Erlang's release handler also
although not tremendously relevant to
this conversation an explicit
configuration mechanism and finally a
tarball support that you can use to
distribute as needed and the release
kind of looks like this this is
absolutely beautifully well done image
of our diagram I don't think you could
possibly do better than this the main
thing is the dot rail file the dot real
foul is a bit of metadata that tells us
information about the erlang release
it's very similar to the app metadata
that you might be more familiar with
that rel file describes those
applications we talked about that make
up the release related to that real file
is the dot script and boot file which is
used which is the compiled version of
that real file that is used by the
airlines release handler to actually run
and start the release and then
optionally assist our config for you
guys to use as configuration this is
what that metadata looks like so we have
the release the release name in this
case it's a echo get in the version the
version of Earth's
neste relying runtime system this is the
core of Erlang that is the references to
the vm and then the version of those
applicate the names of the applications
involved and the versions of those
applications these are all my
dependencies both direct dependencies
and transitive dependencies so all of my
depends both directorate pendency and
the dependencies of my dependencies and
their their start order basically and
the on-disk structure looks something
like this the optionally we can have
hurts I just like Jared before me
recommend that Earth's be distributed
with your releases we have a live
directory with the built version OTP
applications and then we have the
release meta directory where we have the
name of the release the version of the
release and that metadata that we talked
about the doctor bills while the dot
boot filed adopt script file Siskin
vague and quite often vm args so let's
lost my train of thought sorry it's a
little bit jet lag so let's look at an
example and now I need a mirror displays
sorry guys give me just a moment to
figure this out yeah there we go work a
little better I hope okay
so let's go into so here's um here's an
app that you sorry guys so here's an app
that you might be for me have an e bin
directory we have sourced director we
have docs directory we have the various
things example startup sh and the
various things we need to actually build
a release so to build a release with
relics we just type r LX so give us it's
going to do some searching to see what's
available it's going to resolve
everything in East resolve and it's
going to build a release and it does
that by default although we can tell it
to do differently in that was it it
doesn't need any input from the user so
it just figures out what it needs to
figure out and builds the releases so it
builds it in by default oh this is
configurable into a thing called rail so
we can see now we have our but actually
helps if I'm moving it into that
directory we can see we have our live
directory which is all that again all
the direct and transitive dependencies
we have our releases directory which is
designed such that you can have multiple
releases in the same directory structure
if you need to this helps a little bit
with them hot code loading and relics
and this kind of thing which relics also
supports but we're not going to go into
that too much and then in in there we
have the DA trail which was generated
for you the dot boot which was compiled
the dust grip sis config and vm ours
does all this for you does all this with
almost no no input from you as the
developer now relics does have a config
file and i'll bring it up that's what it
is so this config file looks just like
this and that's really way up there the
name release looks appears by design
similar to release metadata release name
release version and the top level
applications that
that are that are including this release
and we get back a little bit to our
slide structure although going back and
forth is actually interesting okay so
you tell that release structure this is
what was built by by relex and you saw
us creating release gave us some
information about what was going on and
resolved everything it needs to do and
created the release so here's what r LX
is actually doing relics reads in the
configuration to get the information it
needs to figure out what's going on it
looks at the environment it looks at
your by default it looks in the local
directories looks in the live directory
of Erlang to discover what applications
are available in your world like what's
what it does your Lang world look like
then it starting at the apps you
specified you saw us their top level in
that config it starts looking at the
adage appendices of finding all those
dependencies based on that environment
it discovered it does a full constraint
solve on those dependencies I'll show
you some examples of that in just a
minute weird make sure that all those
dependencies meet the constraints that
you've given it then you use that
information to assemble the release and
then it creates all the bills and
compiles all that metadata that's needed
and we saw an example of the
configuration in this case echo get the
root remember we looked at echo get you
can see that that the application found
Colonel st live matches the ones that it
resolve I'm getting ahead of myself so
we already saw the release structure but
let's talk a little bit about constrain
let's add something that's really really
common interlining or enter production
or lying applications go back to
mirroring so do so love the TV screens
they make me feel like a giant know what
I put it that's too
so let's look at a relics config Melissa
feet look like this if we wanted to add
sasol say as a top-level application we
could add sasal right go in type in
relics again and it builds release after
a second and we can see that in our live
directory we have we have we now have
sasal there so figured out worse hassle
wasn't added it to our release what if
we only wanted sasal that was greater
than widow and for some reason our
release we wanted sasal that's greater
than then two out three so we constrain
relics a little bit we say sasal 23 and
wanted to be greater than or equal no
one relics again it's going to do the
same thing whoa
what did I just do
this is
perfect course I've run through this
talk probably 10 times at least without
a problem okay so two three we've
concern it to it works because we have
to type 3 there right but what if we
concern it's something we don't have
what if we could say nor to say to dot 4
why do I keep doing that and that we're
concerned to say to dot for now it's
going to throw an error it's going to
say that hey we couldn't satisfy this
constraint there is no sasal greater
than 2 dot for now the reality is for
relics it can you have the option of
specifying constraints both in the rail
the relics that config to control your
top-level app but in your app you can
optionally I actually don't recommend
use it we can actually also specify
constraints in your in your app metadata
and relics is going to look at all those
constraints look at everything instant
environment and do a basically a
constraint solve to find a list of
dependencies that match that all of the
constraints in the system if it matches
it's going to go ahead and build your
release if it doesn't match it's going
to give you useful information about the
where the conflicting constraints come
from and we can kind let's go back and
oh getting quite ahead of myself so so
the constraints basically the
constraints you would expect greater
than less than I'm greater than equal
less than or equal between and a piece I
actually picked up from basheh which is
like between Virgil's thank you it's a
pessimistic solve basically so you could
say I want it to be this pessimistic
solved between to a to dot the rain
it'll take every release between two
three up to but not including 24 so you
have really a lot of options about
constraining releases
let's go back here so it's already lost
my time approach well X also provides UD
this is where r LX really helps you as a
developer by default relics looks at the
bill to applications in your world the
named name version applications and uses
those to assemble the release and when
it does that it copies those
applications into your release structure
so that you always have a well
consistent release that you can move
around however it's often times where
you are working on say two applications
the applications actually providing
services but you're also doing bug fixes
in some kind of dependency and that has
its own repo and that's somewhere else
you can tell relics to don't worry about
constraining anything for this
application name look in this place so
for this one we're saying we want
overrides for the sx4 application we
want to just use this s expert directory
on disk and relics will find that s
exper based on where you said and
symlink it into your release with the
proper version and suddenly you can
start your release manager release with
with that kind of that local dependency
plugin in place of another dependency
before i get i actually completely
forgot to go over a couple of nice
features of relics let me fix this
config so we only need status on
yes we actually already have it so so in
our release director we have a bunch of
it helps to build the release actually
so now release director we have a bunch
of stuff one of the interesting things
once it builds your releases releases
have their own life cycle erlang release
he understands how to start releases
you've got to pass some like magic
incantations to to Earl exec which is
what Earl calls eventually to get it and
that startup that release but we
generate that script for you that works
on so far all the UNIX is we've tried
and heard about so in row then there are
two files one is the name of your
release and one is the name of your
release plus subversion they're the
exact same file we generate too just so
that because we overwrite that echo get
the name of the release every time we
generate so we always want to be able to
start up the release version with
whether it's whether or not you built
multiple release so if there's an echo
get to that four to five four or five
six seven doesn't matter you can always
start up that version of your
application we also also start also have
that echo get that would not echo get
but the start script for the latest or
the last generated version of your
release and that will always work for
every release and you can just call it
and it's going to start and in this case
since is a really simple since it's a
really really simple application that
runs on your you can say hey good look
it started and that's actually going to
work if you're if you built a release
and you're following the OTP stuff where
your configured in and your sister
config and all this kind of stuff that's
always going to work now in places where
that doesn't work we offer the kind of
the same thing that rel tool offers and
just for those of you that are already
using rel tool the this overlay stuff
you can actually literally copy and
paste it into relics and it'll just work
makes it really easy to migrate from
real tool to
real cool for those of you that are not
using real tool you can just forget that
that exists and look at these overlays
overlays are a way for you to add stuff
to the release without getting into
plugins for relics in this kind of thing
basically lets us to specify a list of
bars in a config file that lists of ours
can let's kill this let's make a bar a
second thing that looks like a Erlang
standard length prop list so we can do
something like my bar just put foo bar
in there now then we can set create
another file called my file tmpl let's
say and we'll use the this kind of
standard template syntax to copy that
then let's open up the relics config
think that's where was I always forget
specifically overlay Roy yeah that makes
sense I don't actually use these very
often because i'll sell them at have any
need to do anything outside of normal
releases so let's say okay we want to
use first config which i think that can
only be one yeah when you borrow second
fig and we want these overlays
first we want to make der in the release
directory test we want to copy that
template over from my yeah my filed out
tmpl to test my files a text then we can
ask for alex to rebuild that now we can
see in our in our belt release we have
this nice new so if I didn't do
something wrong which could bear will be
the case because it seemed to be doing
that quite a bit in this talk that's the
problem i named it overlays instead of
overlay call relax actually did that
when I was practicing several times as
well so it makes sense I did it those
release we have tests we have my file
that test and we can see that it's it's
done the swap out for us and basically
we're using a template system called
early detail early diddle I forget I
don't know how it's pronounced and all
that all that templating function is the
functionality is available to you and
there's quite relics gathers quite a lot
of information about the environment and
makes that available in in your
templates as well so you can you go to
the relics relics dot org website you
can look at the and there's really good
documentation about all the variables
that are provided for you by relics this
is a kind of a trivial example well
let's also handles multiple releases you
can have as many releases as you want in
that in that relics config briella and
then you can build them by specifying on
the on the command line the name of the
release and the version of the release
so so you can kind of historically
keep all of your releases around and
build them to test out various versions
of your product and this kind of thing
you can also configure those releases by
/ release by sticking relics
configuration options into into this
release structure and then you can have
different configurations for each
release probably shouldn't need to do
that a lot but sometimes if you release
gets too complex you might need to
change configurations from a release to
release stay release to release relics
is also relics provides a lot of
functionality out of the box most of us
fairly easy to use but if you get into a
place where relics doesn't provide
functionality it's easily extendable has
a simple to implement behavior called
rlx provider and an API for accessing
information about the state of the
releases being built that provider looks
like this you provide a these are the
callbacks by the init you provide a do
and format error now providers are
basically and it's called when the
release when the provider is loaded do
is called when that functionality is
expected to be executed and and format
error when you if you return an error to
relics and relics wants to display that
to a user is going to ask you to turn
that error into some nice pretty string
so it can display it it's kind of
following that same model that that are
lying itself files in a lot or lying
itself follows in a lot of error
handling situations the the providers
are actually really simple they take a
rlx state and they return in rlx state
and they adjust that our Alec state
based on the the the things they need to
do so that later providers can also make
use of the things they happen so you can
think of relics as a series of state
transitions because relics itself is
implemented as a series of providers
relics itself uses all the same
functionality that you as a plug-in
creator would use to manipulate and
modify your stuff that means that the
generally it means that the API is quite
good because it's not something we're
only providing for releases were kind of
dog fooding our own structure and to
make that available in your relic stock
config you would at call an ad providers
and just the name of the providers you
want to add to the
them to the relics creation process so
that's relaxing get more information at
relics org and relics is an earl where
project we have a lot of a lot we have
really good number of well done well
designed well implemented hopefully
tools that you can make we're much more
information about Earl we're at or word
org or we're also puts on a so I'm going
to do some self advertisement unrelated
I work relex we for a lot of years we
have worked very hard to get knowledge
about how to build systems in Erlang
into the community how to build good
fault tolerance systems based on on HP
into the community one of the reasons we
wrote the book we've also started into
2010 giving these two day workshops but
they're really intense two day workshops
about how to build large-scale fault
tolerant systems in our line using OTP
they they tend to be extremely
inexpensive we don't make money off them
were there too we cover the cost of the
venue and the cost of travel and this
kind of stuff and our goal is to to
promulgate knowledge this year we're
doing two for the first time we're doing
one in Amsterdam in august 30 and 30
first it's um it's actually insane
because spill game spil games who here
today you guys should go talk to them is
I'm sponsoring the most of the cost of
the conference so the price of interest
is just 55 euro for that's unbelievable
4ch again the tickets are selling out
more rapidly than we've actually ever
done before so if you're interested in
learning more about building large-scale
trippy apps this is a great opportunity
for you to namm stream august 30 and 30
first if you're in the united states
we're doing another one in nashville and
october the eleventh and twelfth
nashville is a really fun town it might
give you a good excuse to go hang out
there for a couple of days these are a
lot of fun and and you tend to learn a
lot although i will say like they tend
to be extremely intense well we're
showing a ton of information to your
head
over a very short amount of time does
anyone have any questions that i can
answer yep um how to deal with upgrades
and downgrades so relics will build
standard rell ups so basically using the
the same infrastructure that Erlang the
release handle users you're responsible
for creating your app ups there's um at
least for right now there's too much
specific knowledge that goes into a pups
for relics to comfortably be able to
create those so but if you create your
app ups for each of your you're the ones
that need it relex will happily and
transparently create a rel of you just
do that by relics space rel up and it
will create a rail up instead of a a
napa and you can by default or look at
the latest two releases and create a
relat for those two like from the oldest
went to the newest one but you can also
pass command-line options to change what
it's like upgrading from and to thanks
no problem yep if the next question mine
is on this front i'm going to get
matches so someone over here needs to
ask a question next because i want to
see store and run more so with the UM
when you versioned the dependencies even
though relex config mm-hmm how does that
work with the dependencies and the rel
in the rebar config do you specify them
in both like you know if you're fetching
the pendants ease from like it or
something right so um so you have to
specify them in both right now if you
specify dependencies in the in the well
if you specify dependencies in the
relics config and that's optional you
have to specify it there right now it's
quite common for so by default relics
chooses the latest dependency that
matches its constraints all right so so
if the Pennsy only exists in your depths
directory the rebar creates that's the
one that's going to find so it's you can
feel free to leave the dependencies off
of the relics that config and just use
the ones in in the rebar config right
because relics is going to go and look
at that what's available
to it and use the latest ones of the OTP
apps that are there but relics has no
specific knowledge about rebar by design
right is it sure but it well to some
extent if it finds a depths directory
it's going to it's going to use that so
that's the extent of its direct
knowledge of rebar those so maybe I miss
where else does it look if you don't
have a depths directory like say you
don't put any depths in reebok
envisioned by default it's only going to
look in your the library of your current
or Lang release and you can also specify
other depend other directories for it to
look at ok that makes sense yeah all
right thanks no questions over here come
on guys know any other questions so no
other questions we can I have no idea
where we are for time unfortunately we
have four minutes ok so that's the case
then you guys can and when we're going
to do break so you get a little bit
longer break thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
