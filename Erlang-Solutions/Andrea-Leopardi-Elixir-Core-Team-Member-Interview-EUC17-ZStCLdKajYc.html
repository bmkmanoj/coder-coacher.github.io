so my name is hundra and I mean the
elixir Courtin and where are you here I
I am from Italy and I work in Sweden in
Gothenburg ok yeah he definitely wanted
the more frequent presented in the
community which really take it as a
compliment
yeah yeah yeah my hopes I heard yeah
hopefully yeah did you've been
presenting if you do this tour of your
right to an introduction to elixir yeah
help another member of the core team
James to do a tutorial free tutorial for
elixir yesterday like Cal State sorry
and then it's interesting we're seeing a
lot of momentum around to the be me
Cooper system in general yeah I think
the different communities coming
together are you guys seeing many people
from the Berlin communities
remember that I would say that
so the I would say that we don't get a
lot of her lung users that want to try
out a liquor
not at least not as much we get users
that just want our elixir in general but
we get we do get some lung users that
want to try a liter and we generally I
think we're seeing a growth in like
collaboration between the communities
that we get we get to help air along
between Mars as I sing a lot of work
which is like the creator of elixir so
he's doing a lot of work with Erlang and
it's contributing a lot to Ireland and I
think the whole community is starting to
love we're starting to report bugs or
one more off and try to focus on or
trying to when we get a bug report try
to see if we can improve it in Erlang
first the thing we that we get or just a
to request try to do to see if it's good
to like move them to our lung so that we
can help everybody that relies on the
beam basically but in the end generality
I think it's a lot of collaboration
going on in the whole beam community I
don't maybe we're ritual they aren't
necessarily aware essentially
the library of functionality with using
in mixing principle can also leverage
everything that's available through
language yes yes yes definitely so
elixir is built just on top over long it
took the layer on top of ruin
so everything that I can do a lick sir
can do basically the same and it's kind
of true the other way around as well so
if you if you're right along the elites
your code you can use it from our line
provided you don't use a bunch of
features that are holy to your
particular like markers for example yeah
but everything else you can write the
library in elixir it will work from
Erlang as well whether you have the
elixir acquisition so I don't think with
you that open because you need the whole
elixir and kind of library and
everything to use it from Merlin but
everything compiled on to be important
so everything must be like talk to each
other at the end of the year yeah I mean
we probably can't really this morning he
talked there to his excitement around
in flowing in that direction with all
right so people in the airline's being
able to leverage what we do view in
place yes yes maybe that yeah I think
the I think I'm not sure on the personal
sure but I think that's not the story
would be wrapped in cue him out right
plug into the leak sir I think
interpreting cues reading an airline but
I mean the intuition I suppose those
fact want quite easy because it just
need to like write you can write
basically arrived in queue plugging in
elixir and I mean rabbinic she doesn't
care this is elixir or a long figure
that's going to be the same at the end
of the livers you know come down to the
same savings and maybe just to wrap up
is reading exciting the credit coming
down the pipeline the next couple months
or even you can you which for a lecture
there's a lot of exciting stuff because
we're focusing a lot of research so this
is the relief that we I'm not going to
some about this in my goal tomorrow but
the stuff that we're focusing the most
now
so this release has been mostly just
improvements like general improvements
in all shattering things but we're doing
a lot of research right now so we're we
have google Summer of Code going on so
we have two projects in google Summer of
Code going on now so there's there's
region researcher on that today is doing
research comes up I'm doing research on
some other stuff like covert testing a
la hospital quick check
the exciting time to we're focusing a
lot of likely improvement for the
language stuff that we're seeing that
across the language period again at
ecosystems well you know it's summer
what Chris is doing again some
stabilisation around the current
releases and then focus I'm really doing
yeah yeah well yeah yeah we're really
saying I think the community much you're
like a grill and curl like giving as a
mushroom like dense more mature and like
I would say I know we're realizing a lot
of stuffs I would say I yeah I will
people sometime realizing realizing the
little stuff realizing out to probably
do a little stuffing to me is the same
thing like we're we're getting very
familiar with a ecosystem we collect
functional stuff and we're plugging
research into that like existing
researching that I think we're finding a
lot of good ways
my gran Chris Chris built out could
before defeating filled out some of that
special gem district panels hi product
map was yes the cemetery Cecilia that
yes they are we
where you headed okay yes yes I didn't
happen they were very tomorrow yeah yeah
and tomorrow I can join it judgment
meaning India which to commute okay they
won't like their think about pretending
no worries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
