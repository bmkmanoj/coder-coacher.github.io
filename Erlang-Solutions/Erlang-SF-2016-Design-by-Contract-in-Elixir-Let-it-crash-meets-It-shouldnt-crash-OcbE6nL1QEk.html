to this talk I'm going to talk about
this I Bank contract in elixir where the
air lomotil let it crash meet it
shouldn't crash and we're going to see
how and why so um elbow sanchez and i
made this talk with a co-worker of mine
dear me we're on sadly he couldn't be
here today we both work at a company
name right this is trying to reinvent
the highway how the people commute and
we want to remove to remove 1 million
cars from the road by helping people
share its own vehicles through
carpooling meanwhile helping the
environment here right my junior
software engineer on we work on a daily
basis with elixir now so how did we get
here bugs and crashes we deal with them
every day and we try have a avoid having
to so who hasn't who has been on deal
worse situation I have and maybe
everyone here has in his defense he said
entirely ever happens but maybe he
missed an edge cage when he was testing
so did you know that they were release
pensive software errors like this one
the Mac nasa mars climate orbiter which
crash it is integrated within encounter
mars in a trajectory that brought it too
close to the planet why did this happen
the software put produce output in the
USA customary units and a pound seconds
instead of the emetic system units and
Newton's a Newton seconds and it wasn't
specified in the contract between the
NASA and lock it also the herald
terminal five opened opening it means it
miss place more than two hundred twenty
three thousand sorry
bags consult more than 500 flights and
made losses of 16 million pounds why
these because when two weeks before when
the opening and they were testing they
left their testing data in the database
and when they did they opening the
system couldn't handle and all these so
this track tragedy happened also the
Mariner 1 spacecraft shortly after that
rocket take her to cover it responder
improperly to some commands that were
living on on the ground why because of
amazing hyping so this missing hype and
costed 18.5 million dollars another want
the Morris worm that was greed and not
to cut damage but to measure the size of
the entry internet infected millions of
computers living also millinery losses
and the Knights error that costed five
440 million dollars and the story tells
that it was a man about an unmaintained
code base these wars code that haven't
hadn't been used for eight years and for
the purpose of this presentation we're
going to take the audience high flight
51 case and we're in 1996 half a
million's of our error caused the crash
of the maiden flight of the aryans five
flight launcher the rocket was reusing
working software from its predecessor
they are Ian's for but the it's fast and
engines exploited a book that what's not
found in these previous models so 36
seconds into its maiden launch it
crashed so what exactly happened the
software had tried to cram a 64-bit
integer
a number into a 16-bit space so in other
words the value that was converted was
rated that what can be represented in a
system did sign integral so they did it
didn't have an explicit exception
handler so it followed the usual fate of
an uncaught exception and the entire
software crash the onboard computers
crash also and hence the whole mission
crashed so this is a kind of attribute
attribute that we all are familiar with
but fortunately for us the consequences
are usually less expensive so after that
they did some research they wrote a post
morning about this and they they said
that they couldn't blame management
something clearly went to grant money in
this case the issue was technical they
also couldn't blame the language in the
used language which was ADA the section
mechanism was not not the best but in
this case not all conversions were
protected they also couldn't blame the
implementation what they did was they
remove some conversion protection to
achieve performance but this was
criticized but also the was justified by
theoretical analysis and they also
couldn't blame testing that when even if
you can test more you cannot ever chest
tall so what they really had to blame
was there reused specification itself it
was unacceptable in this case that sense
of any kind of precise specification
associated with these reusable model so
their requirement that the horizontal
bias should fit in a 16-bit was in fact
stated in an obscure part of the
document of the mission document body
was nowhere to be found in
code itself so to the InDesign my
contract we're going to start with a
little bit of theory and going to pause
the audience case here and also start
with a little bit of history so and
design by contract has its roots in work
and formal verification and formal
specification and horse logic it is a
formal system with a satchel a set of
logical rules for reasoning about
correctness of computer programs so or
describe the use of representation
invariants and abstraction functions to
prove correctness of astrid data types
this may not say a lot right now but
we're going to try to explain it a
little bit now so the basics of her
logic it is at the core of the deductive
approach of design Bank contract so the
central feature of horse logic is the
Horde triplet and this triplet describe
house day how the exit the execution of
a piece of code changes in state self
computation so in horse lipid is formed
by P and Q that are assertions and see
that is a command P is named a
precondition and Q a post condition and
the word the precondition it is met
after executing a common see it
establishes a post condition so this
whole logic is a really big set of rules
that provides actions and it's really
large but just for the purpose of this
talk we're going to stick with the
basics the basic triplet so there are
also rules for concurrency procedures
yums and pointers so you may want to
compare design by contract with with
testing but contracts as in daily life
erasers a set of specification that
covers mutual obligations
if it's and consistency constraints that
a software system has to meet and this
design by contract falls on their
implementation and design so for the
unit test we all know that they're used
to verify that the software works
correctly under certain example cases
and it's hard to detect all possible at
cases during development so in human
affairs what is this I by contract so
this is a little its trading contract
between an airline and a customer for
example for me to get from Barranquilla
to here to San Francisco I had the
obligation as a passenger to buy a nerd
an airplane ticket bring acceptable
baggage to the airport and be two hours
there before and my rights as a client
are to reach the destination and for the
airline's obligation and they had to
bring the passenger to its destination
and they have the right not to carry a
passenger who is late or that has
unacceptable baggage or that hasn't paid
the ticket so the obligations my
obligations as a client must ensure
preconditions my rights as a client may
benefit from both conditions and the
suppliers obligations must ensure post
conditions and the suppliers rights may
assume preconditions so for a structure
of a contract obligations in this case
are spread via preconditions and
postconditions a precondition is usually
a required class and these characterizes
their responsibility of the program that
calls the method and for the post
condition that is usually an insurer
clause it characterizes the
responsibility of the program that
implements the method so we have that if
the precondition is true when a method
is called and then the method we
terminate
returning to the calling program and the
post condition will be true when it does
return and also is there if the
precondition is not true when a method
is called and that method may do nothing
so here here we have an example in a
piece of code in an evil version it is a
routine call put of the class dictionary
dictionary where we have a value that
can be inserted in the dictionary and
will be retrievable through a key so we
can see here the required clause it is
introducing an input condition or a fair
condition and the insurer clause that
introduces an output condition or a post
condition both both of these conditions
are example of assertions or contract
clauses associated with software
elements here in the required class in
the precondition we have said that the
that count and is the current number of
elements and capacity is the maximum
number so at the beginning of the
program we need to make sure that these
that that this is true and for the
postcondition the insured clause has is
the boolean query which tells whether
certain element is present and I turn
returns the element associated with a
certain key so after executing some
commands we need to make sure that at
the end with we meet these rules too so
back in Ariana's case we have also a
piece of code in evil version we can see
sorry
okay we have added a required colors
before a piece of code and saying that
the horizontal bias is not should not be
ready done the maximal bias so does this
mean that the crash would have
automatically have been been avoided and
by having dimension use a language and
methods supporting building assertions
and the side Bank contract it is able
thing to say but maybe so how can all
these theory help and we as developers
sick for several things we're in we're
grinding programs one of them is quality
so that's why I really like this quote
and the other the other one is
reliability there are two things that we
can highlight from reliability one is
robustness and the other one is
correctness for robustness we have that
robot software acts acceptably in cases
in which it cannot do what it's supposed
to do and for correctness we have that
correct software does what it's supposed
to do and just that so for example if I
want to check my balance my balance of
my bank account online I should be able
to do so without incrementing or
reducing the or reducing my balance in
my bank account so there are several
advantages for using design by contract
one of them is assertions preconditions
and postconditions can be automatically
turn on during testing it all these
through a simple and compile compiler
options and errors might be cutting also
assertions can remain turn on during
execution triggering exceptions in
violated and assertions are prime
component of software and it's
automatically
documentation so for language support
there are several implementations of the
seven contract libraries for some
languages like PHP C C++ Ruby Java and
JavaScript and there are also several
language that have needed support for
design by contract like closed your
racket ADA or if you'll software this
thing I have given some examples in any
fourth version because when they were
writing these this evil language they
were the one the ones that started using
and coins they design by contract term
and in fact they are the ones that have
that habit they have the trademark of
this I Bank contract so how can we do we
can achieve something similar in a
league here for this with we have a
library that is in progress there is
work in progress for these side by
contracts in Alex here and we could be
able to do this week with the help of
meta programming in elixir matters so
there's here's the cover of the major
programming elixir and from grinning by
Chris McCourt who who gave an awesome
keynote and we can really recommend it
if you want to learn a lot more about
macros on how to use them you can come
to this to this book so for macros they
have a set of rules and one particular
rule the first rule of the macro system
is don't cry markers so you may hear
this rule lovely when talking to other
programming to other programmers about
meta programming remember that writing
code that writes code it can produce you
have to do it with special care
and macros also can be difficult to the
book and reason about and you have to
use it when you're sure that there is
cleaner clear advantage over using a
standard functions so for the second
rule of macros we have that use macros
virtuously so why would this the first
rule say that don't use macros and the
second rule say use them like they're
they're free so if you think about it
maybe the first the rule in in Fight
Club about not talking about Fight Club
was about learning how to break rules so
for these we have that after you've
learned how to use the macro system you
can you don't do don't have to be afraid
to use them and learn more about it and
also macros can be used to save time and
share functionality in a fun and
productive way so as I've been saying a
macro is cold the grad school it also
allows domain-specific language
abstractions and provides the freedom to
extend the language and many constructs
inner lips here are markers like they
have even less def model between others
and you may have seen them also if they
are used appropriately markers offer
effective model composition and code
generation generation techniques so the
elixir code runs at compile time and can
be used to manipulate the language AST
the majority of you may already know
what in what is an AST it is the
abstraction 6 syntax tree it's the
representation of code in its own data
structure so the building block of an
elixir program is a tube of three
elements where the first element
is an atom or another to pull in the
same representation the second element
is sorry a keyword a key released
containing meta data line numbers on
context and the third element of date of
these is your list of arguments for the
function call or an atom and when it is
an atom it means that the top 0
represents a variable so for building
the library we had we have to to take
advantage and use the quote macro so you
can get the representation of any
expression by using these this world so
here we have an example of the method
soon with the arguments 1 2 3 and when
we do quotes or it we get the AST and
you can get as i said you can get rid of
presentation of any expression by using
this the first element is the function
name the second element is the list of
meta data which continued meta data
which in this case is empty and the
third element is the argument list and
while quote is about retrieving the new
representation of some particular chunk
of code unquote is used is used to
inject some particular chunk of code
inside the representation we want to
retreat so in this example we have
number 13 and um we want to inject it in
the representation of the quote to at
the end get get it as a string as as in
the last line 11 plus 30 so
to design by contracts what we had to do
to build the library for elixir was a we
use these macros to extend the language
and add support for the design by
contract constructs we also talked early
existing functions with requires and in
short tags also and Mac the macros can
manipulate function body to insert
preconditions and postconditions inside
the functions so in the library you can
see this is an example on how on how the
contracts look in the library we've
built we have to do we have to really
find the diff close support the tags
require any shorts that are the pre and
post conditions and in the insurer close
you can see that we need the number to
be in a certain range so these you can
see that it's a little bit like pattern
matching so for the demo we and we want
to use the example of feeling attack on
how to properly feel attack so we have
this contract test and model and we
define the struct of a tank with you can
see there we also had to we have to pay
attention to the used costs and make it
know how to use the contract the
contract library and this is an example
of the well the definition of the field
method that it's going to fill the tank
and we have above it the required and
the insured clause for the required
Claus or the precondition we have that
at first the tank should be full they
involve should be opened and the
up both should be closed and for the
postcondition we need to ensure that at
the end d tank will be will be will be
full they involve should be closed and
the oddball should be close to and we
have a test for these and here we have
we're giving it a tank that has level 10
so the tank is already it's already full
and as tests are supposed to meet our
preconditions this is going to be a
failing test because we need an empty
tank or maybe have a half full tank to
first try to fill it and we also have a
definition of a function empty where we
have again the required class and the
short class above it and for the
recognition we require that they involve
is closed and the out bulb is opened and
we need to ensure that at the end and
the tank will be NT empty and the
involve will be closed the oval out both
we will be also closed so and here's the
command that it is inside the definition
of the NT function it says that for the
time to be closed it should be level 1
and for the time to be empty it should
be little one but we all know that for
you to be empty it it has to be a little
theorem so this is a failing command and
the test is going to fail here this is
the test for for the empty function
because it will need to assert that the
tank is is empty so
so
so here we have you tell me if you can
see it all the way in the back or maybe
I should we have the the contract test
model that I talk to you about the field
the fill method and the empty method the
method that I said that if a tank is
full or empty and we have here the two
tests that right now are failing because
of the reasons that I said before so
right now we are going to test the two
test run these tests and we can see that
they both of them are failing as I said
first the first one the field the field
test is failing and it says that the
precondition is not that and we have to
blame the client because it is using it
they're wrong way so if we change here
that at first the tank should not be
already full but three but in level five
and we run the test again
we can see that their first set is not
failing anymore and for the second test
in the empty function we have that the
post condition has not been met so you
have to blame yourself because you are
doing something in the code that is not
right and that the the post condition is
telling you to do something but it's not
but you're not doing it that way so for
this we change this line of code saying
that at the end of of this function the
tank is not it's not going to be level 1
anymore but level 0 and when we run it
again we can see that now the two tests
are passing
so yeah so this is still a work in
progress library and you can find it it
in in this repo it likes hereby
contracts and we are right now at right
we're going to try using use it for the
programs that we have and right now in
elixir to see how it goes and we have
also list of further work that we want
to do with this library so I add as I
said at first you should be able to
generate test cases from these contracts
also at the configuration options to
turn off on and off the contracts in
development and production environments
also we need to make this generate an
automated documentation from these
contracts and generate quick chest tests
so to conclude and we have that design
by contract does not replace regular
testing art is an strategies it
contracts add an extra grade of
reliability and it's not a silver bullet
rather it complements the external
testing with internal self tests that
can be activated both for for isolated
test and in production in production and
code during some tests face so these are
the reference we use the aryans case
decide by contract history if you want
to know a little bit more about horse
logic decide Bank contract are the
examples in being evil versions and
thank you very much
