starcraft and i'm going to share our
experience in building automotive an
existing our mom stop just small hello
from our Michael Department a little
color smokers I think everybody knows
what this is about you know you'll have
it behind your laptop off so not
surprisingly what about this one copy an
idea at least I what is transformed
another tooth under par with you this
one is what if I used to all stories you
know it will produce forward West Point
water it will boot pump motor back by
constantly power actually kind of all
technology everybody should know but
what about this one and nobody here for
missing tradition and spy the fact that
everybody in turn on lights use that of
charges nobody here bottles of all the
things and I will talk about it in a bit
later now we have for health consumers
will have transformers and we'll have
razors so I can all change that allow
you to have nice down on your computer's
all this it is a mist in the moment and
that is this fancy epic spot the
exchange is allowed to try to power like
unbelievably but we could do it where is
the market and is quite and business
around it and we are the Congress
photographed we're located produced side
and on break right is power south to the
concerns starcraft ii the norwegian
company it would know who have interests
all over the world and majority of
course it's norway and joining the
biggest Oh mark in Europe and the way
our Instagram Joan IAM as possible for
our conventional generation
of 206 gigawatt and although we have a
portfolio that is hot topic these days
then join a so-called digital power
plant that allow us to see you on as we
end up deciding the factor the biggest
power plant in German with a 750
megawatts of st so some most about power
market versus it's released but nobody
heard about it first of all the
difference between power working the
whole our market like stocks fair i
think is physical video what're your
power produced have to give you and have
to because you you know in contrary to
those talks you can't store the pub you
what produced happy to consume and
sister have two belts always and the net
export is a marketplace where producers
news consumer and blue portrayed Germany
route two major things happen of the
market those two are you stay ahead
auction that happened each day 12 o
clock and yourself power or next day
delivery and continue straining when you
put adjust your position so normally
intraday you could trade this hourly
product say from 73 believe a bar right
event I would rate water point will do
blocks it's a lot mostly but it is all
right now everybody traded and how old
or would look for the producer side will
have price the tower costs and we plan
our product so it over the ramp up over
here try to view the pickles and price
price and I'm da música everson perfect
resolve their head could go for Muslims
infrared a market stuff what we could do
a price goes down somewhere we could buy
back our Empower production so save
money and optimized on power plants so
far any question ok
now about all those system when we start
doing it your source idea to take our
long and we connect quite some tools
that and are very useful I look like
that because I change use it by
communicate also why you're a bar and
these are the people who contribute to
these putos myself for what and how old
their system lacks we have a changing
let's have two independent data centers
went into the file and communication to
them and the way are here collect one of
them center the order sushi dinner you
want i'll have to automatically connect
another one this is a kind of
requirements of the change and we was
first introduced it was not so complex
dude oh yeah you exhibit of her so when
you start doing the system it was cool
to you so long because you have each
thought the parietal process do simple
things it would be need to start to some
simple sent and brought a little bit
improved a little bit improve and so on
also an end up having the seat of the
toy who thinks the fattiness they have
system fine tune it and shoot its way
and because they're gonna try to the
whole system where should be sure that
is really rely and we don't blow home
blow up mine so we stopped simple things
first task was to connect with the
changes in some data simple stupid we
create small web interface had given it
the better you what was in my people see
different contracts the trade delivery
because price predator two separate ones
these kind of messages to my JD was the
issue the system up in white panties it
was we use for quite some time Dustin
firm action Purple's cut a little bit
and make things that we are sure that
our communication part will they change
a stable because some time to change
kadhal result they do some maintenance
and system was minus total water
collectively changed we also have
prepared as long as we have power in our
computers we have hacked yourself what
happened six in this kayak when it's a
change exchange appeared is connect
automatically so no weight is required
from walsall it's really fast so then we
start expect all system so it has a core
part that's important indication then we
will build up our web interface October
built up Ricola the idea was to record
all the way that people of exchange and
then Aggie was we could reply to erase
our strategies and compact esta
strategies it happened that we never use
it to engine and to be truly better your
finest Bank times more time on most
things it's nice option but promotion
then we'll build up our post into the
dress and some statistics model you know
to regulate what they do and control
them then this is how our court system
looks like we'll have supervisor exam
and buggy so is this portal for
connection to the change broadcast so is
it broadcast med for each of the parties
so this is standard pod handle contracts
public release all trades on trace or
two booths and recorded was intended to
repeat red trevisan then make cement to
record collector the dude cause a change
use cement / execute protocol we have to
carry all the sex and mentos not workers
in LA and busters okay awesome
what edition one we will test tonight to
be to get access to the change that we
recodified we find out the contest
exchange at least we receive mental
messages nobody thought was why were
they but it was there and what happened
and you expect were several message ok
our since it perfect support now i will
propagate the rest almost a suppression
and they start simple and efficient I
like customer no problems or for my side
well then people from a change cause
decay you know we don't bite it connects
issues be alive they're not allowed to
reconnect okay but it's much more simple
okay wit okay so I'd either play like
you so choose a wider drift probably was
where was a real kind of different
system towards in use for some time for
us one happy builders okay fortunately
will sell for her life it was quite
simple we just add one or supervisor
supervisor Olympics Christ it don't
procreate don't propagate we don't care
so we have our connection alive if other
part is correct somewhere senior if they
start north ave the connection and what
yours few lines of code to change and we
are really impressive really really good
so all the time time is those who
strikes take in our system and up and up
balls to do something useful fire across
the ocean to be careful with wires user
confirmation whatever happens will
change if both things we'd have to make
train professor message pop up and you
don't have to control right no way they
are not really but if you have some
confirm substituting in our system the
problem here that normally is poppin
bottles and begins full screen yo models
here Barca's hear us lot of time so we
have to spill it up and we still want to
have the manual control what I'm going
to do we'll find those practices
it's nice sort of fun people create
pressure like crazy and was really split
up and then we're ready to go for the
full of the main mode as always seem to
have to remember nice nada why you
should know it wasn't healed knight
capital to have a bucket this software
and done for Californians I think nobody
want to be a dick next so what we did
we'll have our coolest over a lot if
you've major idea to supervise the boss
and if they hit the head just kill them
popular the world water stuff it will
become a better or just block it
completely so it's not your stuff
anymore and now move how those things
work em são Paulo chains receive
message is there somebody put a new
order all the propagator of broadcast
over as i propagate to the subscribers
one knows who their but not going to
statistics let both based on then taken
are going to use decide whatever x what
to do and sign it to the Super Overlord
not have to decide is it okay or not
okay to go with a soda all super what
requires the statistics that kind of
keep track of what what is doing how's
the hey what is profit and loss while
partition to create a song and my
decision go on up the wall or we go by
plugging server backup change done looks
perfect unfortunately why it's not so
simple yeah let's take a closer look if
you have this particle instead of a wood
wanted people go to buy 50 megawatt
you're the best of a 2000 m or f if
there are these are all of the right of
the market and now both sales you want
to sell 10 or attending about 20 or the
question should do it
Joe has picking looks like a broth with
you but there anything we shouldn't do
it and the reason is it's our own B's
and if we start training with ourselves
it will be blamed for Mark new page not
accept great change so we have to tell
our system when we check what what is
doing was have to check on our own
private of the book and this thing that
you try to figure out only when you
develop things are going to cost
involved up front you just do something
try and then you figure out that you
could happen so now system no place is
open we are see private dollars message
exchange and they propagate overall the
book and everything looks perfect and
shine now unfortunately also not so easy
when we design system will have kind of
teaching wine yeah the twelfth I just 30
friends nicely renovated all the time
yeah would you see changes contest from
a gay parade this is mine as type of the
system to find any time I kind of have a
background or dildo with databases and
misconduct you always know a state of
the system is fixed what reality is
different you know never sure what is
there I never should way to receive
message from the change never show how
to the process what titles have where
who received message when what so we
have to turn our system one more time
and what we did we start doing checking
product of the books that will have
action and on top of stark alone right
so what we are doing we the factor
updates on what estates basis our
estimates we say woody percent order to
the market I help you desire despite the
fact that we don't get it yet you know
it could take some time deliver it has
to be there so we put there so what I
want to do checks we know that are
already there
and now in order arrives we'll just
cancel action that we artificially
introduced and have the now
state-controlled wise mark so it could
be a little tricky because in reality we
don't know the real estate market would
be already already executed could be not
come on it's our best estimates and it's
really hard to change your mind to start
thinking about what about what the state
because it's not know but what it would
have to be or could be you know your
kind of favor projection on the state
isn't working so now we're done and they
you could figure out this looks more
complicated it wasn't beginning you know
but fortunately is kind of okay so some
less the loans first of all yeah along
to school another present then you
should lock Arison the most of the time
I spent now I just went into the read in
my log files and because to understand
what happened what happened and the room
was wrong when I asked good test in the
system I just miss pelted by itself side
you know in st. Olaf attention test a
changing role from the referee and
because the kind of Pacifica support was
into the market it started it all oldest
continuously and a few seconds I builds
a huge position in this and probably
don't know what to do they'll know where
to run why it is what to turn Bob you
know in just hope it will never have any
production work mark Everson does it's
never then next lesson that automated
mode is not very fast manual mode the
problem like example is it changes in
private other books and public
Horrible's never happened when we
confirm anyway because time that user
need to press the button and send all of
the signal which much much bigger the
time they actually changed to either
start do the fully automated mode then
part of the event was processed for
writing by the system and path will
still not
by the change so we immediately were
situation we don't know the state of the
mind well it's too fast and we start
regular our own events with direct
partial so with this introduction of
this artificial verification or the
public order books you know a good kind
of slow down not slow down what kind of
change the system to understand what is
should be yeah dependency school sees
people desire of software Savior force
is a problem next update don't have
experience when they pull a the changes
and stop what it was all system I don't
know why so we just fix it to some very
special and use it to love ya tested and
tested by the way let's go alive in the
way if it's really fast and a real one
in voltage should be really sure what
you do it and don't forget exclaims ah
yes it's not a little more because
despite the fact that a change providers
that's a shame we accelerate some older
school and so it's not what happened
relegated in ready to your attention
some a more parties when les parties fun
dragging more actively so you should be
always keep eye on your system you know
and assure that you could turn it off if
required yeah like i mentioned begins we
start thinking about food especially
like record in all states and then make
a player to replay it give a strategy a
lot of forceful spender and we don't use
it so whether or not he'll just do
things that we needed that make evolving
to make money as fast as possible from
other point of view you need some things
you know if you since the not flexible
enough you're stuck and have to write
probably ever
from strategy so you should find it real
bad and last not least the performance
it was a big issue for us as beginning
but looks like nowadays we have to take
more and more new honey and the window
starts talking about perform
measurements I look around little twat
full of tools for one point I kept
simple 120 use timer and as a moment I'm
not sure that every right but I use this
approach I have a personal feeling that
these all the tools you are designed to
show what I what has happened as a model
system we are current law of graphs to
but for me it uses the I it's too fast
tala say you could do it next morning my
name is asked often log files that are
sticking about it so what I really need
and what is really useless assistant
allow me to analyze I don't need fancy
graph so not any analysis to understand
what happened why it happened what has
to be changed yeah it slows the best
approach for the yeah so maybe it's our
company some ideas and last at least
performance I figure out that some
course they take this type in the heat
Israel did what does that okay here kind
of most acceptable but what this and to
be true I still don't know how to figure
out why is the way so held it and where
to look for so if somebody who's help me
please so any question
maybe good question but what do you
think about switching from analyzing
clocks to end up using something like
data don't define some KPIs we should
trace as defined when triggered other
instead of you know watching for tons of
logs after when you it is already too
late I mean in your case okay Allah is
okay so the problem okay haven't got 16
work twenty percent you know so if your
school just goofin alarms and also
joseph alongside way we'd like to know
what happened before what was later yeah
you really have to understand what was
in the pocket because could be that a
lot of photos goes forces market and
they change kind of processing them
called delay could be so modest and if
you just have this a lot of okay
something or open this part of time I'm
afraid you don't have enough information
hey what's your transaction sorry your
transaction actually it's not so high
because they actually power change it's
not in kind of a range of stock market
so odd because the total I think 10 or
20 a savage with right loud around for
gigawatt photos- power for 24 hours so
enjoy it just 200 participants for
tomorrow so the transactional engines
draw a sink on your system maybe two
more on the market so the rest it done
by people mainly so it's not something
transactions and because it's also
financial or sorry physical market and
on the speedy delivery you just straight
when you have to adjust position for
example we do eight and a lot of
production when the mall and enjoying it
you to wind and you have to buy a cell
phone to be balanced so it's not like
the financial market I just continues to
us orders
hey wall all right then thank your watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
