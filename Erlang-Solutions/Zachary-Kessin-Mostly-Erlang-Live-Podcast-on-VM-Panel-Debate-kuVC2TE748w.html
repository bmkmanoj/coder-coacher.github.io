right or people and it's zach who's in
charge here all right hello and welcome
to episode number 40 of the mostly
online podcast and yes if you've been
following the feed you'll notice that
there's a missing one in there it's
because episode 39 has been recorded but
not edited yet it takes me there's a
certain long time there so but welcome
to mostly relaying live thank you
everybody for coming if you have
questions Robert will have a microphone
or you can tweet them hashtag mostly
relying live and we'll catch them up
here because the most efficient way to
get information from you over there to
us up here is via twitter surfer in
California all right so we have a panel
we have Costas why don't you start just
good on the airplane and everybody
introduce yourself so I'm Costas ago
knows I'm involved in erlang for the
last 15 years in ocala university mostly
leading the hype team and then doing a
lot of changes also at the runtime
system but also building tools around
their way I'm Eric's tenma and I've been
doing our lines in 94-95 wrote the first
native code compiler for everyone and
now I have a microphone and I've been
doing a like since then working with
clora and now i'm working for my own
company happy hacking and writing a book
about the airline virtual machine okay
i'm patrick nibblin i'm a former member
of the beating so I've worked with a
virtual machine for like 16 years and
now I've jumped ship so I work at Google
you want work at Google
for google my name is Lucas Larsen I
work currently at the Allen solutions
I've been a consultant that the OTP team
doing virtual machine stuff for four
years now five years something like this
so all right so where our goal today is
to talk about the virtual dr like
virtual machine and so let's start with
what is just sort of the basics of what
is a virtual machine and why would we
want one some people don't know any you
know subscribe for somebody who doesn't
who's never heard the words virtual
machine before what is it why is it a
good thing or a bad thing you want a
virtual machine in order to have the
same software run on different hardware
without having to recompile it for
instance having the same characteristics
in order to make your system run on
Windows Linux PowerPC x86 etc on the
same thing then you build a virtual
machine that abstracts away the
different hardware and operating systems
and runs in the same way on its
different so I'm assuming everyone here
you know of course knows what a virtual
machine is I just want to put that in
for completeness so of course in
addition to the airline virtual machine
we there are lots of other ones out
there java and.net if you're my age you
might remember the UCSD p-code pascal
virtual machine which is electrically
relevant to anything I just thought I'd
mention it and make myself look old um
so but compared to you know other main
street you know current virtual machines
that you know our in serve the
mainstream I think the two obvious ones
are Java and in the jaw dot net CLR so
how is the early virtual machine
different what makes you know what
design decisions drove that over first
of all though I guess window ever
weather watch machine was developed none
of the other once existed yes true so
that's one of the reasons why you have
to build one it also has a different
mindset with concurrency and all that so
as of a specialized machine working with
having separate concurrent entities
running next to each other the
processors rather than having the
sequential way of running code that zero
or the
that JVM works so having a different one
there but I guess may mostly it's
because it didn't exist any other ones
and most of the virtual machines are
targeted to the language that they're
compiled from so make sense that oh this
pressure one although although at this
point of course all three does virtually
mentioned now we're in many languages
each there are there are more languages
that you can count at the JVM there at
least a bunch on that and clr and there
are there are a bunch on the other line
beam Robert over there I think wrote
about half of them for some reason it's
easier to implement language on top on
virtual machines don't implement virtual
machines themselves so tend to be a lot
of languages on a virtual machine that
makes sense so all right Cara but I
think you have to separate two different
things so there there is one on the one
hand you have the virtual machine design
which is the instruction set that the
class and the runtime system that
supports this instruction set and then
you have all the engineering work that
goes into the implementation of the
virtual machine and I think there are a
lot of languages these days that targets
say the JVM not because the JVM is the
most appropriate virtual machine for
that language but because there is a
tremendous engineering effort that has
happened over the years so they try to
take advantage of that of that work as
opposed to trying to take advantage of a
virtual machine that is suited to the
needs of the particular language right i
mean the the big advantage the JVM is
that there's been a huge amount amount
of money spent on engineering it and
there's a huge amount of experience with
like operations people who know how to
how to deploy it you tell an ops guy oh
this is a java thing they probably know
what to do with it yes so the lucas is
absolutely right of course that when air
line started this
kinds of machines were not around and
even if they where they weren't mature
enough to but even if we have to do the
choice today engineering issues aside I
mean like I don't think that the JVM is
the particular goodland is a particular
good target for a language like Berlin I
mean most of the work that airline does
is either elite concurrency or to the
compilation of pattern matching and I
don't think that none of I think that
none of these things are particularly
well implemented or well suited for the
JVM well I mean the JVM you in terms of
concurrency basically uses OS threads
which are two for the type of
concurrency Erlang is doing are much too
coarse granularity for most things you
know we like the fact that inner lying
process takes what a kilobyte of memory
what do you mean you could also
implement all the stuff that's
implemented in C in the current language
machine to implement that in Java with
having always threads migrating jobs in
between the different parts and then
getting that but you still wouldn't get
all the way because you have these
garbage collection forces that end up
all in different parts and you also
don't get access to the operating system
in sa way so you couldn't optimize
certain part you don't get the same
freedom and also you're dependent on
people in the JVM development team doing
stuffs a building a virtual machine on a
virtual machine which is kind of yeah
turtles all the way down yeah I mean in
the level of it's kind of silly I've
heard somebody implemented a version of
the JVM that you can run in JavaScript
and there's a version of Java you can
write in the JVM so you could in theory
won't run JavaScript in the JVM
implemented in JavaScript really you
know although at a certain level that
I'm pretty sure I'd what passed it there
it just gets silly version up to beam
virtual machine implemented in
JavaScript so you can run it in your
browser others yeah
dude autozone or and there's one written
in the JVM too and you can run
JavaScript and outline so yeah so anyway
from the audience have any questions
about the virtual machine you know what
what question about the about the beam
have you always wanted to know Robert
has a microphone this gentleman right
here so one thing I've always thought
about implementing is basically I don't
like chocolate that much so I don't want
to program for android so why don't we
have an airline phone and what we would
be needed to basically implement
everything and early instead on the
phone for instance processes or users
and acls and stuff like that I think the
guy from google it do you have any idea
what words it is to implement
anniversary phone actually there is
support overland for android I think
yeah yeah yeah I mean you if you want
try it you can probably promise a
melding on Android sorry I mean yeah
could it you know I sex questions of
could you do it sure but the amount of
engineering work for the benefit you'd
get you know the fact is I might not
want to write half the apps on my phone
in Java and I have an android phone but
the fact of the matter is somebody
already wrote them I don't need to write
a dialer app from my phone there is one
I don't need to write if you know this
app or that app it already is there so
you know if you were to try to
re-engineer the whole thing from scratch
and her lying would that be
theoretically possible yeah I guess so
but again it would cost you a lot of
money and absence some really good
business case to do so why would you do
so one of the good things that I find
with object orientation is doing window
stuff doing graphic stuff that's one of
the few times that I like
like okay let's do some java swing stuff
that's when i do want to do some of you
from graphical stuff and that's a lot of
the things you do on the phone is
related to that I mean I honestly think
that's much on a phone but I get
building a desktop app for the mac or
whatever windows whatever you prefer if
you could do that in our lying and halfs
every widget on the screen be a separate
or lying process that'd be really cool
but in order to build that toolkit you'd
probably spend a couple million you know
get some engineers to spend a couple
million dollars and I don't know about
any of you but I don't have a couple
million dollars to spend and if I did
I'm not trust what I'd spend it on you
know somebody wrote it I'd attempted to
use I might use it but you know until
that happens I'm like I'm not gonna
worry about it similarly bash oh you
know yes they're an erlang shop but the
full text search and ry'ac is solar
which is written in java because well it
already existed you know there's some
level of well if we already have this in
java is there any particular value in
writing are lying beyond we like Erlang
you know it's a silly way to silly
reason to spend a few million dollars
all right anybody else have a question I
see a lack of hands out there all right
so what's the next thing we should know
about the beam how so happening actually
how big is an airline process I mean how
many bytes of memory does an early
process take up these days before you do
anything interest to spawn with you know
small and sleep or something could it be
233 words of heap plus the process
control block which might be I don't
know another 60 x is 60 words maybe
something like so about 300 words of
memory so so pretty small or UNIX
process is what about a Meg maybe I
don't know actually but with the threads
one thread is usually ask what for case
of stack so something like that sounds
right yeah
I see you're all tweeting really heavily
my folks ask some questions we're being
in try to be interactive here this is an
experiment okay so we basically and how
many machine instructions does it take
roughly to switch from one process the
other oh I realize it probably gonna be
some one implementation that's so
depends infinitely yeah a stack of yay
high hey no idea it's so I mean the word
it the virtual machine does so much more
than just scheduling processors right so
what else does it do well keeping the
what is it keeping track of timers doing
delayed kind of work that's in the
virtual machine so for instance when
you're allocating stuff you're sending
messages back to original scheduler to
say that there you need to deallocate
this and it does can't remember but
there's about a list of 10 15 of these
different tasks that it does and then
schedules garbage collection jobs for
different processes on the different
things so it's a lot it does a lot of
stuff and Road checks for checking for
i/o is another big thing that it does
like seeing if anything is coming on the
socket at the same time so just
switching between the two different
processes if you weren't to disregard
that would basically be copying out of
the X registers and I'm copying off the
X registers and updating a point pointer
to the stack but I mean normally you do
a lot of other works in between there to
do other stuff because I was at a
conference to tell the VDL the day I met
with a no Jas fanboy and I was ready to
20m the advantage of her lying and and I
basically said look you know the issue
that nodejs didn't realize they were
supposed to solve is that for what they
were trying to do the concurrency model
of the universe standard unix OS is
broken this process these are too large
and you know said in early its moniker
lying or haskell you solve that problem
and you can still have you can still
have let us get the scheduler do some
some of the work and you off do it
yourself and he was like but but
walking and you're looking is bad um
totally failed to figure out you know
understand what I was trying to get at
yeah I mean I don't I wasn't that Eric's
talk before but I mean most of the stuff
when we talking about long jobbing
long-running jobs and these things that
we're using the wake up in to fill flag
and so on that's because of blocking
blocking is a problem blocking you know
what level are we blocking out here
within your line the whole scheduler is
kind of built on the fact that you come
up come around to a steady-state
eventually so that when you run for a
certain amount of time and then you come
back to the same entry point all over
the time but if you're for some reason
calling some kind of black hole where
you don't know how long time is going to
take you will never return to that you
might not return to that state at the
same time and then you get problems so
when you say this you know when you see
that it's like you know I write some
code that's you know just some so many
reductions then stops right stops only
code and goes runs some other processes
and comes back to me later and I mean as
long as you write pure outline code you
don't have a problem it's when you go
into the black hole let's see or
whatever you're calling out to that's
when you get the proper eyes so when you
write as an if and see that that messes
with the scheduler yep now so what's the
best advice for writing it's beyond let
me simply hold it so don't know so why I
mean I keep your home talk about nifs so
why would you write but why do you I do
people write nifs well not really I mean
you had to call the operating system
sometimes and we haven't like made
everything into the virtual machine that
you may possibly need so you have this
fantastic library that does funky stuff
and you want to call it so the of course
you need to call other languages what
you need to do that from from any
language so that's one thing and then
performance interpret our virtual
machine code can't possibly be as fast
as much real machine code except if you
have compile it into the green machine
code so i think people are using leafs
for good reasons and for bad reasons so
there are the good results for using
nifs is if you already have an available
library that is exactly what you want
and this library has been debugged over
years and it's well tested and
everything and then you don't want to
reinvent the wheel and you use this
library this is the good reason to write
an if the bad reason to write an if is
because you think even before you
measure that your application in Erlang
will not be efficient will not scale to
the level that you would like to do and
you start writing in if and most of the
cases you will end up with a program
that has worst performance than you then
what you would get if you write the
straightforward airline code you
compiled it you measured it you did any
optimization at the algorithmic level
first then you possibly compile to
native code and you measured and only if
that thing didn't give you the word
performance that you really need then
you can you know start thinking whether
it's worthwhile to investment if but
even in the case where you you're good
case there are other ways to interface
you see code you might know that you
have a talk about it yes so going for an
if shouldn't be your first option when
interfacing to see code yes matter but I
mean as long as the NIF is perfectly
written a good leap there's no place to
know my secret there's no harm in
writing next yeah I mean if you have
long running jobs put it on another
thread if you have short running jobs be
sure to pump reductions
be nice and don't run forever or more
than a millisecond that's not like
impossible to do so I mean it's not it's
not that people i mean the easiest way
to avoid problems with nifs is of course
not to write them if you really need to
and for the good reasons be sure to
write them in a good way so and then the
problem is gone when it comes to news I
will I will admit I can say to claim
that I've written nobuggy C code in the
last 10 years of course I've it or any
other hand on either so what I haven't
written any she killed in the last
decade probably about longer than that
so you know books and see never happens
yeah yeah I'm talking about the design
if you've never seen the talk 50 and 50
by guy Steele and no the other one was
there the there was a bit about see
which is it not really safe but we can
debug anything so a little bit of
silliness there now also people have
implemented obviously a lot of other
languages on the beam you know what are
some of the reasons you might want to do
that beyond the obvious one of
interacting with our line well our
vacuum machine yes the vacuum machine
the beam is really good at concurrency
and Martin as we said earlier I mean the
JVM is good at a lot of things but not
that kind of that like scale of
concurrency that lean can do and I know
or no virtual machine except from being
they can do that so if you want an actor
language you probably would like to
implement it on top of me I would if you
if you're interested me of those the
robbery points the LFE meet up okay yes
I said yeah there's an LFA meet up after
this coming exactly which room it is LF
e stands for let's play with a line
right so if it's for us who love
parentheses but we want to ride on a
real
a real machine that's it yes and I can
just say yes of course that's why that's
why i use the beam because you want
these features that's it and any other
questions from the audience person over
there on the far side I can't actually
see who you are so my question is them
how much the design of the virtual
machine is influenced by other virtual
machines so that is heaven often that
they put a new feature into the JVM and
the air long team says well it's cool we
edition that's never happened yeah I
there two problems with that first of
all you have to have a feature the JVM
sub you'll hit go wow that's cool and
that doesn't happen very often and
second of all for my from my outsider's
point of view it seems like the beam
team is in a very good way extremely
conservative about what they put in what
you guys say that this good state a true
statement yeah well it depends on where
you're putting this stuff in those areas
where we can play around a lot in those
areas where we have to be rock solid and
do different parts but going from where
we draw inspiration I can't speak for
everybody but me personally I don't look
that much of the JVM because it's kind
of close source and you can't look at it
actually but there's a loo
implementation that I I at least draw
some inspiration from when looking for
new strange ideas about how to do stuff
as likely to do budget 2 point 0 or
something like that scope has some very
nice interesting ideas and then but
that's like when you're executing
looking for ideas about how to execute
sequential code because there we can
grow our layers from different areas but
when you're doing parallel code its kind
of nobody else usually do the stuff that
we do and it kind of depends on what
you're looking for if you're looking for
you
for example like there is really in
parenting the guillotine you saying
judge it isn't just in time compilat not
yet is in the version control system
just a clerestory if you're looking for
a just-in-time compiler you probably
will look at lure and but if you're
looking for something like maps you
might look at like Python yeah and if
you're looking for transactional memory
you would look at those who I mean you
look at languages sometimes you look at
virtual machines sometimes I mean the
only thing I that comes to mind that we
took from Java or was inspired by Java
is the back-trace the line numbers in
the batteries we like I like that
feature yeah why didn't you know Java
invented it it now seems it was just
that we I had some students that had ran
java and then they ran a lang and they
asked me where are the line numbers in
the back trace and then i went to be on
and said where are the line number all
right robert gentleman over here so
before that I think you don't need for
historical reasons the the beam is very
heavily influenced by the one so it's
it's sort of started by doing a lot of
things that the one had so this x and y
register for example it's not by very
very this there is a machine there is an
abstract machine called Warren's
abstract machine which is what is used
for prologue implementation and the
whole design of some of a subset of the
instruction set of the beam is very
heavily influenced by the one so in that
sense it's it follows a tradition of
so-called register-based virtual
machines which differ from
more commonly used stack based machines
like the JVM so there are there have
been influences in the past and as
patrick said of course nowadays that the
language is evolving by saying not
nowadays but adding say bitstreams there
has been a lot a whole lot of changes
when this bit streams were added and
these days are maps are added they're
having a lot of changes and influences
from implementations of map type like
data structures over there and I'll be
interested to know and the importance of
immutability two to beam as clearly it's
possible to create an actor program
where the actors themselves use mutable
variables internally so how important is
the fact that Erlang and therefore beam
doesn't provide any ability to its
implementation well for the garbage
collector is very important for example
for that's what you ask for the actual
implementation of the Virgin machine if
the image would ideally i guess i guess
the follow-up to that is what would you
lose hypothetically speaking if if it
wasn't immutable at that level well you
had to reimplement the garbage collector
of course and you could create like
circular structures you could do a lot
of unpleasant stuff if you had
mutability and besides a language with
immutable deserve also I would imagine
it can cause us if you had mutability
would it make something like dialyzer
much harder to write no no no but I
guess has struggled to believe that it's
just the garbage collector I think they
must want more to it than that and also
the fact that you know if you have
closed if you're using a closure you're
sending it to another process protected
it's immutable you know there's a whole
class of bugs that by making things
immutable just go away because if you
have if you they're all sorts of bugs
were all been sharing a mutable state if
you don't have mutable state you can't
share it
and therefore all those bugs simply
can't happen sort of like the fact that
or like me on Erlang automatically does
big integers and you can make integers
as big as you know you want modulo your
memory so you know all the bugs that
were sent you know integer overflow is
just aren't there sure I mean I
appreciate the value of immutability at
the application level I guess what I'm
interested in is the weather or not
immutability the fact that I lang as an
immutable language gives benefits to you
the the vm designers which the vm
designers of for example the JVM don't
have because they have to support
beautiful languages yeah under the
surface it's not really immutable all
the way as well because there is some
sheeting tricks that are done with
records and so on where we can figure
out that okay so we're destructively
updating fields in a record and there's
also the binaries that are being
appended to so there's a bit of
immutability going on behind the scenes
as well and there but it gets just the
garbage collection making I mean having
mute immutability means that we can
garbage collector process much easier
otherwise you I mean you would have to
send these cyclic structures to another
process copy the entire data over there
either way and then in order to the
garbage collection side yeah it's no so
first of all they are too kind two
totally different levels of talking
about mutability virtually debate there
is the level of the language and there
is the level of a virtual machine I
think the most important one is the
level of the language there are you know
clear benefits on having a language
where you don't have a mutability
operator you can you know you can reason
about your programs then of course the
fact that you have such a language
allows you to take advantage in the
implementation of the virtual machine
and do some things like for example
having a faster garbage
lector because you don't have to keep
things amongst a generations when you
use a generational collector but I think
that's the detail the most important
thing is that you don't have mutability
in the language and as look at says said
just now in the in the level of the
virtual machine there are cases where
there is mutability happening it's just
that these are not visible to the
programmer because you don't have
mutability at the language level any
other questions Germany the plaid shirt
okay i am a question about history i
like that for the jvm in the beginning
there were ideas but running it in a
special purpose hardware so was there
ever any ideas like that for the beam
yeah they were anybody ever done it now
well not for the beam but for our long
as such there was Drew has been tries to
do a special processor for Alan I
remember back in the 80s there were some
machines that were specifically designed
to run Lisp yeah like on the same lines
there were ideas that are that I'd there
is dr linens n which is now called Ling
has been open sourced we get a podcast
with have a while back I'm not entirely
clear what the part what the best use
case for that is and I think the ones
they presented were kind of silly but
but I'm pretty sure there are some cool
use cases for it I just not sure what
they are yet so what
right but it's yeah you're basically you
know the thing is if you look at the
standard Linux or Mac you know or or you
know his mac of my mac or windows
whatever you know you have and you want
to run erlang on it and you know and I'm
obvious leaving a development doing
development you know you want your
editor and stuff it's different but if
you know in production you've got you
know linux you know red hat red hat or
whatever but do whatever your favorite
linux is you got Erlang on it even
though all the other UNIX II stuff that
may or may not be of actual benefit to
your with the application you're trying
to run is you know which so the idea of
sort of getting rid of most that seems
to make sense in their various efforts
to do that including the Oerlikon
gentling thing that has been mentioned
but that's you know subject for another
day and actually have a couple people up
trying to hit on the podcast in the
future who will hopefully talk about
various projects in that direction I
want Robert how much time do we have
left I think it was it six look look see
when are we supposed to end okay so any
more questions let's have one last
question late into the joke and we tag
you for a last comment got a question
you thought we have so we get a question
over here okay and I'm wondering if you
had a chance the free hands to do and
they change any designer station in the
airline vm that you could change what
would we be then we would have change it
already I mean I taught it to run on v8
with node kidding by the way I don't
Matt I'm not a stick what mmhmm yeah I
think the change I would make how much
of this is a vm issue and if you is the
idea that you know when you're reloading
code you could have more than two
versions of the module
you know now that we have machines with
gigabytes of memory I don't that would
be how hard that would be the implements
probably change how integers and floats
are sorted yeah yeah that's it very
framing me yeah the things we cannot
change because of backwards
compatibility there are a lot of so many
different small corner errors like how
port signaling interacts with processing
nothing and so on it the nitty gritty
details of those things and yeah yeah so
of course you know implementers love
doing changes and doing improvements to
machines I mean and there is not just a
single thing that can be improved or in
bin this is true for all abstract
machines wherever you look at there will
be always mirror millions of things that
you have to change but one particular
favorite of mine is something that we
have an almost working version and will
hopefully appear in a in an OTP version
relatively soon I hope is a sharing
preserving copying implementation what
does that mean for us 9 9pm so whenever
messages are sent when ever Rose
whenever there is a term that is being
communicated somewhere outside its
process be that sent us a message to
another process or for example put in a
net stable or something like that the
internal sharing of terms is destroyed
in practice this means in practice you
don't notice it that much but there are
situations where you can be
exponentially worse and it's
fundamentally wrong I think for a
language that is based on message
passing to have a operation a basic
operation be exponential
so I think this has this definitely
believe that this has to change and we
have you know a working prototype for
this that will probably make it into
somebody being near you yeah I think
okay I think we need to take close close
up we want oh it's gonna have a last
question I just wondering why everything
wasn't first order I mean there's no
module to list of functions and list of
functions the module and protocols for
example are very important but they're
sort of a protocol isn't itself a
first-order object in there like that
you can reason about all right sorry i
guess p is you can blame Joe and Robert
um um no guys its general protections
fault should be mowed them down to
colonel all right thank you God thank
you to my paddle you guys thank you very
much everybody for coming i hope you
learned something i hope you found this
interesting please go press the green
button on the baby so that we can do
this again in a future conference i hope
we'll do it again next year on a
different not on the beam but on some
other topic and if you have a topic that
you think we should cover on most the ER
line either live at a conference or just
in general or if you're doing something
cool with Erlang and you'd like to come
on to the podcast and talk about it um
we do it over skype usually on thursdays
but we can be flexible come catch me in
the conference or just send me an email
or skype me or something but our goal is
to promote the early ecosystem and the
airline infrastructure and that includes
LFE elixir or log jocks ax and any other
crazy thing ideas you have for what to
do with our lying so i really think the
pot try to try to make the podcast a way
to increase the community for everybody
so please help me do that and the if I
let's go out and be creative so thank
you very much
