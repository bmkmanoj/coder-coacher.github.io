whole thing started as an f-sharp Advent
project and f-sharp advent calendar is
something where it's a nice sharp
project where people sign up for
specific dates before Christmas and if
you sign up for a specific date you have
to publish a blog post about F sharp on
that specific date and I sign up for
they just I think about 15 of December
and when I was thinking well what should
I do
I thinking well maybe something
Christmasy or Star Wars because this was
like two days before the premiere so I
went for Star Wars as you can see and
because it has to be in F sharp I was
thinking well what kind of data can I
analyze with F sharp and I decided to
model the Star Wars social network using
the script files so this is a screenplay
of one of the episodes and they're
actually quite easy to parse because
they have very strict structure and they
are all available online so this was
like the perfect data source so the
normal script files usually they have
title of the scene which always starts
with int dot or X dot meaning interior
or exterior and that's the beginning of
the scene and then they have some
description what the camera sees when
the scene starts and then they have
people that are actually talking in the
scenes in both always in capitals in the
Vale in the middle of the file actually
so that seems to be quite easy to parse
and all the data are available online
this is page from I am as VB something
like the International Internet Movie
Database but this is the script database
I'm not sure what's the legal status of
this because they publish usually
scripts very early after the release but
they make it all available online so I
decided well let's just download all the
scripts and feresten and then
we can model social network by looking
at which characters actually speak
together within the same scene and that
gives me roughly the idea which
characters know each other if they speak
in the same scene that form means they
speak together and that means they
interact they know each other so this is
a nice approximation of the actual
social network so I looked at this
website I looked at the source code and
it's quite straightforward it's nice
HTML we're always the scene is in bold
and then all the people are involved so
it's relatively easy to parse right in
theory so this is the exactly the same
part of the script I was showing before
so now we have again scene title some
description and then name of the person
who's speaking and this is the F sharp
code that I wrote for this I was
actually using something called e from F
sharp data it has very nice HTML type
provider which also includes an HTML
parser so I could actually just load in
the HTML document I'll try to use this
so this is the URL of the first episode
I could load it into the HTML document
and then take all the descendants of
this specific tag and because the
scripts were pre formatted they were
always in this tag and then I could just
extract all the both items by taking the
B elements that's straightforward right
that should give me all the titles and
all the names and then I just took the
inner text so this is the whole HTML
parser so it's relatively easy to use
and the first iteration of my source
code actually I was trying to finish it
on time before the premiere before I was
supposed to publish it on the F sharp
advance website so it had a lot of code
a lot of different parsers for different
parts of the scripts and lots of regular
expressions and I guess it's not only me
but I don't find regular expressions
particularly readable so for me that I
just write
only so when I looked at it again when I
wanted to incorporate the new episode
into the analysis sounds like what was I
doing here like is this actually
matching so I rewrote the parser and now
this is probably the most F sharp code
you'll see here and this is using well
the functional way of writing a parser
is to split your document into elements
and then go through them recursively and
if you have different sections in there
you just accumulate what's in the
section and then return it in form of a
recursive function so this is a
recursive function that takes all the
items in my script and then it goes
through each item and wouldn't be nice
if you could do something like if it's a
scene title then just give me the title
of the scene and parse characters that
are in the scene and if it's a name then
just give me the name and go on parse
the names until we get to scene title
again and if it's something else then
just go on and skip it so this is what
it actually does it I have two
accumulators one for scenes and one for
characters and the scenes are basically
just lists of characters that speak
within each scene and then I could get
the social network by looking at which
characters speak together so here I'm
just going through the elements if it's
a title then I'm returning the
characters that speak in the scene
because it means that the scene ended
and if it's a name then I'm just adding
it into the accumulator and this is
possible to do because of something
called active patterns in F sharp and if
you've been too young who is talking
today I think he was talking about
active patterns as well because they are
really really useful for writing parsers
like this if you have a very small thing
you want to model then active patterns
are the way to go
so I basically put all my ugly regular
expressions inside this little function
that takes some text as an input and
then if the text matches the scene
pattern then it returns the scene title
and if it matches the name pattern then
it returns it as a name and otherwise
it's just some random word and then I
can just pattern match over it so this
is very readable I can see what's
happening here
I'm just matching with a title with a
name and all the complexity is hidden
within this little function and I don't
have to look at this regular expression
again the problem with names in Star
Wars is that they have a lot of
characters they have dashes slashes they
have numbers they have spaces as well so
something like c-3po it has a - it has a
number so it's not like a normal name so
this is the reason why this has to be so
ugly so take out message is that active
patterns are very good for hiding the
complexity behind the readable code so I
can just look at the pattern matching
and it's very very readable and you can
see what's happening there but this will
all sounds very nice right how it's
never this nice you can't really see
this because I looked at some of the
other script files and turns out they
don't respect the proper format for
script so here you can see that here is
Jar Jar speaking and he's not involved
and it's just in capitals followed by
colon so it's completely different
format so it turns out some of the
scripts use the standard format for
spirits some use slightly different ones
so I had to add another parser and had a
regular expression things like that and
you would think that this is all nice
but then I looked at what my parser
actually extracted
and our 2dt wasn't there at all so what
was actually happening I looked into the
script files and found out that he
doesn't speak there at all the scripts
always say are to frantically beeps or
yeah beeps provocatively and it wasn't
the only character Chewbacca doesn't
speak in the scripts at all so kudos for
the actor who could actually put more
expression into it but in the scripts
it's just too Beca barks a comment and
Hannah replies volleyball you said it
you didn't so this led me to very
complex mathematics this is an equation
well what I actually decided to do was
to estimate for these characters that
don't speak to estimate how many times
they would probably speak as I spoke
which means I looked at the number of
times each character is mentioned in the
script and how many times each character
actually speaks and I use this to
estimate weight that each character has
so this is weight of a character it's
basically just the average number of
times character is talking with someone
else
divided by the number of times the
character is mentioned in the script and
turns out on average this is about
one-half so each character is mentioned
about twice as much as the character
speaks and I use this to estimate
connections between the non speaking
characters and the actual speaking
characters I added length for r2d2
Chewbacca and bb-8 some characters were
not happy that I didn't at
actually I realized that there are so
many characters that don't speak
explicitly in the film so I just decided
well let's just not go into this let's
just add the real important characters
and then some characters messed up my
analysis again because some characters
especially in the new episode they are
mentioned a lot but they don't really
speak yeah so no spoilers but some
characters don't speak but they get
mentioned a lot so I actually had to add
another hike into it and for each
character basically just decide which
characters are similar and use them to
estimate the rate of interactions and
then I was again looking at my results
and it still didn't really match so this
is part of the screen and I looked at
this line and my nice regular expression
was just matching the name on madam so
why and actually this is not I this is a
lowercase L I don't know if they created
the scripts that I put on the internet
by just running some OCR on the scripts
but this is lowercase L so this is
actually quite a lot of work so how do I
find out which characters are in Star
Wars and which characters are actually
honestly there and which ones are just
mistakes in my parsing algorithm so I
was looking around the internet and
obviously there are things like the
Wikipedia which is Wikipedia for Star
Wars but there is also something called
swati which is the Star Wars API so if
you want to find out anything about
characters or planets or anything like
that about Star Wars you can use this
and they have a lot of nice rap
libraries I looked at the website and
they had Python JavaScript Android Java
and c-sharp yeah this is not maybe I
could use it maybe maybe I could so if
you are a sharp programmer you feel if
you are looking at JavaScript code you
feel like this and then I decided well
no not really
maybe I can write my own parser from F
sharp and call the API from F sharp
because what's what we actually does it
returns it's a return you will send it a
request and it returns the response in a
JSON format which is quite nice and
possible so this is part of the c-sharp
code and you can see that it's quite
long and most of it is just calling get
and set methods for each of the
properties so these are actually
elements in the json documents species i
color home world etc and the c-sharp
code had a lot of files like this for
every specific thing you can get from
the API so I'm not saying this is wrong
this is the way to do it in c-sharp and
post of the other languages looked very
very similar but oh let's try to do it
in F sharp let's first go to the swappi
website and they have a very nice
documentation with everything so for
example if we want to look at people
this is the cypher people and they have
an example request here so if we just
copy that over and here I'm using F
sharp in xamarin studio and I will be
using the F sharp JSON type provider
is a very useful thing as you will see
so let's just create a type using the
example request they gave me on the
website so I just got it in the example
request and now I can all I can do is
just create a variable called P which
will load the website and let's create a
function out of that let's create a
function get person and because they use
IDs to get the actual results I'll just
I'm just giving it ID as an input and
let's just load the correct address
okay now I have a function to get the
person and let's just run it in F sharp
interactive which is in this bottom part
and let's get one person here what P
equals get per person let's get the
first one and what it returns is the
JSON document and I don't want to go
through all the trouble of looking at
the example response and they have the
documentation for everything but that's
quite a lot of reading so I will just do
P dot and I have everything that's in
the JSON document so birth year is a
string because it has some additional
information it's not years in our time
but for example the height is an integer
because it's just the number how high
the person is it has a home world it has
the higher color and it has a lot of
other information like mass the weight
of the person I think in kilograms so
what's the name and it's Luke Skywalker
and does anyone know how tall Luke is
let's have a look 172 centimeters so
this is really fast you can see that I
got exactly the same code that I had in
c-sharp here this is doing exactly the
same thing that all this code is doing
on basically just two lines so actually
yesterday I apologized to some people
who had a talk yesterday but I decided
well swap he has many libraries here but
it's really missing an f-sharp one so
what I did yesterday I wrote it
thank you so you can see it on github it
has some examples here and if you look
at the Swap e-way website documentation
scroll down how to write buries f-sharp
here so you can play with it yourself
and you can do all sorts of fun things
with it actually so I have some examples
here I'll just load them so do you think
that Luke Skywalker is average sized for
a Star Wars character or not so let's
find out
so here in this piece of code I'm just
downloading the height of all characters
that are in the database and averaging
that so the average I didn't load it get
all people this might take a while but I
think there are only about 87 people in
the whole database now I have to wait it
finishes ok nothing let's hope the
internet works for me yes I have it so
now we can look at the average height of
a Star Wars character and it's 174 so
yeah Luke is pretty much average and we
can also look at which eye color is the
most frequent among Star Wars characters
and the most frequent one is actually
brown so for example Leia has brown eyes
then blue Luke Skywalker and cetera did
you know that Chewbacca has blue eyes so
very useful information and then the
third most common eye color for Star
Wars character is yellow
so a lot of you very useful information
that's gone so this is all nice right so
what can we do after we actually extract
all the information from the script so
now I actually had the list of
characters I knew which characters
interact together in each scene so that
gave me a social network so I used the
three J s which is a JavaScript library
for visualizations and it can do
anything the only problem is that for
mortals like me it's really hard but if
you go to the website it has examples of
so many visualizations you just go
through and pick the one you like and
then tweak the code so this is finally
the social network of all seven star
wars movies put together and because
it's in d3 I can actually open the
network and drag it around and play with
it and you can see quite a lot of
interesting information even from this
because this part of the network it's
the prequels you can see that there are
a lot of nodes
they are very densely connected these
are the characters from the original
trilogy and this is the new one so you
can see that the new one didn't follow
the trends from the original episode
from the prequels because there's just
so many characters so for example this
black node is darth vader and this is
c-3po etc so you can go online and play
with this i wanted to highlight a few of
the episodes so this is the first
episode from the prequels The Phantom
Menace and you can see that there are
many characters quite a lot of minor
ones
several bigger ones and the network is
very densely connected and we can
compare it with
new hope the original Star Wars movie
and there are almost no like very small
minor characters almost all of them are
the major ones and these guys are
connected together and the network is
relatively small and then let's compare
this with the force awakens and this
network is slightly bigger but still it
doesn't have that many minor characters
or that many connections as the prequels
and we can again play with this for
example this is Poe and this little
pentagram of notes are the resistance
pilots so now we have all the networks
so can we actually get some more
information out of that so I do some
things with network science so I decided
to look at some very basic indicators
and find out who's actually important in
the social network so the first basic
measure is a degree I sure if you have
this social network degree for specific
node is just a number of connections
that node has to other nodes so this guy
has six connections this guy has just
three connections so the assumption is
that the more important someone is in
the network the higher the degree and in
terms of the story
this means that higher degree means that
the character talks to many other
characters in the movie and then the
second measure is betweenness that's a
bit more important or bit more
interesting measure in terms of the
social network let's take this guy in
the middle and what betweenness measures
is how important that specific node is
to what's happening in the network
around it so this guy for example if
these two orange guys want to talk to
each other they have to talk through the
green guy because they don't know each
other directly so the green guy is very
important for connection between these
two but if we take these two guys
they want to talk to each other they can
use two different paths between
themselves so the green guy is not that
important because if he disappears then
they can still talk to each other so
betweenness measures this formally
betweenness of a note given to other
nodes in the network is just the number
of shortest paths between the two nodes
that lead through the central node
divided by the total number of the
shortest paths between the two nodes so
for this situation there are two
shortest paths between the orange nodes
and only one leads through the green guy
that means this situation has between s
1/2 and the betweenness for a node all
together is just sum over all different
pairs of nodes in the network so this is
quite complicated but if you using use R
then you can just call a function called
betweenness on a network I wouldn't like
to implement this because I would
actually have to implement the path
finding algorithm to find the shortest
path between all pairs of nodes this is
very easy but so I'm using f-sharp and
in F sharp I can use something called
our provider which gives me access to
all the our functions from F sharp so I
did basically the same thing I just
opened I graph and called our dot which
opens the our provider our dot between
us on the network and they gave me all
the values so how does it look in terms
of the starwars social network actually
well I put together a social network for
all the prequels and for all the
original trilogy and in the original
trilogy the person who talks to most
other people is Luke which makes sense
because he's supposed to be the central
character and in the prequels the person
who talks to most people is Anakin which
also makes sense because he is supposed
to be the main character but this is
just degree so I looked at betweenness
and for the original trilogy it's
basically the same people
high degree and high betweenness that
means the people talk to each other and
they connect different communities but
in the pre-close do you see a knock in
there so the problem is with betweenness
if you want to interpret it in terms of
the story it means that for example if
you have the dark side and the light
side and the guys between dark side they
interact with each other and in light
side they interact with each other as
well and the notes that actually
interact with both of them then they
have high betweenness but in the
prequels actually Anakin sort of just
drags along I think here it seems that
the open one is the one who's driving
actually the story because he interacts
with the different communities of people
but yeah
Anakin just isn't important to the story
that much it seems and if you look at
which characters are here how she even
Jar Jar is more important so let's look
at the first awakens actually though
people who interact with most people is
PO which makes sense because he goes
through a lot of different environments
and talks to a lot of other characters
and in terms of between us the most
central character is kylo Ren and it
sort of makes sense as well because he
is the character that sort of connects
some characters from the original
trilogy with the new trilogy and he also
talks to a lot of different people which
gives him the high betweenness so it
does make sense
unfortunately Rey is not very happy with
this but the reason is that he has
basically her own story during the story
she doesn't meet any of the resistance
pilots for example whereas Paul does so
that gives her a quite small small
degree he didn't even make it into the
top 5 but higher betweenness but still
not that much and you will see in the
next episodes how that turns out
who is the most central in the whole
Star Wars universe well before before
the new episode episode 7 came out it
was this guy obi-wan Kenobi after the
episode 7 came out I ran the algorithm
again and any guesses it's easier
because it makes sense he's in every
episode so this is the most central
character in the Star Wars universe at
the moment and if you look at now I was
just looking at the individual
characters and you can look at the whole
network as a whole is that tells us
something about the difference between
the prequels and the new episodes so
again I did several comparisons the
first one is the size that means number
of nodes in the network and this is
episode 1 this is episode 7 and you can
see that episode one has the most
characters means lots of debate in the
Galactic Senate and then it goes
steadily down the original trilogy has
less characters and these are just
characters that talk in at least two
scenes I discarded characters that
appear just once and I also discarded
characters that are not specifically
named that means if someone is just
called a star through a stormtrooper or
a technician they are not in this
network and episode 7 has more
characters again and we can look at
other measures as well one of them is
density of the network so if we have
this social network again just compares
how many links are in the network
compared to how many there can be in
theory so this is just the prefer
equation for this and density in a
social network tells us how much
the characters interact with each other
and the prequels are the first three
have at least the first two have the
smallest density which makes sense
because there are so many characters
they just don't talk to each other very
much and these five episodes have higher
density which is I think it correlates a
bit with the rating and then the final
thing I try to do is to look at the
clustering coefficient of the network
and the clustering coefficient tells me
if I'm in a social network if my friends
know each other if I know two people do
these two people know each other as well
so in terms of this network if you look
at this guy he has three neighbors and
only two of them know each other and
this link is missing and if you look at
this guy he has again three neighbors
but they all know each other this is
again how you computed in terms of the
equation so it's just the average number
of links between neighbors whereas the
maximum number of links between
neighbors there can be and this is
slightly more complicated but in terms
of the story in the social network means
that if one character just goes through
the story and talks to various other
people that don't know each other then
that character will have small between a
small clustering coefficient and if it's
about a group of people who interact
with each other a lot then the network
will have high clustering coefficient
and in this case it correlates with the
quality I think because the pre-course
have the smallest clustering coefficient
and light ones have higher so this is
something we have to say about the
episode seven it has high clustering
coefficient which means it's much better
than the prequels actually I am NOT
really convinced that the clustering
coefficient correlates well with quality
in general because I think some of the
fairy tales have this structure where
the main character just walks through
the story
and meet different beasts or other
characters but in this case I think it
definitely adds to the quality and again
how do we compute this in our I just
call function called graph density and
transitivity which is the clustering
coefficient and in F sharp it's exactly
the same so because I'm a lazy
programmer I don't have to program
everything and all the plots I was
showing they are actually they were
actually not screenshots they were
calling Google charts directly so this
is how I created the charts I basically
just opened the exploit library which is
an F sharp library for charting I took
one of the measures edit label and value
and just passed it into a chart bar and
just to prove it to you this is not
static it actually tells me what's the
precise number and things like that so
this is a very useful thing to do if you
want to embed some chart into a website
and another thing I did afterwards I
also try to model it in neo4j at the end
of my slides there is a link to a demo
project with the Star Wars social
network in neo4j so we can play with
that as well and this is all nice but we
can use the same kind of things in real
world so for example I was analyzing the
social network around F sharp on Twitter
and this is the visualization so you can
see it's much bigger than the Star Wars
social network and these are the most
central people in the network so the
first one is done Syme who is the author
of F sharp this is the official
Microsoft side of things account this is
the community account and then Tomas had
a talk yesterday and Miguel de Icaza
he's the author of Chrome and mano and
I'm running this on one also it works
nicely you can use it in various sorts
of settings as well I will keep this
example
because I wanted to tell you for example
if in your company you communicate on
sly or whatever you can also just use
the information and see who replies to
whom and create a social network out of
that and see the communities of people
and you can do the same thing with email
communications and for example email
communication is a slightly different
setting where all the links between
people are oriented someone sends other
people an email and there is it's
another example where the degree doesn't
really correlate with importance because
for example a secretary that sends a lot
of information emails is maybe not
central in the social network so we can
use the same kind of analysis I did here
you can also analyze for example supply
grades if you have a blackout somewhere
how will that affect the rest of the
network and something I do most of the
time is analyzing biological networks
for example this is from a paper I was
reading earlier this week and they were
looking at tumor suppressors and
oncogenes in biological networks and
they found out that the genes that are
actually important in development of
cancer have high betweenness in protein
interaction networks means if protein
binds together that means they have a
link between themselves and again if we
look at the network like this uncle
genes and tumor suppressors have higher
betweenness so it's really useful in the
real world as well and what i went
through here was first how to power
scripts how to do data science because I
was calling functions from our using F
sharp and in data science you have to do
this a lot because you have to combine
languages because there is never enough
things in one language
I showed you some type providers I
explained some indebtedness and things
in network science but all this was
using just a very small fan data set on
Star Wars and
I think it's really important to have
fun with data sets like these because
for example in the biological networks I
analyze if a node has high betweenness I
don't really see why that happens
or I may not have the clear intuition
what that actually means because the
different nodes have different values
and they represent the genes or proteins
and it's really hard to interpret this
because I don't know all the genes in
the human body so if you play with
something like this on a fun data set
you can immediately see what it means in
terms of the story or in terms of this
particular social network and in a small
project like this I covered all these
things so it's very nice practice and if
you want to learn more this is the
