throughout I've got time at the end but
I'm happy to answer as we go this is a
supervised respect right this is a very
beautiful declarative way for us to
describe the processes that are going to
be running in our airline systems we
describe what's going to be running as
you do in declarative systems not how
it's going to be run you don't see here
start child pit X start child page Y you
see I want child in this case stage 3 to
exist in the system and the system takes
care of it for us it's a beautiful
beautiful thing for the lazy like myself
this is another thing you might
recognize this is an app app spec this
is what describes to Erlang systems what
an application is and how it should
behave the virtual machine at that point
takes this description and uses it to
start the application it's a declarative
way to describe at a slightly higher
level what things should exist in our
system one of the beautiful things in
Erlang finally we get to the release
this is a relics configuration taken
from a rebar 3 config file it describes
a release and yet again we're in this
declarative description of what our
release should look like what the what
should be started in our system now each
of these steps build up one upon the
other from the supervisor specification
for the applications to the application
specification to the release
specification but what's next we're not
done by any stretch of the imagination
we've got this beautiful declarative
declaration for what's going to exist
into your language I'm system but with a
few exceptions for relying on hardware
we're not done configuring our system a
large percentage of our system is still
not configured is that you guys
experienced this I suspect you have if
you've been running things in production
and we're hitting this this thing this
impedance mismatch between the language
and the system on which the language
runs in the broader context it's been
very popular over the last few years for
languages to have their own package
manager' Erlang has its own package
measure now and in hexa p.m. rebar and
the elixir tooling mix are both musette
ruby gems exist as a language level
package manager' Python eggs
Haskell's cabal pick a language it's got
a package manager and there is a
mismatch between the packages in that
language specific package manager and
the systems on which they run so in any
system not just Erlang how do we solve
that there's lots of approaches the
motor simplistic side we create a
tarball and we with the release stuff
and we SCP the tarball over to box and
we start it up so very imperative very
manual approach if we're a little bit
more sophisticated we might use a tool
like fpm to create a debian or an RPM
and we might use tools like ansible salt
pepper chef mostly imperative tools that
describe steps to go and install that
debian or that RPI that dab of that RPM
and what-have-you right and we might
make images we might not we might make
docker containers we might not but the
fundamental I think that's happening
there doesn't really change and what do
we end up with we end up inside effect
health
why is that that's because we have
implicit ephemeral dependencies on
things we don't control what are those
things we don't control inevitably that
is the Debian foundations repositories
that change and update minor versions of
things over time or Canonical's deb
packages for ubuntu or or red hats yum
repositories we don't own those we don't
control those and they change if i get
paged at 3 in the morning and i put a
fix in my system and i just pushed the
let's say i baked an ami yesterday and i
pushed that out three in the morning I
fixed my
I push it into my continuous deployment
system it bakes a new API what's that
got what does that new API have in this
traditional model I don't have a clue
neither do you it might be the same
thing I baked two days ago with just my
change it also might include an unknown
number of changes and fixes that
theoretically make the system better but
that happened implicitly without my
knowledge implicitly without my control
without my testing and it's not uncommon
for me to have to spend a tremendous
amount of time fixing changes in the
system that I didn't expect to solve the
actual bug that I wanted to solve so
instead of going to back up to bed at
3:15 I'm going back to bed at 9:00 p.m.
the next day this side effect Ness is is
bad so what's the solution the solution
is Nix OS and I say that with a certain
level of grandiosity to coin a word or
to use a word that sounds really cool it
fundamentally solves this problem and it
solves it in extraordinarily elegant way
now
Nix OS is kind of a two-headed beast it
is a package manager a purely functional
lazy package manager called Nix and a
Linux distribution based around that
package manager called Nix OS now the
next package manager uses a purely
functional language to describe a thing
called a derivation and derivation is a
declarative description of a package
including where it's from the attribute
attributes they should have the
dependencies it has those kinds of
things it's when it builds it ensures
and it goes through a tremendous amount
of effort to ensure this that only the
things that are explicitly depended on
in the expression are available to the
thing being built this is critical it it
cleans the environment such that even if
you have installed another dependency on
the box has no access to it so if you
cannot literally cannot have
successful package that doesn't include
its dependencies and finally packages
never changed once they've been built in
another way that NYX goes to a
extraordinary amount of effort to make
sure the packages don't change when
they're built it creates a normal file
system for the package builds that
package and then converts the file
system to a read-only file system once
the package is built from the moment of
building it is no longer writable with
caveats about getting into the low
levels of the operating system and stuff
like that finally and this is the key to
some of the beauty of Nix OS it stores
all packages isolation to each other
there's a thing called a NIC store that
generally lives in slash NIC slash store
and that's where all of your packages
are and the packages are named with this
bit of weirdness here it's a hundred and
sixty bit cryptographic hash plus its
name plus it's version and that
cryptograph cache is not a hash of the
sources it's a hash of every single
thing that could have an impact on the
build an impact on that package it's a
hash of the sources of the package it's
a hash of the nicks expressions in the
package it's a hash of the hash of the
sources of its dependencies and the
expressions of a dependencies all the
way back to those root dependencies so
that version in this case render proto 0
dot 11.1 you could have 20 of those in
the system depending on how you set up
how you build each one of those and it
doesn't matter because the true version
the true version of the system is that
cryptographic hash and poor packages
where the dependencies resolved in that
cryptographic hash it will reuse that if
they resolve to a different
cryptographic hash it will use that or
build it if it needs to lazily it's a
brilliant concept it does have
implications if you can imagine to your
to the programs that run on the system
because there is no there is no root
Linux directory there is no slash bin
slash or slash s pan slash bar
especially at these kinds of things they
don't exist everything in Nix is managed
through the manipulation of the
environment the manipulation of the path
and
every application lives in its own
unique universe so now based on those
foundational building blocks we can step
into the declarative description of the
system as a whole so looking at this and
I know the vast majority of you have not
been exposed to Nicks it looks kind of
like a function right these things at
the top there was look kind of like
arguments this looks somewhat if you
squint right like the body of a function
because it is it absolutely is a
function it's a function that takes
arguments from the environment it
returns a thing called a derivation that
declaratively describes what needs to be
created so this is actually one from our
production systems this describes a
Linux install that has our thorndike
service we create a Thorndike user
described Thorndike the Thorndike user
to the system with kind of the normal
things the description what the home
director should be the shell it should
use and then we enable the Thorndike
service and we say hey use use the
Thorndike user that we just created for
that service and we create a Linux image
in wherever we need to in AWS or in
VirtualBox or in vagrant or whatever you
want to call it based on this
description and that image will only
include the things that are due this
this and the things that this depends on
all the way back to the kernel that is a
powerful powerful thing now some things
to take away from this things like
packages our namespace the package
namespace contains every single
application every single package in the
world but I'm not installing those I
reference it here it's passed in but I'm
not installing it why is that because
the only thing I use in that is dot bash
it's lazy it's only gonna pull out and
build the things that are directly
referenced the derivations that are
directly referenced as part of that
build so now I don't get this for free
it's not magic Thorndike is a Erlang
release
that I needed to describe as a service
so we can step down one level and I've
had to kind of pull some stuff out to
get this sort of on a slide so this
doesn't complete but it gives the the
crux of it we have another function here
right and in that function we describe
our service and we say hey it's a system
D service its name is Thorndyke it has a
description I want it to start after the
network target I want it to be used by
the multi user target and this is the
start bit this is how it starts and runs
so I describe my service to Nix and it
manages how to start it
and then I can make that use of that
service at the higher level in my in my
root configuration and finally the
package so this is um this is where we
start getting into the interesting bits
of Erlang so again we have our function
that returns the derivation we have this
ability of our three declaration that
supports building rebar three buildable
things so if it's if it looks like a
rebar three and you can build it on the
command line with rebar three you can
build it in Nicks now this is a release
this isn't a package it looks a lot like
a package and I've alighted the source
because it fit on the slides again right
but I'll go into that in the next slide
I have built inputs this particular
release depends on bash net tools and
Erlang those are explicit dependencies
it depends on the ear lying package of
lij sx and URI those are its Erlang
depths and because it's a release and so
we support err Lange packages hex
packages Erlang abs rebar buildable
things quite well in build rebar 3 we
haven't baked release support into a
derivation yet this is the kind of the
first couple we've done you should see
derivation or release support as a
derivation in pretty quick order so I'm
going to show you how I did this but you
shouldn't have to do this in the very
near future but in this case as part of
that build I say hey there's an install
phase and in the install phase I
I run some things that include make no
I'm uh I'm probably too old for my own
good I run make for everything and this
is just a make file that drives Drive
three bar three right in this case they
make target I'll show you this in a
minute all it does is run we are third
release create this stuff and then we
have some commands to copy it into the
right place next to us
yep yeah you have to keep those missing
now I'll get in this little bit in a
minute that presents a one problem in
that we're humans we forget to do that
right so so because we forget to do that
unless you're careful we bar will try to
go out and and get the releases right so
on Nix OS rebar 3 is not quite the same
as it is in every other place for the
Nixon saw we pass Schreiber 3 2 where
when it tries to go out to the network
it dies and throws an exception saying
hey you forgot to put something in your
Knicks expression please do that because
that's the way Knicks works essentially
I don't like that for lots of reasons
but it's the best solution we've come up
with so far
yep
know so I like to show you this the way
NYX handles everything is in file system
in a git repository so there's a you're
right mmm might be in the room thing is
a list of all the current names of
packages in in Nix and they're not think
of names of packages and Nick's much
less like package names and much more
like bindings it's a name bound to an
expression so it's very very common in
Nix for names to be bound to a specific
expression without a version as that is
the current latest version in the Nick
system and then where we have multiple
versions of the next system you'll see
name underscore version or name -
version and that way you can use them as
needed but it's this is the most common
idiom where you keep your your kind of
Nick's as a living system and rely on
the names of things that they are um
it's not because all references are hard
and Nick's there is no constraint
solving there is no there's no
dependency change with you out to you
explicitly going in and changing the
Nick's expressions this will always
resolve to the same thing given the same
kind of commit hash in the git
repository in which Nick's lives so it
makes sense it so I'm going to talk
about this in a second but this is one
of the fundamental differences next
versus other systems
yes yep and I'll show you that in a
second and when I swap over to do some
some terminal stuff so this is what a
more normal expression looks like you
see it looks pretty much like the last
one the only thing we have done is we
don't need a separate install phase
rebar three derivation understands how
to build and install Erlang go TP apps
built with built with rebar so we have
the same kind of arguments we have in
this case we're doing le we need STD and
V from the NICS environment we need
fetch from github because that's how
we're going to get the source and we
need to build rebar three derivations we
name version pretty straightforward here
we're doing fetch from github Nick's
knows how to fetch from github is quite
common with the owner which is the
organization or owner of that github
repository the name of the github
repository the reference and you can
often use the refs the actual version
number in there in this case there
wasn't a direct correlative version
numbers I had to use a commit ref and
then finally the Shah of the of the
tarball that's going to be pulled down
now this is not the same as the the
cryptographic hash we saw earlier but it
does roll into that cryptographic hash
it ensures that the tarball we get just
like any kind of hash right there shows
that the target is the tarball we expect
to get and then the rebar three does the
right thing for your for your world so
this very clearly bridges the gap that
declared a gap between their relying
virtual machine and the and the OS world
as a whole yep so i'll talk about in a
second so yes on both for many of the
existing packages generated there's
certain ones that I'll go into in a
minute that we can't generate for
various reasons and you write them by
hand and of course ones you use
internally in your company for now are
written by hand fortunately it's fairly
straightforward to write by hand I was
having a conversation sometime ago where
with a with a person I was talking about
Nick's OS I have to say like it has
solved enough of my problems both from a
kind of a management perspective and to
some extent from a security perspective
that I'm a bit of a fanboy right I was
having conversation with a kind of
traditional more traditional guy who's
done lots of work in with the Red Hat
lots of good work with Debian and the
conversation went something like this I
was like you can do this thing with next
way you understand how your dependencies
change over time it's in a it's in a
it's an apposite or you can use the same
tools to manage your source of your
system configuration as you can to
manage all your other source it fits
into your existing development pipeline
your versions are controlled you only
pull in what you need to pull in and the
response was well I can pin my
dependencies in Debian so that that'll
work for that I can do this and it'll
solve my problem and it reminded me
quite tremendously of conversations I've
had with imperative programmers talking
about functional languages right talking
people it with a job background or a
ruby background or what-have-you and
that kind of moved me into the mindset
of there's a guy named Paul Graham he's
famous for a Y Combinator and originally
for via web and a while back he wrote a
he wrote a blog and he posited this
thing called the blub paradox and this
is a bit self-serving for folks that are
functional programmers I have to admit
but I think it's actually accurate and
the the crux of the paradox is that for
languages that are higher on the curve
of power Erlang Haskell these kinds of
things users of that language can look
at language that are lower on the curve
of power and understand what makes that
language more
powerful understand the things that
makes it more productive more
syntactically terse these kinds of
things but for users of language lower
on the on the power curve the you know C
C++ Java Python Ruby what-have-you
they don't have the ability to look up
the power curve and understand what
makes those those languages more
powerful because they haven't used them
they haven't grok them they don't have a
full understanding of it and they're
outside of their experience so a
person's transitioned from using one of
those languages lower on the power curve
to using a language higher on the power
curve is almost a leap of faith in the
vast majority of cases the reason a
person makes that leap is because they
heard a talk by someone they respect or
they wrote a book or their friend has
gone off and taken that leap before them
and convinced them that they need to go
ahead and spend the time and the energy
to learn it and once they've learned it
they can look back and say oh yeah you
were right this was this was worth it
for the first time I think there's a
power curve of system hopefully that
comes back a power core of system
management right where pick your
languages I'm a huge fan of move move do
I've used it almost since it came out
but a boon to is lower on the power
curve from the perspective of production
systems then Nix is so I can articulate
all of this to you guys and you're it's
probably going to be interesting it's
probably going to sound cool but you're
gonna be thinking in your head I suspect
for the most part like yeah but it
doesn't really buy me much over what it
is that I'm doing now all right and my
my thing that I'm pausing to you is it
does take the time like take my
recommendation walk away use it enough
to understand how it's better and that
leap of faith will be valuable to you in
the almost immediate timeframe oh sorry
guys I'm weeds okay
so now we're going to come in and talk a
little bit about specifically about
Erlang support in
NIC's and how that works so it kind of
composes of two parts one is support
during the the build of an Erlang
package itself and the other is what
Fred alluded to which is pulling in
packages from from hex repository and
making those available so we have the
somewhat unfortunate problem that rebar
three really really wants to own the
dependencies super badly it doesn't want
to give those up for anything so we have
to do some things that kind of trick
rebar three the thinking that it has
owned the dependencies and it's already
pulled them down and then we still had
to go in patch rebar thirty-two to force
it to never pulled out in dependencies
one of the the really important parts of
of Nix is hermetic builds basically
builds that do not reach out to the
network and pull and change during the
build process and in the various build
servers they actually makes sure that
doesn't happen by using things like safe
route environments and those kinds of
things so we had to make it hermetic so
we wrote a little tool called rebar
three Nix bootstrap which is actually an
e script that the build we brought three
derivation goes out and runs previous to
two actually calling rebar three that
derivation good looks at the Nix kind of
Erlang environment creates a symlink
farm in the underscore build directory
in the right profile and then and make
sure that that matches what we Bertha
expects and then rebirth away can be
called it's actually pretty
straightforward in some cases it may
have to manipulate the rebar config and
they'll make a copy of that and point we
borrow three to the copy and that's how
kind of we support it it's not optimal
it does what it needs to be done rebar
three functions as you would expect to
function package that can be built with
rebar three off of Nick's can be real
with rebar three on Nick's but this is
the bridge through the Hermetic builds
that we needed to make rebar three
function the other side of that was the
hex to Nick's tool that we wrote and
basically hex to Nick's goes out to the
hex TM goes out to hex rpm pulls in the
complete graph of packages generates
sorry I lost my train of thought
generates Knicks expressions and
actually makes use of the John's John
he's pretty printer stuff because it
actually does work quite well um and it
does and it also looks at the
dependencies and it uses the exact same
algorithm that we were three does to
resolve the dependencies so they match
what we were three expects no it doesn't
actually use the same code because that
codes not been exposed to be used as a
library but basically uses the axiom
algorithm so we generate that we attempt
to build those and in a fair amount of
the fair number of cases they don't
build and they don't build for a few
different reasons first off people
forget to specify their dependencies
they'll push stuff through to hex they
don't specify their dependencies in Nix
things don't build without their
dependencies fully specified so there's
a fair number of packages that need to
be fixed in hex tot p.m. second problem
there are native extensions in in a
certain in a bunch of hex pack or sorry
yeah hex packages that implicitly depend
on libraries being available in the OS
they don't expose that I mean you as a
human can go and look and read they're
the read knees or the documentation and
see oh it needs you know live notify or
something like that but there's no way
for us to algorithmically detect that so
those packages essentially don't build
there's some solutions of that that we
could get to in the future and finally
there are packages that are just broken
or they one thing we don't support is
old-style we bar get dependencies for
some reason we have not been able to
convince rebar three to accept what we
get put on disk as there and it will
inevitably go out and try to download
those regardless of what we've done to
try to convince it otherwise but
something will probably fix in the near
future but for now it means that some
proportion of packages don't build but
the vast majority of packages in hex are
on Nick's OS and available right now so
let's see if I can do this in the my
somewhat funky funky setup
can everyone see that okay so we're
going to go into
so this is a this is a airline release
it looks and this is a Nick's so on my
laptop yep I can yeah doing the doing
the that's gonna be really annoying is
it not okay cool so this is a this is a
very standard rebar compatible release
that could be built on any system it
looks exactly the same on Nick's as it
does anywhere else the only real thing
that is different is that shell Nick's
over there in the corner that shelled
out Nick's is a is the derivation that
I'll show you right now it's a
derivation that describes kind of the
developer time description for Nick's
and essentially it says the same things
that we were saying otherwise now here's
the interesting thing that shell that
makes is a file that lives in that
repository every time I run Meg we can I
run well you can't see it now but I've
run Nick show here let's do something
that's a little bit more I'm sorry guys
let's put me to be rather interesting is
it not that's tremendously no there we
are let's do this
so this works a little bit better so so
we run next Shell next Shell is a way to
use a piece of Nick's OS combined with a
derivation in shale mix to build a
closed environment over your current
directory
so inside of Nick's - shell I've
specified this pure argument and that
pure argument says don't make anything
in the surrounding operating system
available to it only make the things
specified and shelled out Nick's
available to it so it makes sense
everyone so I do that and then inside of
that environment I run my Earl command
so I have an Earl Aang underlying rebel
that only has access to the things that
are specified in that derivation now I
run everything inside this inside this
this Nick shell
so this is the make file and all it does
is drive and this is kind of a
convention on my part I wouldn't say
it's any kind of uh know what's going on
oh yeah so we come down here and
everything we're doing is inside this
next shelf every make command we run
every repel we run is inside of Nick so
that means that my package manager is a
part of my development environment my
package the package that I'm going to
deploy with is the thing I live inside
doing my entire development process
alright that's a powerful powerful thing
because Nick's lives in a set of files
in a directory tree it lives in a git
repo I have a local copy of that repo
that my Nick's environment has pointed
to I manipulate that in the context of
my running world and I can build my
systems on top of that my development
systems as if they were production but
we internally in my company we have a
little bit of tooling that allows us to
do trivially but with a single command I
could spin up a group of VirtualBox
images running packages built from my
development environment but built with
the packages they're gonna run in
production built within the same exact
way that they will be when they run into
our continuous deployment environment
and I would say like more than anything
else that is the that is the power of of
Nick's now I've got time for questions
yeah Fred
so this is a so this is one of the
approaches that a few other languages
have taken almost inevitably they've
moved from that approach a great example
that is the early versions of elm
support in nick's OS did that exact same
thing and then moved away from it and my
suspicion is they moved away from it
because when you close over that that
that particular set of packages you
basically have a kind of a binary set of
it's not binary but of have binary
closed set and your systems become have
the potential become disjoint right so I
have one release that closed over its
set of things even though they're on the
same head of Nyx packages they're
running different versions of their
dependencies it's my suspicion not I
looked at whether the language is done
historically and so their change over
time and I just went straight to pulling
in two packages to directly yes you are
No so it's not based on any existing
derivation of Linux it's not based on
Ubuntu or Debian or any of those kind of
things
it is this based on Linux kernel and the
junior user space ass package by NYX if
you don't want to use that you don't
have to you can use the NYX package
manager and get 90% of the usefulness of
this it won't carry the it won't carry
the dependencies down to the kernel
level because it has no control over
that but everything above the kernel
level will be controlled by next so you
could use hardened BSD well I know you
can use BSD I suspect you can use
hardened via state and the next tax
management and it would work just great
with the caveat that the dependencies
don't go all the way through the to the
kernel you can use Mac now there's not
as many packages supported on a Mac but
you can do Mac development inside of the
next package manager and everything I
just showed you works perfectly aside
from the the host configuration you
don't get that because that's Nix OS not
Nix package manager but you can still
you can actually still build images from
a configuration if you want it based on
Nix OS so you get a large percentage of
the capabilities without having to shift
to an operating system that you are not
familiar with other questions all right
then
yeah
yeah
the the route configuration essentially
so it is the kind of like when you're
building a release you have that route
app and eating and relics includes all
of its all of its dependent apps Knicks
OS does the same thing but for your
entire operating system yep so there's
some caveats to that and this is where
we go from like theoretically wonderful
to kind of real-world stuff right so NYX
has a lot of tools to generate images
directly from a configuration and I
really really really really want to use
those tools badly but generating for
example an Amazon ami directly from a
NICs configuration is a bit of black
magic not so much from a NICs
perspective but getting it to run
happily in Amazon is very difficult I
mean from my understanding is that is
true regardless of what operating system
you want if you want to come from a
virtual machine to get it running in
Amazon's name I it's interesting so that
the hack for that is you take an
existing base kind of version of
installation of NICs OS you put your
configuration on it
you run Nix Nix OS rebuild switch which
is the command you used to rebuild the
operating system and it goes in forces
that install to look like your
configuration then you and garbage
collect and you kind of get what you
want without building the image directly
so in our continuous deployment
environment how I want it to look how
I'd love for it to look is next
configuration we run run Nix build which
is a kind of a way you can build without
installing next minutes to build the the
image and then upload the image to to to
Amazon or wherever right what I actually
have to do is use Packer which is a
brilliant and a good tool to UM to let's
just not worry about it
use Packer to build a which is a
brilliant and good tool to build the
image use the shell provisioner to copy
my configuration over and then run Nick
sort
rebuild switch and the garbage
collection of Knicks packages that are
no longer relevant to crazy mr and then
have hacker bake that am i for me yes so
there's a couple of different ways
there's a option in Nix to pull the
configuration from the the a my user
data if you want to I don't have a lot
of experience with that because we take
the approach of kind of ephemeral
infrastructure we have a single
configuration for all of the kind of
homogeneous host and if we change
configuration we rebuild VM eyes and and
we publish them so I know it's possible
I can't really point you in the right
direction there unfortunately yeah
so a lot for a lot of the packages in
the system let me see if I can get the
get out of so for a lot of the the
packages in the system they do that if
you look at the the Haskell support
which is stupendously good in Nicks
all that's generated for example the
Erlang dependencies the vast majority of
those are generated from hex and every
time we do we do a new release every
time they do a new release of hex we
make sure that they have a new
generation of the Erlang packages a lot
of packages though are also hand-built
the the packaging itself the community
maintains kind of those pecs check or
declarations in the same way that their
Debian community does for Debian
packages the one difference is because
that lives in the source file that I own
that sits in my repository I can change
those if I need to and and modify them
and add patches and those kinds of
things a great example of this there's
kind of off the beaten path is recently
there was a vulnerability to G Lib C you
guys familiar with that really really
scary vulnerability in our system and
this is granted our systems are working
startup right we don't have a lot of
things deployed but the time from when I
became aware of the vulnerability to the
time it was fixed in production was
about an hour
pulling the patches pushed into our CD
system nicks rebuilds it all everything
that depends on it
which took you know most of that hour
and then gets redeployed into into
production doing that same thing in the
same time frame with the more
traditional approaches is very very
difficult not not impossible but very
very difficult and that I think that's
another one of the clear values of Nicks
