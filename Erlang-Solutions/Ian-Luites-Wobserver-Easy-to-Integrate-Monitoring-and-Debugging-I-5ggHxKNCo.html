to talk about web server just everyone
had it slide so I'm going to say the man
behind the beard like he said I work for
Square Enix why is that relevant we've
been using elixir in production for a
while now and actually we've run into a
few things and if you've seen the
previous talk my colleague that suid is
we have our own solutions for those
problems and one of them was that funny
and now I'm going to talk about web
server what I'm going to do so what
server you might say what
it's web observer it's a web-based
metrics monitoring and actually pretty
much the airline observer in web porn
now you might ask why and why is
observer is great exactly when we
started out it was great to be able to
see inside the state of our processes to
see what was going on to see indecisive
tables it's great for understanding but
hardly enough because I always use it
and why couldn't we use it well we have
a set up with microservices remote
deployment between behind firewalls load
balancers everything is in docker
containers we have lazy devil as the
picture shows who has arbitrary CI rules
let's say you get one port for docker
container not more just one all the
other teams do with one fourth for you
to do too
it's that is what we have to work with
so you get projects like this that try
to solve that there are of course
alternatives so for example you could
just use SSH connect to the Machine you
want to use observer on and tunnel
through that SSH to get the same well
usability there are few problems with
that alternative though you need to have
SSH access to the machine which could be
handled but you also need to setup the
Erlang VM in a specific way to accept
the tunnel and if you have multiple
instances on multiple docker containers
behind for example a load balancer it's
kind of hard to iterate and go this node
that node this node so that is why we
came up with web server so the web
interface takes kind of scare of the
remote part you can just use the web
interface to see into the application
have the same functionality
it doesn't really solve the load
balancer part so how did we solve that
take for example this situation we have
an application we have five instances
running behind the load balancer that
means every HTTP request we do ends up
at one of these five so if you want to
inspect for example number five we
either have to keep refreshing and hope
we hit the fifth instance or try
something else to force the request to
go to that specific node what server
solves that problem by making the
instances discover each other and if the
HTTP request ends up at a node where it
wasn't supposed to end up wet so for
example we want to inspect node 4 but it
ends up at node 2 then behind the load
balancer it will proxy that request to
the right instance to make sure you get
the information you want so what does
web server offer I have here a list it's
pretty much just the same thing the
normal observer
offers but then for security reasons we
kept it was we were lazy we kept this
pure read mode so you can see the
information you cannot change your kill
or do anything like that I can go
through it but I'm going to give a demo
in a moment so this is just a quick
overview it does offer something more
and that is it gives all the information
also through a JSON API and why did we
add that it's easier for automation so
you can check the state of the system
with something else because pretty much
everything can parse JSON and do HTTP
request you can get a list of all notes
crude adjacent and their normal UI works
through WebSockets if from some reason
the WebSockets don't work which can be
with a load balancer that or a firewall
that doesn't really like them then it
will fall back to using the JSON API we
also added a feature that adds metrics
metrics as in how much memory is being
used and if you want to add some custom
counters like requests coming in or
requests per second stuff like that
they're basically formatted for
Prometheus at just an application to
graph and monitor systems through
metrics you can write or set in the
config any metric system you want it is
not hard-coded that way so just to show
you how do you get started with web
server so hopefully I'm going to say the
Wi-Fi works because then I can just give
a live demo I'm going to open the
terminal
I made a yeah just going to make a new
project Oh
demo that works
make a new project and the only thing
I'm going to change Xcode starts isn't
the mixed file make it bigger bit too
big I'm going to add the dependency
hopefully I won't make any typos
should be good I'm gonna to make that
gap that's already there nope we have
internet that's amazing I'm just going
to start it and keep talking because it
takes a while to compile so the only
thing you need to do to get it running
is bringing the dependency and that's it
if you only want your web server
instance to run in develop mode if that
is something you want you just add that
to the dependency and you won't even
notice or have web server there while
you're running in production so it's
done compiling I'm going to try it out
oh I'll make it smaller like this bigger
and what we have here is the interface I
scaled it down it does resize Oh
here are three sizes now it takes too
much information like it's that the
original started as a replacement for
observer because we ran into the problem
that we couldn't use it so here we have
the same setup we had we have the low
charts it shouldn't really be doing
anything right now but the charting I'm
just going to show you then you at least
know what it does you have the memory
allocators I make the interface but I'm
a back-end developer so not everything
is very nice-looking I'm very open to
people one thing to help out there
because it's just not my thing we have
the same application we added some
colors to let know what supervisors and
applications and stuff
that are you can use the same thing as
in the observer so you can click them
and see the state and click through the
processes same for the process list the
ports list I'm just showing you how it
works and disabled viewer
I'm not sure if I can pick one that has
a deal except convict always has options
so this pretty much works in the same
way as the normal observer would work
read-only mode but then through the web
version can also show you what metrics
would look like for people familiar with
Prometheus this is the format that it
uses if not it's pretty much one line of
help one line defining the type and then
D metrics information which in this case
just shows IO and memory usage just to
give an example of the API it gives the
same information but then Jason format
and like I said if you want to view them
there's only one note because I'm not
connected to anything but it gives us a
list of all the notes it's connected to
so let's kill this just to make sure
that I don't keep it running so that is
everything you need to do to get it
running we try to keep it as drop-in as
possible you just drop it and use it
when you don't need it anymore take it
out and it's gone notes that up nothing
necessary by default it runs on port
4001 and that's just because most web
applications seem to run on 4000 by
default so we're just one up if you want
to work on it on your own you can clone
the repo do make steps cat and you might
think it works then but it doesn't
because we did some some strange stuff
to get it to work with distillery it
uses an assets pipeline kind of like
Phoenix but then we try to keep it small
which might not have been the best idea
you need to do an NPM install and we
added the mix
oil mix build just to build the assets
so if you want to try it out and clone
the repo you first need to do these two
things to get it running we use go for
the SS pipeline like I said I'm a
back-end developer I just pick that up
because I knew how it works not really
relevant now the interesting part we
made it to be drop in drop out but we
started getting requests to make it
possible to integrate it with running
web applications things that were
already running Phoenix or cowboy or
things like that so we started out
making it into a plug it was by default
pretty much already a plug but we just
made it all contained in one plug so if
you want to run it and you have already
have cowboy running just start a new
project with cowboy you don't actually
have to add cowboy and plug because
they're already in web server but if
you're want to remove it it's good to
have it in you have your standard cowboy
router I'm not sure are there people who
haven't used Phoenix or cowboy just so I
know if I have to explain something here
I think most people sit well that's easy
then we have the standard plug router
and the only thing you need to add is
pay forward slash web server or whatever
you want to the web server web router
that takes care of everything
if you want to WebSockets to work
however you need to start cowboy with a
child's back and we need to do that
because we need to set the options for
the WebSocket so everyone if anyone has
not worked with cowboy and web sockets
you need to define which endpoints take
the WebSocket connection stuff like that
you need to set options and the options
kind of look like this you need to
define like hey for things ending with
what server slice web socket send it to
this thing to handle it if not send it
through to our default router
I have this code all in samples so if
anyone wants to review you can just what
look at it on github you can see it you
can again run mode server and it should
be running on the same forward at your
cowboy instance and I said everything
works right it does not promise because
we build it so that anyone could just
drop in use it it will always start his
own cowboy server to serve itself so we
need to disable that and luckily that is
as easy as setting the config to use
plug in stand of stand alone that will
prevent what server from starting its
own cowboy instance getting it running
I'm going to talk about it later but you
also need to set the remote URL prefix
the reason is we ran into the thing
where we only got one port and that made
us do some creative things because we
can only use one port so all the nodes
interconnect not through the standard
Erlang system but through WebSockets so
if you don't let the other nodes know
that you've changed your own URL it's
going to assume it's at /ws so you need
to set the prefix so they can find each
other and interconnect because they use
the WebSocket Phoenix is even easier you
start a new Phoenix project I can show
you it hopefully is actually very easy
I'm going to copy the code though
because I can't copy the code okay so
I'm just going to type it oh thank you
thank you for remembering new Phoenix
project signing up
you know what give me a second
it's just pretend we did it
that's faster and we don't have to it's
pretty much the same thing as it is just
now we started a new project just the
default Phoenix project nothing special
and it's the same configuration as I did
for cowboys so telling web server run in
plug mode set your URL prefix and there
are only two files you need to change
apart from that like I said it's even
easier got the Phoenix endpoint you need
to add the web server Phoenix socket to
your endpoint we build or at least
someone in the community was very nice
and contributed this module so it was
very easy to integrate you add it as the
Phoenix socket on select web server and
in the router you pick the right one how
many routers you do the same thing and
you forward it to the mote server router
and what you will get is something like
this
don't don't mind all the Postgres airs
that's just because you don't have a
database running we have the normal
phoenix page but then with what server
running behind it we can use
applications for example to now look
into the phoenix processes if we wanted
to all works the same I'm going to go
back this is pretty much what I just
showed you added to the config added to
the router for the socket added to the
end point and it worked yesterday or at
least we we had the problem that we
didn't we couldn't discover the other
nodes because we have them running in
separate docker containers no way to
interconnect them but through the web
sockets we set up so we needed to find a
different way to discover where all the
other nodes were and what we use for
that is a solution where like I show
that starts we proxy the request strew
whatever no receives them and then that
node will take care of relaying them to
whatever it was meant for metrics on the
other end because they are metrics are
not proxied the one node getting the
request will just aggregate them from
all the other nodes take them together
and make one big file of metrics saying
like hey this node it's using so much
memory and this node is using that much
memory but the question is how do we
find those other notes and I think one
of the other talks already went into it
the easiest thing for us was to use DNS
all the notes are under the same search
so we search for the well obviously not
this because this wouldn't work but for
the one we use internally and I can show
you the code this is actually all we did
because we're using air log we need to
convert the string to recharge their
list then we do a an eye net lookup
for a one and then every result we get
we map to a note question is now what is
a note I'm quite ashamed to show you
this
I wrote it quite a while back a note
it's a struck defined by a name a host
of port and local with a question mark
I'm very sorry about that question mark
the name is just to make sure or at
least the identify for users the
different notes the host is the IP
address or DNS if you prefer like the
host name and the port is the port where
to find the other instances on what we
do in this example is just go through
all the results we get from the DNS
lookup and map them to the different
nodes you can also if you like add your
custom discovery we could use this
because it was set up in the cluster
like this if you have another way where
your notes are still separated and
isolated but there is some logic you can
use to find them then you can just set
in the config that you want to use
custom discovery and point and a
function to do that discovery for you as
long as the function returns a list of
those notes it's all working well then I
got an interesting question yesterday
from someone using web server saying hey
I have my notes connected they are
behind a firewall so I like to remotely
view them through web server but it's
not like they're disconnected among each
other they can just see each other like
a normal like normal connected notes how
do I get web server to show the other
node and yeah you can't really that it's
a mistake and the second question was
shouldn't they do that and the answer is
yes yes we should have thought about
that it's actually funny because our set
up we've never worked with them actually
being connected so we we just never
thought of building in the functionality
to use the the airline stuff that is
already there to get the note
to relate the information so I did right
and this is a nice example a way for
them to do get it to work okay
so let's add it and we'll show you how
to do the custom note discovery
I wrote a method and I just say call it
node info gave it a default false for
local and that local is very important
the local I didn't explain it to now
defines whether the note for that one
sorry this remote note is the one on
that note itself so every node in the
system has a list of all the other one
but that list includes itself and to
prevent it from ending up in a situation
where you get a request that is for this
note but it sees itself in the list so
it proxies the request to itself where
it finds itself in a listen it just ends
up proxying it to itself we use the
local one to define like hey this one if
you get a request for this one that is
you don't go proxying it just handle it
yourself so you don't add up in a loop
as a name I'm just going to use the node
string as it the port just the
configured port so how am I going to get
the remote node information I'm going to
use process messages and when someone
requests the information about a remote
node they need to supply a caller fit
say like hey I want to know what your
information is and what the function
does is use our node info with the
default parameter so saying false this
is not you and send that back to the
caller so the caller knows that this
node exists and where it is which are
BTUs the beauty of this is that these
process messages in air lung work across
the node so I can just answer a pit that
is not on the same machine but they're
on a different machine that is connected
so this logic very simple but still
works through the beauty of airline
so how do we get the information of
OneNote then going to use remote node
and what that is that is the identifier
of a node so in airline yet the
different identifiers can be a name at
and then either the local host name or
whatever what I'm going to do is use
notes palm which will spawn a process on
that
different Erlang node what I'm going to
do is on that remote Erlang node use the
remote node function I'm sorry I'm very
bad at naming everything the same so
this dysfunction they're going to call
that and we're going to pass this guy's
process ID that means that everyone will
get a message from this guy saying hey
can you send me your process information
which they will get and then send back
to the process on that specific node we
all wrapped up in a task and that task
will spawn this on the different one and
then wait for the reply back with the
node information reason we do it like
this so we can do this like I said
before every list of notes requires the
node itself to also be in there so the
first one we just generate node
information with true because that is
the local one and apart from that we're
going to use no list which lists all
connected along nodes on different
machines or maybe on the same machine
but just running on different virtual
machines we're going to use check node
which was above here which will start
the async task of sending a message to
that node saying hey tell me about
yourself and then send it back and
waiting for the response and then using
tasks a way to wait for all the results
of those queries this needs some cleanup
because this is just a short example
because what if one fails then it all
errors out in a non failing scenario
this were
but it is an example to show you how you
can still use the configurability
terrible words to discover the other
nodes in this system does this solve the
problem keine it now works but we still
need to implement it in a way where it
actually doesn't use remote connections
over WebSockets or something else if it
can already connect to the node using
the normal process messages that's just
the waste now I'm going to talk about
extending but how to extend what server
if you want to add more status
information if you want more metrics
more status information on the default
page metrics easiest one to start with
if you want to generate more metrics you
can set them in the config by default we
offer two types Kantor and I never know
how to pronounce this word gate scout
something gate we're going to do gate
gate differences a counter can only go
up or should only go up that is metrics
where you count something it's standard
for Prometheus to use these types so we
just started using them to gauge can go
up and down which for example could be
memory usage which would go up and down
our i/o as in how much IO we've used
should only go up shouldn't go down it
would be weird if it went down how do
you configure those things I've got a
next configuration example here you just
define metrics you say have additional
metrics and my additional metric is
called marbles and this marbles method
generates the actual data so it sets
like we have five marbles six marbles
whatever it's a gate so we can lose
marbles for some reason and we call it
marbles you can also if you have a
system where beforehand you don't know
which metrics you're going to have so in
this example we know we're going to have
more
verbal but what if you have a system
where a customer creates different
stores for example we don't know which
metrics we want for those stores then
you can use a metric generator which
generates the different marbles to show
you an example in the open here the
extending one this one I can run
hearing skills very badly so for the
marbles for example you can return a
list of data and what happens is I say I
have five marbles where the color is
blue and the shape is square flap to
Nibbana them I have eight marbles that
are red and a cube and one marble that
is green and shaped like a pear so how
does that end up in observer right it
automatically reconnects but we switch
ports so doesn't up it's going to say
live demos into everything showing up
metrics as you can see you get the
metrics in there saying shape color and
how many you might also notice that a
note is defined that is because metrics
get aggregated for every note in the
system so that Prometheus or whatever
system you use knows like hey in total
we might have this many marbles but
eight of them are on that note six of
them are on that note and if you had
more notes they would show up here
you might also see that I added some
slight note and show you those I set
those in the configuration as a
generator you can see that the product
pretty much generates it at the same in
the same way so here we already get
marbles but the generator returns the
same structure but then dynamically with
again something that sets altitude
groundspeed then you might want to
extend it not with metrics but
additional pages so you want another tab
in web server that shows data about your
system so we talk for example about task
bunny are other projects that
background jobs you might want to add a
page that shows you how many background
jobs you have running or how many of
those have failed that is a good way
than to add a page there are two options
for pages you can set if it's API only
that is if you want to generate some
data that's only used for automating and
refresh if you have for example a page
that's your static information the
WebSocket doesn't have to be used to
keep asking like hey give new stuff you
have new stuff you can just set it to
zero if you have something that draws a
graph it might be nice to get quick
updates so it turns into a nice graph so
you can set the refresh rate lower like
0.5 something like that so how do you
generate them well you can either give a
map and that will show up as a key value
table or you can give a list of maps and
as will show up as a table where every
map is a row in the table to show you
here I've defined a stable and in this
table we have a test and that is a row
of maps with data and we have a table
that is just one map and they will come
out as
a table with different roads for the one
as a list and this key value table for
the one that's being used as just a map
as you can see again I'm not a problem
developer it's a little bit yeah if
anyone wants to contribute feel free
because I'm open to changes they're
these pages you can generate the one I
just showed you pretty much in the same
way you give a title you give a command
that is used over the WebSocket or in
the API to get this data and a method
function that generates the data then
there is one problem what if like task
bunny you write a library that a user
can use but that user might not have
book server but you still want to give
people who use web server the
information about your library then you
can dynamically add your pages or
metrics using register and the
configuration is pretty much the same as
in the config file apart from that you
do it manually and say what server dot
register I added a line of code above
that so you can just add startup run
this it checks whether webserver is
actually included in your project at
compile time to make sure your you don't
really need to use it yeah sorry yeah
does this work even for users without
what server it does it annoyingly
generates warning saying hey you're
calling web server doesn't exist very
quickly how can you solve that you can
either use apply instead of writing like
in the example web server does register
so apply observer register use the
callback like that or you can set the
xref option in your project to exclude
generating warnings if calls are made to
a specific
a module that might not exist that is I
feel the easiest but apply works without
changing your mix file if you want to
take a look into the code the code is
structured as such in the system
directory are all systems data statistic
code in util you can find all the
observer functionality so that is like
the note list stuff like that in util
metrics you can find all metric
formatting if you are interesting util
note throw the note stuff and the source
directory and the gulp does gif
directory are used to build the web
asset a little bit of reflection at the
end we made quite some mistake we made
the project quite hard by mixing a lot
of concerned the inter connecting nodes
the web interface the metrics the system
monitoring they're all interconnected
and that made it very hard to keep the
project going because there are so many
things that are kind of hooking into
each other I wouldn't do that again if I
were to redo the project we could keep
them more separate keep them as possible
at even different projects the WebSocket
handling can be better should be
improved there were some requests for
security I haven't shown it it is
possible to add some form of authentic
alter ization on top of it but because
it was like an afterthought the
implementation is not great like I said
before notes that are already connected
you need to do use the code I just
posted should have done that out of the
box just connecting to them huh
I didn't see that and the asset set up
it's pretty impractical we started this
project because we had a need for it we
were still pretty inexperienced with
elixir we have been using it for a bit
but we know so much more now so if
there's going to be a version 0.2 we
would split the concern make the note
interactivity better and do the security
from the start and probably get someone
or something to make a nice interface or
diagrams if anyone has any questions or
wants to know more about what we do with
the liquor at square enix just drop by
for a chat
we're always looking for new developers
especially any elixir developers who are
interested and if you want to see the
code examples or download the slides to
review it they're all and github
up next is the break and because of that
we can do a short Q&amp;amp;A but if you would
rather just go and get some snacks that
things that you have out there and
that's perfectly fine so let's start
with some hands okay so nice
presentation
I think lobster looks great I actually
have a question
so observer has some performance
overhead well including production yeah
goes warp server at any additional
overhead on top of observer no we
actually don't use any observer code so
it's opening oh you mean playing that
little bugger because it no no we wrote
everything from scratch so we're not
reusing stuff like that we tried to keep
it at the light way that's possible so
where have my pictures directory so what
it does is it takes some shortcuts it
can take because it's just for
monitoring and not generating pictures I
can do this because it takes some
shortcuts because it doesn't need the
ability to kill or to be detailed it is
a little bit more what lightweight than
the original observer but like I said
that's because the shortcuts were
possible in the monitoring alright any
other question see some hands have you
also considered adding adding traces to
to observer so the ability to create
functions I have to check to do it is
not something we've not thought about it
is just like he mentioned with the
performance overhead we kind of try to
keep it by default is drop-in and
lightweight as possible so there are no
traces available now it is probably
something like it says for the 0.2 I
would like to keep it more
and actually keep the web interface is
something that reports the data it gets
in a more generic way than the pages do
now because they're pretty limited
I think they can't do grab stuff like
that and then write the the of the
observer part as a separate module you
can also include that automatically adds
those pages I think that would be a good
point to add a separate trays module so
that people who are okay with the
overhead that the trays as can just add
or not add that single module to allow
for tracing of that sentence the
question all right any further questions
all right looks like one last round of
applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
