mesh right yes are you doing here well
this is an interesting conference
because it's kind of alternative
languages comforts in a way
now growth of the Erlang contents but
it's now trying to encompass more
languages but I think it's good the
airline conferences usually did try to
become this other languages it wasn't
well advertised because it had fur lying
in the name that's right that's right
yeah mesh is really striving to bring in
this alternative languages and have
people explore them not from an academic
point of view but from the practitioner
you and so that's really cool because
have been languages or conferences about
languages for years but they're
typically academic or irregularly
focused on this one is covering on the
plane so closures here scholars here
Erlang's here a lot of talk about him
being back you dumb bastards did you
have a talk to Steve that I talked about
how
with a benefits and challenges Maria in
Berlin so I was surprised by the fact
that most the attendees seemed to
already have some experience with our
life so that maybe talk easier in a way
I didn't have a the audience seems to
become very very like receptive to these
kind of very advanced actually
technology and new technology ya see it
could be different audience very
interesting like I think people here
seem to be ones that are exploring the
terminals trying to find better ways
during their world
other ways and building their systems so
they're really open to new ideas and a
lot of exchange of ideas that I've seen
already both within the sessions the
questions you really wonderful but also
outside the station so that's maybe the
most important is interesting part right
outside of the stock start exchanging
idea well thank you Steve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
