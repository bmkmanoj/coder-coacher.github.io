everyone is pure joy just joined us hi
welcome to our solution service we
haven't been important those we have
been before polities for confusing you
by building offices within the same
building you know this conversation for
not require notice like excellent I went
to the wrong building this is one in a
number of occasional London Erlang
meetups in very obviously the topic for
this evening is just before we start
hands up those you who presume it
everyone knows what react is yeah as
it'll be done because your colleagues
will beat you up thereby they explain
and you've all been about any more
records
hands up users using react in production
currently okay hands up who's built
intention to use in the future well I
would say a great deal more about react
other than we here are having solutions
and was the try for group who share of
ours have been involved with beginning
try fork was an early stage investor in
fact show we have been one of the react
resellers over the years were close to
do bet365 since then and the other with
now providing react services and support
is TI Tokyo represented by their own
deep here he's plug who's using that
because made the trip over and we like
many others in the space met the news of
the client with a slight depression many
one going discussions room as you can
imagine but could manage to deal so we
were delighted when talking with with
Andy and his boss bet365 we discovered
that there's a deal there in progress
actually doing nothing happened
I'm grateful Andy do you come here today
to explain what you've done what you've
done the future a more particular most
important perhaps how the community can
work with bet365 to ensure that react
the product set around via a vibrant
future life and Yoshida said is who
keeps the keeps the wheels turning
despite the massive traffic so I had oh
ji-hun for me and enjoy yes thank you so
yeah I'm 13 I'm inconsistent about the
manager five department that our work is
named strange leagues min where we
automate work really systems in the past
five years we've been transitioning a
lot of systems Pacific
what I'm gonna do is to go through how
we've used react just to give you a bit
history of bet365 we're world's largest
we see huge huge amounts of traffic we
equate it to Amazon Friday
you see that which begins enormous my
two people on site
transaction systems so now we've got
quite a large to remember that's fifteen
sixteen figures we spend a lot of money
on an IT course what we do develop
Department is large and very anomalous
stuff that sits within its holes for
watching the stuff that dedicated to
driving platforms forward see they've
got a huge codebase trying to get it
down by using a1c sharpen their
they sent footprints there are good
census networks so what I want to talk
about today really is how we subscribers
started to use react four five years ago
it's too much of the situation of their
community
the steps that we've taken to trying to
secure so as I mentioned we've got we've
got a series of systems which we can
plug together the become really the
systems that were talking about the
other other core systems of there's
really key stages in the backlog life
cycle there's cross calculation
summation displacement
there's editing of a bet it's a cash out
settlement of balance and things along
the Murray is various parts of the young
ecosystem so there's a basic key value
store you know we have a casement just a
piano store for what we use it for is
huge days of repositories as part of
that storage engine which sees cash out
is you have the place of birth you have
the ability to close up early if the
results going for you website the time
is turning in the game you can cash out
so what we see is huge spines of
activity around
usually still kissing girls muscle kids
this summer do you see huge spikes and
we are captures with that in particular
huge massive do it helps us with our
real-time settlement system we used to
have a lot of our system a lot of
selling systems are in sickle super slow
it slows ability it can take us 20
minutes to sell things I don't want to
suddenly afternoon quarter times
mister time for us what we want to do is
get money back into people's account as
quickly as possible
I want to get a good customer experience
twenty minutes is a long time at you're
waiting for you we developed a system a
couple of years ago that we took real
time settlement because it really just
set the rehab KB is a huge we recently
put a new employee system in place
perhaps the summation of the bets
platform is its react with an up
occasionally upon in front of it now we
use that we've developed that three four
years ago and went line about three
years ago
it's allowed us to horizontally scale
the placement platform romantic dinners
we took at the time react cause it was
pretty usual to react DT had been
written we looked to the functionality
of CEO duties and we decided good right
it fits and what we needed to do in
terms of scale at the front end taking
huge amounts of concurring rights into
the system and then resolving things at
back end we took that one and module and
put it into the application alady so we
kind of stretched a database of crops
into out of reactant into it's an
application that works really well for
us what a huge amount of us into systems
obviously we use imagine for we've got
seventeen datacenters and growing we
need business continuity and disaster
recovery that's where the Enterprise
Edition area came in we replicated data
everywhere
trucks replicating data we could ruin
some themselves what we saw within the
Enterprise Edition that was there was a
sister from that will you can see that
we would use a huge market react we
yeah so so you see she won't react and
Stewart mentioned in recent months we
sort of it why she was in a little bit
wrong we moved to secure our interests
business critical systems that support
we danced great really the sort of four
or five years that we've been using
react we've been obviously ability
familiar okay familiarity with react
itself running reactors in operation
side and some of the issues that we had
with replication and placing silver when
we went from one for each version to
1024 to step we saw some issues there
issues because the sauce we built up the
internal teams well it became evident
that didn't really like it by Russia we
acted again in securing the rights to
the to the enterprise code so that we
could again secure secure our own future
or we could start to build up build on
the product look like
so a month or so later they actually did
was just real shame
product so at that point we then began
negotiations with the receiver in the
u.s. to acquire or bashers my people so
where we are on the minute with that is
only has changed hands we we are now
just waiting for the receiver to get
approval in the US cause and then we
think I'll take her under my wing so and
once we get the deal worst and I think
we what it's both make this opposition
to really signal our intent is the
discussion in which was also licensed
we're gonna sort of build up to we want
to be a community decision we wanted the
most open it was missing license we
can't I think we look at the mailing
list
patchy to seems to be the drivers of the
voters so that's what we will be going
with you know the discussion is still
ongoing
that was just as she wanted I've got you
to the CEO of the foundation terms of
where we've won
we're similar where I see the situation
of loneliness then we can get back to
those early days where engineering you
know we looked at the papers you know CS
papers and T's that's where we might be
because productivity taking go to CS
theory
we're building reliable almost
indestructible date on this kind of
comes on to where you see the next step
was we will generally agree was license
with take forward that we basically
build out a road map of where we have so
with that in mind what now that's it
barri to rubber-stamp loading what we
intend to do is to release all the code
everything every single thing is going
to get open source license with there's
a committee agree on the supporting
websites come back to life is I know the
doc has been down for a while so I'll
come back there you'll start to see an
activity get home we need to once we
give the
this should be books just on that chair
okay so we got realistic code you'll see
the supporting websites going back to
life and then you'll start to see more
and more community engagement we think
the first step in doing that is a
two-day workshop so what we intend to do
there is in a runaway shop it's our main
development offices in it's an open
invitation to every member that rehab
community anybody want to come along if
you can hit that LinkedIn company web
page in it
you'll see the the me talking change
below that we also see more and more
information pronounced on theirs
because we can get through there into it
I said the invitation is open to
everybody we tend to do is to stop to
publicize what we think our input the
initial room we kind of go about just
kind of 20 bullet points that we want to
hit replication is a big thing for us
one of the things we want to do is is
tactically get to a place where we can
iron out the books
operationally we've seen and then
strategically moving forward what what
does what is it what do you want to
replication typically one of the first
things you need to do to tick talked
about to see the wood for the trees
yeah isn't open invitation to everybody
else but what we think is there one of
those on the other sides will start to
put the size although everybody's in
everybody it's a few minutes about the
room everybody's ideas you know we all
will get together on the top of the 13th
of October politically agree on in
quadrants and we sponsor sickness
forward and then because of the nature
that I presume that's a physical
workshop so it might be there won't be
much energy to join virtually that's one
of the things that we're going out in
the mid so the next the next week or so
what we're going to do is work out what
we think the agenda and time I will
publicize that after going through
 demands what is the logistics of
how really visual side material how on
the physical side being on security
getting people into that building
it's difficult so logistically workouts
and then obviously what we'll take it
forward from there I mean at this point
that that's all we want to what we want
to say I hope it signals our intention
if they're speaking as far as were
speaking to the press and they keep
asking me what you know where you get a
product where you could have run a
technical company within but these
expire or they get produce a product and
absolutely they don't seem to believe
that that's terrible almost any any
questions things like beginning well get
that slide what other open-source
software are you using a stay alone and
you contributing to any other
communities well yeah that's one of one
of the things that we wanted to stop
doing we do use a lot of the source
software in-house what we have what I
said thank you example I mean you've
you've been members of the
now for one yeah there's other such oh
yes there's lots of software Jimmy wrote
do people work topics into cowboy yeah
so it's still gonna try to get out there
how's it going
Woods is is your main goal stabilize it
and just keep it occurring future said
or to expand it to make its funded we
acquire I'm what our first the the
tactical aim is to is to retain the
products well the reasons are we some 45
years ago we did a huge study into war
they took technology take form is we're
having issues with sequel soon and
that's really one why I'm sticking with
some issues that we've seen their own
replication or we held a lot of data
through it and we've very distributed
systems so we've seen you know we get to
educators very quickly what
one-in-a-million is so five minutes into
Monday morning
so you know we've seen those cases wanna
fix them guessed it will sit back here
and then one of the one of the one of
the bullet points and our air muck was
really to to review everything that's
there than the feature sets and see
where in TS you know indexing and can we
get up into
what's it look at it see if it's does
what it says it let's see if we can get
them into a common code base or whether
whether that actually moves against saw
those key principles that you soon
review for me good to see what what
issues you know we almost do give us
assuming that we spotted that X platform
dimension we had to build with indexing
and application learning through
simplicity back into the applications
g65 putting a lot
like in doing this I mean the first we
can get is like what would be on that
what do you want honesty we could secure
the rights enterprise we could just
this is your employer we have to solve
this yeah we've got we've got several
occupations that are probably everybody
who's picked up a line AIESEC knows the
core concepts those Luke - Alexis
business
three or four maybe five I thought that
they should have got the minute it's
there when we built systems and then
we've started to use a little heat not
to do is to is to increase probability
load of people whether dealing with an
issue so if I've got data Chloe through
one system exam lineman flows into an
otherwise it's a little makers wackadoo
non-existent oh this modules calling
this AI module as people try to work
this problems I'm just just go about
loading people with that so the elective
development is kind of doing restricting
a little bit and we need to put it in
specific areas where people are crossing
over
we want to go
it's a Britain's our browser we hide out
of opinion on my name's you twins no
because we come to be Swensen production
so 19 as far as we've gone this is about
they understand I don't see do we suck
the change between 19 and 24 where maybe
some bit less than what Suzy Amis right
now we go up five sacred works Atlantis
college education for my yoga studio is
not a question for you specifically
didn't walk in the room who you
mentioned crypto in 20 it it was asked a
couple of times in the men who this is
anyone anywhere actually using react
security and the TLS like mister
I am using I have a fork of the executi
another is the only is the only model
that I would pick up and say this is
crap yeah I mean the reason I asked
because like you know if you think about
fundamentally what it's doing as a key
value store and secondly and a couple of
things of use big and then you start you
start looking through and there's a lot
of these abstractions and these nurses
coming back to what you're saying
earlier about like putting lights and
the code no no I don't find stuff like
that was like it's in there you know to
say it's tension the code base what's
anyone ever touched it anyway you know
what one of them another one of the act
is it is a review of the studying issues
the issues are you guys using slower
like but we're not our use cases are
very particular so tempting
not wanna use so there's many things to
do tapas to potentially push out that
because a lot of test complexity and you
know you know main list is a little
questions we're concerned it's quite a
big way to carry on and is it other
refuge in using search we've got various
clusters
I was just wondering if you have sorry
but would you find like your biggest
pain points are well what was the most
time cuz you most inconvenience or
whatever like you're like magic issues
issues have amazing replication volume
of data
ship ship around okay so we see if we
have network issues we see huge amounts
of pressure
Q's bills you've never profit one ship o
bunch of so make those routines that
we've run to kill it to notice those
basement we don't want to take out what
was we've done that will then take a
look and see network replication
in terms of general timelines of any
time yeah where do you see a new stable
police being this I think we need to one
of the first questions might be where to
start from
I mean is it is it the head and so most
of the Nicholas was kind of you know
developer date when but who knows how
big potentially could be lots of
interesting things like around the curve
a so I've been working on some stuff
around node worker pools to try and help
manage - I bet there's a hole which
again even at the nine percent stage you
know we're interesting ideas knocking
around there I think I'm speaking with
from the HHS perspective we're thinking
more about starting at two to three and
potentially losing that simply because
it might be too hard to work out how it
was
finish it and for some of those things
they have all the answers
how much have achieved the same thing
strategy well you know we're not close
on that if someone says you know we're
desperate became you Sweeper and I think
most of the teachers they're talking
about with teachers at 70 degrees yeah I
think in most of that fashion police are
still around very active yeah I think
reaching out to many more responded
actually about yeah and I pray she's on
here right right they are now and I
think many customers the way I see it is
really getting those there's a lot of
minds button take this
are you are you happy with distributed
Erlang I think we're all happy we've
we've tried so play one of the key
things is like let's not break things
that's not stability take a look what
you see the the resources like those
questions coming back up as soon as
would Suz the deal is finalized you see
me access to those
yeah thank you very much for doing this
because you write to see bet365 didn't
need to do this you know I think from a
prospective solutions community there is
sufficient advertising interest does
continue
one final announcement before we outside
and finish some call pizza and the other
people there is a webinar that we're
hosting on the 28th of this month with
Monson someone who I should've
introduced at the beginning from EHS I
was responsible for a large parts of
spine to NHS they're just stories a
project that relies on react and we will
be talking about the NHS perspective
we're only out in your particular plans
for it now you'd like to see it thank
you
if you don't know about that's already
covered on our website you'll find a
link to the webinar you can register in
that's the end of the day as I mentioned
earlier the video of this published as
well the slides will be made available
so for those who've got calling for
contacts been making today please
disseminate this as light as possible a
successful community here is as many
people as much of this people react or
block or are they any of these possible
anyway thank you all as I said the small
beers out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
