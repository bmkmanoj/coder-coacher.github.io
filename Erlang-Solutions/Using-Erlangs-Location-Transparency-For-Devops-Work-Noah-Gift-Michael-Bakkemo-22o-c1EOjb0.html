la glee no my name is no gift this is
Michael baka mo and we're going to give
a talk on how we're using or laying it
log Lee to do DevOps work and how some
of the Erlang features have been very
useful to us so a little bit about the
log Lee stack we're predominantly on ec2
we use bongo Python or lang-java solar
JavaScript so we're a
software-as-a-service company basically
some of the other companies that you may
have heard of that do some of the
simplest things like splunk or arcsight
there's those are kind of some similar
competitors and so one of the things
that's happened recently from being on
the cloud is that like this is actually
a graph of a fairly recent a number of
alerts that we've seen over the last six
months and so as you can tell like some
things have have trended in a bad
direction and so one of our co-workers
has experienced this as well so one of
the things we need to do is figure out
well how can we actually fix this and
what are some of the problems that we're
having that are causing these alerts and
one of the one of the issues is this is
a breakdown of the actual alerts is that
it turns out that the processes that
we're running in a cloud happened to be
very problematic and if you look at some
of these alerts here this is this thing
we call a splitter there's actually
solar itself there's you know we had
syslog-ng running you kind of
proprietary demons running and all of
these happen to run within the context
of this utility called supervisor that's
a Python I guess clone of her lang
supervisor and this is one of the
problems is that they all well fail like
so the
some of these external non are laying
process management tools actually
haven't performed like we'd like them to
so basically what we used before was
this python-based process management
tool and for example one of the problems
we've had with it is that we added a new
tool that actually off child
processes and that blew up actually the
supervisor process things against
restart reliably things aren't actually
cluster aware so everyone that's been
spoiled by our laying like other
languages they don't have some of the
features that Erlang has so that was
that was a minus the other thing that
that also made us decide to look at
Erlang to due process management is that
we didn't have good monitoring or
logging integration so we want to not
only have a very fine grain like OTP
type control over the processes but we
also wanted to be able to hook into a
logging company want to hook into that
and actually bring it back to us so and
I think what why not some of the other
process management solutions like God or
or monett I think you know the the
Armstrong corollary on green sponge 10
through love programming which I'll get
to everyone here knows it we need to
heavily customized it like I mentioned
and I think it's also about picking the
right tool for the job and a few of us
knew where lang so I mean I think this
is a great quote you know basically all
sufficiently complicated distributed
systems contain an ad hoc and formally
specified but bug-ridden slow
implementation of half of her lang so
basically we had that so he decided to
actually just use her lying and so then
the next question was well dozen OTP do
that yes it does kind of though but it's
just for Erlang processes so here's
here's an example provided spawning a
process and one of the one of the
problems is that unfortunately standard
Erin standard
out or mixed so so that's one issue that
we had and so the way we actually got
around that was we wrote a little shim
that handled it and that's that's kind
of where the aspect came into it and so
what we finally decided to do is
actually write an open source project
that's not released yet that actually
just does this for users OTP for non
Erlang processes so so now we're going
to get into loom and Michael is going to
start talking about that a little bit
okay so okay so i'm going to i'm going
to now go into a little bit of a demo
mode let's get out of here and i will
probably just be lazy and take a seat
here while i'm typing okay so you can
talk now just so there's actually
something really going on ok let's start
okay so we will get into Earl and
application starts move
so now we recommend that little Python
program is actually written that stuff
and that's good and then this tail
tornado process is actually our our tail
process that we run for showing people
their logs coming through the real time
on what bitch and your heartbeat monitor
from that will show up
where did you kill it I'm yeah I might
have actually killed it but yep yep good
you anyway hey you get you get the point
though so it's not really step because
well we're still polishing the code but
the ID here is we're going to get rid of
we're going to try and get rid of
supervisors trying get rid of God
because we'd better should be an SUV
application also we're going to release
it because one of the major pain points
that we have good of the middle it's it
ok good a lot of dog so this is our
application and this is him doing a
query love the crap the event log abyss
they're coming through that bloom is
actually sending lightning so the idea
here is we're a logging company we want
people to actually log their data to us
this is natural fit but the one of the
main main problems can you go to the
main main problems that we've discovered
and maybe I can relate that I I can't go
to them but I don't want to get onto the
network but I can ok wait is that it's
really actually hard to set up inputs to
actually log to us and since we like
customers or the at least the idea of
customers we ourselves can do this
programmatically from the tool so the
tool isn't necessarily for you guys
because well you are you feeling
as you probably are in homogeneous
Erlang environment perhaps but for the
people who are out there using
supervisor painfully and God painfully
this can help them and they can set up
their inputs easily from this tool so
that's the general idea and if you find
that it helps you great if you want to
contribute to it great that'd be awesome
and it doesn't have to log to us it'll
just lock to us very very easily so I
think that's pretty much where we are so
that were we yeah so I mean I thought
like one of the things we would would
ask is kind of like an interactive talk
a little bit like does has anyone done
something like this before that they
have any concerns about what we're doing
or okay yeah
yeah so we'd like to make it simple we'd
like to make it actually work and entry
and we wouldn't mind tricking it out so
we're free
supervisor
the program those
sorry then so what did was asleep
that's funny so do you capture offenders
yes right so we have a bunch of
different tools in our stack and they
all sort of log differently which is
kind of problematic as well so we have
some apps that have a heartbeat some
apps that have the rest interface for
capturing information some apps that
like the standard air or some of the
like to set it up so the idea here is we
capture standard air capture standard
out heart reports and rust interfaces
that you signal and we were at a time
interval and we'll go through and
capture them and shove them to luckily
or Sheldon where you want my cup full of
the addition to capturing standard out
and standard there he also
pinellas late welcome preciado has a
heartbeat we out of court we'll listen
to that port for you capture the method
sort of like we could become syslog by
perhaps you're throwing it out of
protein
right and if you give us a rest
interface will hit that as well grab the
data throw it into la kiss or
wereallblack URL yeah la cometic you
were on that they have provides that
will say oh this is my time this is what
I've been doing in the last 10 minutes
flat decided to restart something
partners or yes just dies process yes
why some restarted
so the general does the quick over here
the general design is that there is one
supervisor purge but there's a gem cert
actually the fires auction starts the
process and there's a supervisor
watching them so that it will restart
things that and there's a supervisor
above that watching a whole bunch of
those units that have different resource
right so and then there's another
supervisor that is really and circle
it's really difficult in state and
talking to Lee to the other side of the
tricks of these messages yeah plus
supervisors yeah I guess the other thing
too is we figured that it would be nice
to I think the plan is to be free i mean
we have some working code that's i think
we could even release it like like in
the next you know like week or something
just clean it up a little bit yeah but
then like hopefully a bunch of people
like I think a lot of people would want
this and so like we're not we're
probably not as smart as a lot of the
other people in the community and they
can come in and help us make it
something cool I think a lot of people
just do this ad hoc on their own and
we'll list let's fix it for real one
time
and get it done it was kind of
interesting is the we didn't know about
this but the the fulsome thing is kind
of interesting too because it actually
could like work together right so you
can move to Fulton stick those women or
the other where you just to get the
metrics from the vm yeah another thing
that we like about this so one of the
reasons is not out to the public right
now is we have a very specific
infrastructure that other people that is
written to that other people probably
don't know so we provision rpms over
rights care so we use the right Scott
tags and a Jason file is generated for
every machine that informs that machine
about the roles and locations of all the
other teams in the deployment so we can
leverage that and you might not be able
to for example so one of the things you
can do with supervisor that we can do is
and nobody here will be surprised that
we can do but people really supervisor
god probably would be is we can just say
oh I want to do a multicast fire off
this please restart all the Apache
servers in this block of machines and
then fire that off of the network and
just have it work because
the only people who would respond to
that by the attaching machines and they
know who they are so that other ones
would just drop the message immaculate
just make sure when I venture police
they probably are using a glue to serve
as a patent we use moon to supervise the
less processes in our set so yes yes
awesome thank you like a rolling we
started we can do a rolling greaser yet
so it's not the coolest most
groundbreaking piece of software in the
world but we hope it's useful don't we
get some work on Sri better month but
yeah I guess the the thing the the
reason why I think this is really an
interesting technique for lang I guess
to kind of embed itself in the community
is that the we didn't have to write OTP
so instead he already wrote it for us
and so yeah I good have a tool that
actually actually works
in the end of message not that I
expected
so I be kind of curious about the your
experience with with was a god that used
previously beaumont it okay yep and the
discussion that keeps coming up in our
infrastructure is how we saw our I'm not
going in programming language academy
stomping on early gaming's from never
going back up and right now he's modded
on a discussion that we've come that we
kind of insecurity around for a while is
couldn't we just hack together a
supervisor bridge to watch these things
for us it seems like you all you do it
doesn't selling you the supervisor
bridge model you're using something that
fits into the air like supervisory
structure to restart on Erlang villains
yes yeah i mean we could show some yeah
look how are you you right now how are
we doing if it's not a supervisor bridge
oh if we walk back to the other it's
like a gender or watching a port it's a
gem server that that fires off a shim
that starts the program in the shin was
separated the standard air we watch
standard air and standard out of the
program that it started in my shipping
that's the little CSP double that's been
spun off yes holy exactly and yep that
gets restarted if the process does four
thousand the process watch us about the
senator
the PID goes away or if the heartbeat
isn't received from the supervisor
process it will kill itself and if the
supervisor process notices the gem
server notices that the process went
away that died it kills itself the
supervisor then restarts standards so
the two things we have interlude that's
a dedicated supervisor than a gesture ah
so these are these two were supervisors
these are the gen surg oncol right
because these have different research
strategies right so if the research
strategy fails there's the match retries
exceeds the time women this whole tree
will go away that's right so we have to
that's the power and then this guy has
all the information about what these
guys are actually running when you talk
to this guy please start it please stop
it so it's pretty simple design
cool well so it's called colleague
because and these guys are actually
called a lot too and I don't know if you
know that the watch is the watcher and
Marvel Comics universe but we had a we
had a naming competition and there were
a bunch of different names and nobody
liked the fact that their name didn't it
so I just said okay I'm just going to
call all these different things the high
the one two three and four on the naming
competition so that's why it's called
Kali goddess of rebirth and destruction
yeah what's matts with some ugly
business maman we take your logs so if
you're running as observers and cloud to
sort of a standard thing right now is to
write or log discs and that you ssh onto
each one of those servers right there
still up and then you you know they have
abrupt through your logs what we do is
instead of that you hike gulags directly
to us as as the events occur we storing
we index it you can come to our website
with the query or with
we provide text results wraps and it's I
think until all the VCS find out we
still accept 200 megabytes of data per
day for free so choose to actually use
the option to lock your events from your
infrastructure to luckily if it's under
250 megs add a part-owner e and there
I've had assurances from our CTO or
whatever y con that they'll probably be
some I don't know if it'll be 200 megs a
day but it'll be some free amount per
day for just to just walk from one till
oddly from from the tool so you could
use it if you want I mean I know some
people probably might not want their
data off into the cloud that we control
but if you don't care then you can use
it and you'll have a nice aggregation
and visualization yeah I could see how
we could use the the stats from folsom
right and we could we could we could
display that as well so meet your needs
please cut the snow isn't you know I
don't do yes we will i don't know if we
can announce it through the early
yeah actually what's the best way to if
you talk about something a conference
and you're going to coordinate Tigers
tweet I just wait but who listens to
lock he didn't even know who we were
well now okay okay yeah before that it's
just vaporware like this kind of toll
should be built into OTP does yes yeah
there you go separate project somebody's
to find on the internet and start using
yeah that's a good time no problem that
awesome it's just that there will be
code in it and maybe we shouldn't
release that the OTP but there will be
code in it to make it very very easy to
set up the in so the general design is
for each process that your astral
monitoring there'll be a separate input
at Longley and so you can look at just
because you're interested in something
you put separate them out overlay them
so that code OTP probably doesn't want
tiktaalik become popular better untie
your laundry specific back-end included
yeah we definitely it's not going to be
you you download it and then it sends
data to us yeah we just want to make it
very yes to get the data into law yeah
yeah yeah and yes it would be it would
be wonderful this should be part of OTP
but love this problem pretty much the
same way pretty much the same thing we
all have yep again in an ad hoc manner
exactly ASA right and if they would just
there's what a patch from two thousand
nine separate is Brad why do I grab
there and why isn't that in there I
don't know it does anyone know about
that guess nobody really the same reason
that you I driver steel strips color can
see color codes they don't
some like exact time works now let's not
touch it Yeah right okay so in the
interest of let's stop everybody from
reimplemented the same thing over and
over and over let's like make it rock
solid and then finish it off I mean
maybe it should be part of the AOTP
leopard releases yet that'd be great and
I wouldn't I mean because I searched
right I was looking around like why
isn't this tool already there it has to
be asked me and actually it doesn't have
to be but hopefully will
so looks like we finished a little early
unless there's more questions okay there
yeah we need for the oh yeah we could
actually that's a great we could at like
what are the blockers that we have right
now that we're embarrassed about and
then maybe we could find answers to them
now or somebody already has a solution
well I don't know that there's a good
solution for ripping out the stuff where
we generated to Jason cloud for all the
machines yeah murdered lemon yes sure
but the shim maybe well the shin in the
shim was is right now python process and
it's going to be rewritten as a see
process because well we just wanted
something really quick to who cares
about the
it just has to work and it has to be
nice when we finally release it but to
actually test code and get up and
running python jim was just run so well
so you won't see if my function when its
rules but he wanted though when i was
going to be able news i'm shooting for a
month is that too long i'll work harder
three weeks so it's just those things
are saying why doesn't this to exist and
i think the reason is lots of teams are
possibility of themselves and i also got
20 were doing something similar
exactly and and I understand that and I
plan on checking this thing out to more
than just this architecture right I'd
like it to be pluggable commands that
you just plug in and work across your
infrastructure for example the rolling
restart stuff so then if we have it out
there there's a point where people can
contribute stuff to it and they won't be
doing every team recruiting and it's any
and it is funny that that video this
morning was really awesome because the
part where they talked about how you
know you have 2 chron things constantly
you know it's like we have to do yeah we
have to do that it's like Java you know
that it's of all the memory reboot also
we're moving into more of his data
analytics off your logs as well so we'd
like to be for example I don't want to
inflict that on people but we'd like to
be able to offer analytics and action
actionable events off of your log events
so
defining variants that you never want to
be broken in your logs and alerting on
that so all that stuff would happen
where we'd like to provide on our side
our computational power our big solar
infrastructure but that should be a
plugin right should be inflicted on you
guys unless you want so yes we agree
they're all we're in violent agreement
yeah actually that's a probably this
probably reason bar is that we just
provide a plug-in that sends your data
wherever you want no one gives a Michael
back oh thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
