the vice president of something or the
other small furry animals and potted
plants I guess at a company called
ubiquiti networks which is the largest
communications company that you're
basically never heard of we basically
provide most of the internet access
long-haul internet access long-haul
network access Wi-Fi hotspots etc etc
that you use pretty much any way in the
world it's just that you don't know that
we're providing the hardware in and also
in this whole internet of things that's
coming up we provide the internet part
of the Internet of Things and it's okay
that you don't know us we provide your
services and we're happy and that pretty
much works um and that's the quick and
dirty blurb about who we are I'm going
to be talking about well stuff we'll get
into in a moment I'm also the track host
for the DevOps track today and the
general idea is we're going to be
wandering through devops and i won't get
into the gory details about DevOps why
who what and all that jazz you'll see as
the day goes along but what we're going
to try and do is take you through a
bunch of different aspects in the field
ranging from what I'll start with is
kind of a big picture perspective on
just fault tolerance and what you as a
anything from a developer to an
executive to a to anybody working at a
company what you should be thinking
about from a systemic stability
perspective we'll get into that there's
also going to be a bunch of talks Jeff
and Fred and a bunch of others going
over various aspects of essentially all
circling around the same core concept
which is stability fault tolerance
reliability and how we can ensure that
as you know people that make stuff
happen anyhow so to begin with the big
question here is as
a developer or as somebody involved with
the system side of the world how how
prepared are you how ready are you or
the systems that you're working on or
the components of the module to working
on how ready are you to make sure that
these component systems and so on
actually you know work because the thing
is at the end of the day about the only
thing that's constant the only thing
that's consistent is shit's going to
happen now something bad is going to
happen and you just don't know what that
is look at some really basic metrics
about sixty to ninety percent of every
single software project out there is
it's going to fail it just is not just
that somewhere between ten and twenty
five percent of all software projects
just get abandoned as in they just get
thrown away it's like we're not even
doing anything with this thing we don't
care but the funny thing about that is
we're talking about just the software
project which is just code that you're
writing or somebody's writing when you
actually think about the project in a
bigger context as part of something a
company initiative a you know mod you a
thing that's being done for finance or a
thing that's being done for the product
that you're building whatever it turns
out that the actual numbers that you're
looking at are way higher you know how
much higher can get above sixty to
ninety percent well the bottom line a
line here is pretty much anything and
everything that you work on is probably
never going to see the light of day it's
just the truth that's just the way the
world is so you know why even bother
doing stuff well yeah at the point but
the thing is that's waste and that's
waste that can be eliminated across a
bunch of different places the weird
thing about this waste is when you
actually look at what causes most of
this what causes these crazy numbers
what actually boils down to is time it's
the metrics on this are even more
amazing it turns out that
timing issues are responsible for
something like seventy five percent of
everything that gets thrown away timing
issues are like big picture timing
issues it can be anything from I was
late I got delayed I didn't get it done
on time to somebody else's late somebody
else's delayed somebody else didn't get
it get something done on time to
somebody fell ill to whatever you know
stuff timing issues the bottom line is
gotta start thinking about fault
tolerance not fault all and here's the
wacky stuff when we talk about fault
tolerance I don't just mean hey computer
went down there's a hot spare and that
comes back up which you know this is an
erlang conference after all let's talk
about fault tolerance from an erlang
perspective you know contextually it's
all there in arm Joe's thesis section 2
dot 7 or something like that the six
essential components of a fault-tolerant
system which is just stuff that he
cobble together for a bunch of different
places but it's relevant and just to go
over them you got concurrency you know
stuffs got to work at the same time you
got error encapsulation fault detection
fault identification code upgrades in
stable storage cool great all right I've
got the stuff in it what's the point the
point is this isn't about Erlang this is
about everything it's about fault
tolerance this works across not just a
code you're writing the systems your
building heck it works across your
entire company when you get down to it
let's just look it's to be really
precise you got the obvious system stuff
when we talk about company I don't just
mean hey the different groups in the dev
organization I'm talking about the
different corporate strong sections
finance accounting sales support
whatever everything's got to be
fault-tolerant everywhere let's take
this one at a time after all this is
kind of a tech track let's go through it
from a systems perspective so what
exactly do
if you want to break out these sections
and we talked about kind of like big
picture system design what's it actually
come down to start with a couple of
these concurrency error encapsulation
code upgrade just for the you know half
of you who are not aware by half a mean
half of one person who's not aware of
the individual individual components
just explain this concurrency stuff
happens at the same time air
encapsulation errors in a particular
section somewhere don't go ahead and
infect something else fault detection
you need to know that bad stuff happened
basically that's fault detection fault
identification you need to know what it
is that happen not just that something
bad happened code upgrades swap out
stuff put new stuff in without having to
take everything down stable storage you
need to be you need to be able to rely
upon consistent available storage that's
basically it if you have systems that
have all of these pieces in there you
got a magical fault tolerant system it
actually kind of works I won't go into
the details google it plenty of details
anyhow these tweet these three sections
in the end when you're designing your
system when you're building your system
there's one fairly simple magical
solution just keep this in mind it works
just make sure everything that you have
in there is loosely coupled so what
exactly do I mean by loose coupling
writing a piece of code you got a bunch
of different modules in the code the
modules talk to each other using very
strict api's they don't depend upon each
other and you want to send something you
throw it over the wall that the module
gets it and so on great that works with
modules do the same thing with larger
components do the same thing with even
larger components and modules heck do it
across your systems do it across your
bigger systems your accounting system
needs to talk to a hosted accounts
payable vendor
break him up keep him loosely coupled
point is why I mean there's all the
obvious stuff we know why we want to do
loose coupling blah blah blah but
there's a couple of like things to
remember when we're going down this road
loose coupling it breeds trust okay now
when I say breeds trust what you're
sitting there is see what you're
thinking is oh hey yeah these systems
are loosely coupled you can trust him
uh-uh that's not the point I'm getting
at the point is it breeds it should
breed trust in you sorry you should
trust that bad shits going to happen
really trust new stupidity or people
trust that things will fail trust that
you will be affected when things fail
just assume that that's going to happen
the more you believe that this is going
to happen the more you'll make sure that
you're insulated from the vagaries of
stuff that you're not working on heck
you know what you're not perfect this is
entire religion that's made up of the
assumption that you're not perfect you
know so Maxwell believe in that stuff
too if you want to but the point being
that you're not perfect if you're
working on two things they're not going
to work well together something Bad's
going to happen somewhere trust that you
are going to screw up yourself it's a
good thing to do think number two you
can devote more brainpower to a specific
area let me just kind of like get into a
bit of detail about that assume you got
a hundred units of brain power that you
can apply to something anything whatever
that thing is if you're working on one
thing and one thing alone just this
little tiny area this is great you know
it's like me I'm doing this talk I'm
devoting 100 units of brainpower to this
talk which is really depressing when you
get down to it but still 100 units of
brain power by the way I didn't talk
about big units or small units in this
case my units are really tiny but still
100 units of brain power being devoted
here supposing add a whole bunch of
plates that are spinning at the same
time you know
remember those things plates in a poll
and guys spinning and so on I got to
devote something to make sure the plates
don't follow the spinning polls now I
got a problem I can devote some time to
it anytime I devote to that is time I'm
not devoting to you guys which may help
those of you guys that are sleeping but
as far as the plates go that we got a
problem and divided and a conflicted
loyalties and so on the point being if
your systems are not ridiculously
loosely coupled you're going to be
spending more than the absolute minimum
amount of time making sure that the
stuff works together that time that
you're spending on that is time you're
not spending on the component you should
be spending time on period simple plain
math there's no way around that the more
you says keep your system modules
separate the more you keep your
component separate the more time you can
focus on actually getting whatever you
want to get done done it's true analysis
paralysis behavioral psychology has a
thing that basically points out that if
you're thinking of more than three
things at any point in time your total
productivity goes down like drastically
three is the max number of things you
can do at any point in time that's it
done you might be an idiot savant or
whatever you might be able to do four or
five good for you party most of you
aren't I'm not the last thing this is
this is kind of like a bit of an obvious
one but this kind of ties into previous
point to which is the number there's a
bunch of studies that have shown that
the number of bugs per line regardless
of what you doing or what language
you're doing and so on it's basically
about the same by the way bugs aren't
like syntax issues or compiler issues
your stuff it's like actually the deep
bugs issues that you need to fix the
smaller the thing that you're working on
the less bugs you have I mean really
that's basically what it comes down to
simple stupid but it's relevant keep
things loosely coupled focus on the
small stuff so this point somebody
somewhere the one smart person goes woo
performance what about performance we
need to worry about performance you got
things loosely
you're spending all your energy throwing
things back and forth across systems
throwing things you know serializing
objects what whatever objects Java you
got to talk to java at some point
somewhere you know it's horrible but
that's life yeah sometimes he do I'm
sorry I mean it's just bad we do which
makes my life horrible but that's a
separate issue so what exactly do you do
about that performance is an issue well
performance can be a problem actually I
won't take it back performance as an
issue in fact it can be a pretty
significant issue but the important
thing is start with point number one
remember this thing about most software
projects fail dude if your projects
going to fail why do you even care what
the performance is like that this sounds
like me being facetious is actually I'm
very and being absolutely serious just
build the damn thing author is going to
get cancelled anyhow if it doesn't get
cancelled you can start worrying about
performance I've never gone wrong doing
this I've been doing this forever oh and
some of the stuff that have built has
actually worked then been useful some
the ones that weren't cancelled but yet
um so yeah I know every single one if
you're sitting here going ah but no no
no my thing is important my thing is big
I built this minecraft detection app
that's going to have like you know it's
going to show every single minecraftuser
out there and it's going to have like 10
million users on it within the next
month yes absolutely true could happen
but it's not you are we insignificant
little speck of nothing and you know I'm
kind of beating you down on this but the
point here being statistically the
number of systems in which performance
really mattered right at the front and
because of performance not being they
right at the front the entire system
collapsed statistically it is
probability zero that's not you that's
not any of us it doesn't work that way
it just does it so don't worry about it
that's the bottom line just build the
damn thing optimized later be happy
it'll work itself out by the way of
course there's a grain of salt with that
one there may be the specific case that
actually does apply but don't worry
about it so next one fourth detection
and fault identification you need to
know when something happened one of the
components and you need to know what it
is that happened yeah obvious right you
monitor it it's already in your code you
got tracing built into your code you got
monitoring built-in J code it's all good
life is great you got dashboards life is
really really good if it's built into
the app and app goes down what do you do
no no no I wrap doesn't go down we wrote
in an erlang Yeah right famous last
words right stuff goes down stuff
absolutely goes down key point here do
stuff out of band you know absolutely do
stuff out of bed this actually isn't a
joke I've been the pack in my in a past
life I ran a phone company we built this
phone system for small businesses we had
hundreds of thousands of clients
scattered around the country it was
great life was good there was lots of
money and our entire monitoring system
the monitoring system of last resort
actually consists of our proprietary
phone system being tracked by these
things AT&amp;amp;T cell phones completely out
of band had nothing to do with anything
else oh yeah tin cans and pizza string
actually do tend to tend to be relevant
the key point being don't rely on the
system to tell you what's going on it's
going to lie in fact as Anton pointed
out earlier you will end up in the
situation where the only thing the
system is doing is passing the tests
that you had in the system nothing else
is going to be working but the tests
will pass that is guaranteed to happen
last thing bitter heresy here if you're
talking about serious production serious
production systems which absolutely
positively cannot go down and if they
need to go now and you need to know what
happened and where it went and so on and
so forth be polyglot if your entire
systems written in Erlang right you're
monitoring system in o camel or
something search just use something
completely different have people who had
nothing to do with your athlete with
your application development build your
monitoring systems like a completely
separate team working off there or
working on the specs you have specs
right okay get somebody to write specs
and then get them to write the
monitoring system based on those pecs
because that's going to go down it just
is and if your basic if your thought
process behind the monitoring system and
the system that you're building the same
same problem again you can end up with
the system that passes tests but it's
going to be down last chunk stable
storage yeah point beyond stable storage
really kind of obvious you got your
system you put in there this the one
that everybody just kind of goes yeah I
know what I'm doing is just kind of
we're going to write to a database life
is good or you really know what you're
doing you're like ever I didn't or no
sequel database because hey no sequel
you know first to win we're happy or
some such thing whatever the point being
the point underlying point here being
whatever you're building whatever you're
writing don't think of this as storage
or stable storage or even let me take a
step back don't look at this from the
perspective of how am I going to store
my data take a whole bunch of steps back
and think about it from the perspective
of what is it that I'm trying to do what
is it that I'm trying to access what am
I trying to go with this
to take a whole bunch of steps back it's
all about what we call polyglot
persistence which basically consists of
what I call solution oriented stores a
solution anointed store basically is an
environment in which you are building
your system solution first every single
one of your components and this could be
as small as a module it could be as
large as the ERP system for your company
every single component every single
loosely coupled component has its take
on what it needs for data solve its
problem don't retrofit the problem to
the solution it will not work or it'll
work for a while and then you'll have
two problems it will also send now the
care and feed of that store is now a
pain in the air pay so wise guy once
said at the end of the day all you
really want to know is what do you want
the data to look like when you pull it
out of the database the data store and
the thing is you know that there's an
entire track that's going on about no
sequel databases I guess which most of
them are going to be going over the same
thing there's a bajillion different
types of solution oriented stores key
value stores object stores column
document graph they can be eventually
consistent they can be ordered they can
I mean it goes on the bottom line is
it's all at the end of the day in the
service of whatever solution you want
this is the set of tools that you have
available as of December and my
extremely unscientific poll of this has
shown that there's approximately one you
know sequel database added every 17
minutes so hey you got any set of
problems the one thing I'd add to this
though don't write your own I know you
want to write your own I know you think
I can do it oh come on databases are
easy
no they're not they're not writing
databases not easy if you want to write
it a database don't if you're in the a
company that's building if you're one of
the bunch of people out here good for
you guys everybody else don't any of
that is the quick and dirty thing
they're back to the big sis the big six
when you look at fault tolerant systems
in case I haven't hammered home the
point enough this applies everywhere
every damn thing that you do you need to
think across all of these not just one
you're the systems that you're building
they can be little tiny product oriented
things they can be big honking systems
they can span divisions here's an
example this was from an earlier
conversation with somebody out there you
got a product it's this nice complex
financial product that does nice complex
financial trading things and gives you
the latest value of some currency option
that you want to do who the hell knows
what with you built the system it's
gorgeous it's great it's spectacular you
being the developer are focusing oh so
much time on the my new share of some
obscure edge case that you know what
somebody filed a bug report on because
whatever great finance right financial
system well you work for a company the
company's got a financial part there's a
CFO the CFO doesn't care about any other
stuff where the CFO wants to know is how
much money did we make today how much do
you make yesterday how much are we going
to make tomorrow the thing is that
finance department go in and look at
what they use it they're probably using
spreadsheets I'm a while back on my blog
that posted this thing there's an
organization called a Europe European
spreadsheet risk group or some such
thing
they track spreadsheets error
spreadsheet errors that have caused
monster problems worldwide hbu surely
heard of the London whale the JPMorgan
guy that lost whatever there's a bunch
of crap that went on there but a huge
chunk of that crap was in one
spreadsheet inserted dividing by the
mean of a bunch of values they divided
by the sum of that bunch of values so as
you can imagine all of a sudden the
number this is actually the value at
risk that what they thought was at risk
went from being a number X to being a
number about an order of magnitude less
than X oh hey we have only lost sixty
million dollars of 600 million per day
now it's real money the point being this
is the kind of antiquated RK horrific
mind-numbingly dumb stuff that's respond
that's basically responsible for your
paycheck remember finance a ra p so yeah
fault tolerance you do you build the
best damn financial trading system out
there some AP clerk in the accounts
payable dept screwed up a spreadsheet
and you're out of business remember that
these things apply everywhere I mean as
a very very very smart guy Helmuth von
Moltke said doesn't matter how well you
prepare doesn't matter what you do well
he didn't say badge it's going to happen
but that is going to happen and you
need to be prepared for that which to
kind of take this one level up at this
point this isn't just about systems in
everything that we've talked about we're
talking about systems we're talking
about code we're talking about whatever
but as I alluded to earlier you're part
of this larger company you're doing
things as part of the organization
the thing is even within your group now
your buddy the person at the cube next
to you or the office next to you or the
person that you work with you know 3,000
miles away or whatever people fall ill
happens people fall ill oh you know what
that's a tester that's a person
responsible for signing off QA what do
we do hmm but they're ill you know just
get them to go look at it oh no they
can't look at it because they got their
eyes poked out by a chopstick ah now we
have a problem you know stuff happens
you know it is a it was a fried rice
accident things happen um vendors fail
you are oh so happy and then you know
amazon proceeds to like violently and
royally screw the pooch and all of a
sudden your Heroku and you know you're
not very happy on jun 29th that would be
an understatement of near biblical
proportions I suspect but yeah things
happen uh worse you suddenly get a call
from somebody saying hey why is the CFO
in Brazil you're like I don't know what
happened to the money in the bank I
don't know happens okay this doesn't
happen all that frequently nowadays but
stuff happens you know what bad things
always happen and then of course there
is the worst possible one which is the
things that you don't know the UH Ness
Rumsfeld once said it's the unknown
unknowns there the black swans it's a
tail risk it's the stuff that you didn't
expect with the stuff that you said it's
never going to happen that happens and
these these are the ones that kill you
for these by the way there really is no
preparing what it basically boils down
to is just make sure Angela enough so
that you can recover and kind of like
survive when these things come along
true story financial crisis we had to
downsize by let's just say a very large
number and not too personally
go of a very large percentage of my
company it was not pleasant it wasn't
pretty but you had to do that that was
bad that was really really bad but we
survived and as a company we came back
and eventually hired back a bunch of the
people and so on and so forth so you
know it happens but we were in a
position where we could do things like
that just need to be careful so remember
the big six let's just run through the
same thing again but this time think us
part of a company not you building a
piece of code fault tolerant
organization so the obvious thing
concurrency and by the way and I say
what I'm saying organization you don't
necessarily have to think in our me and
development and me and product and me
and somebody else in finance and
somebody else in customer support just
think about different groups in your
same or different people in your group
or different groups in your same
development team and so on and so forth
can you guys work out on multiple things
at the same time ya know are you sure do
you have the hairball micromanaging boss
happens you can't do anything without
the boss saying you look at it you'd be
surprised at how hard how frequently
stuff like this happens if you work for
any company with just more than Oh
approximately 100 people in it you got
some variant of this somewhere in the
company I guarantee you this if you
don't you're really lucky but anyhow
separate story it exists air
encapsulation bit of a trickier one but
remember the QA guy who got his eye
poked out with the flying chopstick
while eating fried rice cool excellent
what do you do is that error
encapsulated it's an error can you
figure out some way around the thing
don't let problems with one group QA is
running behind or developments running
behind or the development of the
interface to the bus is running behind
can we continue with everything else
yeah loose coupling
all of that fun stuff but as a team can
you guys progress by the way the single
largest enemy to being able to do error
encapsulation is something that I call
the executive fire truck let me explain
the executive fire truck say you're the
lead developer the lead forget developer
it's your baby you own whatever is going
on there's a problem some problem
somewhere what's your what's the
likelihood that you go back off
everybody I'll take care of it I got it
I fixed it happens right we do this I've
done this everybody does this that's a
bad thing that's the executive fire
truck that's the executive pulling out
the fire truck going every back away i'm
going to put off the fire put out the
fire it's like yeah great cool wonderful
but you know what how many of you are
there one how many fires can you fight
at one time one what are you doing while
you're fighting the fire you're not
doing anything else what should you be
doing everything else not fighting the
fire it's an important point don't pull
out the executive fire truck just don't
put it away throw away the key fault
detection fault detection you need to
know when bad stuff happens to take a
little lesson from the airline world
there are two sides to this think of the
difference between Lincoln monitor you
need to know when something bad happens
this is people in that organization that
group that team need to be smart and
well-adjusted enough and self-confident
up to tell you that something bad is
happening even better to tell you before
something bad happens yeah oh my gosh
we're not going to be able to make the
delivered deliverable that 0 was due at
eleven-fifteen that's bad hey Mahesh
we're not gonna be able to make the
deliverable due next week that's much
better one that's the link side of
things monitor yeah you know what you
need to kind of pay attention to other
people are doing
to do that and of course no executive
our trucks just remember that fault
identification this is kind of like a
subset of the reporting bit when you
guys are talking to each other when the
teams are talking to each other don't
just say hey Bob's ill he's got his eye
poked out for the chopstick sorry tell
me what that means Bob's ill can't
finish the QA thingy we can't deploy can
meet the 5 p.m. deadline which means
we're not going to be able to make the
release of the product next week oh now
this year folks interested because
that's what the CFO cares about the CFO
except for a passing interest doesn't
care about Bob in the chopstick at all
fire truck so code upgrades what's a
code upgrade when I talk about
organizations what's a single most
common code upgrade like thing that
happens in a company you hire someone
how's the onboarding at your company
fred just joined Heroku what's the
onboarding like don't answer that but
the point being what's the what's it
like most places I've ever worked it's
this seriously oh these are my companies
by the way and I'm actually really good
at this stuff up trust me on that not
for that guy though but usually I'm
really good at this but the point being
typically the way we tend to do this
thing because we're all alpha males
tragically all alpha males here which is
really sad but still roll out for here
so what we end up doing is we're like
yeah there's the water enjoy that's a
problem you gotta have good processes in
place to bring people on board showing
what's going on w a more productive oh
in the last one this is a horrible one
stable storage the thing about stable
storage what stable storage for an
organization
standard rule systems practices standard
mechanisms by which you can do things so
that when somebody leaves and somebody
else comes in they know what's going on
I don't mean this what I do mean however
is if the CFO leaves and you get a new
CFO that person can come on board
quickly if you're the person who's
absolutely in charge of all the
interfaces into RabbitMQ decides that he
or she is much better off working for
klarna and you know heÃ­s themself off
to Sweden hey the next person you bring
in plugs right and rapidly how do they
do that not just on boarding or working
with what the specs I'd mentioned
earlier the ones that you know nobody
ever writes writing is painful writing
sucks writing is a good thing to do
right I can't emphasize that enough
anyhow to bring this whole thing to a
conclusion at the end of the day when
you're writing code when you're not
writing code you're just interacting
with people when you're building out
your team when you're expanding your
team when you're building out systems
when you're doing anything involving
your professional life maybe even your
personal life but that's except we're
not talking about that year when you're
doing anything ask yourself just one
simple question no is it safe is it
going to work just look at it from the
perspective of what's going to break I
can guarantee you if you look at it from
that perspective you're going to find
stuff that's going to break if the
question is or if the statement is yeah
that's probably not going to happen oh
yeah it's going to happen I guarantee
you that so just remember that part and
with that I'm done
so any questions by the way the flying
chopstick incident actually happened I'm
not making this up I patch it wasn't me
but it actually was it was a separate
story i'll tell you over beer at some
point but it was not good funny but not
good right so okay so you can get crazy
paranoid about this stuff yes absolutely
true you can just go down the rabbit
hole of every single possible thing that
can go bad but the point here isn't
analysis paralysis the point isn't
therefore don't do anything the point is
set yourself up so that when the stuff
happens you are in a position where you
can recover that's important it's about
agility it's by the way agility not be
agile development and scrums or whatever
it's about being in a position where you
can react rapidly and survive something
happening the loose coupling thing I
mentioned the point is when something
bad happens to all the other teams and
think about it this way I mean again
basic math let's say there's a ten
percent probability that any particular
team is going to screw the pooch great
got ten teams the odds of it being some
other team very high the odds of it
being you ten percent so the key here is
don't depend on them and that's a point
I'm getting at make sure that you are
largely decoupled and that
at the end of the day that's about
mocking and test Suites and making sure
you have got simulators and making sure
you've got mechanisms why would you can
test load which are reasonably accurate
and simulate the load that you are going
to hit but don't depend upon actually
you know racking up computers and saying
okay turn yourself on and let's see what
happens I know these are stupid things
but I've seen this happen so true story
a colleague of mine a long time ago was
given this very simple task there's a
nylon hawser a big nylon rope that tests
the breaking strain on the rope how do
you do that ever trust me because I know
nothing about ropes what I do is that
Google test breaking strain of rope and
it go okay fine you know there here's a
company that tests of breaking strain
our ropes and you ship it to them and
they sent back and they say no 17,000
pounds per whatever the hell it is the
appropriate metric is my buddy was an
engineer so am i but he was like this is
what he did for a living kinda as in
mechanical so what he did was he
yeah worse he actually went to Nebraska
and he built this thing this by the way
is absolutely true build this whole
thing in which he attacks two weights to
the end of it hooked the Rope up to a
motor started spinning thing faster and
faster till it snapped and you what the
RPM was I know by the way there's a
whole cage on top of the thing because
when it snaps what happens to the
weights they go flying off you don't
want to be there when the weights go
flying off so he stood on top of the
thing while it rotated and then it
snapped I got a picture somewhere of
this whole crazy Rube Goldberg
contraption and when I said why didn't
you google this he's like oh I never
thought of it that's the point you know
it's just assumed people are going to be
reading stupid things just disconnect
yourself from the head
anything else if not thank you all again
appreciate it next we have Jeff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
