introduction I'm yeah I should only
showed us a little when I was posting
this talk I thought let's talk about
this and then it'll drifted a little bit
but this will come back in the talk
somewhere so that that's how it is so
quick check in a nutshell I will for
those of you that haven't seen it yet i
will show you a little bit about what
quick chiggers and i will give a little
bit of a demo and how quick check works
and then i move to to kind of the in
this suitcase that we watch that one we
were using quick check so a little bit
of background here so this morning John
gave a keynote John CEO of quick cuick
and he already explained a little bit
about quick check but that was very very
short so I will try to to blow that up a
little bit and give it a bit bigger
contact so a property that's the the
whole thing well it comes down to you
want to specify what kind of properties
that do hold for your system on the test
your software instead of saying oh I
write my test cases and and this is what
that you do you say I write a property
and this is what it should do and from
that property then we can generate test
cases automatically so that's the whole
idea don't write test cases that's
boring labor-intensive and you will
never write enough instead you generate
them automatically until you find a test
case that actually fails and this this
automatic generation is based upon
random kind of choices depending on the
property you have but you randomly
choose certain things and at a certain
moment of time you may feel get a
failing test case then you want to
simplify that failing test case as much
as possible you can think of this as
when you have a test case in the field
which fails what are you going to do
first thing you try to do is to make
that test case simpler to try to
understand what the actual work in the
software is that should also be done
automatically because as soon as you can
do that automatically you save a lot of
time and time is this thing we have
leased off so you automatically simplify
the test case until we find a minimum
test case that fails and that's the one
that you're actually going to present
the user and that is necessary because
in particular in random testing you
always have a lot of kind of random
noise around and you really want to have
only the necessary part of the task case
that gives actual need a failure so in
John's talk this morning he showed the
reverse of a list and the minimum
example of in which the list was not
equal to itself and you reverse it is it
1 and a 0 and not a 0 only because you
can still reverse that so that's the
basic idea so instead of writing test
cases you now automatically generate
those test cases from properties and
there's a misconception of where that is
used because most of the demos we give
we normally show that only kind of a
little piece of code in order to quickly
be able to convey the ID but of course
and that that's just for the purpose of
the demos you can use the unit test but
also component testing or whole system
testing that that still works equally
well it's less work better testing and
more fun and we'll show that by means of
an example because that's better so most
developers day they think I you know
writing tests that that's useful but it
gets quickly very boring and actually
that that's the case so what we want to
do is you want to automate that and by
means of an example this is the ticket
machine or ticket dispenser do you
notice this thingy is in shops often you
take a ticket and then you have a number
and you cure yourself and by the time
your number comes up you you are served
so that ticket dispenser is a nice
example has a very simple API the APR is
basically taking a ticket right that's
your API call and there's one more thing
you can also when you have no tickets
left anymore you can put a new role of
tickets in there so you have an API
which consists of two commands take and
a reset and that's the whole idea of
this ticket machine so now I want to
show you what we do with that API we
start with the API on the test we
generate randomly a sequence of calls to
that API so we make a random sequence of
takes and reset
and we do another random secrets if we
run that and we run that until we find
failing sequence of commands that do not
really do what we expect so that's a
test case which fails and then from that
test case we can kind of pick out
certain things which are bored so we
shrink that test case back to the
essential commands needed in order to
provoke an error and that's our minimum
test case and that minimum test case is
then reported to the user say hey your
software is incorrect they didn't work
it's the same as writing test cases by
hand so this is how you would write an
ailing a test case by hand you would
write reset the take take take the
preset take that's a remnant test case
right you just come up with that but
this is not a test case yet what's
missing the expected results so you have
to put the expected results in place in
order to say what you actually expect
you so you expect 123 on those takes and
then you lose respect a 1 on the next
stake after the reset okay to expect to
resolve is important and that also
should be in part of your property your
property is in this case a state machine
depending on the state of the system you
should have a different results because
it take doesn't always result in the
same value it depends on the state the
system is in what value it depends upon
and the way you can encode that is by
having a state machine describing the
state of the system so the generator for
test data is a state machine
specification yeah that's how you should
think of this you generate test cases by
having state machine saying what you
should do and what the state is the
property is done very trivial as just
says run a generated sequence and check
that the post conditions we make post
conditions those are the the 123 here
that's that's the post commission that
those post conditions actually match
what you expect from the state in the
model okay so we have this state machine
which generates a sequence and the state
machine in the bottom keeps the state so
this is the API calls and these are the
states in our model in our quick check
world telling me that there's a 1 a 2
and a 3 after the reset reset should
return okay and then the state is a 1
and if i take when the state is the one
I get a 1 back and when I take when the
state is to do I get it to back that's
that's how that works how do you write
that state machine well you're right as
an airline so in this case I have a very
simplistic state machine there's two API
operations in each API operation has a
number of functions connected to it and
the name of the function of the function
is the API call is in the function so
reset arguments shows you the arguments
that you can have in the reset call all
right you can do a reset but recent has
no arguments in this case so i generate
the empty list as my arguments which is
then I call the function by doing an
HTTP GET to my web service i will show
you in a moment how the web servers look
like and i can reset it by resetting the
state to what that's my my basic idea of
my state machine for the reset and then
the take has something similar I have no
arguments for the take I when I do it
take I call my web server with an HTP
request take and the next state should
then be state plus 1 right because i
took a ticket mistake should increase so
that's the whole thing my post condition
says the result that I get back from
this HTTP call should be equal to the
state plus 1 because that's the ticket I
have taken that's always a design choice
whether you want to do it equal to the
state or to the state plus 1 but that
this is how my web server works there's
a precondition telling me that I cannot
do it take if I'm in undefined state so
when I start an initial state I cannot
do this take because I have no clue
where the tickets through all this right
so i have to wait doing it take until i
did a reset so with preconditions on the
api calls you can say well this api call
you cannot get do because you you're not
in a state that that makes sense and if
it makes sense I don't really know what
to expect here so I you better not do
this ok let's do the live demo Dan and
hopefully that will work fine so of
course I have wanted to do this a bit
larger than just
simple airline module with this process
that does this I wanted to implement
this whole thing as a web service so I
wrote that in elixir it's a nice little
Phoenix Phoenix server and I have it
running here I think so this is my
safari and I have local host their 4000
and not well where is it here we are
don't know why it didn't load but yeah
it's my elixir server right it has two
buttons a reset button and a take button
I used to think of that in a shopping
you have that running there and you come
in with your mobile phone here's your
mobile phone let's open a mobile phone
your window is your mobile phone and
from that mobile phone you want to take
a ticket all right so you go into the
local hosts in this guy you have the
real and you take take all right and you
see it already jumped a to this is
Safari so far just a look ahead so it's
already taking your jacket ticket I
didn't even press return but ok fine i
press return I get a one back because
that was to take it I actually really
took right it's all cashing that so I
can do another one I can take another
one I got a tool back yeah you can
probably not treated but it's not very
much I gotta do back and my next ticket
now is a tree that I can take and I can
do a reset and if I do a reset it this
jump to one before I even hit the return
key but it's reset so this is nice you
can test this manually you will spend
many many weeks of doing that you can
automate this with selenium all right
then you just push the brothers but you
have an HTP interface so you can just
call everything directly and that's what
we want to do so now we want to do some
some real testing here in order to test
I wrote my test state machine and this
state machine looks slightly different
from what I just showed you before it's
a quick check state machine in which i
do something slightly different the
reset is more complex than the reset i
showed you on the previous slide the
reset actually has an argument i wanted
to show you that even the arguments of
the AP articles can be randomly chosen
so the research
argument is a natural number and a
boolean the boolean stands for do i sent
a reset with the value or do I just do a
reset as i did in the demo what so if I
just do if the boolean is false I will
just call the HTTP request on reset but
if the boolean randomly chosen is true i
will actually have a value there which
is randomly chosen natural number and i
will do a reset ? value equals and then
the number that's the parameter of my
HTTP call right they often have those
kind of HTTP requests where you have
parameters but of course you want to
test both things you don't want to test
only with parameters 0 but this means
that or parameter 1 this means that you
reset with parameter one that should
have the same result but there's also a
valid request so you want to test that
and therefore your reset next also has
two different branches either you take
one that's the default case all you take
the value that you have passed on to
that and the take is very similar to the
one I showed you on the slide with the
difference that I introduced an error
because testing is all about finding
errors and if you don't introduce errors
you can't find them so I introduced the
error on the mobile side right so this
is this is wrong if I do it take next
then my state is not changing so I will
see an error appearing there and this is
also something i didn't show on the
slide but you can choose your weights of
your different API calls you could say
in this case you don't want equally many
resets s takes because that gets very
very boring to do all the resets so I
say what on average generate ten times
as much take API calls as all the other
API calls which is the reset or chicken
you can steer your random distribution
in all kind of ways ok then it started
go to it well I test from the airline
chalon bit old-fashioned I don't use
rebar here or mix you could just mix as
well but let's do it from the airline
shell I compile my module just to make
sure that this is the code I'm running
and I start quick check say
quick check ticket equus e and then
there's a property just property ticket
and I run that and let's move it up a
little bit such as you see it better and
yes this is better let the test what is
the test the property Oh problems got it
oh she s yes yes I considered absolutely
so a dozen setup starting eyebrows yeah
and then it says for commands that you
generate with the specification in this
module you do the following you run the
commands yeah and that should result in
history and the last state you you are
in and some result and the result should
better be okay and if it is not okay you
print the commands night well you're
always printer commands nicely if its
failure and then you check the command
names that's more for statistical reason
so this is kind of sugar for what you
normally do this is automatically
generated this is part of the Emacs
macros as well this is the property you
always use when you do state machine
testing so yeah and when you do this you
get this following fail in case you when
you do a reset in this case the kind of
default preset because this is false you
get a 1 you get a 2 and it says all post
commission violation because I really
didn't expect that to the tool because I
saw the one because I didn't expect it
to because my model says it should be
one I never updated the state in my
model you get some shrinking making it
smaller but it doesn't really get it
smaller because you already have come
the minimum case I was unlucky here
let's run one more test see if I'm a bit
more likely now to actually show you
some shrinking and no i didn't and no
yeah okay a little bit of shrinking it
shrink the true to false actually but
you see if you're the true and 0 then
the zero issues that's a first ticket so
there's some shrinking going on and now
we're swing to the default case which is
if there's an error in the default case
is more valuable and it has one attitude
and you have an error so hmm then I get
more resets but that probably will
anyway find this this arrow rather
quickly and this is kind of the best
distribution I want okay so let's fix
the error and go here and say this is
actually s plus 1 alright that's my next
my next value so I save this I recompile
and I run and now you see I'm passing
lots of tests each dot is a sequence of
resets and takes and it just passes that
and gives you the output you want you
can of course take another number of
tests if you want you can you can set
that so I show you now how you test and
web surface basically by using the API
and that in a relatively easy way and
then I and at the end I print how do
distribution of the different API calls
was sixteen percent was a reset and
eighty-three percent was it take super
nice but what they are actually test I
tested the ticket machine in such a way
as I did in my actual manual test
opening one window and set to take take
take what you really want 10 people at
the same time pressing the taken the
reset buttons right that's testing
that's really giving you some some some
value is there any concurrence event
that screws up the surfer well it's
Phoenix so you can't really screw itself
but assume that you have a web server
which isn't really good that you would
be able to find those kind of
concurrency books so how would that work
can we do that in a simple way i think i
have a few slides on that actually so
let's jump back to the slides and
express that property more clearly so
what do I really want the test I want to
test these kind of situations where you
put in a new roll of paper you put you
reset the counter and then you have
different customers coming in and taking
different tickets all right so you do
with take and take and they are
concurrently so what is it good just
outcome a good at tests outcome would be
that this person there's a one and A two
and the other one does it gets the tree
that's a good test outcome
another good test outcome would be that
this one gets the one that one gets the
two and this one gets the tree that's a
very good test outcome it's very simple
and there's another one which is good
but this is bad right when two people
get a one there would not be appreciated
then you still have the fighting in the
shop which you did try to avoid so you
know what's good outcomes you know
what's bad outcomes because it's a very
simple test case it gets really really
difficult if you get this test case if
you say well let's make it slightly more
complex then you have 30 possible
outcomes so you can write this test
anyone if you can write this test
because you know we have airline you
spawn a process you spawn another
process and a third process you let one
of them do a reset the other ones take a
take and you collect the information
when they have done the stuff and then
you say okay let's try to write down to
validate whether this is a valid test
case and that's where the problem is all
right because you have done to write 30
possible correct outcomes and there's a
very big risk that you will forget one
of them so there you have you have some
some problem so writing unit tests or at
least this kind of test for concurrency
is really giving you a headache and
therefore you don't want to do it so and
what do we can we do with quick check is
well we can actually do this
automatically you can do this validation
automatically what is needed for that
it's difficult you have to be able to
write the world parallel without
spelling mistakes right and that is not
easy i can tell you but if you can write
parallel in the property then you will
generate parallel test cases and if you
don't also run those parallel test cases
in parallel then indeed you test the
parallel case let's do that for just for
the fun of it because it's quite quite
fun to see that happening so I go to my
specification and a type parallel
without oh no no see it's so difficult
but I hope it comes correct and
otherwise the compiler will complain so
that's fine oh yeah I'm testing the old
one sorry doma because i'm running a
hundred test and don't want to interrupt
my server but what I can do in the
meanwhile I can show you how the the
time of jumps from one number to the
other it's a bit slow because I only
pull every so many milliseconds but you
see the testing going on so that that's
quite fantasy let's get some numbers
dead ok done so let's compile it the
specification and let's test again and
now it has the parallel stuff right oh I
found an error all right and it's shrunk
so the error i found was that i actually
get the sequential reset in the
beginning and then i do two things in
parallel the first one is taking a
number and the other ones also taking a
number and then there's a little bit
more but hey this one gets a zero and
that one gets a zero that doesn't sound
right and i get a zero because i did
zero in my reset with true as an
argument so what's happening here is
after shrinking I shrink this too well I
don't shrink it at all very very poor
shrinking ok so you would have them to
run the same test a few few more times I
can run also auto test and see if it's
better oh this was a very long test case
which shrinks very nicely all right
sometimes you're just lucky in the demo
so this one strange 20 false which is
absolutely the default case and you do
two takes in two different processes and
both get the one back so that's really
nice so this is how that works now I
have explained quick check and I hope
you understand to what we can do with ap
ice so people normally get lot of
enthusiastic about this oh this is
fantastic and we can we can do all kinds
of nice things you run the sequences we
can it parallel testing but do we always
need to re-implement the software as a
model because what i showed you here is
basically what's in the code I mean
there's a little state and if you do
take of course the state to state plus
one yeah and the answer to these
questions do you have to re-implement
the software is no all right you don't
have to do it for you
systems it's an artifact of all those
small demos we give that gives you the
impression that we have to do this but
if you give a big system as a demo no
one will understand what this thing is
doing so that goes better but I give you
a story a real real life story about
about this and it's about a complete
system it's a cloud orchestration system
it's called Project 54 it's an open
sources a project on github and we were
asked to test this with great check so
it's cloud orchestration it manages
private and public clouds it's based on
smarter ways this was also large
containers it's a relatively complex
system it's self hosted or you can
actually host somewhere else it's a
distributed system highly available
eventual consistency is react in the
bottom there's lots of things happening
there all right so the architecture is
relatively simple you have an REST API
hey that's good because we like that
then this authentication layer there's
some kind of business logic and a
management layer and our ages that
actually take care of the virtual
machines that are running in the system
it's very general architecture and the
whole thing is about sixty thousand
lines of code this is including all kind
of packages that you you get in when you
when you want to build this stuff so
there are lots of libraries that are
well tested already and that that are
put in place so this I think is a nice
challenge to let grit check run on and
the question is do we have to implement
the whole system once more as a quick
check specification let's test we have
operations one of the operations is
creating a vm that is an important
operation all right so when we want to
test this we call create in the API but
you can't do that because we have to
authenticate first so we have to write a
little bit extra for the login we have
to make sure that there's a log in
command you can be logged in or you
cannot be locked in fine we do that then
we created an M Vijay get in all of what
look at the vm and give me some
information back from the vm and that
fails and it fails because the create is
a single miss Lee
and that's very very typical for web
services you're not going to sit there
and wait until the vm is both which
takes three minutes and I said oh by the
way now you can do your next operation
you can also cancel this operation no of
course you can't cancel that operation
because it's already done all right so
you really want the responsive API but
you do things in the background so
that's a singleness so that's where the
time to come from this a singin asst api
testing so what can you do well you can
write a test case that creates it waits
for three minutes what go get a cup of
coffee and then you do get and then you
you do this action with quick check you
can imagine you do generate lots of
create and you are just waiting like
that so that's not a very good today
it's utterly Schlow testing it's very
very hard to test around just started
machines because you have to take this
three minutes then relatively brought so
you will always be in the city in a
stable state so a very little
interaction with just started or just
stopped or whatever and race commission
testing you can completely forget about
okay so there are more commands than
just creating you can create and if you
create you have to wait a long time then
the system is running and then you can
stop it and you can have to wait again
until the stopped and again this is an
asynchronous API so you really have to
wait there in order to be sure that you
stopped you can of course asked to start
it immediately after that you stopped it
but you know that the systems are going
to say error and it's very hard to know
when you can do this without the system
saying error and checking that it
actually was a successful operation to
stop them so you have to distinguish the
different kind of errors so this is how
that would look like this is a small
state machine for one vm but what you
can do of course while you are waiting
there you can create another vm right so
thatthat sure your goal you want to each
black hole here gives opportunities to
do some other testing so that's where
you want to go to and the idea is simple
you perform actions while waiting what
do you have to do for that if not wait
at the end of each operation but you
have to pull the system
before each other operation so you have
to implement the cyst in your system and
the test you have to have an operation
which you can pull for am I done this
the vm exists is the vm stopped things
like that you have to be able to pull
the state and then you just wait until
that has happened this is super trivial
shift of waiting after that you've donut
too now I need to do this I better wait
until it can be done and then you can
run lots of those things in in parallel
you still have to wait a lot it still is
slow testing but the guy doing this was
very happy with this solution because
it's a simple solution and a word for
him so in what sense it revealed 25
errors in the in the system this very
simple mobile reveal 25 serious errors
what some are more serious than others
in the system and the test so that was
good because that means and the system
was already running at the customer side
so it's nice to find those things fix
them and get further what kind of errors
did we find we found timing errors race
conditions type errors but calling a
library with the wrong type of the
function incorrect use of library api's
because it he uses a lot of libraries
and sometimes he misused the API of an
underlay library would find we found
errors in the documentation as of quite
fun because of course you implement the
documentation in API errors in the logic
system limit errors errors in full
handling and actually go incidentally
also an error in the hardware that one
of the disk broke while testing and the
thing is that that happens in real
systems and it was very good it happened
during testing because it showed that
there was no fault tolerance against
this to happen so there was a kind of
the nice thing takeaway had to write and
change the code so you could wonder now
ok this is all a lot of big system say
two thousand lines of code we showed a
very small graphical annotation of the
state machine how much work was this
really all right how much effort was
there inviting this model what
it's copying the logic anyway can tell
you although the system had sixty
thousand lines of code our critique
model was only 460 lines so we had to
write 460 lines of code to make this
testable to test this and find those 25
errors and my claim is that any
reasonable test suite for sixty thousand
lines of code would have more lines of
code than 460 just to test this all
right we found all the errors it the
system is since then very stable we
might have missed some kind of corner
cases because it's still very primitive
testing but the payoff is enormous if
you have such a big system you can
inform on sexy lines test it relatively
extensively you really feel that yeah
this will scale with larger systems and
that's where I am open for questions
yes coverage was run while we were doing
this I don't remember exactly this paper
about it but I think we covered about
sixty percent or something fifty sixty
percent of the lines which is quite
logical because we don't cover the error
cases right there's a lot of code there
for handling the when something goes
wrong and you don't really cover that
and we don't cover all the possible
features with this simple model but at
least sixty percent of the real
important part of the code we recover
with this yeah and there's another way
of coverage and that is what kind of
scenarios through your cover do you
cover the creation of two state machines
at the same time the same statement you
you create a state machine and you
delete it directly often and things like
that I think we go from basically all
possible combinations of doing that kind
of strange things that's a different
kind of of coverage yeah
you can run quick check in different
notes so you could you could start this
often and run different versions but not
to the same machine because you will
break the machine right so you have to
that's true so you could say instead of
the standard commands you make longer
sequences that's called more commands
you give it a value say more c'mon Stan
you can ten times as long sequences not
necessarily better because you find
something shrinking will take much
longer but you can certainly do that if
that's there but you can run them in
parallel with parallel commands but only
the last part and you will do some
things in parallel the other thing is
indeed to spawn of different web service
because you will do not want to
interfere the tests should not interfere
with each other unless you use different
names of the virtual machines and you
would say well my implementation
actually can handle different machines
differently and then then I will work
again
so you missed the first part yeah I
think in this case it was long in the
model itself in at the stage where I
write my reset function and call the
HTTP server before that I had a polling
function and the poll infringers have
got a general one but this was in the
model itself yeah sorry it's yeah yeah
that's all now on the whole whole
project five who is Ellen yes it's
amazing isn't it yeah there was more
reaction so why do you need that all
right yeah what's in there yeah
I would keep that separate and eat and
just use the API to talk I mean this
this is in some sense I put it in the
same repository which you could
definitely place it wherever you want
it's a client right you make a
multi-client implementation and your
hammer your server and where you want to
do that is up to it up to you but I want
you are you we have to write it in
Eleanor an elixir the specification so I
would keep it probably suffered from see
stuff and java stuff in the parallel
thing spawns parallel connections is it
spawns processes that do the AP articles
in random order because you have fit in
in parallel and there's nothing else
then following the model x and then when
it comes back it it records for that has
seen comes back and say is it logical
can explain what i have seen in my
parallel processes and will report an
error if it cannot explain what it has
been seeing in the parallel processes
the reason it crashed yeah yeah yeah oh
yeah I didn't show you that the reason
it's crashing because I'm a very bad
program and I wrote this code all right
I I introduced a race commission in the
actual controller first of all I thought
okay you cannot do this because you're
right this is this is Phoenix and
Phoenix will make sure you don't make
mistakes like this so I had to try a bit
hot and I got actually a mistake in the
Phoenix framework by an end user code
and I think I'm not completely alone to
make these kind of mistakes if you get a
more complex system where you have
databases and all that kind of stuff
it's a bit hard to get it into such a
simple system but so the reason is I do
a read here and then a right n plus
and of course that's moma tomek so you
should have done a read aneroid at the
same time and I would have booked but
and I can uncomment this code and run it
again you will see it passes but yeah
each execution in itself is then merge
well you look at all the possible into
leavings of those things you get back
and say is it yeah okay okay there is a
way try to test these kind of things
when they are worthy where we don't want
to wait that is that you on the lowest
ERA the one thing that takes time here
is actually to boot deviants and you can
emulate that so you've got an emulator
that sits under and to test everything
else in the system and that emulator
will be super fast if we have sort of
mimic a creation of the beams and then
you can test
yeah so that's a good point is this good
point you say it's 100,000 lines even
this is it also a realistic value what
what you do I don't know but it's good
and then if they have more test cases so
I think that's true if you write manual
test cases the space is much bigger but
i also like to comment on the last part
you said well you can emulate that and i
propose that to two hind switches
they're the kind of the author of this i
said you can you can just muck the thing
he didn't want to do this because they
really want the system testing and he
really found some things which are deep
down in the operating system by doing
this so there's a trade-off there what
you want to do yeah yeah and you it's
relatively but if you have an emulator
you use plug it in you can still run the
same kind of tests but this goes 10
times faster were the thousands of times
faster than what the dish now you have
the question yeah so the polling I
didn't describe the pulling in detail
but of course if you have to wait
forever they never end get a timeout
then you have to get a timeout saying
hey this is more than three minutes it
cannot take more than three minutes now
I really raised this and you shrink to
the minimum case that provokes that
timeout so the polling is not just
waiting forever until it happens here
quick check to test consistency across
who knows it's slightly more and I don't
know how much more but you know react
probably so there is a model for react
with testing Ria's eventual consistency
yes Joe John do you know how big that
model is no yeah so yes there can be
done in about 500 lines of code if you
hire a job okay any more questions okay
