through I'll go very fast glossed over a
lot of stuff
they'll be on github as soon as we're
done here all right so whitespace
language will go over the language
Halifax and parse it example code
another example and this is where this
stuff is gonna live whitespace is an
imperative stack based language only
significant characters are line feed tab
in space everything else ignored
operations are an instruction type
followed by a command and the
interpreter maintains a stack and heap
data is base to spaces and tabs are 0
and 1 line feed and of number first
digit is sign labels are similar the IMP
is the high level operation we have
stack everything to keep flow IO stack
for example so we see stack is
represented by space a space means one
of these is going to follow next push
duplicate swap as indicated by the
command on the Left arithmetic similar
addition subtraction etc arithmetic
takes the top two items on the stack and
that's what they offer eights on and
replaces it with a result keep access
more interesting it takes the value to
store and the address from the stack and
similar to retrieve flow control you can
work locations in the program and do a
subroutine jump or a unconditional jump
as dictated by these labels IO output
the top of the stack as either an imp I
mean he has a number or a character and
similar conversely read a character or a
number here's a program
pretty uh pretty simple right and so
this is with spaces and tabs replaced to
make it a little more clear a little bit
and this is for normal people
so mr. white that this application
allows you to define it in textual form
not just in white space to make it
easier so this simple program and it
guesses on what it might output given
that this is an early focus talk someone
called it okay all right look second
parsing need to take the stream of
tokens and ultimately get a form that we
can programmatically operate on let's
skip over some that looks in parsing
stuff but leeks is a built-in tool in
Erlang OTP very similar to the UNIX to
Lex except they just added an e to it
get it the output from Lex leeks goes
into the parsing stage also similar to
the UNIX tool yak with an e replacing
okay early all right and so on the
bottom here we see this is the output
and this this list here is what my code
walked right on and so we'll skip over a
lot of this is just how we define the
lexing specification these are macros
you know defining each of the operations
similar other operations and then here
are the rules based on the left and the
input on the right is what gets output
which goes into the parsing stage
similar here you can include early
encode that can operate on that as well
and so the parsing specification has
these tokens which are the output from
delux and here we define on the right is
what this is what we're gonna get in a
doctor decoder link to execute the white
space program so similar here these is a
tuple what we're gonna get
and again our lane code can be included
in here and so this application I wrote
it can execute white space programs
execute based on the textual form we saw
and convert back and forth to districts
so when we won a program extract the
labels first and keep it in a map of the
label pointing to a line number or index
in the list of operations so we can jump
is we need just jump into the list will
maintain a stack of integers that
as a map and do jumps is necessary so
here's one simple operation stack push
so we see the first argument is the
first element of the operations stack
push and the number and it just prepends
it to the stack arithmetic add similar
we got the first two elements on the
stack and then add them and replace what
had been their heap a little more
interesting we get the address and the
value from the top of the stack like we
saw before and that goes in that's goes
into the map the address went into the
value flow I'll skip over some of this
we just used the label to see where in
the list of operations were going to
jump and upon return then we just
recurse again I oh this is read a number
just get it from standard in and push it
on the stack it push it into the heap so
in the documentation there's a standard
white space program which they define
like this just a lot of uses a lot of
these operations and it just is you
would never guess from this it outputs
one to ten references here and this will
all be on github shortly and thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
