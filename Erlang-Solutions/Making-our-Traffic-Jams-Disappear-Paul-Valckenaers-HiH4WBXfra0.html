are doing the day long in the domain of
intelligent traffic systems that i'm
going to present mostly the strategic
issues of how to apply airline to real
hardware in the real world and why it's
being so such a challenge of doing this
until now so then in a generic way i am
looking at developing what an operating
system does the four computer systems to
do have an in IT infrastructure offering
similar services to the real world and
if you look at the core business of an
operating system it's a resource manager
which is managing the resources in a
computer system it has a low tolerance
on overhead because everything you
you're going to use other computer
resource to do take better decisions you
have to earn back by the other decisions
so low tolerance for computer overhead
but easy allocation de-allocation
elements there on the other end if you
look at the real world resources they're
very expensive but it's not so evident
to decide to make the right decisions
because if you have a drug which you
want to deallocate in barcelona be able
to reallocate it in rockateur you have
to find a way to transport the drug
itself to the other place so it's a
different working point which you have
to handle and doing this I basically had
to shocking events in my career for the
first time when I learned about mobile
driven architectures issue using LMK you
don't need
anyway but the model that is driven
driving the application is a mole of the
computer environment you will be sitting
in it's nothing to do with a model of
the application world in which your
software is rubbing second thing
Internet of Things there is an
architecture there and they're talking
about resources and entities and the
resources are talking about are located
in the internet and anything that's
outside the internet is an entity and so
in a way because you have so many
interesting things to do within the
computer network IT people are kind of
racist in the sense that anything inside
the computer network is the prince and
the princess anything outside the
computer network is third-class citizens
wait you're not looking at it and you're
more or less from my perspective on
developing an Internet talking to things
instead of an Internet of Things so you
can allocate and manage the allocation
of boundless and computer course but the
parking space which you really need is
not a resource you're going to allocate
that's an application using the Internet
of Things so basically having IT people
making splendid things to do information
processing you say why can't the
application experts manage from there so
why is it not working by just offering
superb IT solutions and services and
then have application people do their
thing in their domain the problem is
that they still are working like in the
pre intelligence period we're doing
something in a more complicated way is
simply too expensive and impossible so
people in application domains are
focused on the decisions in their
application domain and performance in
their application domain and to make
infrastructures this is exactly the
wrong approach because an operating
system in a computer is not telling the
applications what to do it's make it's a
resource manager which tries to be as
agnostic as possible
on what you're going to do with the
resources domain experts basically do
the wrong thing they focus on the
decision making making and because of
that when they start to build but should
be an infrastructure they are
implementing a lot of our three
constraints you cannot make cars and
trucks drive on the same way of the road
without deciding it's left or right and
in 20 different places you take
independently a decision and when you
start to integrate things Jeff conflicts
on one side they drive left on the other
tart they drive right and when you
integrate there's a problem and what
domain experts don't realize is that
they're really entering new areas of
development and they don't know so they
think they know what are the best
decisions but basically they're not
capable of making the best decisions why
do they know less than five percent of
what will be possible in their
intelligent domain intelligent traffic
because they're only a small part of it
once things get deployed for real a lot
more people get involved have their
inputs contributes bring valuable
information in traffic as long as its
research and development the real users
don't get involved so you don't know how
they will react how they will use social
media to group and indirect as a group
so they you can't know what your
objectives what your decision-making
mechanisms have to be before you he'll
already have a full deployment so you'll
need to be able to to postpone the
choices you want to make the working
conditions are unknown just to give an
idea what the order of magnitude is if
you go from small scale applications to
large-scale applications after the first
Gulf War the people had to extinguish
all the oil fields which were on fire
and they did the first calculation based
on
current practice and they concluded they
would need about two to three years to
put them out in reality it took a couple
of months just because of the different
scale at which you could work solutions
which were developed on the fly like I
had a Russian tank on which they put two
jet engines and it just blew out the
fires which is something which is not
practical if you have one fire somewhere
at five thousand kilometers away in the
world this will happen in all these
smart worlds and intelligent systems
you're going to build this kind of from
less than five percent according to
current calculations based on current
insights to full deployment so if you go
to full internet of things we know less
than five percent of what will be
possible with it and domain experts
don't suffer from a lack of arrogance
and thinking they know best so it's very
hard to convince them that they don't
know it yet and maybe the only argument
they will listen to the will be open to
is that they will be beaten not by a
larger community or by people who bring
key technologies from other domains that
they will be beaten by themselves not
themselves in the future so after their
five years of experience in doing it for
real on a larger scale they will be the
experts which will be their insights
today by at least one order of magnitude
and probably more and we have lots of
those domains today's which are
intelligent factories 2000 grit smart
healthcare all those domains actually
are probably very plausibly is that they
are below this 5% of potential known
today which will come out later on so
the issue is how do we make an
infrastructure which is application
domain knowledgeable and still agnostic
regarding all the decision making
choices you have to make and the thing
is that instead of asking what are the
performance indicators and what are the
key objectives you start by liking or
these
identifying what's relevant so what
what's your problem domain and you don't
rely on expectations you rely on on what
certain and in in thousand traffic you
know there will be roads you know there
will be cursed other people will be
commuting bringing kids to school go to
work go to shopping on the way back and
how they make decisions in there how you
arrange it that you leave out of sight
in when you're making your intelligent
infrastructure I say you have to look at
what exists to be in a question not to
act or to decide or the truth is the
question so it's not optimizing it's
really to reflect what exists or at
least if you want to first say implement
services which have to rely on
expectations be be prepared to undo them
and let's start with things which is
most familiar to IT / experts undo you
do by resource allocation so if you want
to be able to implement an
infrastructure services which later on
might be out of date deprecated it's
important that they are submitted to
explicit resource allocation so if you
want to replace a service say deciding
whether you can allow something on the
power grid and not make it crash which
is too restrictive because at the time
you don't know how to make it less
restrictive then you have to explicitly
submit it to allocation in the
allocation so that either better or more
adapted customized version comes along
you can remove in a controlled way the
old version and put a new one it this is
something which we are familiar with the
application domain specialist definitely
not now to the core design principles on
how to design for the unexpected to make
it successful an important criteria
there is critical user must you make
artifacts you make software components
which have a certain complexity have a
sighs and you can only do this in a
viable way an economic viable way in a
technically viable way if you have
sufficient critical user mass and what
we learned is that you have to mirror
reality according to system architecture
where you recognize resource types these
are instances activity types activity
instances and that what you need to
build them into what I call a VIP
architecture which means that every
activity has kind of an electronic
butler a process that's going to manage
its activities and it's going to look at
the resources to find the right
trajectory the right sequence and
combination of services to get the
activity executed it's wrong to make a
resource knowledgeable about the kind of
activities it needs to execute because
then it becomes so specialized that you
don't you're not able to get sufficient
users for your resource to support it
and of course you need to be able to
make composites and aggregates which
vary in time which are not static in
order to build larger systems and keep
critical user us if we go the traffic
your resource types are very
recognizable so they are all the
elements which support transportation of
people and other things and your
activities are typical the commuting
ad-hoc trips multimodal trips and so on
the types are saying knowledgeable about
how so the road segment type knows the
physical properties of a road segment
the weight of the trucks are allowed to
put on it if there is a bridge across
what's the maximum height all those kind
of things they are not they don't have
any knowledge about specific instances
and the same weight with say activity
types delia specialists on knowing how
to have such activity can be executed
but there is no link to
an activity that's physically happening
in the real world to maximize against
critical user massive separate software
entities which have a reference to their
type and ask duties are real managers I
mean they don't know anything except
manage and one as soon as you need to
take a decision that takes some specific
knowledge they asked and type they asked
a technician to specialist what to do
the reason to do that is that you can
implement a very limited amount of
managers which can manage a lot of
different types in different activities
so these types have a real-world
counterpart which really exists or has
existed or will exist they have a state
they have a history and importantly to
really get rid of traffic jams as you
will see the resources need an agenda
and your activities need intentions the
butler's manage intentions so that you
don't have to stay on your smartphone
all the time in order to avoid traffic
jams to the computer process that will
know how you commute you only have to
tell it when you do something special
same with the resources they have a
process which is managing for on behalf
of them now why is mirroring reality
such a good idea to design for the
unexpected that's because is the only
known artifact in the world that's very
complex very big and fully coherent and
consistent it's not necessarily in the
state you wanted so you have two cars
which have conflicting trajectories the
consistent state which ends up is not so
nice now it's people injured killed in
cars becoming worthless but the real
world if you say time is now it's one
steak it's fully coherent it's fully
consistent the oldest say IT artifact
which we know complying with mirroring
these are maps and if you have two maps
which disagree on something that one
says it'll bridge the other one said
there is no bridge the third one says
that your tunnel you just go and have a
look at reality so if you as long as
your IT infrastructure is mirroring the
real world
you're very nice properties to make it
big and still consistent coherent
working well if a map is lacking some
information adding information to it
it's much easier than if you have
something that's a functionality and
something's missing like you have an ERP
system and its assuming that the world
that you make products by assembly and
then somebody is taking cows and turning
them into steaks and he wants to use it
ERP system as a bee or what forever to
manage his business he will discover
that it's like trying to talk to a deaf
person about music I mean the air p
system is not able to track what's
what's happening there and give lots of
misery very important to get it working
well is that you have to have a single
source of truth mirror so you cannot
have the same road segment reflected in
20 different places which have different
ideas especially if you go to the
instances to the vicious state which
have to reflect the state of what's
there in reality what do we do with this
we basically have to say services which
come out of the research and one is not
very say revolutionary it's just better
forecasts so because we reflect
intentions of our users in traffic you
have more information than what's
currently being developed and being
installed where people basically track
the current state as good as possible
use historical data and based on that
they predict where there will be
congestion and how long you will be
congested and so on these kind of things
is nice what I call for business class
because if too many people see that
information they react to it and instead
of having the predicted traffic jam you
get a reverse I once got well announced
train strike in Belgium and so it was
announced days on beforehand it also was
spring and very nice sweater
and I had to be somewhere at the end
other end of Brussels which is about the
champion of traffic jams of in the world
at half-past nine so I basically but I
didn't really have to be there at half
past nine I had to present somewhere
half past eleven so I said oh what the
heck I just leave at half past eight and
if the traffic jam it just arrived late
because of this strike everybody
expected saying double the normal amount
of traffic jams well actually if the
speed traps had been installed already
now their speed traps then they were not
at speed wraps being installed there at
that time they would have caught me
because it was almost nobody on the on
the highway it had been a normal traffic
jam one hour earlier than normal and
then so many people to decide that this
was a perfect occasion to work in their
garden there was nobody on the wedding
so the problem with forecasting in this
kind of systems and feeding it into the
users is of course that the providing
them feet forward the information can
just invalidate the defeat for an
information in our system the user
intentions are propagated on this mirror
of reality and that this is if your
change your intentions you propagate a
change so if you get a forecast of
traffic jam and people change their
invention then they will see the shift
and they will be able to adapt the
forecast so you you get better forecasts
but it's still safe very much a better
version of what you will get anyway hmm
i'm talking about propagating intentions
and i'm telling you that i want to keep
the decision making out of my
infrastructure now intentions are the
result of decision making so how can we
design for the unexpected and still in
they provide something within this
infrastructure that's say the result of
decisions it's actually a relatively
simple step but it's it in the real
world it always is something that takes
decisions maybe
just physics if you have a ball and you
drop it now it's gravity in the laws of
nature that take the decisions but there
is always something that takes the
decisions if you get to the point now
all decisions have been taken from a
practical point of view so you can
mirror the decision-making just like
your mirror the existing of the
existence of roads and crossings and
whatever in commuting activities in the
real world so you instead of having
expectations of what the decision
mechanisms will be you make it model
driven by models of whatever the
decision-making mechanisms are now if
you go to automated systems and your
coat is not too complicated that's very
easy to have those models because the
code can be its own model it's only when
you have humans making the decisions of
natural processes or compute heavy coat
that you will have to do the effort of
making approximations maybe use some
machine learning and use that to
propagate the say compute predict the
intentions and propagate the intentions
across your mirror image of the real
world because if you want of generate
predictions and refresh them quite
regularly of course it's necessary that
your mirror image can execute virtually
what's going to happen much faster than
reality so that the slower your real
world is and the more important is the
more you can apply this design for the
unexpected because you want to say
propagate intentions and see what's
going to happen in the real world it's
key to have this single source of truth
design there's no point in having 20
versions mirroring your Road segments
and have people propagate our intentions
but not all on the same Road segments
because the thing is going to predict
congestion simply because there is one
reflection of the road segment it sees
all the intentions coming by vitriol
execution for tomorrow morning at eight
o'clock it's self model is able to
deduce the level of congestion
you get and it will be able to predict
congestion yes or no if you have don't
have a single source of truth design
then you get into problems because this
is what's happening with the car
navigation systems and they all have
their own private model of the real
world where you need one they need to
talk to a single one at the traffic
center so that you can see what's
happening with all the other how you're
going to have interference from all the
other users in order to get a useful
prediction so what do we do we built a
mirror image of our traffic system and
we are able to do virtual execution
using models of the decision mechanisms
whatever the decision mechanisms are and
keep in mind we are always in early
evaporate refresh mode which means that
this is not something that plans gives
you the result and stops now this is
something which keeps on working and
your intentions are regularly recent
through the system so if something has
changed you will see it and you will see
the consequences then you can react to
it so it's a you're going to use this
virtual execution so you have your
intention you generate you to execute
your trips virtually because everyone is
doing it on a single source of truth
model every part of the rotary
infrastructure can predict its future
state and instead of having an
assumption that highway will be 100 km/h
every section of the highway knows
exactly what it's expected loading will
be and can predict the expected
congestion and where you do this virtual
execution you get expected travel times
which correspond to the congestion
levels
if you want to eliminate traffic jams
it's not enough to just have better
predictions so you need to have your
users follow instructions if you there's
no way around it so you did you cannot
have me traffic jam free road
infrastructure or travel system without
people following instructions so at some
point people think we need a big brother
somebody who is taking all the
information is going to make all the
decisions for us and you already see
that you would be living in boarding
school where Mother Superior takes the
one-size-fits-all decisions the
advantage of having uses following
instructions is that a lot of male
modeling challenges which remain in
which are intrinsically very difficult
will be resolved by users following
instructions it's not so difficult to
model say how Road segments behave but
if you look at crossings you can get
butterfly effect and so the right of way
to the right of crossing just arriving a
little bit earlier later can make a
difference on who gets first into a road
segment about the next crossing the one
who gets first has to turn left and
there's lots of traffic coming from the
other side say a small change can have a
big effect on what's happening there if
you get into a more managed system you
can you can see those things coming and
you can have small local improvement
algorithms to avoid the negative effects
and get the positive effects and anyway
get more predictable traffic the way we
do the virtual execution are not going
to detail in detail on this talk is
actually a combination of more classic
traffic modelling from the traffic
experts and intention propagation which
comes from intelligent manufacturing
control systems so the classical traffic
models flow models are very good at
modeling the back propagation so what
you have is at a certain point there is
short
of capacity so you get traffic jams and
people queue up and such a queue will
propagate downwards against the flow of
traffic with a certain speed but emit
less than 20 km/h so it modeling these
kind of things traffic people are caught
very good at very efficient in our
approach this would be requiring a lot
of iterations to get the same result
which they get in one iteration well
they're not good at because they don't
know how they don't take in the right
information in the forward propagation
how the traffic density will propagate
forward in the network and we use our
delegate multi-agent system to do that
coming back to the fact that if we want
to get rid of traffic jams at some point
you will have to follow instructions the
good news is that most of the time it's
enough that you follow your own
instructions because you put in the
decision mechanisms you propagate it
when you see that your ID is not very
nice that you're going to have the
opportunity to change your intentions
Yuri propagate your intentions and
basically you're able to two adult and
if there is no real capacity problem if
it's just a matter of take say agreeing
amongst each other what Intel what what
decisions to take it's enough that you
are obeying your own instructions all
that's necessary is a kind of social
control and this can be on a voluntary
basis if people have the right culture
or this can be more enforced if you
propagate intentions and later on you
decide to change them or deviate them
when you really are driving along the
road and other people get problems with
that of course that there is no free you
don't go for free and so this will have
some repercussions anyway you do but
you're so you make your intentions known
to the rest of the world and you have a
kind of commit
into that but nobody has to tell you
what these intentions will be you can
actually as a user freely decide about
it you can ask groups of users use
social media or whatever use the system
itself to coordinate and make nice
decisions so in all those cases you
basically don't need to obey a boss you
obey yourself except of course when
there is a real capacity constraint in
which say policies need to arbitrate or
you can as a group decide okay then
there will be a traffic jam that's also
a policy but when the users are able to
work it out amongst themselves there is
no reason this kind of infrastructure by
government or whatever traffic
specialists that this functionaries who
run it should tell you what to do you
can just get the first shot and so you
follow instructions that you follow your
own instructions that's basically what's
happening so this is work you have your
e Butler is managing your traveling
maybe other activities as well you're
commuting whatever is going to propagate
is going to look at a mirror image
consisting of airline processes going
though of what possible executions are
for your needs and the e-boat where is
the one who knows what are you don't
cares and what all you needs and what
you are hard constraints and it's going
to do this routing on this map which is
basically a collection of connected
airline processes which mirror the road
infrastructure these road infrastructure
elements give answers which account for
the intentions that are already
propagated so if you decide to commute
at rush hour and a lot of other people
too already want to do that you're going
to see that it's already very heavily
congested Yuri Butler knows that you
don't mind getting up early or your
workload permits you to arrive late at
office and it's going to look for better
solutions yell selection mechanism
selects from these are your intentions
is going to propagate your intentions
and these aren't there going to be added
to the information in the roti
infrastructure part and other users will
see say what your impact is on only
expected loads and this way you get with
constant refresh you get a continuous
image of current state of the traffic
future state of the traffic and
commitments of the users to stick to
these things lake of course can always
be nice to everybody and change their
intentions in the way that nobody has
problems if they change their intentions
in a way that somebody has issues with
it there are policies which apply and
only in the places where these real
shorts of capacity you need community
policies to manage that and there are
some simple like pricing but also anti
starvation and priority based on that
you did is already for three years
things like that so no not this is it's
only money which can handle this what
are the kind of gains you can get with
these kind of systems is that you can
optimize the time in which you're
sitting in and the location in which
you're sitting in traffic jams I mean
there are some places where there is
shortage of capacity but it's nicer to
sit in a traffic jam in your office or
at home and in a car somewhere on the
road so you can organize the system in
such a way that the the slots on the
constraint parts of the road are
basically reserved and in order to get
to your slot you wait at home or you
wait in your office or you wait in a bar
in order to do something useful with
your time and then when it's time to
leave you just go and the system will
because everybody makes his intentions
clear even if you stay to the last
minute in your office and then you go
out and then the traffic jam the
bottleneck is five kilometers away your
right of way to do this slot is priority
if somebody is going to stop you there
and not you
and because of that the capacity of the
bottleneck is not used then of course
you need to have a mechanism there to
say not make this something that happens
a lot of very frequently and what you
basically wanted abolish is that you
never have to say if I had known I would
have acted differently you know up front
it's like the buses telling you the
subway the metro telling you how long it
will take to the next one to arrive if
you go to the airport it's the display
tells you how long it will take before
your suitcase is passing on this kind of
stress less living is going to be
offered by that and the second thing
which you basically want to implement
the air is that good deeds are rewarded
in the sense that if you stay out of the
if you are nice to other people in a
don't care way that you don't get
penalized for that so what you basically
have is that because people having to
sit in traffic jams do this at home you
avoid that anyone else with nothing to
do with the traffic jam is also sitting
within the traffic jam typical example I
living somewhere in highway going to
Brussels I have to get on the highway
but not to go to Brussels to go to the
other side and the traffic jam is
directional Brussels because i had don't
have a system to have all the people
going to brussels wait at home until
they have their slot to brussels i will
be stuck in a traffic jam and I've
nothing and actually have no connection
to the cause of the traffic channel so a
lot of people i think more people are
sitting in traffic jams without being
part of the traffic jam than the reverse
with this kind of prediction and the
ability to have commitments from all
users you're able to only have people
who are affected by the bottleneck
having to say take it into account and
time the tire say adjust the time at
which they leave home and will be
sitting in the congestion part but all
the people who don't have to be there
they will not be stuck
behind somebody was queuing up to go to
Brussels so you get a lot of say win-win
situations free lunch situations simply
by building an infrastructure in which
you can say you can have commitments
because of those commitments you can be
nice to other people and because of the
system you will not be penalized because
you're nice and so you reserve your
parking space because of being nice to
other people you are at 10 minutes later
at home awake into something useful with
your time but you're not penalized by
the fact that now you don't have a nice
parking space and you have to go
somewhere we have to walk a lot of
distance or paid in a paid parking space
the the application of of the no traffic
jams version it requires that almost
everybody participates so that's the
let's say that difficult thing about the
whole solution so you can predict if you
can wait at home instead of sitting in
traffic jam in the car you know up front
how long it will take to travel but it
only works if almost everybody
participates and the almost depends how
much of your capacity you have to keep
us keep a spare capacity the less
predictable people are the less you're
able to go to full utilization of the
capacity but it doesn't work if only say
thirty percent of the travelers
participate so that the migration part
of this kind of solutions is to start
with managed parts of the infrastructure
so you can you don't start with the
whole road you start with the bus lanes
which we are now the buses are only
allowed to travel and maybe in some
places the taxis and you people who
participate in the system are allowed
when they get permission from the system
to also use the bus lanes and you can
make sure because of the commitments
that the buses and the taxes will be
traveling as fluently as there are now
only you don't lose the spare capacity
because you are able to use bus lanes at
full capacity the decision to have more
bus lanes becomes easier
and it's important and also the decision
to have a bus lane going completely
through the bottlenecks becomes easier
because you're not losing the capacity
today it's always trade off if you make
a bus lane you're going to lose
infrastructure capacity if you apply
this kind of systems you keep full
capacity last point I want to tell about
what are the major obstacles for you to
enjoy this kind of comfort first of all
the traffic specialists which still
believe that they know the right
objectives although they have no idea
how their customers travelers will react
once they're deployed things and they
still ignore that it's possible to build
an IT infrastructure a first layer which
is agnostic it doesn't make the choices
and that they can with much less effort
try out and change the different
versions of how you're going to manage
your system of raw and they also have
say selfish preferences in the sense
that they like to see the money go to
things with which they like to play with
them that's typical thing the other
thing is ignorance occur and concerning
privacy technologies there are people
who just think that privacy is a luxury
which only criminals need if you're in
self-organization it can guarantee you
that big brother is the way to get a
criminal government in the end fence so
if you chase if nobody can hide for big
brother if will catch most of the
criminals but the ones who escaped will
be big brother so it's so you need
privacy including privacy against the
government not just against other users
because the the way the system works
it's like the way hotels work so for
normal users the design ensures privacy
because you don't see who is say causing
the congestion on the so you don't see
what other users do you need privacy
against insiders hackers inside fix
enter or
governments which it won't abused it and
currently there are two bottlenecks
their first of all other people don't
know about hard privacy by privacy
enhancing technologies using
cryptography that's the one part which
is missing and the other end people are
doing research on privacy are not
interested in middle of the road
solutions because hard privacy tends to
be quite expensive computationally at
some point where encryption especially
secret key encryption is cheap and there
are solutions where you basically have
privacy unless a number of court orders
force service operators to unclose to
disclose information so you they are not
developing systems where you need to
have a court order in Geneva and
Delaware to know whoever has been at a
certain point in traffic so the
technology they know how to to ensure
privacy actually in principle is very
likely to exist but the people involved
either are blocking the privacy hope we
don't want it or are too extreme to
fundamental istic in the direction of
enforcing privacy there ok so to
conclude an open there's some time for a
question answer so I think looking at
the kind of system I'm proposing I don't
have to argue to an airline audience
that this is the natural way to
implement it because and it's a scalable
long because if you start to assign your
processes on hard airline notes it's
very easy to get locality here so you
don't end up it's very unlikely end up
with loads which have to talk more to
other notes then they have to do work
internally so it's very you need a
single source of truth design where you
need to store like all delegate mass to
propagate and distribute no local
information and if you look at what's
making classical IT systems like ERP
systems fail or cross frustration is
because they try to capture real wealth
interaction
to data formats database tables or
whatever and that's where it doesn't
work it's like trying to help your
grandmother with our computer by used
writing a user guide and then you can't
talk any more about computers to your
grandma so that's what classical systems
are basically trying to do and I've been
telling you in a more general sense how
you can make infrastructures application
knowledgeable without remaining
infrastructures and not becoming
specific solutions and how to do it
including being able to forecast to
anticipate to be proactive by having
intention propagation and agendas for
the resources involved okay fine I'll
take some so we have about two minutes
for questions are there any for you yes
as you use the system on data based on
gps that existing car this is an ongoing
european project and what we're doing
now is that you have in kind of never
model which is a micro simulator which
models the real existing situation to
which you connect this system and the
users in a deployed system would be
using smart phones and apps to be
connected to it but we're in a
development phase so this is currently
we're developing this in another line
with suma micro simulator connected to
it which is I think modeling Nottingham
and then probably lower them to run it
on in simulation this is still say quite
some distance from a real world
application this kind of thing so what
is the core identifier of vehicles is it
the GPS in cars or is it their mobile
phones what is the main focus in your
project well it's kind of agnostic to
how this happens but I think that the
the model there is basically that's the
car navigation system order if you not
necessarily driving in the car you can
be a bicycle or a public transport and
it would be your mobile phone smartphone
and basically model is basically that if
you get this kind of
double travel the expense of having a
smartphone is quite justified so this is
the basic assumption ok we'll do one
more question and do you know there are
already at least two vile applications
which do this they collect traffic speed
and GPS location and predict where
should you go to avoid the traffic and
one of them being ways which was
recently acquired by google for a huge
amount of American candy rocks and other
one has been made in Russia is Yandex
traffic jams which is basically the same
they collect traffic data from mobiles
but they don't have all picture but they
use some rest statistical calculations
and guesses to predict so well you can
download waze right now and go on the
street you think it will
it uses your GPS to see how fast I you
move and then it will tell you turn
right here and you will think no I don't
want to turn here I'm going forward but
then you hit the traffic jam and then
you know you are so great that you're
describing it including including yes
including advice its current state
mostly but I think they use predictions
as well this is not part of it and
commitment to elect or intention is also
music as if I where are you going but
i'm not sure if it can tell you to go
later yeah so what you what you
basically have in this system is that
you virtual execute your intention that
you look for solutions yourself on this
mirror so there's no system that's going
to advise the router you have your own
well my system will allow you to just
explore the possibilities and will tell
you ok if you if you do this right then
you will hit the gym because we didn't
solve it so it's it's less say doing it
for you so how you search is your own
choice and the only thing which and it
you you propagate your intention wait
then of course the if you build it with
full system they'd say commitments to
intention so these are the additional
things which you have in there ok ok
thank you very much as I marano pastors
and the next
we're going to have me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
