monthly webinar my name is Logan milic
satrang the solutions director here at
airline solutions today's webinar
represents a continuation of a series of
webinars we are organizing across topics
of interest in the world of Erlang and
dealing with solutions based on the
Erlang programming language now you may
know that John Lennon once said before
Elvis there was nothing and I can tell
you that we certainly appreciate Elvis
in world of Erlang in fact so much so
that a no lying start letter written in
erlanger obviously has been named after
the king so today we will be talking
about Elvis and give you a technical
overview of the solution and what it is
and the use cases it covers we will also
touch upon align guidelines and coding
styles to sort of trouble in the mix now
as with any live event please do excuse
any technical issues that we may face
today but to start by telling you a bit
about Erlang solutions we are a product
in services orientated company
completely devoted to the airline
programming language since our founding
in 1999 we have worked with
organizations and individuals using
airline helping evolve the language and
supporting people and businesses using
it today we have just over 100 people
across our offices in London Stockholm
Krakow Budapest Seattle and Gwenno Cerys
and working on projects across the globe
we're really keen on creating value and
competitive advantage for our customers
across industries and using the unique
features and characteristics of lying as
a language we're quite ambitious in
developing airline based products and as
well and some of these include our
Mongoose IM messaging platform the react
distributed data store and our wombat Oh
am monitoring and management technology
for our line systems as well as many
other solutions applicable across
sectors and problem areas where our line
makes sense now I'm really pleased to
say that our speaker today will be
Fernando Bravo benavides the CTO at
anaka ruger will tell us a bit about
Elvis
and we'll also talk about its technical
workings as I mentioned earlier now I
was told that bruja means sorcerer in
Spanish and I was also told that in
Argentina you really have to sort of
earn your nickname so obviously Brujo is
a sorcerer in erlanger a sorcerer on
Elvis and I'm sure this will come
through the webinar itself now please
allow me to finish by saying you're very
welcome to post questions throughout the
duration of the webinar by using the
chat facility on the webinars interface
our speaker Bravo will answer as many
questions as time allows at the end of
the webinar if any questions should go
unanswered you're welcome to raise them
by email using the following address
webinar at lying hyphen solutions com if
you're interested in learning more about
airline as a language or you wish to
establish whether it could be a solution
for the challenges your own business may
be facing please feel free to contact me
directly my email address will be
displayed in one of the final slides of
the presentation we will share with you
today the same goes for any other
questions you may have feel free to
contact us I would now like to hand over
to rubin who will be glad to start us
off well hello everybody aslan already
told you this is a presentation about
Elvis and the erlang guidelines since
i'm usually nervous at the beginning of
my presentations i will start with the
most boring part which is the
introduction to when who am i where i
work and the webinar i'm a programmer
since i was a little kid I started with
basic in a Commodore computer but i have
already 15 years in the in the industry
working as a software developer in many
languages the last six of them in erlang
and now i'm the CTO at the company work
in akka and since a couple of years ago
i'm trying to introduce this idea of
open source projects to everybody
especially in the company and
and if it has paid off very well in a
guy started in 2010 and we are a company
that create solutions for startups
mostly but also for companies in
different languages we work in along
Ruby noisiest we create products for iOS
and Android devices and we were recently
acquired by airline solutions so we are
now part of that big family we have a
big number of projects and many of the
projects are open sourced and we have a
big number of along developers as well
and that number is always growing both
of those things are the main reasons
that led to the creation of the rman
guidelines and Elvis indeed I will talk
about kind of four things but not
exactly in that same order I will speak
a little bit about the code styles and
how Elvis enforces them and I will tell
you about the guidelines that we follow
when we write a long call at anaka and I
will let you know how you can create
your own guidance ok it start first of
all let's talk a little bit about the
guidelines the guidelines are there in
that URL that you see in the in the big
bubble of the screen gives how / innaka
/ along guidelines and I will tell you
how they came to be and why let me first
start talking about why did we created
the rules and why are there are they
wear on github our first goal was to
avoid repeated mistakes if a developer
already faced a problem that it's easily
detected and easily solved we don't want
different developers or each developer
face the same problem again without a
guide to tell him that that's just not
the way to do stuff
we want to fix things once and use them
many times we also want people to move
between projects easily we have as I
said many projects here and many
developers as well but we don't have
each developer assigned to one
particular projects if the developers
switch projects I want to say constantly
but usually and if you if you have ever
faced that situation you will see that
switching from one project to another
one requires a change of mentality you
have to adapt to the new environment and
also to the new the way that the code is
written in this new project we want to
smooth that thing out by making our
projects look similar and then reducing
the complexity of switching from one to
the other because the code is similar
you just have to focus on and adapt in
your mind to the new environment or
decided functionality we also don't like
copy and paste we know that's evil we
really don't like it but we know that
that's something that happens sometimes
it's just a piece of code that you have
somewhere and you have to move to a new
project sometimes it's a module that's
in a private project and you want to
make it public you want to share little
pieces of code among projects that
cannot use a shared library because they
have whatever some particular stuff in
it that that prevents them to to be
abstracted and then you have to move
called from one place to another in that
case if when you're moving called the
the destination looks widely different
from the source you will have to not
only focus on using that code but you
will also have to adapt it to make it
clear or if you pasted a CDS you end up
with a messy project and that's those
are things that we really don't want
we'd like it even they are worse for us
than copy of
based so we wanted to be easy to share
code between projects and also we work
with code reviews and code reviews tends
to be a lot easier if they are not
subjective if the style is not reviewing
because it's automatically reviewed by a
tool or its specified in some rules then
the reviewer can focus on a real
constructive criticism and actually
reviewing the what the code does and
know how it's written in the end all
these things led to a code that looks
better and since we are open sourcing
many brushes we want our code to
represent us to show how we develop
software in our company and in that
situation we want the code to look good
and to look consistent among all of our
open source projects and that was the
the final goal of all these but it's as
important at yo her once and she has to
be clear the code you're seeing on the
screen is not pretty because it's
checked by Elvis or because it follows
the guidelines it has a different kind
of beauty I will leave it to you to find
it this presentation will be online
after I finish my speech so you can go
back to it and check it again if you
want and now let me tell you about the
story behind the guidelines it all
started when we started growing when we
have a considerable number of developers
on project we realized that our code was
messy and that we have very conflicted
views on how to write the code and so we
needed some way to standardize the way
that we created our airline project to
do that list started with the first
approach code reviews so at least four
to leave
lovers for each piece of work will be
aware of how it's done how it was
written and how the project is
progressing and that's fine that's a
good solution but it turns out that it
becomes subjective the reviewer may
different reviewers may have different
opinions on how to write the code of
what things are allowed to to be in our
projects and what things are not and
then it's confusing for the developer
just or regenerate much a lot of
discussion about how to why the code was
rejected or if it passed the review of
one reviewer but another reviewer has
something to say they discuss what's the
better way to do it and it slows
development and not so we decided to get
objective on that and to write a list of
rules that says what's reviewing and
what things are the basis for rejecting
pull requests and deciding how the
developers should write the goal in the
first place the problem with the ad is
that it was in a wiki so everybody had
access to it everything was the rule
somebody wanted 80 columns why the code
that was a rule it will not develop and
be like this no pretensions so no list
comprehensions well as another rule and
so on so on we even have conflicting
rules that no developer could follow
because one was in the opposite
direction than the other we tackle that
problem using a little bit of democracy
in brackets so we created a project a
process for in which a rule became a
rule and we also separated the roots
into categories we have standards where
those were rules that if not followed
the pull request should be rejected and
we had guidelines that we're like most
like good ideas and things to improve
but not reason enough to reject some
developers code
and with this procedure we also find
that sometimes we have resected rules
rules that just one developer want and
nobody else wanted and so we created a
way of voting will a boat down boat and
so rules with enough up both became a
standard rules with not enough down mode
became a guideline and if you were
totally totally downloaded like Nana
Mosley in the words it's got to be
checked that improve the rules and make
them clearer and make the list smaller
which was good but asked new developers
started joining our company we found out
that we had to explain the rules to them
and sometimes we didn't know why their
rules what was there and so the
developers were asking and we had to
find the guy that wrote the rule in the
first place and maybe that guy's wasn't
even in the company anymore so to cope
with that we other reasoning I'm
examples to each rule so that it's clear
it's there why the rule was needed and
what was the goal of that rule then the
rules we're in a private wiki and we
started sharing a lot of code with the
world that meant some people contributed
with us and they were surprised by
seeing comments in their pool request
about rules they didn't knew so we
published our rules and guidelines on
github and so now everybody can see it
and everybody can contribute with them
and the rules looks like this this is
one of my favorite rules it basically
said that if you are going to edit a
file and you don't like the way it's
written by it's written consistently you
don't get to write it your part in your
way and mess up with the rest of the
file
that's basically it has a title it short
small names have to remember the rule a
longer description without resetting
just what the rule is the goal of the
rule nothing else it has examples with
gold that follows every other rule and
guide line except the one that's shown
in the bad example but it also shows a
good example where the code respects the
rule if one model is not enough it's
fine we create a folder with different
modules that represent the bad cases on
the good cases and finally the most
important part is reasoning it's the
reason why we consider that rule
important and what one what do we want
to achieve with that rule and we don't
allow reasoning to be stuff like it
looks prettier or it's more right clear
with no valid concept of what clear
means we want reasoning to be very well
redacted I'm very precise on the goal
that we want to achieve and now we have
around some something around 40 rules
between standards and guidelines all of
them will call all of them with a
description and reason and you do find
in the Allen guidelines repo that I show
you before the problem with that is that
40 rules is very difficult to remember
and to validate any in every poor
request code review so it's fine the
obvious ones always show up but there
are subtle rules that the reviewer has
to keep in mind and it's complicated so
we wanted some of the rules as many as
we can to be automatically checked for
us so that the reviewers don't have to
worry about that and we knew how CI how
he is
the is a ruby brush check the checks
Ruby code and now it takes no she s as
well I think according to the rules
defined by a script called Robocop since
Ruby guys have a hound we created Elvis
right with the model that you see in
this screen you're nothing but a hound
at least it's the new open source
project it's public on github it's an
airline obligation that means it's
written in airline and it checks airline
code to see if it complies to certain
style guides or on rules that it has
it's helpful because it automates for
reviews I will show you how that's done
in a minute but it also standardized the
code that we are sharing because it
applies the same rules to every little
piece of code that we write here and
there are four moving is to use alleys
in your projects first the most basic
one one is to use it in the along shell
in this case it's a it's used as any
other airline obligation that's in
dependency you put you make sure that
it's compiled and in your path you
create an Elvis coffee file or you
create a the contents of an Elvis config
file in a variable in your shell and you
just run Elvis rock that function will
check all your source code files in fact
all the files that you want because you
will see in a moment how you can put
different kinds of files in different
places and run different rules on them
in the Elvis config file but it
basically goes over all those files and
it tells you what's wrong with them if
anything is wrong i will show you an
example i wrote i have written a module
there with very long lines and i do this
rock Elvis checks the the file and it
tells me that there are two lines 9 13
and 14 that are too long and finally
it takes the other files like at least
coughing and tell me that they are okay
that's how you run a lease on a console
on an airline council the problem with
that is that every project that you want
to be checked by Elvis must have Elvis
as a dependency compile and available on
the console and you must manually write
it it's tedious there is a 0 over a you
can compile a list SMS script you
install it using make install usually
with sudo so that you have it available
for every project at the same time you
can run it on the console using the
Elvis executable file that was created
we'll make a script like that at least
rock or Elvis rock and if you want to
provide your your own configuration file
you do it with dash C it's extremely
similar to the previous example you
write the module you go to the console
you do Elvis rock and the output is
exactly the same but the problem with
this approach is that you have to run it
every time manually you will have to
decide when to run it then you may
forget if you want not to commit Cole
that doesn't comply it way to a rule
when Elvis rule you can use the l weeks
gift code to the app you can pile and
style elvis as i show you before and
then you add a this line to the program
it file in your get hooks always get
hook you have to make sure that the file
is executable and everything as any
other program in hook or rather you run
Elvis install git hook that does exactly
that exactly what I said before and each
time you try to commit your code if
there are modules that don't comply to
some rules and we will stop you from
committing until you have everything
green light for instance if you have
this module and if you try to do a
commit the output will be exactly the
same as before but the committee will
not get done so until you have ever
module on every file within a green okay
you cannot compute not generate a commit
and that's fine but again it must be
done for every developer in every
project give hooks are not uploaded to
the gift repo so it has to be done every
time a developer closer repository so to
avoid the fact you can use github as a
web a you can use Elvis and say get
subway hook oh that's that's a bad name
we will improve it but the basic
instructions is our other similar you
have to go to the lec- sub home side you
sign up with your github account the
first time it will ask you to authorize
the application the application is just
used to set up web hooks in your github
repos if you don't want to authorize the
application you can do that on your own
there is a wiki page and the always
rebuild that tells you how to do it but
then you turn on integration for the
project that you want to check and each
time you want to send a pull request in
that brushing any developer wants to
send the ball request in that project
Ares will check it and comment on the on
the lines that failed to comply to the
rule like this it will write a comment
on the specific line that the fails and
it will tell you what's the problem
using the lvc Naga github user that way
the reviewer has time to has some review
already done for him it has gets to
spend his time in other things not
reviewing the particular rules that
Elvis already reviews but the not
everybody uses the same roof so if you
want to use particular set of rules for
your project or projects you can use the
Elvis config file the oldest config file
is a file that's very similar to an app
config file
basically has an entry for Elvis with a
configuration and the configuration is
basically a list of a groups of maps
within which one in each one you have a
source code folders where to find the
files and wildcard expression to filter
the files in those folders and the rules
that must be applied to them as you can
see the rules are kind of MFA's it has
module function and the arguments are
not the usual ones that you see
everywhere everywhere you have an MFA
these are maps their name and arguments
so if you don't have if you're the rule
has no arguments like no tabs the third
element in the table it's a can can be
not other but if the rule has arguments
like or options like nesting level for
instance or line length you have a map
to the config file with the proper
values or your decided values for for
that rule and you can have multiple
groups of files with different rules for
each and if you want if you're running
away from a console from an online
console you want to use rock without
providing a proper config file a
configure given the eldest will real
Elvis config file that's in your path if
you do it from the console that's the
same thing if you do it a survey get
hook it must be in the root folder of
your repo and if you do it if you want a
Elvis dot inner gloves all come to check
your pull request with a different
configuration that the default it must
buy as you must provide Elvis config
file on the root folder on your master
branch
okay now let me show you how to
customize this even further because as I
show you before you can set some
parameters and maybe choose the rules
but there is a way to extend it where
you write your own rules then we first
start by show you how one of our rules
is written and then I will show you how
you can add your own rules to your Elvis
we have a rule that's in Anaka we want
code to be any columns wide and so we
put that rule in the guidelines with the
precise number that's the most important
part of it of this it has an 80 there it
doesn't say number if there are no
parameters no one with nothing it's very
strict 80 columns for line that's the
way that we want our code to be written
it edenic so in the guidelines we have
that rule but in ll days we have a more
generic rule we have line length written
which is a function written in the Elvis
style module and it has an argument
limit with the length of the line the
maximum length allowing for the lines in
your code in pole line length is just a
function will a specific set of
arguments i will show you what this pack
i will show you in a further slide but
it basically has the whole of eurasian
file the file that must be analyzed and
the specific configuration for the rule
that we are running now as i said the
rule config is this map with a limit
property so if in the first line it gets
the limit from that map with a default
value as 80 and then using functions in
Halper module like Elvis file gives the
source code for the files we analyzed
and using functions in the Elvis you do
spoil it checks every line will
specific function check ylang-ylang
check line length will take the line
this text in the line the number and the
arguments and it will go it was just
check them specific line and if it's
longer than their limit it will generate
a narrow result using Alvis result new
otherwise it will say no result and the
line will be ignored if you have your
own rules I will recommend you to start
to use the same process that we do first
create your guideline define the the
goal that you want to pursue for your
project if you want if you want you can
fork in our airline guidelines
repository and put their your own rules
the way you want it but if you think the
rule that you're adding it's a it's a
helpful contribution for in Agra and the
community you can send us a pull request
you have to follow the contribute
guidelines but i think they are not too
strict and too hard to follow now if you
want that rule to be in Elvis you can
create your own module and your own rule
in your inner function and you have that
what what in the slightly sell us your
ads it's a map with any argument that
you can see they're useful for your rule
and then in the coal you will just have
to write a function following that spec
three arguments the first one is the
config file the single one is a file
descriptor I think it's a fine name i'm
not sure but it's something that you can
use for the in the other modules to get
the contents of that file and the final
one is a map which are your arguments
and the result must be a list of elvis
results in your code you can use all the
functions india in Elvis Elvis code will
give you parse error log modules like
it's a kind of an abstract syntax term
but AC textfree sorry but it will be
represented with maps
l this file will give you the access to
the source code like my line most likely
Elvis result will let you create the
others result items easily finally there
are many other utility functions group
in a digital spoil again if you think a
rule like that will be useful for the
community I encourage you to fork the
Elvis repo and add it there but if it's
just for your projects you can have it
whatever you want as long as it's in the
bath when you are running Elvis of
course in Elvis dotty negatives or Tom
will not we will not be able to run your
rule if you don't provide the code if
you don't create a pull request to the
Elvis people but in any other in any of
the other ways to run out this you will
have it as a final set of words I want
to tell you that this project since it
triggered the creation or the
improvement of many other open source
projects like the alternative along
preprocessor which is a we forked and we
improve it by the addition of maps and
there were a new representation of emm
on terms using maps we created see Percy
/ comes from closure and it basically
lets you use the same functions to
traverse the diverse immutable data
structures we've created a and API
client for the github API and we put
many other things you know and other
things that are not specific to always
in a grab bag of useful functions we
call a long Kitana that project is a
good place to look if you think there is
something that must be done somewhere
else it usually is there I I like to
give you some other resources where you
can find Elvis or how CI to compare you
know you can have access to our
guidelines and to all of our other
and open source projects in naga that
github that I owe you can check our
website and of course our github company
page this presentation and many others
are online at proceed calm / user / in
Agra and you can find everything about
myself in about me / local gun and
everywhere you see a row Hagen is most
likely me finally if you have questions
feel free to contact London as he said
the beginning and there you have his
mail and the women are male I will go
back to this live in a moment but before
that I wanna be if you too with one
final thought that that was written by
one of my friends and one of the most
style oriented programmers anagha my
friend in Yankee it's long so I want rid
of loud but basically states that the
goal of having guidelines is not to
force developers into coding in a way
that they don't want but to let them
code in a way they want in an
environment that everybody wants at the
same time given them the freedom to
express their own creativity and to
contribute with their best things
without having to worry about how to
write the code but but instead worrying
only about what code to write in the
problems that they need to solve and
basically that's the message I want to
give you at the end of his presentation
and that's it for me all right thank you
for who I'm sure everyone will join me
in thanking you for a very inspiring
talkin Elvis we spent a bit of time on
the presentation itself and before
everything I'd like to sort of start by
apologizing for the slight technical
issues we've had with the connection
that I've certainly noticed and about
the sort of use at the time we have
remaining
so it's best we have had a number of
questions come in we do have to
apologize we will not have the time to
answer you know all the questions we
received because there have been quite a
few but to sort of try and honor as many
of them as we can Fernando I will ask
you a couple of questions and obviously
you can share your thoughts with us now
the first question one of our attendees
is asking something quite interesting
why would you use Elvis to begin with if
there is already a plug-in and rules for
Erlang in sonar so why would you use
Elvis if you already have a plug-in and
rules for a Lang in sonar I didn't know
that claim actually I'm not sure I know
what sonner is okay so obviously you'll
defer comment on that and if you have a
look and you know we can always set of
respond to the person by email as well
once you acquainted yourself with that
particular item so I'm glad one thing if
that plug-in is open source and has
proper code that we can use in Ellie's
it will be awesome and also one of the
goals of Elvis is to be integrated with
each hub I don't know that Lane but I
not sure if that integrated with each
how at least not as Elvis a snap for
under well I can tell you that we're
receiving questions faster than we were
responding to them so just to move on to
the next one one of our one of the
people in the audience morteza
specifically is asking can we configure
Elvis to only check changes made in New
commit and not in the whole file meaning
only in parts that get diff shows so
just repeat the question can we
configure Elvis to only check changes
made in New commits and not in the whole
file meaning only in the parts that the
gift diff will show ya
was our goal when we started we could
figure out how to do that given the
information that gives help provides us
we will convene on that eventually we
will get to it but up to this point we
couldn't find a way to determine which
lines are are the ones that we are
modifying in the pull request and also
another interesting question is that
some rules act upon compile code I would
say to do in the abstract term format so
it's not that if you modify a line you
will produce an error exactly there for
instance if you are you using a two-deep
nesting level you may you may have it to
the nesting level because you had a
another case inside one of your cases so
that the error will be there but you can
add a case in the outside of of the
outermost case and the error will be
detected in inside but you either the
line outside right thank you for that
now to try and again honor as many
questions as we can and again apologies
to all the questions that are sort of
piling in as we're answering these
couple we will try and answer at least
seven eight questions here and the
questions that are not answered now
we're alliance two by email so you will
receive an email once we've consulted
with Bravo and obviously you'll get a
written response to your question but to
move on to the next one well whilst we
still have a bit of time Hemant Kumar is
asking an interesting one do you need to
clean up an existing project to get
started with Elvis or can it be done
incrementally i would say it can be done
incrementally and that's what we are
doing now with one of our when it we
honest with all of our projects we just
added Elvis to the old ones and it's
time there is a pull request we fixed
the style
failures that are recorded their
excellent thank you for that bruja now
just to move move on straightaway to the
next question and these are by the way
answered in the order in which they were
received so there is a kind of a
first-come first-serve principle morteza
is asking once again can Elvis check for
how many space characters should be used
for indentation so for example morteza
prefers two spaces after each
indentation so can Elvis check for that
can you check for how many space
characters should be used for
indentation that's in fact a very very
tricky one it was one of the first rules
we want we tried to implement and I had
to say we failed a bit mostly because
they are so crazy indentation rules that
are not like exactly in the number of
type of spaces to tell you one if you
have a list comprehension and inside the
list of retention you have a begin and
end close blood of code and will that
should that begin the word begin should
we placed like to the left of the of the
starting bracket of the list
comprehension or should we play the two
characters to the left of the blood
place it was very tricky and that was
just one of the many places where we
find that strict inundation rules are
not as easy to apply to twirl ankle as
to as they are two other codes excellent
thank you for that Brujo straight on to
the next question is more are coming in
a question from one of our audience
Chava can you give us an example of a
more complex rule like in code yes I
think that it's not specified in the
question but I would assume that's
that's what the listener is yeah
you can see all of the rules you go to
get have / you'd have the term / innaka
/ Elvis and there you find the eldest
style dot L file it has all the rules
any each one of the rules with their own
definition and internal functions
everything thanks for that so obviously
everyone can refer to these sources of
information moving on to the next
question Caillou Jensen is asking will
there be a way to make this part of
Emacs so with every a way to make Elvis
part of Emacs excellent passer I'm
expecting somebody that is familiar with
emails to contact me someday and yeah we
will work that out for sure but I'm not
familiar with amongst us as much as I
would wanted to be able to tell you that
i will leave limit that well i would
invite you know the many people we have
today in our audience to feel free to
sort of contact us and obviously we can
put you in touch with Brujo if you're
interested in collaborating on such a
project and you can obviously
potentially take that forward now moving
on to the next question are there any
eclipse plugins available save us okay
so here is our again an invitation to
the audience sort of communicate with us
on that as well now just to ask you a
really interesting question it has come
in how does Elvis specifically integrate
with tinier and just to let our audience
know tidier is or should we say was a
project by kostas agganis with a similar
but less generic goal of Elvis so the
question is how does Elvis integrate
with tidier it's not integrated yet but
I mailed Costas even I mailed him when I
started working on Elvis in the very
beginning I just found him on vacation
so I'm hoping that when he comes back he
will contact me again and we can work it
out it's it's my goal to integrate it as
well and lastly thank you
and just to try and answer at least a
couple of other questions is an
interesting one so you know you have
your big project you have a lot of messy
code you know how hard is it for you to
just start using Elvis with with this
big project and with you know a load of
messy code it's it can get complicated
my my first advice and that would be to
start with a shot a few rules and keep
adding the rules one at a time when you
feel safe with the previous ones so that
let's say you have code that it's fully
in then there will mix of tabs on the
spaces and you want to you want to play
the note ops rule ok let's start just
with that work you run that on your own
computer or you put that as a get hook a
pre-commit hook and you keep checking
your code and cleaning it up from that
rule and then you you feel that you're
fine enough then you are another rule
and go on one by one or maybe two three
each time so that you're not overwhelmed
by the lots of failure reported by Ellis
but besides that I think it's easy ok we
have another interesting question from
Kyle Johnson again he's basically asking
asking is there a way to exclude files
from checking that's an issue already
reported in the in the aeries reborn
itself we will be working on that
probably the export thank you brueghel
you're answering these questions very
sort of efficiently so we can cover more
of them two more questions that we can
cover and then we'll have to wrap up but
they're quite interesting so the first
question what happens if you have two
conflicting rules to run with Elvis yeah
that's that's a that'll be an issue for
you wells rightly if you have two
conflicting rules that means you want to
achieve to go
rules that are not valid within
themselves so you you will either want I
don't know 80 columns wide or you want
you want expressions to be one line
let's say and maybe expressions will be
longer than 80 and then you have
conflicting rules because you either
follow one or the other and you have to
decide how to set your Elvis trophic
file to achieve your other mouse goal
you need to decide which one of the
roots is better or whether the arguments
for the other not to conflict that much
thank you for that now the last question
we here at a lying solutions are big
fans of felix here and obviously big
supporters of that so the last question
is asking the person is working in a
mixer so they want to know whether Elvis
will check their code for style let the
answer will be not yet but like found
our source of inspiration for this
started taking Ruby and then moved to
know she s our coffeescript we will most
likely if Ellis goes well eventually
moved to elixir tube fantastic thank you
for that grew home now many apologies to
people asking all the questions we still
have on the list that have been left
announce that we will answer all your
questions in writing please allow me to
once again thank Google for a very
inspiring talk many thanks to all of you
