what platform that lets play games we
have designed last year spill gains has
a lot of history but to be very very
short well he has already introduced me
I'm passionate around developer and like
testing and a beautiful coat over
everything away for spil games spil
games is a gaming platform company the
gaming industry that means we are not
specifically game developers actually
mostly we are not game developers which
has published games we do develop some
games and we serve data to more than 190
countries worldwide so it's really
worldwide it's sometimes you just see
traffic reports and you with traffic
from places that's like okay that's fine
and we serve more than 180 million
unique users per month and that's the
actual challenge basically so that's the
real difficulty in what we do we use to
serve the games to multiple platforms so
desktop mobile also native on mobile and
stuff like that but mainly our main
focus at the moment are the web portals
and have more than 300 employees more
than 30 nationalities offices in the
netherlands game studio in china and
most of the money is made out of
advertising and used for monetization so
these about spil games now this is what
i'm going to describe like the old
portals landscape so before going into
that world these are a couple of
concepts aren't going to be repeating
all along the thing the situation we
have a spill is not the most common one
so we use the word brand or channel I'll
try to stick to one of them but I cannot
promise you anything for targeting the
different audiences so the moment we
have five brands teens families girls
boys and women we have between 1 and 15
sites pointed to different geographical
areas so sites are language but not only
language some type of content tweaking
making it according to the geographical
area where the contents can be shown
and the company policy is also going for
strong domains so that's the reason why
we have stuff like spell dota see for
teens in Sweden yoga spoon to payday for
families in portugal and brazil games
that code of the UK for families in the
UK girls go games co WK four girls in
the UK you can see all the pinky stuff
and so these are the basics now
technically how does this work we have
three separated layers to be short as
abstract as possible we have the portals
on top the portals talk to the
application layer which is the one
implement in the business model so all
the logic about the data that we
retrieved from the third layer which is
the storage layer portals are
implementing yeah just they're just big
monolithic block / brand and in each one
of those brand blocks there are lots of
sites for the different regions portals
are mostly static pages with some Ajax
calls making the connectivity to the
application layer and the these
architecture layers can be developed and
can be improved moved forward
independently so this is what we have
been working with for a while and it had
good things allowed us to target
independent brands and side with one
specific improvement or one specific new
feature it has provide providing us with
acceptable performance clear layer
separation which is always something
really good to have and thanks to it we
have grown really fast but of course
it's really good that you can target 1
target audience and one specific
geographic region with your feature but
is really bad that when you want to
actually put that feature global in all
the portals you really need to not
reimplement it from scratch but adapt it
many times that's annoying and
I mentioned that we perform acceptable
yes that's true but that's because we
have taken very aggressive multi-level
caching strategies to make it work so
couple of memcache layers here and there
cdns caching proxies browser cache and
when you try to make an update yeah well
good luck with it so in case you have an
isolation in the caches you can just
invalidate and okay that should be fine
but in case you don't you cannot
invalidate because you don't really know
what you're going to flash so you should
not do it and then it takes like seven
hours for the change to propagate and
it's not really under your control so
that's bad and also from development
point of view developers cannot switch
brands easily because certain point in
time and in order to improve or shorten
the time to market for specific feature
for a brand the code bases for the
brands were split so it did work for
that but now sharing the code or moving
a developer from one branch to another
it's much more difficult which results
in a longer time to market for global
features so one year ago more or less we
started writing a wish list so what do
we want to do to fix this issue and
there were basically two words that we
focused very strongly on so one of them
obviously is performance and the other
one is isolation so we wanted to have
insulated requests if a request goes
wrong in a client see some error
something it shouldn't affect request by
other clients okay it's common thing we
also wanted to have this related crashes
so something crashes it should be able
to recover without spreading the crash
all over the place that's also good and
the most important of all we wanted to
have isolated features so not worrying
if I put out this new feature that I
have proven that works beautifully what
am I going to break and the rest of the
portal that's something that we really
wanted to run away from ok so I put
something new either it works or it
doesn't but it doesn't break the rest
we wanted to have featured toggling on
runtime to proof IDs being able to fix
the errors quickly and of course perform
decently again so this number of
requests per second and the most
important even if you don't have the
most top-of-the-line throughput or
whatever being able to scale linearly so
that's with supermarket hardware no need
of extra powerful killing machines you
know just normal stuff being able to put
more machines in the rack just make it
work and since the application and
storage layers we have already migrated
to Ireland well guess what but our task
force also had some wishes and some
stuff that they wanted to accomplish
like they were tired of course of the
different code bases so what they wanted
is only one code base as modular as
possible so everything is sure and if I
need to do something that's very
specific for this side then I can do it
but the rest is the same that's a good
thing wanted to be able to prove or test
their ideas by creating small features
with very little code that are easy to
deploy and roll back and they wanted to
be able to test those changes in those
features in isolation from the rest of
the portal so before we started going
crazy and typing which is what we like
we decided to think it's always a good
idea so we took a look at the frameworks
out there the main one singer on that we
found were so Tony can chicago bus and
both of them different completely
different implementations but share a
lot of concepts like a very nice layer
separation and there are material
solutions or companies using them we
wouldn't be the first so it wouldn't be
exactly a trial they're easy to use i
mean when i watch the to talk about
chicago bells in the airline factory in
San Francisco I was really amazed it's
really really easy to start using to
carrabba's and building stuff on it
but future isolation was not a key on
the design something that we really
wanted and it's not really a concept
that comes together with those
frameworks you can do it of course it
doesn't come naturally and the second
argument we don't need a modal view
controller framework we only need a view
controller because we have the model
obstructed in different layer so we
don't want to re-implement we don't even
want to touch our model or model is fine
you just want to talk to it so we
decided to come up with a widget
platform and naming is not what we do
best so what is with it this is an image
of one of our portals and what we have
done here with this pink lines as a
separate in different areas which
provide independent functionality so for
example here you can see a list of the
most played games or ranking here a list
of suggested games popular games the
upper part just on top you can see the
header with some logo and some links and
some user information right up here so
high score username status stuff search
bar now each one of those boxes is with
it and it's independent from the rest
and that's a whole point that we're
trying to make here so if the Wi-Fi
allows me I'm going to try to show you
how it actually works so this is the
portal running on my computer let me see
let me see okay so this is the actual
portal it seems to be working so i
showed you before this one on the right
this list of ranking of most played game
so it's a completely independent part of
the page that's the whole point of it so
as a completely independent part of the
page i could just switch it off so
that's what I'm gonna do
so if I now retry my request just that
part of the page is gone and it doesn't
affect the rest it's just that small
part of the page is different okay now i
can come up and start it again and it is
back so this is feature insulation but i
talked also about crashing error
insulation so let me actually show you
that
you
everybody could see that yeah
so
okay so if I pressure five now it will
loot like the widget is disabled well
sorry this is what I mentioned about the
Wi-Fi so now you saw these one-time
doubt in the back end to retrieve the
information I can just reply yeah so
what you just see is this area missing
from the page why because there was a
crash in it it exploded but it never
propagated to the rest of the page so
it's just this part here is broken I
just broke it so that's our isolation
let me quickly fix it
okay so that's the idea now the
components for these are widgets each
one of the widgets is an independent
airline application and I mentioned that
we decided not to go for sardonic not
for chicago bus but that doesn't mean
that we can use some things early dtl is
a very nice thing that this inside
chicago bus is a templating system
you're familiar with Django for Python
this is a port of Django for Ireland
it's 95 99 percent compatible and the
stuff that is not the same well you can
take it so each one of these widgets
when you request a page now imagine for
example you're requesting a search page
and the search page is this guy over
here which at one but the third page has
a search bar and search results for
example yeah so when you perform a
request the request will come from the
top will enter the first widget which is
the search page and the search page will
have two children which are these guys
over here and in this case these guys
will have no more children so this is
your tree this is a tree representing
your page a tree with three widgets one
top level entry point and two children
yeah now each one of the widgets has
exactly the same stuff and it must
specify it all otherwise anything that's
not clearly specified in the widget will
not be possible to use it from the
widget that's also one design concept
that we wanted to apply so let's try not
to avoid crazy development of features
and adding stuff and hacking here
everything must be declared somewhere if
you don't declare you will not be able
to use it so for example each widget has
public properties public properties are
stuff that modifies the behavior of the
widget for example if this one is a
search result that could be for example
a public property saying I want four
rows with five results per row and each
one of those could actually be
overwritten
by the parent so that that's the meaning
of public your your parent widget can
actually change your behavior right
based on anything that it detects on
runtime there are also private
properties and private properties of any
variable that affects the behavior of
the widget anything where you are going
to put any if in your template or a for
loop any variable that you're going to
pass in there yeah you must declare it
either as a public property or as a
private property because if you don't
the widget will never be able to render
that template and that's by design so
you will be able to catch the error
really early if you don't declare it
will not work but apart from that well
of course these public and private
properties will be declared with default
values that make sense but we also are
able to define Brandon site-specific
default values so by default unless my
parents specify otherwise i want to show
five five rows or four results per row
unless I'm in the Turkish portal for
teens where I want three rows with five
results for example yeah and we just can
also specify some decoration needs so
I'm not going to lie you all use on that
browser is not Ireland okay there's some
CSS there and there's some JavaScript
there as well we try to minimize the use
of JavaScript to just tweaking the stuff
that you can not to from the back and so
and reaching the user experience but
still you you're going to need some
stuff so we just must declare what they
need parent configuration the easiest
way of parsing it and this configuration
will not be accessible on any server the
wheel is running I have some specific
overwritten values for teens in this
case for this brand I want a specific
CSS many specific JavaScript or a widget
you're going to use these type of specs
and you need to export these functions
provides wrapper for common actions like
for example the horrible work of parsing
this stuff you know you don't have to do
it we're already wrappers for it and
it provides a way to make nice and
simple calls to the application layer so
if I which is so stupid that it cannot
access the model directly because
shouldn't you have a business layer
logic in the middle business logic later
in the middle that way of communicating
is also instructed in a library so the
widget can just make a call get the
results and don't care if the call is
HTTP or RPC or whatever you can come up
with yeah it will be abstracted and also
these libraries provide some stuff for
the view so early detailed custom tags
which means you can actually write
specific write your own early dtl
commands that you can put on your
template to do stuff that is not exactly
defined in the original early ddl for
example generating translated links it's
a very repetitive action that you don't
want to do every time you're with it
every time you generate a link you want
to generate the translated the localized
version of the link so you just use
specific tag for it your code becomes
super simple now all these widgets lives
in one place they do live in a platform
the widget platform and this platform
contains all the widget dependencies
shared libraries for login libraries for
monitoring all you can think of contains
the path to widget mapping which means
when I requests large / search I should
go to widget page search which will have
two children which will be the search
warrant search results that path
matching is really relevant and it's
depending on the platform it contains
the airline web server which is a cowboy
web server and it implements the request
flow and the global error pages so why
the global error pages are not widgets
in this case because what happens I mean
for what reason would you want to show
an 500 error well internal server error
or something went wrong well if
something went wrong with your server
how the hell are you going to generate
your dynamic page right so it's a static
page
and we just have one very thin layer on
top which is engine X so why do we have
engineers on top of a cowboy server
because it allows us to define the
servers so the domain mapping meaning if
I go to spell that the sea and if I go
to the hue goes punto com Spanish portal
they are both for teens so they are both
served by the same platform which is in
that cluster over there so that the
domain them in that server definition
fertile house definition you do with
engine eeks and since you have engineers
anyway and unix will serve the static
class it was really good at it and so
static error pages are static files as
well and in your virtual host definition
you probably need to indicate to your
platform to work from what domain you
come from some brand ID some site ID so
engineers can do some very basic URL
rewriting so how does this look like
request kemsing for a path / search with
query string search term cuts then does
the path much an existing file yes okay
then engine eeks will serve it this line
here is the frontier now it is if it's
not a static file immediately engineer a
directed to the widget platform the
widget platform will first translate
this last search to the widget that is
supposed to handle it so widget and the
query string the squaring is kept
because is the way to affect the public
properties of the first level widget
since the first level will have no
parent yeah so it will be in the widget
tree representing the page this case
paid search search bar sales results
this widget tree will be rendered which
will result in some io data and some
decoration needs to start we mentioned
before now if there is a need for
decorating well first of all if there's
I need for decorating like like I'm just
typing my first widget creating some
stuff I just want to check the HTML that
gets generated see if it looks ok I will
take care of making it beautiful later
then we're done to just return the
response otherwise you need to use all
these decoration requests organize them
in a nice way and build something that
is not just a bunch of HTML tags but
something that's actually a page with
HTML head body stuff so this is what the
decoration tree does so you can see
that's sort of a to two-step rocket
first you render all the stuff behind
your page and the three corresponding to
the page will declare all the needs that
are there then if you need to make it
beautiful to make it look like a website
there's a very short second step that
picks all those needs and make them
available in the web page so the second
three is render then you get some io
data that is served to the client and
but we also wanted to solve the problem
of deployment I promise you a quick
deployment and quick releasing so how do
we take care of it wants to be able to
create easily small Delta's so I have my
configuration here my set of widgets
running on my production machine I just
want to make this teeny tiny change you
know should be quick and we want to
arrange different sets of widgets in
running on the same hardware so I'm
going to test this directly in the
production servers I want to test it
myself on the production service but I
don't want my clients being experiencing
the test themselves because maybe i'm
testing because its body right so i want
to test how that works in the real
installation without making it public
for the rest of the world so different
sets can be built for requests so let me
show you nothing now
so one of the things that you're seeing
here is I talk to you before about this
these different blew up yeah this
different blue gradient is just one
widget which contains several stuff like
for example these other thing with a
logo and these links in the search bar
and the user information box yes now
what I'm going to do is add some
parameters to the query string because
in the same airline vm which is running
here exactly these Earl nvm i have two
different sets of widgets running and by
default it will always serve me one of
them but i can create these small delta
like i have so i have a different
version of this logo thing here running
and i can make a request that serves the
full page from the main set of widgets
accept this small dell that i want to
see how it looks so i can actually
request this other one and you see now
it has a different positioning is that
the logo has gone to the middle and has
a different color of the text now it's
just a slightly different i'm requesting
the same domain just i'm specifying that
this widget header logo has to come from
a different set said that I call tins
preview yeah
so
so this is how we make that inside the
same airline virtual machine we have one
master node and several slave nodes you
can configure as many as you want now
the master node will be running the
cowboy web server taking care of the
requests will be running a management
interface which you will be able to use
to see the list of slaves that you have
available the soul each yet list of
place you have available that the
versions of the widgets that are running
etc and the master node will of course
we're running one specific set of
widgets which will be the main one the
one that will be returned unless you
specify otherwise but now in each one of
those slaves you will run a whole
specific set of widgets that might
differ actually what I just showed you
just one different that small logo
widget is a different version so i can
make requests like this and if I specify
well I want this customized origins for
widget 1 and widget 5 and i want them
from the preview node when the tree of
widgets corresponding to the page is
being billed this one will be served
from the preview and these one will be
served from the preview while the rest
are coming from the master node so this
means we just can be called in any node
by default they will always come from
the master node because they're running
locally there but if you specify
something different inside the same vm
you have this slave with a different
version might be just off and it will
RPC that slave to get a result render in
that specific widget so you can create
specific deltas and test them completely
isolated now in this case for example if
widget 5 was disabled in preview you
just see the whole tree without this
thing if with the three was disabled the
master you see these big area
disappearing from the page yes so you
can point or target the specific sub
trees when you enable disable widgets
alright so you have a master and several
slaves and lots of set of widgets and
can be different versions so this
requires quite some management to make
it make it right so we also realize that
and we realize we needed an automatic
managing system so first of all so we
could actually change the versions in an
easy way create the deltas that we want
test exactly what we want to test second
keep the cluster platforms synchronized
together and if you have three of these
platforms for teams running on the same
physical hardware cluster you probably
have a load balancer in the front that
is redirecting your HTTP request one of
the machines behind now if you have
different sets of widgets in those three
things you cannot predict what the
client is going to see which is
something that you don't want you want
to in the same class or platforms have
exactly the same view from the external
point so to make those changes in a
uniform way we need this manager thing
you so before going in detail let me
actually show you what it is the manager
is this so this is more well application
here allows me to select all the
environments that are running now I have
two brands running on this laptop one of
the brands is teens the other brands is
this seybold thing which is brand for
women does matter so I have two nodes
inside teens the master node which is
teens me and the preview know which is
teams preview so for example here I
could just disable widget header for
example so this one if I just set it off
and now I come to my page which is here
the Heather is just gone you see the ad
on top there's no header so it is that
simple you have this graphical tool
where you can click around switch the
versions not only on and off I mean you
will be able to switch it to a
completely different version right stuff
like this now I enable these other
version which is a slightly different
yes so this is a tool now the
implementation of the tool is of course
another application as well and has an
HTTP interfaces you have that thing and
it talks to this thing here do we have
by side call swift swift is distributed
binary storage from OpenStack and we use
it to store the widget releases so every
time you release we did you create you
make a release out of it to just store
the binary in there so this corresponds
to weezer Heather 123 and you put it
there then the manager every time you
open it will actually go to Swift
retrieve the list of widgets that are
available go to the connected widget
platforms check what they have enabled
and show you that interface where you
can actually choose and sweetie versions
and stuff so that's already cool and via
this route or library in here the widget
manager can talk airland to airline a
different to these platforms and be
aware if one of them dies so if this guy
dies you have your client traffic coming
from here as long as your load balancer
is informed so you don't address more
client trafficking here you're still
able to work both from the client side
and from the management side of it you
can actually keep performing changes
keep deploying widgets in these two guys
that are alive yeah now one of the
coolest features of the managers in case
you decide to do that what happens when
this guy comes alive again you have
performed a couple of changes we had a
manager while this one was dead to
change this you change this at different
sets of widgets and now this one is
offering a different view to the client
well the manager is response
realizing when a new platform is about
to join an already existing cluster and
in that case the manager reads the list
of widgets that are running in one of
the machines in the cluster for example
this one and enforces that configuration
to the member that is joining the
cluster so hey you're joining this group
this group has this conflict I don't
care what you want this is the config
you're going to have and then the client
always sees the same and this is
extremely important because doing this
by hand if you have an accident or some
server goes down you have to keep going
with one server less then if you have to
go and check how many things I have
changed the last 24 hours and does
replay it is an enormous waste of time
and the magic just does it for you is
completely transparent you can just take
it down for maintenance if you want and
put it back and we'll automatically
revive to the correct state all right so
where are we going now what's in the
future for us well we have learned a lot
while developing this thing so one of
the most important things is reinforce
the adoption of the concepts so this is
not about technical details how do i
implement this particular thing over
here very low level it's about
refreshing the concept and explaining
the concept one and again and discussing
them as many times as possible because
yes I mean even if you have a developer
that is not really feeling comfortable
with the stack that you are providing or
the architecture that we were providing
if you understand the concept when he
starts typing if he is going in the
wrong direction he will have this
feeling of I don't know what I'm doing
but doesn't really feel right this is
important because otherwise we will go
forward with solution eventually someone
will find out what was the solution will
dislike it ways that work angry workers
you don't want that okay so just keep
insisting on the concepts first and
review review
everything review the code 20 times 50
times keep reviewing and especially when
you think the concepts are very clear
then review because if you do that not
only you will make sure that you were
right and the concepts were clear but
it's that reviewing the one that
provides you very very very good value
that reviewing is the one when someone
understands it all and that's something
that is weird for you dang is where you
really have to look at it because
probably it's having a good idea you
know there's something there that you
didn't see in Keystone so keep reviewing
and measure performance from as early as
possible one of the very funny things
and I'm just about to finish that
happened during this thing is the first
time we measure this super scalable we
did platform with fully dynamic pages
were really happy you know typing our
performance tests the concurrency and we
got the amazing number of 2.6 requests
per second and that was like really
really what are we doing well in the end
it was a matter of very stupid thing so
just in case you find out always check
code is loaded it's a very good thing
code which is a very evil thing code
which if the code is not loaded before
returning you false will scan all your
folders in the code path physically
before telling you know so yeah that's
really evil if you do that prayer
request and yeah after that in a laptop
like this we can surf at the moment 670
something like that concurrent requests
per second more than enough so coming is
to native widget the back and
connectivity the moment the widgets are
requesting the application layer stuff
via HTTP they are both ireland right so
let's do eating airline just want to
define a stricter interface to do that
nicely want to define / widget render
timeouts so specify each one of the
widgets in the tree if it takes you more
than two seconds to get all the
information you need to
render just shut up and disappear yeah
and cashing the request for the back end
calls for calls to the application layer
may be in the tree you have two or three
widgets doing the same call don't
perform to call several times even
though when you branch all the calls so
all the widgets in different branches
are rendering parallel just don't
perform the call you don't need to do it
right so just cash and keep improving
the performance and very interesting
thing you can come talk to me if you are
interested later I will not splain it in
detail that this route their library
that I mentioned here is the same route
or library that I mentioned in previous
talks about the storage layer of spill
games we're going to open source this
library in the second part of the year
and it's a very nice library to keep
your airline cluster connected only with
the connections that you're interested
in instead of keeping a fully connected
graph this is the stuff we have used
everything is clickable when the slides
are online you can just go there check
it out stuff with stars or pull requests
that we have submitted upstream with
extra things and yeah that was it so now
it's time for you to ask me stuff yes
please yes oh that's because my private
browser you tends to access who probably
has a lot of cookies from the
Netherlands that's that's the only point
yes
well at the moment you can specify a
time out / call in a widget so when the
widget makes a beck and call you can
specify well after that just timeout and
the call will error and the widget can
manage the error but instead of letting
the widget manage the error of the call
that actually timed out we want to
manage that in a platform level so I
don't care what the guidette is doing
the widget should be as small as stupid
as possible you know just program the
widget for a happy flow and if it
crashes or it the render call whatever
is doing just times out I don't care it
doesn't show it so move that logic of
well when i call the back and i am too
slow move that logic to the platform so
for example if you have a widget that
doesn't use is use any back-end but it
has up I don't know for level four loop
in the template or some super crazy
stuff like that that will be damn slow
just the platform takes care of shutting
the widget down that's the point more
yeah we have one vm with obviously when
she'll that you're seeing but we also
have slaves with slave start inside the
same vm and those are just running
different sets of with it so different
versions of a list of applications
inside the same vm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
