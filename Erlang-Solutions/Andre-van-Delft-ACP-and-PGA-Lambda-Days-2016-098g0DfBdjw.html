about two algebraic theories touch
briefly we open it and i hope to erase
your interest to FF er looks into the
literature so the first theory is called
the algebra of communicating processes
it's in the process theory starting with
axioms and what can you do with it one
thing is based programming language on
it and that's called subscript I'll
briefly showed it the other theory looks
a bit similar at first sight it's got a
PGA program algebra also axiom so you
can do it helps you reason about some
puzzles that you can encounter in
programming like with Java static
variable initialization and both
theories have in common that have been
invented or call invented by young bear
star was a researcher based in Amsterdam
in the desert and afterwards all given
small conclusion so this algebra of
communicating processes what is it it's
a bit like boolean algebra but in the
ACP things can happen it's not just
statements that things are true or false
or whatever the things that can happen
so basically we have an or operator and
an end operator like in lots of algebra
but the end operator is now a sequential
perator it's not its end then and this
way there is a kind of notion of time
hour or so and that becomes important
because now there's not just true and
false and so on but there is also
something things that can really happen
in time they're called atomic actions we
develop them a and B and the role of
true and false or or 0 &amp;amp; 1 is that 0 is
now a process that can never happen it's
deadlock that's what's called and one
instant process that succeeds
immediately if start from this then you
can add things like parallelism
a defined in terms of sequence and short
and choice and you can also define
communication this synchronous
communication between processes
disruption and interruption and there
are even extensions to this theory with
time in space and probabilities and the
end money it's so and where the HP was
developed starting in nineteen
eighty-two by young bear star and young
film club in Amsterdam and predecessor
theories that you may have heard of a
CSP and ccs which were developed around
nineteen seventeen eight or so so these
basic these five axioms of a CP which
are called the basic actions you have to
mall so in the boolean algebra there
there are a bit more about indication so
initially there's no negation in HP and
and there are also axioms for this 0 and
n 1 elements and what they do with these
now you can use these axioms also as a
term rewrite system from left to right
so now we can compute what would happen
with such a term X plus 1 and then why
so what would happen first rewrite the
rule that can apply is this distribution
law so then we would get X and the y or
one and then y and we can further
simplify the one and then y and we get
here x and then why or why in other
words your exes has become optional by
adding just one to it in the sequence so
based it you can expect things like
parallelism like except parallel y means
it's then defined using analog chivalry
operator left merge operator it says
well either the X process
its first and then the rest is parallel
with Y or Y starts first with an action
and then the rest is parallel with X or
they can start it communication and then
you can define all these other processes
these left merged operator and does the
communication operator using more some
more air axioms now what can you do with
the theory you can reason about things
and prove that there is a deadlock in in
the in a parallel system in practice
that's that works but it is quite hard
so there are there are some papers
written about it and it's it's not
really easy stuff firstly i use the acp
in an easier way just as a formalism to
express these things like choice and
parallelism in in a more basic way and
last year of us here at lambda days and
I presented this example among others
and I'll briefly touched upon it suppose
you have to get a GUI controller for a
simple program there is a search text
filter contacting a naked say go and
then somewhere in the background on
Google for instance a search happens and
at some point the thing returns and if
you want to program this in java in java
swing they must be sure that everything
happens in the right thread and it's
quite hard so what happens in jonathan
is your coat looks like this it's really
ugly and what happens it's it's kind of
spaghetti so we should not want to write
these kinds of programs in this this
language subscript which is an extension
to scatter you're right well at 4 inches
here that the life of this GUI
controller it's it's a search sequence
etc these three dots mean that something
like well through and a search freakin
so it starts with a search command and
then we show some some text
we do the search in the database and
some search results and it's just a
sequence or the other end the amount of
operations are different the search
command happens it's it's a kind of its
kind of listening it's in the event that
happens from the outside world searching
things in those results is something
that must happen in the gooey threat and
doing searching in the database must be
done in the background thread which you
can then quite easy specify this now a
search month you can just say it's it's
a search button well in the scalar style
this is effect the kind of implicit call
to a script that says the search button
is being clicked so so this is kind of a
shorthand notation but what happens here
so you must click the search button the
certain Ching searching text is an
action it's a it's but done here using
piece of scalar codes between the
special kind of braces and there is a
notation which says that it must run in
the GUI threat the annotation is not
really part of the language with the
language allows for some tweaking it is
respect and to do something in the
background thread we have a different
kind of raise prices with asterisks and
now you can easily extend the program
for instant have a cancel option and an
exit button and you must also be able to
use the enter key for instance so again
we have an eternal loop loop of search
sequences and search command is a search
button but now we can also add the enter
key that's in the or operation both
things via me we are not really adding
processes together but we are adding
things through this implicit conversion
mechanism of escala
yeah it's applied to processes but
basically it says a command is it goes
to the button or are the key likewise
the cancel button and the exit amount
well it's very exit better or the window
closing button on top of the window and
now exiting what about us sxting do so
you start with an exit command then you
get this are you sure dialogue and if
you're sure then down but if you're not
sure forex thing you must press the X
button or again you kept the dialogue
again so it's a kind of eternal loop
it's mugdha godse this way so we have a
sequence of an exit to month then we do
in the GUI threads we run this
confirmation dialog and then with a kind
of data flow construct the result of the
confirm exit is fed into the derail
predicate and this works and now we have
to activate this exit process and let's
baidu placing it in parallel with the
demesne script this is not in subscribe
it's not normal parallelism this is kind
of or parallelism it says that the
entire process is ready as soon as the
left-hand side or the right hand side is
ready it's a bit like you have in skala
inja have and see with the the boolean
or operator but it's more symmetric so
the third sequence will never end but
the exit process will end at some point
now you can answer more things and I
won't go much into it with well let's
say for cancelling there's a similar
strange there is a similar operator
which is a slice which it means the
disruption so you can cancel an ongoing
process by in this case by another event
so so far for this ACP and what you can
do with it this PGA but it's a bit
similar theory and you can it's kind of
a computational model I would say the
alternative maybe an alternative for the
Turing machine and let's have a quick
look at this so again a built with
atomic actions but now these atomic
actions with result either in true or
false and special praises are a plus a
and a minus a action which perform this
these atomic actions but also do a small
jump so plus a will burn through it will
execute the next instruction and
otherwise it will skip the next
instruction and minus eight say it
similar but the other way around and
there is also a termination instruction
and a relative jump forward and that's
all there is and then you can reason
about these things it's a programs are
built of these primitive instructions
and there was a sequential composition
and you can even have in the eternal
there's also another taste for an
eternal iteration of these things so
again there are these these kind of
actions and it's it's very typical for
the work of young bear style so it
always starts with the actions and then
prove said this it's always sound and so
on and he gave some some laws he is we
have a loop and folding which can be
proven by use of these actions so I
won't dive into this but the style is
completely similar through an ACP other
time then this is very low level but you
can go higher make higher levels out of
it for instance we have only forward
instead jumps but you can create we can
define backward jumps in terms of these
formats jumps in higher levels and
on the still higher lamp at levels you
can have numeric labels and go to that
those labels and even if then else and
while concerts then the Bears term
reasons them about what is the program
he says no program is just defined
relative to a programming language and a
programming language is test yes a set
of expressions and a projection to this
program algebra it's it's a definition
it's not a theorem and what can you do
with it there's a nice paper projection
semantics for multi file programs and
you have these kinds of this applies for
the dis uses you can the structure of
projections which are also you can see
this also as a kind of compilation steps
and what okay you do with this for
instance if you have three java cloths
the source source files and what happens
when you are doing strange things with
static variables now the first file says
we have a main program and it goes
method in second file and sacrifice to
static variables and third as well so
and practice these things are very hard
to to reason about if you just think in
terms of java but by hand you can
translate this into program algebra on a
high level and then looks a bit strange
at first sight bit term these are this
is the essential stuff not have what
happens there then you can go one
projection lower the projected to one
level over and then basically you are
getting rid of these method calls and
this is one thing and at this level you
can already reason what will happen with
the variables what value they will have
after engines
initialization okay well this is a young
barrister who created these theories and
I took in 1980 course mathematical logic
from at leiden university he also told
him lambda calculus during this course
so he created this ACP in the in the 90s
he started to think about Java but
doesn't mean what I said java program do
with it he couldn't find out and then he
developed this program algebra and later
he made us some other nice theories a
few years ago I became a head of the
informatics section of the european
academy of science series recognized as
an important scientist yet these
theories are widely unknown acp okay
there is for HP there's some acceptance
but pga is only very few people i've
heard of this yeah and that's I think
that's a that's a pity at the same time
it could be kind of nice successor for a
Turing machine what'd i miss in these PP
j publications is matter it's really a
kind of turing machine i'm not sure i
asked you on bears I said yes it should
be so so I i would bet my money on it
but there are lots of opportunities in
the in DC area so if you are working in
a university or very teaching students
or so I would certainly recommend to
dive in these materials so by clicking
on my paper my page at the conference
site you can click to to the PDF of this
with these slides and at the last page I
have lots of references for you sorry I
hope you will enjoy it enjoy main
foremost also a PGA it's a very nice
theory review thank you very much for
your attention
a relation to is there a relation to
functional reactive programming I'm not
completely sure so with this subscript i
am i'm trying to do to probably the same
things like in functional reactive
programming and I don't use things like
promises and futures and so on but like
dairy I can then you can have implicit
conversions to those two futures but
what happens I'm not completely sure
what where it is so on one hand these
scripts look like parser Combinator's
and on the other end they also some
things in common with futures one thing
that you gain is that these processes
are really interrupted or disrupt able
and the future not curvy and so that's
that's a thing of futures on the other
hand you will lose some performance here
Oh in many cases not it's not very bad
so the typical processing speed is 10
maybe 50,000 actions per second which is
quite good for GUI controllers but not
good enough for text processing lots of
texture a process for writing a compiler
for instance yeah
yes yes widely known very wide range of
application yes so so why is ACP better
I would say them or when is it better
I'm not not gonna be sure very HP is
always better but it's a it was inspired
by both CSP and ccs one one limitation
of especially ccs is that it has not a
real sequential composition there's
action prefix so the left-hand side of
sequence must also always be in sync a
single action and about ten years ago a
bit longer Yas baton has written a paper
showing that this limitation is not
really necessary so so it's very
important in the normal programming
language that you can really compose
bigger things than just atomic actions
in terms of sequences so that's a
limitation of CCS I thought csps is a
similar limitation but it also has
another different sequence of
composition but CSP what I don't like
area stairs there are two different
choice operators exclusive search
operators and in practice when i use a
CP as the SP style in entering programs
i only need one choice operator so
that's different but the real different
approach between a CP on theoretical
level and ccp esse SB is that ccs CSP
they start with this is the world and we
are and we see these laws for the world
and ACP started with the laws and then
they can build different models so
finite processes and infinite processes
and with and without recursion whatever
and they can study each different kind
of world also but first you can have
derive law sets that hold in every world
or model that they come back they can
construct based on the axioms let's see
that's the algebraic approach and about
nineteen ninety the the groups of CCSS
ESP they found out well this algebraic
and policies nice and then they call
themselves also process algebra that was
the work in aim for acp up to them so
they say it oh we also have processed
all the Bears and right ever they were
widely now and then the DM stem people
had to reprint a name into a CP because
the otherwise it was it would say I kind
of disappear anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
