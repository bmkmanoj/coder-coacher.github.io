history because we do have a lot of
coding to do is that it started out as a
no named entity and then only Kissel
y'all got his hands on 126 pages of
notes about this thing that had no name
he joined me a little while later a will
Byrd joined me and when Oleg joined me
he called it Cameron which meant
relation in Japanese and then when will
join me he basically thought this was
impossible to ever understand I took
that as a good sign
and redesigned it basically right away
and then he liked it and then finally
Jason has joined and in each case it's
gotten better and better and I think
Jason has basically reached the the
ultimate and Jason wanted to take over
all right well we're implementing logic
programming as a shallow embedding in a
functional host language racket scheme
relative and we're implementing logic
variables using those as using rackets
the host languages numbers so we'll
define we can tell something's a
variable if it's in fact a number and to
turn a number into a variable require
some deep dark magic
for those of you who don't speak lisp
that's the identity function and we're
gonna carry around logic programming is
the conjunction and disjunction
recursively defined conjunction and
disjunction of equations and as we try
and figure out what it takes to satisfy
these equations we're gonna keep a
record of all the requirements we've had
thus far so we can make sure that
whatever new requirements we have on our
solution are also copacetic with the
pre-existing ones and that record of
information is called a substitution it
you can think of it as analogy to the
environment if you're writing an in your
functional programming language but here
think of a more like you're solving a
set of simultaneous equations so when
you solve a variable X there might be a
Y or Z in the answer and so our
substitutions might look something like
we're implementing them as Association
lists so variable zeros may be
associated variable one variable one
itself might be associated for variable
two variable two might be associated
with I don't know cat and that's that's
an association
and that's what our associations look
like and if I want to figure out what
what zero means I can look up meaning in
the substitution this is a racket
primitive for doing that and we got to
give it the the element we're looking up
today I want to find zero in here and
it'll give me back that pair which isn't
quite what I wanted firstly I wanted not
the pair the Association but the thing
it was associated with and secondly
that's not what I want because I wanted
to drill in deep I wanted okay if zero
means the same as one well what does
that mean - well what does that mean I
shouldn't have to keep asking these
questions over and over again
so instead we're gonna use a use a
function call walk or find that drills
down deep and gives us the meet the
actual honest-to-goodness meaning of one
of these terms in the substitution and
what it does is given some term and a
substitution first we ask if that thing
is a variable because our associations
are always mappings of variables to
determine that term may be a variable it
may be a constant but the things we're
looking up isn't a variable then we're
certainly not going to find it assume
when we find it we we try and get
assuming it's a variable we try and find
it and because in racket pairs are
truthy anything that's not
honest-to-goodness false is considered
true so if we get a non false value well
then we'll go ahead and look it up
otherwise we'll return the thing we were
looking up so one thing you might notice
is with environments you look something
up you actually can get an error message
that says it's unbound here you'll never
get anything but sounds for information
very difference big difference so we
look we try and find the value of zero
we dig all the way down and get if we
try and find
let's say three in here we'll just get
back three because there's no
information we have about also when you
try and look up dog or something there
we're not going to find anything there
either now that we know how to look
something up in one of these sub
substitutions we ought to know how to
build one and building it in some sense
is the obvious extension you know I
should remind you also that we do take
questions so if you have a quick
question just raise your hand or
something and I'll try to reach you so
we're extending we want to extend the
existing substitution suppose we've got
some the solution to equation we can
make we can solve this equation if we
make variable X the same as term u so
we'll just add that requirement to our
program and then carry on about our
batter our merry way and we would extend
that by just creating a longer list in
the original one where we have the new
pairing of X and U in front of the old
pairing of s and so we can take our old
one and we'll say let's say three has to
be the same as dog in that substitution
Oh it adds the dot for me there we go
and so we can however this also allows
them some things we'd be happier that if
they weren't included for instance we
don't do any circularity checks here and
that can allow infinite terms for
instance we can make the variable three
the same as the list that contains the
variable three and if we did that and
three is the same as the list three
which is the same as the list three
which is the same as the list three
which is an infinite list and we prefer
to exclude infinite terms this is Lisp
printing invention actually dotted with
okay 3.32 what do you want fine fine
three in what is this going to
demonstrate no it doesn't because no if
we tried to find the real complete
meaning for this one of the things that
we're doing with our substitutions is we
don't we don't encode them in a way that
every term has exact complete meaning
one of the reasons is that in doing so
prevents the sort of situation Dan will
be worried about if I have a if I know
that variable X means the a tree a
variable Y and variable Z then we just
return a variable Y and variable Z we
don't recur into the terms and that
makes the representation of the
information we're mapping much shorter
than it might otherwise be you can
imagine situations where if you had to
update the entire substitution every
time you find a variable meaning than
your term representation for certain
terms might get exceptionally long this
is a way that saves space and
so I think makes it somewhat simpler to
understand how you add specific bits of
meaning sure no conflicts we can attempt
to write equations that are
unsatisfiable we can as is often the
case in life have desires that are just
physically or logically unattainable and
when that happens we induce failure we
haven't seen how we're going to induce
failure yet but I'll show it to you
immediately
glad you asked so there's two situations
where we might fail to add information
as it turns out this isn't sufficient we
need to eliminate the ability to add
circularity so we can't just willy-nilly
add an extender substitution we have to
make sure that we forbid circularity x'
one way that we do that is by doing
what's called the occurs check first we
see if the variable X shows up somewhere
in the term u and if it does then we
fail that was example with the three
inside the three lists the list of three
that's that's an accursed check that
will lead to lead to failure and only if
we only in the situation where the
variable we're trying to map to the term
doesn't show up in the term do we extend
and the concept of the curse check
really showed up first in Prolog lot of
years ago
and this is so this is its definition
for us
Thank You ba just says that two
variables are the same then returns true
so if the term that we're trying to add
is a variable will they darn sure better
not be the same and we find the meaning
of both pieces those of you who are not
familiar with the Lisp language world
cars and quitters are the left and right
hand sides of a pair but I'm like to
think that you all do know about car
encoder and otherwise it's not a
variable and it's not a tree with
children then what we've got is that
we're a node that's a it's a leaf node
and that node happens to be a constant
and since constants aren't the same as
variables already then we can just say
it doesn't occur
and that's one of the ways we can fail
to extend the substitution the other way
is if the two terms we're trying to
equate don't unify unification is the
implementation of unifies about I don't
know itself about a fifth of the number
of lines we need to implement the whole
system and so unification over a
language of binary trees with data the
leaves you can think of it as solving a
deep equality predicate but where you
keep track of the information for
differences if we were asking are these
two trees equal you just return yes or
no
here we allow two they're not equal yet
well they might be equal if we made a
certain change you it's either no or if
we do the following things than they
would be the first line says that if
I've got two atomic terms two two trees
that aren't pairs then if they're
already the same we just return the
original substitution and that includes
variables in this case if the if they're
not already the same but the first term
is a variable then we go ahead and try
and map add an association that variable
to the second term and that would make
them the same again provided we don't
have any circularity x' or in the
opposite case we recur and if the second
is a variable but the first one isn't
well then we'll see if we catch it the
next time around the interesting case if
we've got two trees that both have left
and right children then we'll go ahead
and try and see if we can make their
left children all the same down the left
side of the tree and if we can do that
will produce some new proper potentially
in bigand substitution and then we try
and make the right children the same in
that bigger substitution presuming that
we were successful
which is why the end is there if this if
this comes out - if this fails then we
can fail immediately and in the
situation where they're not already the
same neither one of the two or variables
so we can't add an association to make
them the same if we can't get it right
by recursion then we have an
honest-to-goodness clash as the
gentleman and the third row suggested
here's here's the other place where we
can't make them the same maybe one is
cat one is dog or one is horse and the
others gold together with fish if we
have an honest-to-goodness clash that
can't be resolved then we fail and
that's our failure situation so we could
see unify 1.2 together with in the empty
substitution and that will get us back
well those two terms are the same if one
means the same as cat means and two
means the same as cat means
likewise these two terms are the same if
one means the same as cat means and two
means the same as cat means
because we said that one has to be the
same as what's in this position and two
has to be the same as one which we
already asserted this cat
all right and so we can influent the
first of it and there's only four to
five operators in the language we're
ready to implement the first step and
this is they define we define it as
equal equal this is our equation and
this I is the program in this language
want to say that these two terms that
two terms have to be equal relative the
information we're keeping around U and V
and we'll just start off with
substitution s tan so you need to say a
few words then that this is a curried
function oh yeah that's all it is we're
just currying the lambda s right into
the syntax and this is a trick that mit
scheme had a few years ago as has racket
which is the language that we're
implementing the code in today all right
so I is the language writer give the two
terms and then under the hood our
implementation pipes through the
substitution those of you like the word
monad can find out where to place that
here so we'll let s be the substitution
we get back our new and bigan
substitution be the result of calling
unify on you use that word and begin but
what we really mean is potentially
larger right it doesn't always grow
right because we said in one of the
cases you just return s okay but
metaphorically you are thinking that
when you do unify two terms you're
getting more information and that's what
substitutions are they're pieces of
information and now you've got more and
you haven't violated the the views that
you have at this moment in time and so
the result of unify is either a new
potentially in Biggins substitution or
failure
if we could make it work or we couldn't
so if we get some non false answer back
then we'll return a list with that
contains the one answer we were able to
achieve and otherwise we return an empty
list of no answers it'd be hard to miss
that this is you know based on the kind
of list monad that you've probably seen
so coming up is non determinism when we
add disjunction we'll be able to the way
to solve either of two problems is the
way we solve the first one and then the
ways we solve the second one and we'll
move on from there but there you can see
where the list monad is or non
determinism is hanging out but you don't
need to know anything about monads I
love when Phil waddler would give these
talks and say oh you don't need to know
any category theory that was always nice
but it was all about category theory of
course all right
so we can give this a whirl or some give
it a couple champion I got a couple
examples and you'll get a sense of what
the unify is buying for us
and this auto-return a procedure Oh No
yeah another substitution I got to get
home quickly there that ought to return
a procedure because it's waiting
remember that's the lambda s that we
know for a substitute and we give it a
substitution we get back a list of
answers that list of answers is itself a
list that contains one pair the
association of variable two two variable
one so several things about this are
somewhat less than we less than we
prefer to have the first of which is I
don't like programming where my
variables are 0 1 2 3 4 that's rather
cumbersome try and write a programmer
you need 158 variables and then ask
yourself again what the 90th one was
instead we're going to be able to
piggyback on top top of our hosts
lexical scope and their lexical
variables to implement our logic
variables so what I'd like to do rather
than having to write some sort of
equation like that I'd like to create a
variable and say let's say the variable
X has to be the same as dog I'd like to
be able to write my own XYZ logic
variables and use those and so we're
gonna use the host language as lambda
with an operator call with fresh that's
going to scope this variable and pass
along the logic type the logic variable
under the hood that's the that's the
behavior that we're going to use to get
ahold of lexical variables
it's going to take an ass a function
like this
and then we're gonna give it some sort
of a state and we'll continue from there
now that we didn't mention this at the
time but one of the good reasons to use
numbers as logic variables is we want
every time we create a new new one of
these logic variables to guarantee that
it's different from all the previous
ones we'd like to functionally know how
to create a new one and we'd like to
make sure that we always have another
one available and numbers have this nice
property that if I start at zero and
increment when I need a new one I'll
know exactly how many I've used and what
the next one is and we need to carry
that information around with us so the
easiest way to do that is to carry it
not just a substitution but a
substitution together with that counter
which requires changing our
implementation of unify of equal equal
just a little
and that means here we'll return a state
that has that new s together with the
original counter rather than just
plumbing through a substitution and we
now plumb through a pair of a
substitution in that counter and again
the reason we need that counter is so
that we can get a hold of it when we
want a new variable
and so a functional a function like one
of these s it's expecting an
honest-to-goodness logic variable and we
give it a and we get it given logic
variable it returns one of these sorts
of things one of these goals that's
waiting for a state that is a
substitution and accounting so we need
to give the goal that we get back here a
substitution and a counter so we can
give it the original substitution that
we had with us and an incremented
counter
and if we give this goal the counter
then what we get back is a list of
answers either
right now one or none of them so call
with fresh let's see lambda X equal
equal X to cat and we'll call this with
a state the empty substitution together
with the counter zero and now you want
to describe the details of these
parentheses please sure this is a list
of answers and this is a single answer
state and that state contains a
substitution which is a list of these
pairs dotting variables two that two
terms together with a next variable
count we use the variable zero and
associated that with the term cat and we
know the next variable that we're going
to use is variable one and it's also a
little annoying to have to start up
using writing that state out every time
so we'll define an it state to be the
employee list together with zero
all right and that's we can right now
create as many variables as we want and
set one big giant equation and solve it
and figure out what the information is
and whether it works or doesn't and
that's kind of cool but logic
programming is about getting choices
dan what you want to say where are we
going next
well we're obviously gonna go to a
choice operator let's call it dish
that'd be all right and this takes two
goal goals okay now they look simple
right they're equal equal this to this
is one goal and how do we recognize the
goal because it's an expression whose
value is a function that takes a state
that's what a goal is and it returns a
list of states I'm using the word lists
loosely right now a list of states okay
we'll make it less loose all right I
promise
so there it is there's the call to dish
2 y 1 Z 2 which returns a function
expecting a state so goals are States to
list transformation all right and so the
way we solve these is by solving each
one individually
we just apply the goal to each and now
we have two lists guaranteed two lists
or maybe two failures who knows but two
lists and we just append them together
now I assume everybody knows a pen but
if not give two lists then you just
remove the parentheses in the middle and
you've got an append okay and now we
just write a pen here very simple
couldn't be simpler right and now we
have a pen
that's the operational definition of
remove the parenthesis in the middle
that's it right there okay so it
probably would be good idea to
demonstrate this at the doorway so see
dish of will say you do this one or
let's do something so we can clearly
tell the difference oh well probably be
good to do something where you can tell
the difference okay all right so see the
two answers all right oh I see there and
there they be mm-hmm the one answer
where we've extend the substitution and
create a new variable and the other
where we have it conjunction is
similarly defined we have binary
disjunction also binary conjunction and
the way we solve the conjunction of two
goals is solve the first one and this
returns presumably a list of answers and
since it returns a list of answers what
we want to do is we want to run the
second goal over each one of those
answers and remember even when it fails
it's still a list of answers it's just
the empty list of answers
and this is if you know it our good old
app in Matt function no just in case
you're wondering about this that's
because we know that it's always a list
and later on it will change what that
means but for now we know it's always
the list so in the case where we have a
non-empty list of answers well we need
to compute the recursion and this
returns a list of answers and we know
that running a goal on a state returns a
list of answers
and so we need some way to combine these
two lists of answers and get back a list
of answers if only we had such a
function that can do that
thanks to list of answers and returns
one list of answers any thoughts on what
that might be I have one what would you
like the only one we've got
right and so now at this point we have
both conjunction and disjunction we have
equal equal and we're actually missing
one more piece of information how on
earth are we gonna get anything done
right how are we gonna do anything
interesting yeah this is this works
perfectly well this implements
depth-first search and works perfectly
well over finite search trees
depth-first search is in point if I
complete over finite search trees it's
only when you have infinitely deep
search branches all off searches that we
built with recursion where a depth-first
search can go into a hole it can never
get out of it'll go mighty quickly let's
see what you got
so we'll define one how about define
something holds to something we'll call
it unproductive if it's if the recursion
holds aptly-named not very useful oh but
it's so use this is the kind of thing
I'd like to write write as a relation or
how about if you have this in mind let's
do
god bless you whoever you are
so X is either equal to cat or will
going to recur for more this is the kind
of thing I'd like to like to write to
implement to ask for infinitely many
cats wait wait you didn't test
unproductive
no I didn't does everyone know what I'm
productive returns no nothing it goes on
forever that's well well because this
one goes into an infinite loop just as
badly we solve a disjunction by getting
the results of both answers and then
appending them together so for the first
disjoint that's not bad we know how to
do that that returns a list of one
answer the second one returns never and
if you're waiting for the for the result
of an infinite recursion before doing
some action you're gonna be waiting
quite a while so there's the point the
problem is when we're doing building
these recursions and I'd like to rather
than recurring some part of the way
let's stop it right in its tracks and
here's the shorthand way of doing it
we'll add some new syntax so we'll say
resume one more row we'll call it define
relation and it's going to take a name
together with some arguments and then a
goal
and instead when we and when we see a
pattern like this rackets gonna
understand that this should be written
as define named args together with the
function that's going to take a
substitution and when it does that I'm
going to just use the word delay here
down we're going to delay and we can
change our implementation that later if
we decide to and so we're going to delay
the evaluation of the goal on that state
so rather than computing a recursion we
return a delay immediately we return a
promise which means that we now no
longer go into an infinite loop here and
said we stop instantaneously which is
great except that our PIN our dollar a
pin doesn't know what to do with promise
it knows what to do if it gets an empty
list or a list with at least one thing
in it but it doesn't know what to do if
we return a promise we'll have to tell
it what to do in the case where you get
a promise if we return a promise we are
going to well because we are this thing
is a promise we want to make sure what
we do the result of dollar a pin doesn't
go into an infinite loop so we'll also
delay there was delay here and what
we're going to do is we're going to
delay
we'll return a delay which when we
invoke it continues the work right where
we left off it's not like a covert team
all right those of you are old enough to
remember such terms and we can do a
similar thing in the conjunction case
because conjunction also doesn't know
what to do in the case that we have a
promise
except that has to be G and it's got to
be a dollar but you need to end a - man
do what you need to hi hat I think the -
man yeah yes
so this straightforward recurse likewise
carries on right where he left off to
little tiny changes oh wow we also ought
to make this define relation yeah two
little tiny changes to a pen and a pen
map and we've almost got the entire
system one more little itch we've got to
deal with so we return a promise which
we can enforce and we get back an answer
together with a promise for more so we'd
get the get the promise for more does
anybody recognize this data structure
and they'll force that starts with the
letter S of course that's the stream and
what we're noticing is it's cats all the
way down so that clearly should have
been called Turtles
all right and so this this seems to work
we can get multiple as many answers as
we want out and so long as we're getting
them one at a time there's no problem
with with this infinite recursion
because we always have to push the
button for however many we want let's
say we wanted to get I like cats but I
also like turtles
you didn't change your definition of
cats playing change did you do what did
you change your definition of cats no I
left it the same as it was okay good
okay
and I do need to load the file
so we run this I'll get a turtle and if
we run it for one more answer
we'll also get turtles and turtles and
turtles and turtles all the way down the
reason being is that it's exactly what
we said and nobody stopped us when we
did it what happens to combine these two
potentially infinite streams together is
when we reach a promise when we find a
delay in one well then we continue right
where we left off right where we left
off getting infinitely many more of
those cats and turtles and never do we
get to the cat so the solution going
from a depth-first search that we've now
made work in a shout in a strict host to
an inner leaving depth-first search that
turns it into a complete search is to
wait for it switch those two answers now
when we hit a recur hit a delay we
instead let the other guy go and because
we do this at every choice point it this
turns out to be implement a complete
search guarantees complete by
construction based on the program that
we're right now it's not depth-first
search or iterative deepening
depth-first search any of the particular
search strategies you know of
necessarily but it is guaranteed to be
complete and this is the least amount
that you can require for an arbitrary
program to guarantee that you'll get a
complete search
and now it's officially the entire
implementation well Dan this is I'm also
rather annoyed at this oh the force oh
well you can get rid of that one let's
do that so a simple tank of some kind
right yeah something like that so two
things it's awful annoying to have to
force force force force force force
force because that maybe it takes
multiple steps to finally get to some
sort of an honest-to-goodness answer we
could be having to push on a promise for
a while so or pull on a promise this is
called hind representation right if what
we've got is a promise then we'll pull
on forcing the promise otherwise if we
have something that's either the empty
list or a list with a real answer then
we'll just return that answer and what
do you say we pull we grab the
definition of take and also add that in
so we're throwing in now in this
definition which is very simple it
simply says you'd give this a number and
you give us a stream because it's now
really is a stream and we'll give you
the first ten elements out of the stream
if there are that many answers but if
there aren't that many answers then it
will give you less nevermore right but
those of you who haven't had your coffee
alright so make sure we load it
now I can ask this for
take the first three answers
out of well let's pull on it and then
take the first three answers off of that
and we'll get Turtles cats turtles and
now we get an interleaving search and
this is sufficient to do logic
programming the classic logic
programming 101 example is is a pen and
the pen is neat and logic program one of
the benefits of this is that we can
write rather than the pin function that
takes two inputs and produces an output
or if I wanted to find all the ways to
concatenate two lists together to
produce it I have to write a second
function that takes the list ABCDE and
produces the two by n matrix of answers
that says the list a together BCDE and
then the list a be together with CDE etc
all if I want to produce all the ways I
can combine two lists together to
produce the initial one but if we
describe things that relationally then
we can write one function so to speak
that we can use in any of these
different modes to get the answers we're
after and this is sufficient to do that
kind of programming now it's not
necessarily the the language you want to
program in but I assert this is probably
the language you'd want to compile down
to and the compiling down is simply very
trivial one or two line macros and
there's I think six or seven of them
it's not big and let me just pause for a
moment and give you a little bit of a an
advertisement the reason the camera came
out in 2005 and
the reason schemers new addition I don't
know what exact title will be will be
coming out relatively soon I hope and it
will have virtually the same code
including all the macros that make it
mini Cameron so that's something to look
forward to I hope alright so do we have
time to write a pinda turn the whole one
out of the water no no oh well in that
case that would've wise oh it's really
tricky the first time define relation so
this is we're implementing it as a
disjunction we're either two things have
to be the case either L has to be the
same as the empty list and s has to be
the same as the output or BES this is
our first case when the first list is
empty the second third have to be the
same otherwise
well we'll posit two fresh variables
well Jason's busy typing I would like
for you to know that there have been 50
implementations of micro Cameron since
it first came out I'm what some 35 or so
languages yeah 35 or so languages it's
all available on many canon org but the
temptation should be really strong that
you want to do it on your own favorite
language that you use as your go-to
language when you're in a hurry and if
you have you write in a functional
programming language that provides
closures conditionals constants numbers
higher order functions in garbage
collection I can show you how to write
one of these in your own favorite
language so if you're working on a day
to day basis and need some logic
programming you can bust one out right
quick solve your logic programming go
back to your functional language didn't
you just ask a student recently to do
one in JavaScript yeah what's that you
have also done it yes of course
what we wanted to see if the student
could do it as well teachers do right
you have to keep exploring the life in
them in the brain of the student with
them all right so
either the first lists have to be empty
and the second has to be the same as a
third or given the exhaustive the
existence of two variables a and D such
that the first list is the same as the
pair of a and D and then pause at
another variable so that the output is
the first L the car of the first list
together with this R that's the output
and the recursion is itself an appended
so call let's see with initial what are
you calling I wrap it in and take so
call with initial state yeah sure how
many do we want six okay boy all right
let's do it
so take six Oh No call with initial
state will do that for me and there
she'll state six and let's call fresh
lambda X
X
why
z and we'll say append Oh XYZ well there
you know those are the answers and
that's six ways you can pin list
together and get or we can do about
let's see ABC together with de and if we
add some pretty printing on top of this
they come out looking exactly like the
lists ABCD efg but that's in
approximately 50 lines of code logic
programming sufficient to a pin lists
together and it turns out under some
assumptions this is enough to generate
coins too now I do want to say a couple
words in case you don't happen to have
all the fancy tools that racket has
lambda nil will do your self fine for
delay and invoking one of those will
take care of force and that's really all
you need except then you have to ask
procedure question mark you set a
promise question mark if you happen to
be in a scheme or you can put a tag on
the thing and check to see if the tag is
whatever it happens to be for arbitrary
thunks functions of no arguments so you
don't really need all these fancy tools
and and you may not want to be writing
programs in racket so this is that's how
simple this is it didn't start out
simple trust me it really didn't but now
it is become that's pretty much it or
have we just gone for questions okay
questions I don't think we had time for
quite well I don't think oh I last way
words are we're time for questions
the first thing where it's were I don't
think oh I miss those thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
