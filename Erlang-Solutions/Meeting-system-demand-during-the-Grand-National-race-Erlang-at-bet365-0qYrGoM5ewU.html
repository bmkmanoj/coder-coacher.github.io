sis Steven gold be from Erlang solutions
in London and thank you for tuning in to
this webinar which is to do with really
the systems processing and how bet365 in
particular cope with the massive Peaks
presented to them during the grand
national which is a traditional British
horse race and talking about that demand
is going to be Andrew Dean who's the
systems development manager at bet365
he's in stoke-on-trent an arm in London
bet365 have been suppose airline uses
for something like well this is their
fifth year of use and they have a number
of systems in operation and Andrew will
tell us something about how they came by
this decision some of the processes that
they've been through at the end of
Andrews presentation we'll have time for
some questions and I think there is a
panel on the right side there where you
can actually type in some questions
which we won't attempt to Archer until
the end of the presentation and if we do
actually run short of time was still
ensure that everybody does get their
questions answered right so in order to
make best use of the time if I can hand
over now to Andrew and he'll tell us a
bit more about how he stop worrying and
learn to love the grand national thank
you Andrew afternoon all yes sir
basically my name is under Dean I'm
currently a software development manager
at bet365 I kind of cut my teeth in
finance I worked for a smoky maker and a
stockbroker for something like 13 years
the the systems that the sub market
makers have in place are basically
aggregated data feeds formulating the
price disseminating that price out to
third parties generating trade
opportunities committing the trade
reports on that trade and then settling
the trade this is an extremely similar
model to sports sport trading so
basically i moved to 365 two years ago
and into the middle a department and it
immediately do under me that the the
scale of the operation is really share
trading on on steroids what we see sorry
what would have been a busy hour in my
old life is the same order of magnitude
that we see in a quaint second here is
just to give you a flavor of the the
size and scale of the operation that
we've got the motor responsible for a
number of 365 systems which include bet
placement some of the settlement systems
session management cash out which is a
very important system a very popular
system and the publishes what we used to
disseminate all of our site content
bet365 ourselves we were the largest
private employer in stoke-on-trent um we
so is easily we we take very large
volumes and very large sums of money
week there's a 34 billion wagering on
sports last year we continue to see
double-digit percentage growth
year-on-year we're extremely technology
focused and we invest heavily in
technology to the sort of 60 million per
annum which has basically allowed us to
leverage that technology and become the
world's largest online sports main
company by a large margin oui oui
greater size than our two newest
competitors combined continuum own sort
of investment theme we've recently moved
to a new multi-million pound office on
an area with in stoke-on-trent is the
rejuvenated festival park area um we
typically on a normal quiet day we'll
make between one and one and a half
million markets on site we support a
number of languages that 18 figure goes
up regularly our transactional systems
the sequel systems as they are the
moments run in excess of half a million
transactions a second we're a very
bursty business and we burst sure you
can read up to 100,000 changes at a
second majority which it apart from our
automated pricing models during a busy
afternoon so traditionally saturday who
and we can have 200 million users on
site and we service or in the region of
6 million HTTP requests to second one of
the things I didn't appreciate before
move to the company is that we stream
more live sport than anybody else in in
Europe so on some levels we are a
broadcast the Grand National itself is
for those that aren't in the UK is a
this is the largest day of the horse
racing calendar it's it can be it is the
equivalent to black friday to really we
see enormous there's enormous
interesting in the race itself it
generates lots of drama there's 40
runners it's quite a long race so so it
sort of four miles the majority the
runners don't actually complete the race
through tightness or falling up fences
and this can generate lots of very
exciting stories and lots of drama
day which means that it's it's a
extremely popular race with with casual
what casual betters from from the
figures from 2006 you know it's so 2015
it's estimated there was some two
million pounds bit sorry 200 million
pounds waged on this on this one race
alone enough to those figures oh well
got four last year well we don't
actually have the figures yet if
obviously it's a big it's a big day for
us as it is for the industry we see lots
of new customers arriving we don't help
ourselves at all we run lots of special
offers and the days prior to the race
the race day is itself starts very early
people will wake up and immediately want
to get there get the bets on for the day
so we see volume start to build from
about nine o'clock and traditionally the
race the race off is quad bust full so
we see a whole day ramping up to to the
off which traditionally zman's of three
percent increase at the peak the the key
thing for us is whilst we're servicing
this this and what is for a large but
casual demand and we also have to
service our regular customers so whilst
we've got the race on were also on the
sports book including a lots of in play
markets and spreading across 30
classifications over a thousand fixtures
up to 120 markets on each fixture so you
can see that as well as the this
abnormal load from from the race itself
we're still supporting the millions of
opportunities that there are on site at
that point in time and one of the key
things for us is to is to keep the site
function as if this so future normally
wasn't happening and then it's very
important for us to give our regular
customers and the same experience that
they see each day on the on the website
this power of placing the best within
the systems there's sort of what I
mentioned about Morgan making and
there's various stages in the in the
life cycle making a price disseminating
that price get the opportunity out to
the customers being able to process and
their request to place placing the bet
customer the option to to cash out
that's something that's now substandard
within the industry we were wondering
for run us to bring to bring that in
allowing customers to take money back
having changed their mind and and then
settle the bet and update the customs
balance the way that we run these
systems is we we bulkhead these services
out so what we try and do is this if we
have any issues within and those of
individual services that it doesn't
affect the remainder of the system but
what it does mean is that if we have
failures within those individual
components that the that the experience
where the customer is really degraded as
you see you know if we if we can't make
a price we got stale odds can't get the
price out to the customers that still
out on site you can't generate
opportunities there's no markets the bet
on Christmas can bring the requests
uh-huh that's when you get placed if
cash out isn't available it's a degraded
service for the customer obviously
settling the bettors extremely important
to us and as is the withdrawal of funds
the way that we handle the increased
load is basically because we within the
within the traditional systems we only
have
a finite we have finite resources and
finite capacity within the transactional
system what we've traditionally done is
is the is bets and fixtures move through
the life cycle we've managed to meet
demand by moving capacity around the
systems this usually means by basically
we've got a ridiculous amount of of
options so that we can prioritize bet
placements against settlement and turn
off various parts of the system should
like condon under extreme demand demand
so if if we sort of similar systems were
being stressed we will we will have a
sort of graceful failure of the system
including some turning off customers
full history the systems that we really
don't like doing but in order to
preserve the experience for the
remaining customers and there are any
parts of the system we bulkhead that it
works well or multiple to a point um it
is very nervy and obviously we hope we
are degrading that the servicer at that
point the idea is is to bring the demand
under control so we don't actually lose
the site one thing that happened this
year the organized announced that they
were moving the traditional race start
from corpus for two quarter plus five
what this actually means for us is that
subtly afternoon it caught us five we're
busy settling out and huge volumes of
bets that are now been settled and
multiple as part of the football for the
day it's our peak settlement period so
what they simply moving the start time
by an hour means that now our peak bet
placement period is it
we slap bang in the middle of our peak
settlement period there was a real fear
around this on what my behalf been
responsible for these systems what and
we do send tend to see when we get when
we go past being able to manage the
demand is really one graceful failure of
the system so we start to see and lots
of locking and laughing within the
system that means that we've you know
there's synchronization points are being
overwhelmed and we it also means that we
can't use the full capacity at that
point because everything as interlocking
know it happens in traditional systems
gives even worse the ones we start to
get those locks we get stalls within the
database once we get in there stools
what will still have to do is apply by
pressure once we get that back pressure
we get into the the fairly feedback loop
once were it really doesn't mean that
we're going to end up what I like to
call I'm disgracefully failing which
means that the customers see this page
in this page only this is this is a bad
day for us there was a real fear and did
having such a large demand at this point
would what cause would cause an outage
so as the day came to us we were quite
worried phul is certainly I was but what
actually happened was nothing we really
did have the perfect day the team that
would sort of assembled for that day to
monitor the systems and and and sort of
cater for any potential outages that we
saw we basically SAT around monitoring
our systems rifles and eating pizza
wasn't good for for a waistline but it
was certainly good for us in that we had
our record day um we so
you see we were as of twenty-nine
percent on the granite or suddenly with
twenty-nine percent up on a normal
Saturday we were overall overall we were
twenty-six percent up on the previous
year's grand national figures a peak and
we were forty two percent up over a
normal Saturday and a peeker thirty-four
percent up on the previous grand
national so it was was an excellent day
for us figures bear out so really you
know how how did we get to that to that
point a number of years ago we started
to invest in a lung we began with a
number of small small ish and pocs we
started working with well they were
important systems to us but they were we
could turn them off if we need to take
all you know we would face things in so
we started to get a long into production
in in small areas and then we could have
moved through and some of the
applications that we got and started to
tackle more and more increasingly
complex problems we started to to use
both and distributed a nun distributed
ear lang this is we approach those
complex problems and now we've got to a
point where we've got a number of
business critical systems I really like
the one that made the difference on the
day is a system that we call bets it is
a multiform multi farm stateless
application which and basically we what
we did is we took react dt and
introduced crdt supports into the
application layer a colleague of mine
mark going did a did a talk on how we
actually manage that and last year's and
a long Stockholm
conference after that the videos are up
if you want to go into great detail of
how we actually managed to leverage
react DT within the application excuse
me we use react TV on the back sistance
and we fully integrated this system into
our traditional transactional systems
what that really meant for is what
airline gave us is really sort of crooks
is that the increased capacity the best
application that each each application
each note of which that there are some
many angled millions of operations
parallel on the day which is obviously
excellent 443 boss I think what I didn't
appreciate until afterwards with the not
only can we do enormous parallel
processing for what airline actually
gives us because of the and the way
which it uses a multi-core hardware and
it is it actually increase the yield
from our heart from that Hardware
basically we're getting more out of the
CPUs the fact that we can spin up
airline processes but very small
ownership initialization times means
that we can if we get any better
placement bursts which we we tend to see
certainly is there run up to good the
roll up to the off we sought to see it
sort of ramped up and if there's only
seeking bet in-play so if there's any
events that would cause people to want
to lay additional funds then we can see
thats boost coming in the way what's
your lung initial Isis initializes those
processes and very soft short order we
can we can respond to those whose boosts
the enforced and statelessness
a very long either we can carry state
but brush part because we don't increase
the throughput of the system basically
were enabled able to horizontally scale
and the application out which is
excellent the one thing that became
apparent and through our use of Iranian
is in the difference assistant to this
was the scheduling algorithm at first we
thought it was a it was a problem and
that we could see pauses because work
was being done it turns out was that it
was the it was the VMS scheduling
algorithms actually protecting our key
processes from becoming overwhelmed if
mailbox has become large than the actual
producer as scheduled out which from a
wild assistant perspective is is
excellent we you know we don't get into
that sort of feedback loop because we're
basically moving moving the work away
and allowing the process that's become
or starting to run behind sit actually
after the CPU and another sort of great
thing that we see with with a bank is
even after sort of extensive periods of
a full of live soak testing as we call
in that we've got this unprecedented
load that just keeps coming and coming
and coming again higher and higher and
higher we don't really see any leaks
which is excellent because obviously we
want to we want to you cpu you want to
use the memory what for doing real work
we don't we don't tell you about not to
be lost kara ties in with the low
garbage collection times that we see
basically means that the D and CPUs are
being used to burn to do real work
rather than just simply burning cycles
or we also see Oh in this system
others is real resilience and the the
soil mixture of the leather craft
philosophy and the redundancy that we
build in an application way through the
various sub development patterns that we
use and deployment patterns that we have
real system systems resilience you know
so we can we can cater for those we can
cater for those edge cases that we that
we don't see and just move past and in
the main where and what we're dealing
with the real work then we need to get
on with the good thing about the running
on the dl nvm is that the rollout they
were unable to makes of on the fly
configuration changes when we do when
we're dealing with such large systems
and a lot of 365 x 24 operation we can't
take things out traditionally we would
manage this new forms but it becomes
more and more advantageous and that we
use this sort of on the flight
configuration changes and it allows us
to maneuver many of the systems and much
more agile way one thing that the vm and
the console also gives us this increase
of process monitoring and we go lots and
lots of statistics that we that we give
out of out of the systems and charting
these various stats allows it gives us a
real understanding of our applications
and the systems and the behaviors that
that will see during these and during
these heavy load periods and for me from
it from my point of view being so
responsible for these systems it's great
to have that insight into how the system
is going to behave and how it behaves
over time and yeah and one thing that I
don't think even though we
we didn't have to use it on on national
day but what I think there's great to
always have in the back pocket is is the
ability to her coat load a hot load code
just be a couple of instances during
sort of normal non non national on a
normal day where we've wanted to make
changes very quickly and we've done that
through hot loading of code is a very
very powerful tool but you have to be
careful it was easy enough enough rope
to shoot yourself in the foot so come in
summary what autoline gave us through
through this to the BET system and on
the supply systems within our ecosystem
is really increased capacity real
visibility into what systems are doing
the real maneuverability in the way that
we can adapt the systems as we go and
obviously we were able to eat lots and
lots of pizza on the day so thanks for
listening and hopefully there are some
questions Oh much of that Andrew it was
a very interesting it's not often that
some of the successful companies live
the difference of a bit then you can
estic see what's going on the processes
that are involved we have had some
questions and one of the first ones here
is really to do you mentioned react and
I'm not quite sure who's asked the
question but in any event i'll try and
i'll try and summarize it to a degree
quote I've heard many opinions on on
react some people say it's pretty good
and some have no issues with it you can
get
what's coming here other hey it's pretty
good there which is what other people
say that they encounter endless problems
with react when they when the DB falls
apart and the data becomes broken I
would hazard a guess that nearly all
databases present certain issues but I
mean what's your impression of reactant
I mean it's a pretty open question
really yeah react is really stable for
us we we inject a lot of data into Rica
react and and we delete a lot of data I
think it's a bit of an odd speaking of
the guys from Russia it's a bit of an
odd case in that we've got this constant
chin through through react obviously
it's used for some big data and
applications or we we deal with a lot of
data out of it as we're processing
through and so we we can t use in it
right on the edge of where where it was
designed well I don't think we're a
typical use case i think is one trying
to say yet it performs extremely well
for us we know the this off speed speed
in which you can put data in the speed
in which you can get data out the
volumes that we put through it is it's
very reliable and weave them we've had
various of operational issues where
disks have been lost machines have been
lost we don't see any adverse effects
and the rest of the cluster occasionally
you might see that when you have one of
these events like a machine disappearing
you'll see maybe a long put time I want
to say long it's talking still sub
second but you know that's in that's one
part in millions so on so yeah we we
really like react
fine ah hopefully I'm not muted at this
juncture I think that last is the
question pretty well I mean as I say
most most complex data storage systems
are to be held and need some reverence
in the book yes if things do go wrong
let's have to plan to fix and sort out
but I think the notion what at the gist
of what you're saying I think is that
well it doesn't actually go wrong very
often when should once you actually got
the thing into the right operational
situation yeah that's right and also the
you know the use of these RC o DTS you
know we basically took to the library
and start to use it and it's safe to say
that we our application wouldn't work
without it yeah all right well thanks
for that and I think YUM yes as Andrew
said that there is a mic wasn't it like
was it Mike Smith said it didn't do much
oh yeah okay you know he did an original
presentation on CR DTS and the whole
thing is also related to the sky I think
it's Mark Shapiro sink free type scheme
so I mean I said it's a very hot topic
on the on the technology front we had
another question she's a bit broader in
remit that as a no line newbie could you
please explain why you use Erlang an OTP
directly and not elixir um as a good
question actually um we are we are
beginning to take a look at Alexia um
but i think it was felt that the sort of
the history of OTP and airline and the
number of cycle you know so cpu cycles
that it's been through you know it is it
is kind of tried and tested and we
whilst we we look at all technologies
and we'll look at sort of young
technologies as well we we do tend to go
for proven technologies and having said
that we all
Alex our bridge happens that we we
needed a safe bet okay oh yes it seems
reasonable to me a lot from the number
sorry that's not meant to sound quite as
God as finding as it did oh no what I
was trying to say was it from her from
my experience of programmers who've
encountered Alexa it is very much first
of all why would I bother in terms of
doing this it is the importance of
elixir and it's take up is very much
related to the fact that you're not
probably an egg program or developer you
might think about problems in the same
way but you you don't think of them in
traditionally annoying nature and for an
early developer to start using elixir in
earnest I mean I might do it possibly as
a hobby I'll get shot after this I'm
sure but the traditionalists look on it
is something that works very interesting
and he obviously uses all of the
stability in the scheduling capabilities
of the redundancy that the vm presents
but the hope is that it allows people
who are familiar with our the Erlang
syntax and development set toolset to
migrate into something that is quite
different it provides some and not all
of the same functional response positive
responses same fractional properties as
using airline would but I you know
special point in that it's a new
language by comparison so yeah I mean
bigger commercial firms that are doing
information distribution can adopt it
quite easily without all of the ANC's
that people doing real accounting and
the possibility of losing money would be
have a bit more trepidation or suspect
is the alone yeah in and in another
another question here is from I think it
comes to what you said it is there in
the gambling world is there
wartrace actually the biggest demand of
the year I personally I find that that
charge got well because I I do struggle
to understand and we knew an
international company so I assume that
not all of your users are based in the
UK the Grand National is an event in
Liverpool isn't that really interesting
everybody else in the world that's that
level yeah it's safe to say that the
majority of the customers that come on
and all subway doing on the national or
are based in the UK it is it is a large
day for us we do have other days where
we see very large demand as well so this
this summer will be very busy for us
obviously the euros are on the olympics
are on but we will see we'll see large
volumes on Champions League night and
just because it it's a huge huge event I
think some you know hundreds of millions
of people will watch the event so that
that's a large large stay put yeah it's
a I think it's the the National is that
you know it's a real sort of prestige of
Marquis de and so we yeah we see lots of
lots of new users right okay um sorry I
was I'm suddenly asked to show my screen
there we are another question perhaps
along the same lines I mean we're
shortly heading towards in Europe the
Euro football championships and is that
going to be the same nature then because
I mean I was at some conference in
central in the Hippodrome in London and
most of the gambling companies seem
really concerned about the volumes
they're expecting from that but I mean
from what you're saying it's just simply
walk in the bark in terms of you know
war but it can it be bigger than the
Grand National
yeah yes it can it ended within the
obviously it's you know it's a very it's
a very it's an event with worldwide
appeal and the fact that you know a
football match will go on for 90 minutes
there'll be lots of sort of events
within their you know lots of excitement
and people can people can bet in-play so
that you know if if teams started to
score or run away with it we see you
know bursts in traffic so we we we will
we will see Peaks that will go go above
above but the thing about the national
is is it's that it's the sustained
sustained nature of that the volume it
just gets bigger and bigger and bigger
the euros we will see Peaks having said
that you know there might be I don't
know what the games will will throw up
yeah we could see you know we can see
really exciting games I'm hoping to see
really exciting games yeah yeah Oh of
wing when you'll get past the group
stages um said well that yeah it'll be
good smile help your table right another
question and when developing your
software in Erlang do you use dialyzer
and and spec four types or any other
additional software for static code
types and we do use dialyzer and type
specifications and in places you don't
enforce it across all one of the reasons
been that it's a dynamic language if you
name your variables sensibly don't know
what types are supposed to be coming in
so yeah so yeah we do use we do use
dialyzer and in various places but we
don't use it across the board and on the
same basis I assume that you're not you
don't use things like I think quick
check or things like this for
thing by design so it's not it's not
something that you build into it no no I
don't think a pretty sure we haven't use
quick check out but I probably am
corrected but I haven't heard of any
other guys use well well going on from
that we had another question that I
suppose it is a pretty obvious thing if
everything is so busy all the time how
do you actually test the what you're
putting into this system to be sure but
it doesn't break it and I don't want
testing the thing yeah we have extensive
test systems really that we you know
will functionally test something and
then we'll stress test and then we'll do
feel sort of destruction testing will
attempt to is put the put the new
changes under load and then and and then
basically trying and and destroy the
system by you know being our own chaos
monkeys really and will you know take
out loads and remove remove the network
split the split system in half sort of
thing and triad undies to one had to
break it and it is it it's quite a heavy
testing cycle that we put stuff through
and because we're so precious about our
life systems that's not being said that
the live system is it does throw up
anomalies now and then and we have to we
have to cater for them and that Airlines
sorta like rush philosophy really helps
us there in that you know we can we can
move past that error and obviously fix
the error and our code loading allows us
to fix that in place it's not something
that we'd like to rely on but it is
always good to have that sort of get out
of jail card okay well I suppose going
on from that this is a personal question
but presumably it's like the traditional
telephone exchange
get switched off in that you can swivel
off because that's basically what the
business is that's right that's right
yeah we we just got in the system of it
then you know it's very rare that you'll
see there's those holding pages and
going up right now are there any other
questions out there I've got one more
here that is related to something that
you said earlier on in the presentation
then again this is more of a generic
question rather than the detail when we
just had about dialyzer you may feel
comfortable answering it you may not
know question is will you be expanding
your broadcast services and I don't know
I don't know to be perfectly frank I do
know obviously done now know that we we
stream a lot of sport um I don't know
the plans are not to expand that yeah
soon and I have any more questions here
that's
I am struggling to see ah did you
encounter any specific unexpected
problems with early any examples and how
you manage to control them problems so
far no no no I can think of other tore
off the top of the head that was the
issue that i mentioned with the
scheduler but i think that was really
our our understanding what the
scheduling algorithm of why if if a
mailbox became full why a process would
be scheduled out rather than just going
on with the sort of natural flow
obviously that's that's now though now
we know it's there to protect the
downstream processes and protect the
mailbox from becoming it'sit's unbounded
after all at one point you're gonna you
know memories only finite so once we
understood what the schedule is actually
doing and the reasons behind it yeah
yeah we became comfortable with that and
it just means that you know you change
your application design slightly then
it's okay a question from somebody
regarding I think build and distribution
quote do you use any specific build
system for building the airline way or
make for you mad or any other custom
built stuff and we have a number of ways
of building we haven't we haven't found
a solution that kind of meets every
applications needs so we've really
experimented with a number of build
tools i think i'm not completely afraid
with alexia but i understand that it's
tooling is
and I should we say more what
straight-lined yeah so we were still
kind of on a voyage of discovery in
terms of what is the best way for us to
build build their applications the thing
isn't our applications are so diverse
that one build system a build system for
one isn't so Sarah Lee right for another
but you know at the end of the you know
we produced been files and ship right
the other part of that was is there a
other specific things that you also use
for distribution rather than just making
and in the main we distribute through
rpms use a package manager and to get
them all out onto the out onto the notes
mine okay right are there any other any
other questions that term that the
audience would wish to have put towards
Andrew as we're nearing right the build
systems do you encounter any certs
between room you could you explain we've
done that let's get back there as you're
on development cycle shortened or have
you spent more time on testing less time
what changed I think that's looking from
actual the Lang engaging withering and
using it and yeah it has that sort of
times am I can ask them done we do it's
hard to say whether and we do we do more
testing now because we've kind of always
done extensive testing is it is a it is
a long testing cycle but yeah the again
it's difficult to say whether you know
if if we
program this thing in language x vs new
one would woods this warm application
have been developed quicker you know
that's hot scene in general artsy's come
down a little right and notice that the
question regarding rear had actually at
the header off it which was to do with
Lisp lisp play flavored earl and you
have any views on that I've never never
a Sawbuck encountered it hot pan I used
to work with a guy who would ready for
parties so and he was a good guy it
wasn't just right so what I dini do you
use for early um well I'm personally I
use the all only editor anybody should
ever use which is fine but the
development team in general use whatever
the favorite editor is really
everybody's free to use their own week
so we've got a mix of you know emacs and
Phi and IntelliJ people use I think some
sucker for punishment use Eclipse yeah
so the full range freely okay uh we've
done the build system it was something
other we go Bubber Bubber this is the 1i
gentlemen in Thailand says I'm teaching
business computing at the University
after comment that we should be teaching
walk and currency in functional
programming but to give a view on why if
you think these things are important and
perhaps what skills you look for in
terms of what you're when you're
employing graduates yeah I'm are
completely a great self concurrent
programming and parallel processing
again it going to be the next 15 years
20 years and probably more if the of the
industry Moore's law has taken us to a
point now we've got it you know
we can't get more speed altitudes we're
just using more chips we you know we
need we need to be able to process and
parallel CS so I've kind of even though
you know I worked in using various
languages I think code in a functional
way is the way that is the way forward I
think it's the only way you can really
stretch the systems and get all the
yield you can out of out of those bits
of silicon as for what what I look for
in developers is really opposed to quote
Jos polski it's smart people that get
get things done so people that can you
know a bit think they can get so head
around the concepts which I don't think
it difficult you know passing state in
I'm performing an operation passing the
results back not you know no side
effects that's pretty nice pretty
straightforward stuff so people think
they can get on with that and then then
show a real soft feel sort of attitude
towards getting the work done over the
last few years we've obviously been
expanding and but we haven't just
recruited young programmers we've critic
good developers and cross trained and
interviewing for a force of a program of
onboarding people and what we're really
looking for is people that have got good
systems knowledge that you know that
know how a distributed system fits
together of functions and how how long
you know what those fairly cases are and
how to code around them or not sits on
his King not to code around yeah I think
there's a there's a lot to be said for
differences in approach from one or the
other there I owe ya one I don't know
sorry just just a rama point home i
think a real Jewish universities
wouldn't just teach
and our web programming I think yep
teaching and so sensible you know
functional programming as well it should
be yeah we don't need we don't need
those hierarchies we don't need
factories winning functions yes well
said and I'll send you on a mission to
simple new kitchen whatever next yes off
you go right so there's another question
really followed on from see this and the
original one was from Richard about
whether the development cycle had
shortened and you spent money to spend
more or more or less hard testing the
sort of a junk question was furthermore
how much smaller is the code base well
I'm always a bit dubious about this i
mean if you hadn't written the stuff
before how much are we going to know how
much smaller it was but it was a similar
application that was in existence do you
think that it is smaller oh yeah yeah it
will be good the dawn unions if so much
more terse then tenant of I don't know
pick on Java but I will um you know it's
it's joe isn't job is incredibly for
both um you know it's I've I warned
keyboards out programming in java java
and see if that occur basis is much
smaller right okay um i think from the
same person originally what did they
replace Erling for i meanwhat wishing
for the words what what erling replaced
what was in use that you then started to
design and produce things in early that
was the question yeah i think well we
did write a lot of systems in in java
one thing that we found i think that
people fund a fund of the industry also
is that you know all i want to do is you
know it is this X you know I want to
print something on the screen I don't to
think about a complete type hierarchy
think about all these things that need
to be in place before those things
really do slow down development and you
find people to know disappearing in
their own thought processes of of what's
needed and they kind of get away from
what we're trying to achieve with this
software what trying to achieve is a
business you know it's like look at this
beautiful type hierarchy well that's all
well and good but you haven't solved the
original problem yeah so so it was it
was really did to get away from that
sort of you know my the industry was
finding itself in to get back to and
programming I think it so I think is rob
banks quote hunger pinch it anyway is in
the object-oriented program is really
the Roman numerals of programming you
know it served a purpose but it's not
necessarily an ideal yeah we've moved on
yeah yeah hello we move yeah I see it as
a diversion and we've now gone back to
where to where we should have been going
bold words indeed right over I think
I've covered most of the effect yeah I
think I've done all of the questions
that i can think i can see yes that may
not be all of them but i think they're
all about I think that's about it then
unless you've got anything else to add
because some of you've been more than
helpful with terms of both describing
the processes involved in some of the
reasons that you picked up her leg and
ran with it but as I say it's very
interesting to hear somebody from a very
big commercial company that's got all
this stuff riding on it and also from
the person who has to sit in the chair
by the screening watching things and
making sure that it does work that's not
always everybody's ideal in terms of
often easier to write programs and then
go away somewhere else rather than have
to be responsible for ensuring that they
do run in genuine operational
environment so good luck to you for that
well but thank you very much for your
time Andrew and if there are no more
questions I would like to draw the
session to a close as we're we're
approaching the hour anyway and thank
you very much Andrew for the time and
effort to put in for the presentation if
there are any other questions that
people will come to mind for anybody in
the audience please Justin down and send
them off to the the address there
webinar at erling iphone solutions com
myself or indeed Andrew if they are of
nature to bet365 will be pleased to
answer them and thank you all very much
for listening and we hope to have you on
air again hopefully within the next
month alright thanks very much and
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
