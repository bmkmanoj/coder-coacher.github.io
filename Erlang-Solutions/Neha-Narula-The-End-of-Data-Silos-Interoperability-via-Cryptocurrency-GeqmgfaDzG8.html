research director of this small group at
the MIT Media Lab called the digital
currency initiative and so interesting
story I used to work on databases
actually and more recently after after
finishing my PhD I got really interested
in crypto currencies and so now people
invite me to speak at their conferences
thinking I'm gonna talk about something
useful like databases and actually I
talked about crypto currencies instead
so but this talk is gonna be about
databases and crypto currencies and you
are probably thinking what do these two
things actually have to do with each
other well we're gonna we're gonna go on
a journey to connect the two and the
first thing I want to talk about here is
this idea of interoperability so how
many people here take pictures maybe
with their phone yeah pretty much
everybody where do you put those
pictures so my pictures are everywhere
they are on Instagram and Facebook and
Twitter and snapchat and Dropbox and my
old phone in my new phone and my
computer and an SD card somewhere right
it's a huge mess it's a serious serious
mess we have all of these apps and
photos that are trying to capture our
photos and our apps and services that
are trying to capture our photos and
none of them actually work together who
remembers back when Instagram photos
showed up in line and Twitter yeah so so
I I'm not sure how many of you know this
but um in 2012 Instagram actually turned
off support for showing photos in
Twitter right and so now when someone
links to an when someone shares their
Instagram photo on Twitter you just see
a link and you have to click through and
go to instagrams website so let's just
be clear here this is a photo that I
took and I posted on Instagram I have
explicitly chosen to share it with
Twitter and it's probably public anyway
since most Instagram photos are public
and yet because Instagram said so
Twitter's not allowed to show it in line
and you have to go through this extra
link so it really makes you wonder whose
photo is it whose data is it this data
really belongs to Instagram it doesn't
belong to me
and so we have all of these fake forms
of interoperability everywhere you know
your app probably comes with some kind
of API so you can share to Facebook or
share to snapchat or whatever but can
you easily take the data that the app
creates outside of the application and
can you do things with that app data
that maybe it doesn't want you to do or
that it's API wasn't designed for you to
do that is true interoperability so I
want to dig into another data nightmare
that a lot of people have experienced so
have you guys seen shelves like these
before I don't know you know in the UK
in America everyone would be like yes so
these are medical charts and medical
charts are incredibly important they
hold all of this really important data
like you know your weight your blood
pressure what vaccines you've had your
medications what you're allergic to
your treatment this is really really
important stuff and until very very very
recently these were kept up to date by
hand so my mother is a pediatrician and
she had shelves like these in her office
and at the end of the day she would sit
down and she would do her charts so she
would update her charts by hand you know
this is really important information and
it's not backed up it's not searchable
and it's really hard to share with other
providers so you know it's 2016 now and
things are a little bit different we can
go digital
you can put health records in a database
and there's a name for this it's called
electronic medical records it's a huge
thing right now in health care the Obama
administration is even giving out
incentives for doctors to switch over to
electronic medical records but
unfortunately going digital doesn't fix
all of our problems with health records
my provider stores my electronic medical
records digitally every time I go get a
check-up you know I get this update on a
website that updates all my vitals and
my stats and medications but yet when I
go to a new doctor or a new provider
they're not on the same system and I
have to literally sit there and tell
them everything about myself you know
there's no way of porting that data over
I don't know if you guys have this
problem in the UK because you have
single-payer health care but you know
you might experience the same thing if
you move to a different country for
example so the data even though it's
electronic even though it's stored
online isn't transferable and why is
that well when people build applications
today they build them kind of like this
and this is a drastically simplified
picture usually users interact with
their data through an application so you
know the application the company is
running some code in the cloud and it's
implementing application logic that's
reading and writing to a database
usually the application and the database
sit behind this kind of giant red line
the network security parameter and the
network security parameter is really
important you know this is for security
purposes we're trying to protect the
data we're trying to keep it safe
totally fair but unfortunately this
design has a lot of drawbacks sharing
data can be really hard even within an
organization without giving others full
access to your entire system it's also
really hard to conduct to construct an
audit trail so when a problem happens
you can tell who had access to what and
like what got you into the situation
you're in right now a database
administrator with enough power can
change data without being detected but
most importantly this design discourages
different applications from working
together it makes it really hard for
applications across administrative
domains to share data so the user can do
it manually right they can interact with
each of the applications through their
web interface you know this is the
equivalent of me having to tell every
single doctor that I visit my entire
medication my entire health history or
you know they could write a web scraper
to do this which is horrible and brittle
and manual
maybe if we're really lucky the
applications have poked well-defined
holes in their security perimeter and
setup api's and so this means I mean
this is a little bit better right the
applications are supporting API is we
can we can write programs to share data
across them but what's happening here is
that there's still two different
applications with two logical copies of
the data in different schemas that were
constructed after going through
different application logic and so if
you really care about the data that's on
both sides for example in healthcare or
in the finance industry then usually the
applications have to do some kind of
manual reconciling work like settlement
between banks and to make sure things
didn't go wrong and I've seen lots of
different ways of doing this people said
well send emails to each other with
giant lists Excel spreadsheets traded
back and forth in the finance industry
they still use faxes sometimes so we
have a lot of problems with the way that
things currently work right the back
office reconciliation is slow and
terrible and requires a lot of resources
you know it's really hard to share data
and the worst part is that if you add
another provider into the mix then
usually you have to do a new integration
with everyone so it's an N squared
problem you have to fix up to logical
data stores and you know the whole
reason that we structured this thing
things this way for security to protect
our data it doesn't even work all the
time like Sony was hacked target was
hacked hacks happened all the time so
what can we do about this well I think
that part of the solution is changing
around our data model so instead of it
looking like this it looks like this
applications construct the data together
we put the data and the validation first
into the protocol and using the
abstraction of an append-only log
combined with some pretty simple
cryptography we can we can construct the
data together across different
administrate
domains and this makes it much easier to
add a third application because you just
need to kind of add them in and say
here's the data here's the protocol go
you can go implement it any way you want
but the data is right here and with this
kind of a system a user could even
control their data themselves they could
update their own data directly so what
I've just described is what we mean when
we're talking about a blockchain how
many of you guys have heard about block
chains and blockchain technology okay
great so it's it's a I think that the
whole blockchain thing is actually a lot
of really old ideas put together in a
new way with one exception and I'll get
to that exception soon and part of
what's going on here this face has a
tremendous amount of hype is that people
are really attracted to the idea of this
global database in the sky that everyone
runs together but no single person
actually owns so the word blockchain is
super amorphous and if you asked ten
different people you will probably get
ten different definitions for what it
means it's also very overhyped but I'm
gonna give you my definition of what I
think it means so here are the important
components of a blockchain and and why
people find it interesting and useful
distributed consensus public key
cryptography and common data formats and
protocols so first let's talk about
consensus so the problem of distributed
consensus is the problem of multiple
computers distributed across a network
all getting together and agreeing on a
single value now if you run a consensus
protocol many many times and agree on
many different values then you can
contain construct yourself an ordered
blog which is a very useful primitive
now if instead of storing values in that
log you store operations then you have
an operation log and you can use that to
build state machine replication and a
distributed database so this primitive
is really cool because it gives us the
tools to build a distributed database
now distributed consensus as most of you
have probably heard of it usually assume
a crash recover fault-tolerance model so
nodes can fail and as long as only a
certain number of nodes fail even if
they crash and come back up again then
we're gonna be okay our log is still
gonna be correct we're all gonna agree
on the same values and we're all gonna
have the same state on each of our nodes
now there are a lot of existing systems
that do this paxos zookeeper raft it's
incredibly useful and it's used across
many different companies now you might
not have heard of this other fault
tolerance model called Byzantine fault
tolerance so with Byzantine fault
tolerance things get a little trickier
no it's not just that nodes can fail
they can become actively evil and do
crazy things in your system now the cool
thing about this is even though you have
nodes that are actively out to get you
running in your system in your protocol
as long as there's only a certain number
of them we have protocols that can still
reach consensus and that can still
construct this primitive this log you
might have heard this formulated as the
Byzantine generals problem which is the
idea of a lot of generals who altogether
want to attack a city and if they don't
do it all together then they'll fail
they won't take the city but some of the
generals might be turncoat so they say
they're gonna attack but they're really
not going to and there are protocols
that can handle a small number of nodes
being Byzantine and we can still have
this log and just to be clear consensus
is a really old field so here's a time
line it was first talked about in the
late 70s and early 80s
I think 1982 is when Leslie Lamport and
others published his paper on the
Byzantine generals problem and now and
and you know then there was a lot of
work on on other fault tolerant
consensus algorithms and even Byzantine
fault tolerance rose to prominence for a
little while in 1999 this paper called
practical Byzantine fault tolerance was
published and then in the early 2000s
there were many many different papers
kind of improving on this protocol and
making it work better in the optimized
case and then after that things kind of
fell off for a while
Centene fault-tolerance sort of fell out
of favor mainly because no one in
industry was really using it people were
using just regular old fault-tolerant
consensus protocols instead and in 2006
Google published a chubby paper and in
2014 we have the raft paper which is
very exciting
and in 2009 something kind of sneakily
happened on the side which is that
Bitcoin the one of the first crypto
currencies was launched so Byzantine
fault torrents kind of died out for a
while but crypto currencies are actually
bringing it back which is really
interesting so we have this log right
we're running distributed consensus we
figured out how to build this log and
you know we can even tolerate both
Byzantine actors um but with
cryptography we can do even more than
that okay so the important parts of
cryptography that play a part in block
chains are asymmetric signatures and
hash functions and what what they do is
they allow us to move security to be
within the data so instead of having
this network security perimeter
surrounding your entire application
you've either encrypted the data or
you've signed it so that it can't be
modified and so this is really helpful
because we can use this for secrecy we
can use this to prove provenance and
users have a different form of identity
than they did in the old system now
they're using a public/private key pair
and this is something that's portable
across applications so ok we have a
protected encrypted signed log great but
what we really want is interoperability
and that doesn't happen if people can't
read each other's data formats so
Bitcoin came along and had a format for
the transfer of value and you can go
look like the transaction format for
Bitcoin is like very well specified and
everyone has to use the same transaction
format and I think that when we put this
agreement up front on a data format when
we're designing the validation protocol
so whether an operation in the log is
well-formed or not
then things like shared application
logic become easier to deal with and I
want to be clear this is not a trivial
thing to do this is a standard setting
there are many many bodies the IEEE
TF the w3c that try to do this and it
seems like a long drawn-out frustrating
process I do not want to be involved in
it but for certain things if we can do
this ahead of time if we can agree on a
protocol and a validation process in a
data format then that can be a really
powerful thing that people can build on
so when used across administrative
domains this combination distributed
consensus public key cryptography and
common data formats this combination is
really powerful you end up with this
totally auditable log and you can redo
validation if you want to to ensure
correctness and you can ensure that
things haven't been tampered with
so that's blockchain technology in a
nutshell this is what people are talking
about right it's cool and it's useful
and it's very interesting and it can
solve some problems in the real world
but I wouldn't exactly call it
innovative most of the things that I
mentioned in there are at least 30 years
old so in order to talk about what I
think is new what I think is really
powerful about this space let's talk
about how you might build decentralized
digital cache on top of this log okay so
we're trying to build decentralized
cache here and we all kind of have
digital cache right now you know we have
credit cards we have bank transfer but
all of that is done through an
institution you know it's its visa that
controls my credit card it's and is
deducting and adding things to my
account it's it's my bank that controls
my bank transfers so we're talking about
you know digital tokens digital money
that that isn't controlled by an
institution here and the way that we're
gonna that we're gonna represent that
are by you know unique tokens so Alice
wants to pay Bob well Alice is gonna
give Bob a unique token and that unique
token is gonna represent one coin so
there are a few potential problems with
digital token transfer okay and we're
gonna kind of talk about these problems
a little bit and understand how
cryptocurrency solve them so the first
major problem is that an attacker could
intercept the transfer and
steal the funds right it's just this
digital token another is that an
attacker could possibly if they see your
digital token spend it without your
permission and then there are two other
attacks called the replay attack and the
double spend attack which I'll go into
more detail on in a minute so we're
constructing this decentralized digital
currency and the way that we're gonna do
it is by taking our log primitive and
putting in entries that stand for
transfers so this might be an entry in
the log Alice is going to pay Bob one
coin and this is a coin that she's gonna
pay him let's ignore where the coins
come from for now assume that people
have some so a problem here is well what
if you steps in and is listening on the
network and manages to get ahold of this
coin before Bob does how are we gonna
handle this problem well Alice has a
solution to this she can use public key
cryptography so Bob has a public key and
Alice if Alice knows what it is then she
can encrypt the message in such a way
that only Bob knows how to open it so
Eve is out of luck here you know she
can't she can't actually have access to
this because it's locked for Bob okay so
asymmetric cryptography helps us with
this first problem well what if Eve you
know knows the name knows the tags of
some coins ahead of time how is she
going to you know what if she spends a
coin before Alice can well Alice also
has a public/private key pair and what
Alice can do is Alice can use her
private key and she can sign the
transaction saying I Alice and sending
this to Bob and it comes with a
signature and if everyone knows that
this belongs to Alice because they've
been looking at the log up in the past
and they saw that Alice received this
coin then you know they can wait until
they see a transaction with a valid
signature before approving it and adding
it to log and spending it okay great so
signatures help us with that other
problem and please note all bets are off
if people end up losing their private
keys so we need something else to help
with that so the replay attack so let's
say Bob is the evil
in this situation and he would like to
coins so what's to stop him from simply
creating a copy of this thing and and
and here we're really lying relying on
the fact that all the coins are unique
and we have this ordered vlog because
all the coins are unique and we have
this ordered vlog will never allow in
the same coin to be spent twice so
there's another problem alice could be
evil and Alice could try to spend the
same coin twice she by by kind of
tricking Bob and Carol Alice could say
okay I'm gonna give this coin to you Bob
here's this transaction saying I'm
giving it to you
here's another transaction Carol
spending the same coin and kind of what
I was alluding to earlier both of these
problems the replay attack and the
double spend problem are solved because
we have this primitive of this log and
because all of the actors in the system
are watching the log and making sure and
not accepting coins that are spent twice
so digital cash was attempted many times
in the past the most well-known attempt
being Chow and eek ash and in the past
it always relied on a trusted
intermediary and sometimes the amount of
trust you placed in the same
intermediary varied sometimes the bank
couldn't really see what you were doing
sometimes they could see everything
sometimes they could stop you from
spending a coin sometimes they couldn't
but and and a lot of people tried to
start companies around this idea of
digital ecash and all of these companies
failed all of these you know they all
went out of business and we didn't have
digital cash that wasn't controlled by
an institution it wasn't until Bitcoin
that this actually worked and became
something useful in practice and I would
argue bitcoin is useful in practice it's
worth about ten billion dollars right
now and people are doing a lot of
exchanges on the system it's incredibly
helpful if you want to do cross border
currency exchanges it can help you avoid
a lot of fees I know people who do this
and so why is why is this working now
well I think what the main differences
is that bitcoin is totally decentralized
there's no central point of control
there's no CEO there's there's no single
server that is running the system
and instead of requiring the users to
trust intermediaries it allows users to
verify correctness for themselves so ok
you know let me show you a little bit of
you know what this this log actually
looks like so this is the data structure
that this log that the log in most
blockchains looks like you know instead
of running distributed consensus to
agree on every single transaction we're
gonna batch them together and we're
gonna agree on a block of transactions
and here's some of the here's some of
the fields of the block and I want to
talk about this thing called the Merkel
route in a minute but what's important
here is that each block contains inside
of it a hash of the previous block in
the chain and the next block will have a
hash of this block and that kind of
serves to to link all of these blocks
together so if I wanted to go back and
change something in this white block
over here it would change the hash and
this would no longer match up and that
and and this would no longer match up
either and so you know you can't go back
in time and change things without
breaking the the hash links and so so uh
so let's talk about now how else we're
using hashes to help with transactions
so um Bitcoin and a lot of other
cryptocurrencies use this data structure
called a Merkel tree to store
transactions and you might be wondering
why like what's the point of putting the
transactions into something more
complicated than a simple list or array
well first let's talk a little bit about
how a Merkel tree works so the way that
a Merkel tree works is that you take all
the things that you want to put in the
tree and you hash them and then you hash
the hashes and then you hash the hashes
again and you keep doing this you keep
kind of hashing everything that's under
you until you get to the top and then
the top hash which note is just the size
of one hash so it's independent of the
size of your entire data set it's called
the Merkel route but because you've used
all of the data to compute this hash it
kind of in some ways represents all of
the data in your data set you can't
change
one entry without changing the hash and
what this does is allows people to ask
the question very quickly and
efficiently of is this piece of data in
my data set and users use this to tell
whether or not their transaction has
been incorporated into a block so if I'm
a user and I want to know if my
transaction si has made it into this
block I only need to ask the server for
two pieces of information the things in
yellow and with the things in yellow I I
can I can then construct my own path and
make sure that it matches the merkel
route that I have that's that's in the
block and so this is how I confirm that
my transaction is in a block without
downloading the whole block and checking
for myself but so so that's great and we
have kind of these cute ways of you know
using hashing to link all these blocks
together and to link all of these
transactions into a block but you know
how do we actually make this log in the
first place in a decentralized
cryptocurrency so currency is a pretty
valuable thing probably there are a lot
of people who would like to steal money
from you so we're probably gonna want to
at least use a BFT algorithm we can't
assume that that people in in this
protocol are honest but you know it's
not as simple as just taking an existing
Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm
because existing Byzantine fault
tolerant algorithms all require the
participants to be known ahead of time
so that means you need some one blessing
the participants or assigning IDs or
creating a list of trusted keys that are
in the inless in the community and we're
operating in at restless environment we
don't want to place trust in one person
to control admissions into the
environment but if there's no one
controlling admissions if it's just an
open system and anyone can join then an
attacker could just flood the system
with fake identities and this is what's
known as a Sybil attack and so this is a
problem with systems that require
identity you need someone assigning
identity to the nodes otherwise an
attacker could just create a million
fake nodes with different identities and
screw up your voting process
and and this is what I think was the
innovation okay this is what makes all
of this blockchain stuff different than
what happened 30 years ago in computer
science research so this guy Satoshi
Nakamoto and and we have no idea who
Satoshi Nakamoto is so he is to this day
unknown he's the one who kind of just
came on the internet and dropped the
Bitcoin code in the Bitcoin paper on
everyone and was like here's the system
I'm running it I I created the first
block I've embedded the words you know
chancellor on the brain uh on the brink
of bailing out the bank's so this was in
2008-2009 when you know the economy was
kind of in trouble he just dropped this
code and the system on people and said
and stuck around for a little while but
didn't actually stick around that long
and you know his paper kind of described
this new digital decentralized
cryptocurrency called Bitcoin and what
was very interesting about it was that
there wasn't anyone controlling access
to the system there was no central
trusted bank and there was you didn't
know didn't need to know the set of
participants ahead of time instead
participants could just come from
wherever and join the system and but
they had to do this thing called proof
of work and his new sort of form of
consensus is often called Nakamoto
consensus in the literature okay so the
way that proof of work is used to gate
access to the system is as follows so
we're gonna add a couple of things to
the block we're gonna add these new
things in yellow one of them is a
difficult level and the other is this
thing called a nonce so what's happening
here is that in order to produce a block
in this system you have to show that you
solved a puzzle and this puzzle is not
something you can pre-compute ahead of
time and it's not something that you can
just you know buy the answer to you
literally have to sit there and and spin
your cycles and expend CPU power and
expend energy energy actually turned out
to be the thing that was sort of the
most expensive about all of this
calculating the answer to this puzzle
which is basically trying to find the
preimage of a hash
and once you have found the answer to
this puzzle then you include it in a
block and that's what makes your block
valid so in order to get right access to
the system in order to participate in
the protocol and put your block up as
with transactions as a candidate you
have to spend a bunch of money and waste
a bunch of energy and CPU cycles and
this is how we get around the Sybil
attack because sure you can simple
attack the system if you want but then
you know you can't just create
identities for free you're gonna have to
go out there and figure out how to
generate all of that CPU power because
an identity in this system is really
evidence that you have expended energy
and money producing this nots which is
the answer to a puzzle and it's because
of this design and again the pieces of
this design were there before Satoshi
Nakamoto put them together there was a
form of digital cache called hash cache
but he was the one who kind of pasted
all these things together because of
this design we have this so this is a
data center probably in China which is a
rack of Asics application-specific
integrated circuit so basically the
puzzle that Satoshi chose it turns out
that you can optimize that puzzle in
hardware which people did because
Bitcoin started to become worth
something and so they wanted to be able
to solve the puzzle faster than
everybody else because that's actually
how you get new Bitcoin so there's all
this special hardware for computing the
answer to that puzzle really really fast
this hardware is completely useless for
anything else the only thing it's good
for is for generating blocks and Bitcoin
and supposedly people say the Bitcoin
network is using on the order of the
same amount of energy as Ireland so
there's a paper out there which says
that you know the energy that the entire
country of Ireland expends that's the
amount of energy that the Bitcoin
network is expending every day working
on solving this puzzle and computing the
blocks just peer review in this area is
still a little spotty so it's unclear if
this answer is totally correct but you
know people have tried to figure it out
so big question here why bother why do
people bother solving this puzzle why do
people follow the rules
you know this is a very shady industry
right bitcoin is a currency of Silk Road
it's often used for ransomware it's it's
a you know its origins were not exactly
the best and so it you know it came out
of a very mysterious community and and
you got to kind of wonder why is it even
still here you know why hasn't it been
hacked and I think part of that reason
is because Satoshi designed a really
clever game so the reason that people
follow the rules is because it's in
their best rational interest to follow
the rules they make money by following
the rules so remember those three things
before that are part of blockchains
distributed consensus public key
cryptography common data formats and
protocol well let's add one more really
interesting piece to this puzzle
mechanism design so mechanism design is
this part of game theory and in
mechanism design you have some goal or
outcome that you want to have happen and
you design a game so if if the
participants act rationally you design a
game with an incentive structure so that
the participants act rationally you end
up with your outcome so this is often
used in advertising auctions it's an
attempt to try to get people to bid
their true value for what they actually
value the auction for so this is was a
really really clever Bitcoin was a
really clever application of mechanism
design and Bitcoin security relies on
this game and it relies on assumptions
about rationality so Satoshi Nakamoto
tried to construct a game where this is
how rational participants would behave
they would try to solve the puzzle for
bitcoins and they would always build on
the long it's valid chain and the
longest valid chain would all be the one
that the other rational ones are all
building upon and you know so longest
means that the majority of the network
is behind this chain valid means that
we're following the rules of the
protocol and because of this incentive
system you can go off and try to create
your own chain your own blocks your own
ledger accounting
but you really have to ask yourself are
other people gonna follow it because if
they're not then your money's gonna be
worthless because no one's actually
operating on that chain of yours that
you made um now a big assumption
underlying the security of the system is
that bitcoins are actually worth
something why should you believe that
bitcoins are worth something
bitcoins are literally bits that that
are non-existent and are manufactured
out of nowhere by a computer program
that an anonymous person dropped on the
Internet in 2008 well that's a whole
nother talk and I think that that's
about money and economic value and why
we value the things that we do but the
point is if I had a Bitcoin today I
could exchange it for I'm not even sure
how much right now over six hundred US
dollars and I think everyone agrees US
dollars are valuable so because of this
we can apply game theory and we have
some confidence in the security of the
system and so you know but we're before
we have that BFT model of some of the
actors are malicious some of them are
very faithful and are following the
protocol now we have this other model
where everyone's a little bit mysterious
we don't even know who everyone is we
don't know who the participants in the
system are we don't know how many of
them there are we're just assuming that
they're rational and that most of them
won't collude and this seems to work in
practice and as long as this is the case
then you know all of these non-coding
actors will construct the longest chain
and even if some of the actors decide to
collude and to try to make a different
chain maybe to double spend the same
coin they're not gonna have the longest
chain and so everyone's gonna ignore
their fork and they're gonna follow the
longest chain
now bitcoin has a lot of downsides the
biggest one the one that gets talked
about the most is energy usage for
proof-of-work
and it is very high it's very
troublesome and that's why a lot of
people are looking into different types
of open admissions consensus algorithms
to try to solve this problem another
problem is performing
literally every node on the Bitcoin
network is storing an entire copy of the
blockchain and has to validate every
single transaction so this is you know
this is a very slow system concentration
of mining power so a big assumption
regarding security is that actors don't
collude but what we're actually seeing
happening here is that mining has become
a very profitable business in places
where energy is very cheap and so people
build these giant data centers and that
means a lot of hash power is under the
control of a few individuals another
major problem in Bitcoin is difficulty
of use it is very hard to use I actually
really dislike having to buy things with
Bitcoin because it's very annoying you
have to dig out your your public keys
you have to figure out you know which
wallet you want to use scan a QR code
but speaking of which I have like
thousands of dollars of Bitcoin on the
Bitcoin test net so fake Bitcoin and if
anyone wants one I'm happy to show you
how to set up a wallet and I'll give you
like a hundred dollars a fake Bitcoin
and you can try it out and then another
major problem is this uncertainty of a
new currency so the currency and the
fact that the system has economic value
is is incredibly important for
maintaining security in this open
admission system but a lot of people
want to use this to do things that don't
have anything to do with currency so you
know with with a good reason they maybe
they don't want to undermine the US
dollar or the Euro or the pound and so
how are they going to secure their
system but I think we can learn a lot
from Bitcoin and and there's a lot here
that I find really interesting so first
of all an open admissions rationality
based consensus protocol can work at
scale that is really cool we've never
seen that happening before Bitcoin
second simple transaction formats are
really useful and they enable all of
this innovation you can build all of
these different types of applications on
top of them and then third giving users
the power to audit their own
transactions is also powerful users
don't have to trust intermediaries or
third parties they can actually validate
things for themselves and note that they
don't have to validate things for
themselves if they want to trust a third
party to do that that's totally okay
but in this system they have the option
and what this means is that we get more
open systems with less trust and we end
up having more choice and more
interoperability now I alluded to the
fact that a lot of people want to use
block chains for things that have non
currency applications and and here's
just some of them and this is what
really got me interested in this area
was talking to people especially people
who work in the developing world and are
trying to do things like Bank the
unbanked or provide more financial
inclusion and they were really excited
about this technology because they
thought that it had the potential to
help them solve their very real problems
now I want to talk about just you know
one of those problems really quickly in
my last few minutes there are so many
inefficiencies in our existing financial
system and one of the worst ways that
this manifests itself is in how
expensive it is to be poor oftentimes
the poor don't have access to financial
services or when they do they get hit
with the highest fees and the highest
interest rates and quite simply our
current financial system is not serving
everyone and we see that in many
different areas there are a lot of
people who don't have access to credit
because they don't have a traditional
credit history so in the eyes of lenders
and the banks they just don't exist
rampant fraud reduces access to capital
for many small businesses in some areas
contracts are totally unenforceable and
oftentimes rural communities are without
access to basic infrastructure because
they can't get the investment they need
to build it so things are like this
because right now today everything we do
with money is mediated by the banks they
set the terms and our choices are
limited now I want to think about a
different world for money and I want to
think about that by looking at the
internet so the power of the Internet is
that it's this peer-to-peer system with
open protocols anyone can stand up a
server anyone can join the network and a
lot of really amazing applications and
protocols have evolved on top of this we
have email
video conferencing and chat and social
networking and e-commerce and mobile
platforms in the blockchain space we
want to do for value what the internet
did for information so you know the
blockchain can be used to keep track of
transactions in a secure and verifiable
way and we're starting to see and we're
at the beginning we're at the cusp of
some really interesting things
developing in this space but we're still
definitely at the beginning you know a
lot of people in in my industry are a
little bit a little bit down on Bitcoin
blockchain because they don't think that
you know we've seen world-changing
applications come out of them yet but I
think that's because if you compare this
space to the Internet where in what was
the 80s of the internet right now in the
Bitcoin blockchain space we're still
trying to get the protocols baked we're
still trying to figure things out
and you know this is gonna take a little
bit more time I know I want to point out
that a lot of large companies are
investing in blockchain technology it's
a very like I said it's a very over
hyped space but what I describe to you
and this picture right here this is not
what the banks are building block chains
can mean many different things and a lot
of the consortium in the space are just
rebuilding the existing financial
infrastructure under some new buzzwords
and I think they're missing the point
because the power of what's happening
here is that it's open all right thank
you very much here's the website for my
group at MIT and also a talk I did on
the future of money which kind of helps
hopefully describe a little bit about
why things like Bitcoin are worth
anything and thank you for listening
okay we have time for a couple questions
I just want to ask about that and so do
you think Bitcoin will take over real
money or perceived real money as we see
it today or something else I also think
that it's possible central banks will
issue digital currency directly so you
know the central banks are kind of
dancing around this a little bit you
know they're sort of the the way that
money's issued in the world today is
that you know central banks change the
interest rates and commercial banks sort
of hold central bank money what if
people could just hold central bank
money themselves like why not right and
central banks you know you could issue
the dollar a digital dollar a digital
family's digital euro and I think if
they do that in the right way then there
might not be as much of a need for
crypto currencies I don't know how
likely it is that they'll do that in the
right way those are still a lot to learn
you've started from saying about
potential of using blockchain for
storing personal information like
medical records other stuff but you've
also mentioned that blockchain has
inherent problems with big energy
consumption and overhead because you
need to transfer the whole blockchain
they think that or do you know may have
many about some solutions which could
overcome those problems too for
applications like medical records so so
the first set of blockchain stuff I
talked about that did not use any energy
consumption that was just running I mean
any more than any computer program would
use so you only really incur the energy
consumption costs when you're using
through the work and you only need proof
of work if you're operating in a system
where you don't know who you are running
the protocol with so I think for things
like medical records you probably get a
consortium of hospitals together and
they would run you know a distributed
consensus protocol hopefully and you
know you would not need proof of work
because you'd have identity now when it
comes to the problem of everything being
public I think we're making it really
exciting strides of that so last week
the first anonymous cryptocurrency was
released easy cash and they use a
primitive called zero knowledge proof
which are very exciting and so basically
you can validate that you know your
coins exist and they haven't been double
spent without having any idea about you
know any third party having any idea
about the amounts or who the transaction
is between so I think that there's gonna
be a lot of really exciting stuff as we
apply sort of these areas of
cryptography to watch chains okay we're
out of time so let's thank the speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
