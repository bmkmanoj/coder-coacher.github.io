and they say all your complete idiot and
that will never work and and most of
these ideas are not very good so the
first phase of filtering these ideas is
I sort of post them to the net and I
talked people and then packet tells me
I'm a fool and and we have a bit of an
argument and so on and and this process
helps remove the most stupid ideas but
then I still sort of do it a bit and
some of them end up being don't you
you've always say that's a stupid idea
so here's here's some really stupid
ideas which clock is gonna so where does
it start
actually it started I thought I would
write a PHP killer you know cuz PA
because PHP was some liked and I thought
difficult user like so so I thought well
I just make the simplest thing possible
for a web thing and I started working
with something called ehe then then a
why I called he actually the name just
came to me and I thought I'll make ehe
so here's my first ehe program hi and
this stuff that's got a little question
mark that's a lagging and that's
actually XML because that it's a
processing instruction in XML thing
parse it with XML parser and what's
inside there is just Erlang and that
just evaluates to something the final
thing it evaluates to it's supposed to
be an i/o list and it just sort of basis
it into the document so when it
evaluates the first thing it just puts
an empty string into the document and
then later on I just use it so what you
can put in there is anything you can put
into the airline shell so of course I
wanted to see how you'd do this in PHP
so that I started PHP and wrote my first
and only PHP program I tweeted about
this I have my PHP moment when I when I
wrote factorial because I wrote
factorial of course I got it wrong the
first time and it crashed
and just it said get a web page back and
I didn't know why it took me like an
hour of googling to find out that some
magic file hidden deeply in the system
had to have a sort of turn on all the
debugging stuff and then it gave her
Evan was sort of syntax error somewhere
and so it wasn't I couldn't understand
how people like could ever get started
with PHP because there were no error
messages at all so I thought well how
come they complain about Erlang right so
I wrote factorial here and then I ran
factorial and it was when I ran
factorial that I had my PHP moment so
this is what happens when you run
factorial it's pretty good isn't it you
know it's up 2 factorial 14 it's great
okay but what happened factorial you
know I thought if you multiply two
integers together you get an integer but
apparently you don't in PHP you get you
you get a floating-point number which
gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
that's okay until you get to 171 and and
then you get info I don't know what in
fees
I think it's infinity actually but in
that case it's probably wrong because
the infinities awfully big
if bigger than in factor 171 it's a lot
bigger than factor 100 everyone so I
thought well let's do this in our Liang
and see if we can get it right so the
first program I wrote was factorial FAC
is a firm in the phone of because our
line can't refer to itself you have to
introduce an additional parameter that's
this F which you pass into the function
and you do it again this is a standard
trick that functional programmers know
about and I thought PHP programmers
might find that trick a little bit
complicated so I thought let's let's
rewrite it to make it easier for a PHP
programmer to understand because this is
mass marketing stuff and it's got to be
easy to understand so I rewrote it like
this well first of all this is how it
works I mean you sorry that's fairly
programmers but let's you know it sucks
because first of all you define an
additional function then you define a
sort of interface to it they need two
functions to do it and now think about
this is you can generalize it because
the additional function you need is
always the same so if you do that you
define a function called Y and that's
the additional function that's always
the same and then you plug in the stuff
you want to do into this additional
function and then it becomes very easy
to write but you being functional
programmers some of you will know that
this this Y thing is it's the Y
Combinator right and so suddenly I'm
thinking this is taking me down a path I
don't want to go because if PHP
programmers have got to learn the Y
Combinator they might just not like it
then we have any PHP programmers here I
did talk to would you like to program
with the Y Combinator no no right good
because I didn't actually know any PHP
programmers so I thought this would be a
good idea so so I thought there has to
be a better way sorted well okay so
instead of using the shell as it is I
thought well let's change early valves
that I can define functions in early
Vout sites the first thing I did I just
put a death in So Def FAC it's a
function of something and now on the
right hand side I can return I can I can
refer to FAC
because it's defined and this is the
sort of let construction that you'll see
in a you know the the lambda calculus if
your lambda calculus oh you have to
introduce a sort of late rec in there
defining mechanism but that's not quite
right that's a hack adding a def into it
because it's it's treating the symptom
rather than the problems I thought well
what's the problem there's a deeper
problem what is the deeper problem okay
so wait a moment there's something funny
going on here if you look at modules
modules are sequences of forms okay so
this is a module and it's a sequence of
forms and you can't put expressions into
modules if I say X is 42 can't do that
I'm very strange why can't you say X is
42 in a module I don't know and then
you've got the shell and the shell war
you can say X is 42 and you can type
expressions in but in the shell putting
forms is illegal goodness gracious what
a moron designed this I mean it's
completely why can't you put X and I
thought why can't you put expressions in
modules and why can't you put forms in
the shell we'd have to change something
oh dear I can't change anything God has
said that it should be like this and it
should never be changed right so so
what's wrong as a shell look at what the
shell could be like this is just this is
not how the shell is but it let's
pretend it was like this you could say X
is 10 sure it's 10
let's introduce two new things quote and
devour so if you said why is quote of X
plus 12 but you can't do in the shell it
might say well far why is an expression
of not plus words it just returns the
power
tree of X and then you might say well if
our weii and it would say 12 okay now
what language of my inventing yes thank
you very much yes so so so what's wrong
with the shell and what's wrong with our
line is it's not Lisp so why don't we
make it a bit more lispy okay so yeah
well I said that again that's the same
thing so let's make it a bit more lispy
and just define well I'll define
defining forms to be things with side
effects that return parse trees which
just changed the environment and so
these would all be perfectly legal as
inputs to the shell and then I thought
well let's do that and I thought oh god
that breaks absolutely everything I'll
never be able to persuade people to do
that and so then I thought oh I know
what I'll do I'll make a new language we
call the Erlang - and then I'll be able
to write this in Erlang - and I'll write
a thing that turns our link to into
Elling one and then all the tools will
work and so on
that way there'll be some disadvantages
because errors in Erlang - will be
turned into errors in airline one and
you won't understand them so I said well
let's throw throw some I had a load of
ideas that sort of sitting in the back
of my head said let's throw them all
into a link to and see what happens and
stir the pot a bit okay so and then I
thought whoa you can go further than I
try yelling through the generator like -
and then you draw a line for the
generator selling through that's called
meta programming in that that's actually
very powerful and meta programming
nailing is not very easy because of the
way the parse trees are and the past
forms are so well I said that let's see
so then I just took a lot of ideas which
I like and then I reduced them to their
simplest form and put them in you know
lengths - so I put in partial evaluation
literate program unit testing program
refactoring Lisp and get all sort of in
different ways but all in their simplest
forms so for example this unit testing
but unit testing is just
this simple pattern matching I can say
120th factor of five that's the only
form of unit testing but it's
sufficiently powerful and so the goals
of all this were to get rid of the bad
stuff you know the macros and the
records and the stuff we all hate and
and and and add the good stuff and don't
break the old stuff while you're adding
the good stuff and have a bit of fun
while you're doing it so I wrote l2
which you couldn't get from github and I
don't if you want to actually I could
run the actual examples and prove that
it works but I mean it's a bit of a
waste of time because it's kind of
obvious how it works so here's the first
sort of demo program and this says well
this is a factorial thing and it says it
defines factorial and it's got a unit
test and then it computes the value of
factorial xx and then it does this okay
so when you run it through l2 there's a
new declaration there it says local it
says local fac-1 that says that
factorial in that module is local so
it's not going to be exported to
pectorals earth to and Elling to program
and just run that and of course because
you can now evaluate things in the shell
you evaluate this the unit test passes
you compute the factorial xx and then
you paste the value into here so the
code that's generated is this right so
now you've got compile time macro
evaluation with a macro so just a lung
functions it does create a new
dependency but I can live with that and
this is I think much more powerful than
macros it's actually quite useful so
that's sort of it's not exactly partial
evaluation but it is a way of optimizing
your programs and it's actually very
simple to implement it was only a few
hundred 50 lines of code I think to the
early valve did that here sorry I think
actually the example that I really liked
because here I let's suppose I'd done
the same thing and I've got a function
like factor and I've got a unit test
that's a unit you know fact or 4 is 24
but the definition of factorial was
incorrect so I said n plus factorial
naught times that of course is a type
correct function so a type checker
wouldn't help you in the slightest even
its type correct no problems with that
the unit tests will however fail because
the program is incorrect and so what
happens when you try and compile it and
try and produce an airline to program is
that process will fail and it will not
produce an airline to program so the
fact that your program has compiled
means that it must have passed the tests
so you're not going to get a beam file
or something that you then have to test
later and you can defer all the testing
to compile time and not testing time
which is later you can defer all of them
but you can do a heck of a lot of things
at compile time and if all the tests
pass you generate code you don't
generate the code if the tests fail and
I thought that was it I was very pleased
with that actually and then I thought I
discussed on the airing list about I
don't like modules sort of love-hate
relationship with more difficult the
problem with modules this is a
classification problem when you have
written a function you don't know what
module to put it in okay so modules are
used for two or three different things
which are orthogonal one of the things
modules are used for his code
replacement because you can replace a
whole module
another thing modules are used for is
abstraction so you can hide the details
of something in a module another thing
it's used for is a shipping mechanism so
you can ship it to people and and in
fact it confuses all these three roles
and I think it would be very helpful to
split the roles and one of the roles of
a module is abstraction and one of the
things that's bad about Erlang is
there's no let Ric so let wreck is you
want to define one function and it uses
some auxiliary functions and you have to
invent names for this for the auxiliary
functions if you didn't have modules you
could probably put a large number of you
could put large numbers of functions
into the same module it's much easier to
do that I put all
I have something called Lib misc
actually called Jaya I put all whenever
I can't think of which module should I
put this function in I put it in je le
misc and jail it misc has got about 450
functions in or something an awful lot
you know and I really like everything in
there because otherwise I can't remember
which module I put it in I've got
thousands and thousands of modules I
can't find them right so but that gets
difficult to manage if I have to invent
the names of auxiliary functions so you
want to say let rec this and this
function and then have some locals so
that's what this construction does it
says begin function f1 if you look at f1
f1 calls foo and there's a foo inside
this scope so it so it means the local
functions so the foo is not exported and
f2 also uses a foo and that just is
transformed to that so so once you put
it through a compiler thingy
it says f1 it's just gen-5 through
that's the local name and f2 is Gen 14
foo that that's the five of the forties
that are actually the line number where
the things defined that's really rather
easy then if you want to define several
things you might want to defy those I've
got a local foo here because it's it's
local but ported things but I want to
call the foo in the outer scope so I've
got a an extra keyword this this colon
foo and that resolves to the outer scope
so I thought it's very important that a
compile time you can completely resolve
a function name so you know exactly
where he is is it in this module or is
it somewhere else and didn't go around
with that so I added I added let Rex
then think sterling too and the next
thing I put in was modules change with
time and there's no sense of time in
program development look at something
like it the way you deal with time is
that you you have a sort of md5 sha-1
checksum of the thing in its date
stamped and you can refer to that but
that's conveys no semantic information
very very horrible thing you know it's
dreadful so if you look at a module his
lists for I mean this isn't the real
list but you could imagine that it was
first created on a certain date and that
on other dates it was changed and so you
could say well you always start with an
empty module and you put things into it
so at a certain date you might say well
I've got an empty module and let's stick
some stuff in it and later on we might
add some functions and then we might
remove some functions and this is a time
sequence so you could view a module as a
key value database where the key is the
name of the function in dexterity and
the value is a function and then it's
just a time list of when you do the
insertions and deletions and you could
you could imagine systems evolving as
being timelines where things evolve so
so what you see on the top line that's
the evolution the evolution of lists and
at a certain stage in time you you you
file starts and it evolves and and then
you want to write your own codes what
you do you cut and paste modules from
lists and file just get a text editor
and gang stuff out and you make a new
module and it evolves in time so I
thought well let's describe this I won't
describe the deltas so it looks like
that wait a moment you have to look back
to that here we are again
so the deltas are you have to add a
little bit more information so let's
imagine the first ever version of this
is the one at the top where I define
reverse and so on and I say well I did
that on that date I did that in you know
1986 8612
and I just reverse into this module and
then later on i said ii blue thing I
said well okay this is derived from and
I give the date of the earlier version
and then I put the stuff you want in and
and and and so I can describe exactly
how I've changed I've added stuff and
I've removed stuff and this adds what I
call intentionality to a system this is
what Donald Knuth said from the big
when he wrote tech he wrote one massive
great big file and then you wrote patch
files that the patched the original file
introduced a new file and then as he did
more he added them but you see the patch
file is a form of refactoring where you
have described the intentionality of
what's going on this is what's right
about the way Clint did it and what's
wrong about the way that all religion
control systems do it you see revision
control systems they they stole blobs so
you you have how the file was on that
date and how the file was on that date
and there's a binary difference between
them and if you don't add any comments
to the commit log you don't know why
you've changed it and you also don't
know if people don't in detail document
what they're doing when they change
something okay so you just don't know
what's going on but because they lack
intentionality so this is refactoring
this is programming refactoring but it's
a very simple refactoring it's not all
the refactoring operations you need it's
only got add delete and delete and
remove that so delete is remove yes it's
only got add and delete that's only got
add and delete so it's actually quite
simple you just keep track of that given
that you can actually synthesize the
final code by taking this Delta list you
could merge all the module names you do
anything you feel like it just by
transforming it at the end of the day so
I did a little thing I'm sorry you need
clone at delete and clone clone just
takes an entire copy and renames it so
that you can start removing things and
so and then if you have naming
collisions if you built everything in
this way you have name collisions you
could resolve all the name collisions at
compile time and just build a single
module it would be quite simple right
the bigger picture code is part of a
bigger picture and when we write code we
forget the bigger picture so I'm just
another idea which is not in l2 but is
will be in something fairly soon I hope
is part of the bigger picture and the
inspiration for this actually came from
the website for the real world haskell
book so here's a little clip from
world Haskel and it's very nice this is
beautiful website is graphically nice
it's beautiful and it describes a
beautiful language and if you look at
here this bit of code taken from some
thumb in the middle but you notice is
linked here there's 27 comments right so
if we click on the link okay sorry I've
linked on the top oops there I didn't
click on the twenty-seventh I clicked on
the two comments on that paragraph if
two comments on that paragraph now
there's a comments provided by the users
they're not done by the author of the
thing and they live together with this
document so here we've got code there
we've got the code and we've got the
comments and they're attached at a code
and they will live with that code
forever
okay you can't we rip the two apart okay
so I observe when I'm programming I've
often spend a lot of time googling for
how to do things I've been writing some
JavaScript and it's impossible you know
I see something cool on the net and I do
view source and I start reading and it
called something and I google it and and
finally after you know sometimes it can
take hours of googling I find a tiny
little programming example and then I
can write my program my program is maybe
10 15 lines of JavaScript it's got some
funny API that I didn't understand and
that's what I call research to do your
research and then you write your program
once if the research takes three hours
writing the program takes two minutes
it's a final version you publish the
program and you throw away the research
isn't that smart so that somebody later
cannot figure out how you did it because
all they see is the end result but they
don't see how you got to the end results
okay so this is a brilliant way of
keeping the documentation together with
the code but you have to do it through
an interface which allows your entire
community who's using that code to
access that right so what I'm doing and
the first release I
promised a date but true position of
having the best documentation system in
the world perhaps I don't know it's very
nice it's nice because I will rephrase
that it's an exaggeration it's the best
documentation system inside Ericsson and
I don't know how the ones outside
Ericsson work but but the nice thing
about the online documentation is
everything is done in XML neck's ml is
absolutely brilliant for marking up the
text because that's what it's derived
from sgml st ml with the text markup
language and it's no hassle to put in
bold and you know emphasis tags and it's
semantic tagging it's not okay paragraph
is perhaps not semantic tagging between
tags in SIA there's a function and this
is err or what not and it's absolutely
brilliant
forget markup and markdown and drop dead
and all these things they're rubbish all
of them and the reason they're rubbish
is they solve
well they solved the 95 percent problem
if you want a document you're gonna
write a quick and dirty document that's
got 95 percent of beautiful formatting
you can use markup or markdown or markup
or you know all these things I don't
think any of them get quotes right
English quotes English quotes are pretty
called 6699 quotes I have downloaded
every single open-source JavaScript
editor on the planet and not a single
one of them gets quotes right despite
the fact these are used by millions of
people and despite the fact there are
thousands and hundreds of thousands of
programs not one of them has managed to
write an editor that get English quotes
right now that is a thing that annoys
every single English reader of text on
the entire planet okay so if you want to
get it right how do you get it right in
a markup language you can't you got a
hack the markup language but in XML you
just define an entity you say and L
double quote semicolon and out comes a
left double quote or if you want your
operative you've got them Gwilym on now
what do you call these lovely beautiful
French things what are they called
give me you know the French wants a
little beautiful little things that
absolutely beautiful now you could do an
XML but you couldn't do it in one of
these markup languages okay so all the
ailing documentation is written in XML
and when you want the books and the
papers and the webpages you type the
word make and it all sort of migrates to
the web servers and does everything in
out it comes and PDF comes out and all
sorts of things so what I'm doing to
that is fixing it so that we name every
paragraph in the entire documentation
now there's a principle of philosophy
and that says if something's got a name
you can talk about it if it hasn't got a
name you can't talk about it
so documents are full of paragraphs but
the paragraphs don't have names so we
can't talk about them we can talk about
the document as a whole but we cannot
talk about the individual paragraph okay
so I have written a little program but
tags every paragraph in all the Elling
documentation with a globally unique
identifier and that points to an entry
in a database and so it's just a matter
of transforming your XML and wherever
you see a paragraph you stick a little
tag on the end which is a globally
unique identifier and writing a bit of
web server e stuff so that when the user
clicks on that you put an entry in the
database right and the nice thing about
that is what you can do with that data
because the sort of things you can
easily do are the author of that
document can automatically be informed
when anybody makes a comment about a
paragraph also the users themselves can
hold a dialogue that's based on the
content of that paragraph so you can
think of a paragraph as a forum about
which there is a debate okay so I call
this doc you forums it's it's a forum
but the topics are chosen by the author
every paragraph is a topic of discussion
and a debate can follow and of course it
doesn't have to be
author who replies because somebody else
reading that can reply somebody else
could subscribe to that paragraph and be
told when it's changed or when
somebody's commented about it so I'm
going to do that first of all for all
the ailing documentation but wait a
moment hang on aren't clauses in a
function paragraphs that we might like
to comment on yes I think they are so so
I think I'd like to actually put all the
code into a system like that and I
really want to lock together the
research and the results of that
research ie the code so if you're a
writer this is a Mac protocol Scrivener
Scriven is very nice because you can
drag and drop PDF files and sound files
and spreadsheets and God knows what and
webpages into a sort of virtual folder
that's tagged at some point in the text
and you just open and close this and
it's important to that search to take a
copy not a reference because if it's a
reference to something on the web that
reference might not be available when
you access it later so I really want to
tie together the research that you do
and the code that you write so that
years later you can back through that
process and see well how did I solve
this problem how did the guy because
that's the question I asked I mean I was
airing in the browser
frederik here West Frederick he's not
here but I was reading his code and my
goodness he had converted a
floating-point number to an ID got a
sort of I Triple E floating point number
or something in the ailing binary format
or something rather to a JavaScript
floating-point number no JavaScript
actually is untyped so JavaScript has
type number and internally it uses bit
patterns to distinguish between integers
and floats but in fact they're all
doubles and some of these doubles or
floats numbers are integers and how the
heck JavaScript knows what a floats and
what her doubles I don't know I haven't
clue I tried to work it out myself by
I'm not clever enough you know I
couldn't like Google for hours I
couldn't find out it and I read
Frederick's Code and it was like three
lines of BB
left hand or excellent and I thought wow
and I cut and paste it into my program
and it worked and the problem you see I
thought how the heck did he write that
program I hadn't a clue you know so here
we're all programmers we write code we
spent hours doing research we write ten
lines of code we throw away all the
research and we finish our project we
hand it over to the next programmer who
has to maintain it they read the code
and they can't find the research and
they go back to square one trying to
figure out how the program was written
so that's part of what I call the bigger
picture so I think if I had yeah I would
like some development environment that
helps me program now these things like
eclipse and get and things they don't
help me program they just make you more
difficult I mean Eclipse goodness
gracious it is so I've been writing one
or two programs to do this and and
they're not really a link to their what
I call the programmers workbench and one
of them will be I'm writing a second
chapter miling book and one of them will
be in there and it's great fun I'm not
prepared to release it yes until it's
figured out but it's a search engine
thing now what I've done is the
following when you search in Google you
have to choose keywords right so you you
you choose keywords in the new search
you get something back and you find
something or maybe you don't find
something because you've chosen the
wrong keywords so quite often I search
for things at work and I think I won't
remember where it was because when I get
home I can search again and I find the
same thing so I just got to remember the
keywords and I go home and I search and
I use the same keywords I can't find it
then and then I think maybe I didn't use
the same key with maybe I change the
keywords I can't find it again so when
you make a query the results of that
query depend upon the keywords but I
don't know how to choose the keywords
right so I thought there's an awful lot
of valuable information in the yelling
mailing lists so I found I read a little
program that
all is it there Piper mail format a zip
files downloaded all of them unpacked
them all past them all and split them
into it and put them in a database and
there's something called the keyword in
index or something over there LF
something star library index waiting
algorithm and that says you have a
corpus you take all words and you work
out the frequency distribution and you
look at the frequency distribution in
the individual document and you compare
the two so if if a particular word is
use one percent in the corpus but occurs
ten percent in this particular document
then for that document it's a
significant word but it's not a
significant word for all the other
documents and for every word in an
individual document you can assign a
weight to how significant it is you know
something called the cosine similarity
index where if you compare two documents
you take each word that occurs in both
documents and someone's square all the
this number you get the weight of the
word multiply them all together and
divide by the number of words and that's
just that's a similarity index between
two documents this gives you very nice
way of searching
that's very computationally intensive
you couldn't do it in Google because it
just takes a heck of a lot of computer
file you have to compare it you have to
compute the vectors for every single
document store them and then compare
them but you can do it locally on your
machine because then it's that it's
tractable so I've written a program that
downloads all the early mailing lists
and it's a little search engine in in
the web browser you type a few keywords
and it will rank all it will rank all
posts in order of what it thinks is the
most interesting post and then you can
click on them and then because they use
status to search term for the next word
so then it uses the entire document or
sorry the entire posting it uses every
single word in that is used as your
keywords which are used to search for
the next one and I wrote this program
and the first time I ran it I was
interested in full text indexing
anything it found a full text indexing
program that I wrote four years ago that
I had forgotten about that was the top
of the list
and I thought if we could put all our
programs into this as text and then I'm
using it on code as well so I can say
what I'm writing code I say what of all
the modules I've got 55,000 modules on
my disk which is the one that's most
similar to it and it just thinks for a
bit missus that one you go and look at
it and if I that's fun so these are some
ideas that I've got this sorry
ten minutes yes one is some changes to
the shell and things like that that
might be a loan to one day we might put
it into Elling one I have to sort of I
can't just do it myself these days I
have to convince lots of people and and
they say you've got to check the
dialogue and they like I said with
stupid ideas and then these kind of
they're not really in the language but
there are things around the language
that would help you sir because I want
to build tools actually not to help you
people just help myself cuz I can't you
know I can't find my code I've got lots
of files all over the place on lots of
machines and it's very difficult to find
it it's very difficult to find a file
that I you know I remember oh why did
that 16 years ago
mm maybe and it may be on that machine
and difficult finding it full-text
indexing is kind of okay but it's not
very intelligent that's what I've been
doing and I hope some of this certainly
the the commenting system is currently
oh it's actually number one on my
priority list at the moment so so it's
getting done and yeah and I've finished
ten minutes early I think any any yet
now you tell me it's all rubbish
no no no you could use it for anything
yeah
so I think this collaborative common you
see I don't believe ok the wiki is one
model of interaction right so that's see
large number of people have similar
rights on a document I don't like that
model well no I do like that model like
that not look very good for certain
things
the other model I like is one author a
lot of commenters that model I like
writing stuff and then lots of people
commented but I like deciding which
comments I accept because I don't like I
like you know when I read books and
newspaper articles I like articles that
express an opinion a point of view which
gives me the freedom to either agree
with it or disagree with it i don't like
sort of i don't imagine things you know
i like okay so this guy has written that
these people have commented he's decided
to include that and that not that and
that their decision is final and it's a
great help to improve quality when my
ailing book came out the first form it
came out as part of the pragmatic
presses bt publishing process i didn't
know anything about this it was
published when i was 70% ready they
published it seventy percent for certain
books and it went out as a PDF people
prepaid for the PDF and then there's a
commenting system on their website
pretty much like this though not like
this actually in syria
you can't just click on it there's a
form you fill in and the next day I woke
up and went looked at it and there were
every single page at a comment on it
something they were
850 comments in one day and you know
when I'd written stuff before it handed
it out to people and you get like two or
three comments and it takes a long time
to get here were the many eyes were
staring at it I didn't know if I'd known
I'd have taken a two-week holiday and
done it but I didn't terrible but they
improved the quality a heck of a lot for
this model of one person you know the
author of code look at look at how we do
open source software you look at any
open source software one guy will have
done but not any but a lot of projects I
think one guy's done ninety-eight
percent of all the work and then two
people have done the remaining two
percent and then there's a long tail but
that long tail is very valuable to the
people the most valuable contribution
the long tail can make it's not fixing
the stuff but pointing out that it needs
to be fixed so if we can make a nice
commenting system you know provided you
know there's an error you can fix it so
you the barrier for entry for pointing
this out must be low so the barrier and
the Wikipedia is great because the
barrier for entry is very low you can go
in and you can make a spelling
correction okay so we want the same in
revision control systems the barrier for
entry for commenting and changing must
be very low so you don't want git pull
master main modules send me a patch then
that's the barrier for entry is far too
high what you want is just up in a
browser immediately click on it's got a
comment look fuck's so we need to reduce
the barrier for entry for for commenting
on say on things so that's about what I
had to say oh sorry that's a long answer
to your question or comment so anymore
yeah well oh and and the the l2 I was
very excited so and I did this nice I'll
put it on the thing and I thought how
about three people sort of looked at it
I think and kind of surprised me cuz but
please you know take it and play with it
and rip it to bits now add features to
it and things and then some of the good
features we might we might try and stick
in two or one despite the fact it's
called l2 and
okay anymore yes yeah it will be very
nice actually yes it would I mean
Roberts written a prologue interpreter
that you can call and I would I would
like to yeah I mean yeah it would be
very nice because they are telling
really would start off with like little
prologue things talking to each other
and then it became fun we lost the
little prologue things talking to each
other and it sort of got forgotten about
somehow it's like throughout the baby
with the bathwater and we lost that
which is great shame yeah as they should
be at God who didn't read a book on
logic you know there's meta variables in
big letters in facts are in small
letters and of course logic is I mean a
fair point yeah Aristotle invented type
systems so so all all men are mortal and
therefore Sophocles is mortal is exactly
the same as saying well there's a
function from integers to floats so if
we can prove that the arguments is an
integer then the return value will be a
float and that's actually modus ponens
which goes back to Aristotle and it's
very nice because once you start
reasoning about programs usually using
rules of logic you've got hundreds of
years of mathematics that you can apply
to it and prove procedures and things so
it's very nice and be very nice to get
back to you see I used to be a physicist
physicists and mathematicians work with
equations and programmers write
algorithms and equations are declarative
and you physicists they write down
equations which is a declarative fact
and then they figure out how to solve
them and that's what logic programmers
in constraint logic program is do they
write down relationships and then they
throw them at a solver and that way of
programming is fundamentally better but
then how we program we program with
algorithms which is it's not a good way
of doing things so yes you know I'd love
that to come back and now I'm not
actually working on it to the moment cuz
I'm doing this and and but don't tempt
me because I'm and where's Robert
incanting improved the garbage
collection in his prologue oh you've
seen the film about convincing Kennett
