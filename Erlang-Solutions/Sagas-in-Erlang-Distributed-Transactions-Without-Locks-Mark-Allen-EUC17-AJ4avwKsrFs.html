with you today I work at alert logic
it's based in Houston Texas a lot of our
back-end systems are written in Erlang
and that's how I came to be involved at
the Erlang community originally anyway I
want to talk today about sagas and also
futures which is something that is
pretty well known in contexts that are
not Erlang and so I want to explore that
concept a little bit in the context of a
saga in Erlang and the final thing I
want to talk about today is property
based testing one of the things that's
really great about the early community
is I think that there's an emphasis on
correctness and that is a wonderful
thing and one of the primary ways that
we can build confidence that our
solution is implement correctly is by
using property based testing and so I
want to just briefly touch on some of
the property based tests that I've
written for this particular library so
let's get started the first thing I want
to talk about is sagas sagas are a
viking tradition i'm in sweden i thought
this is a good way to open so let us
discuss things in the way of vikings
there's a paper this paper was written
by a computer scientist named Hector
Garcia Molina
he wrote this paper in 1987 and
published it at Princeton he's now at
Stanford and is still working on all
sorts of interesting research problems
and areas this paper describes four
different ways for different types of
sagas and the the library that I have
implemented in Erlang really deals with
the first one the backward recovery
model but there are three others and I'm
going to just briefly tell you about
them because I think they're really
interesting and I think there's room for
multiple ways to solve this and one of
the goals I had in doing this talk was
really to promote this idea of using
sagas in your production systems so
first of all what is a saga we should
really describe that it's really a way
to provide a transactional semantics in
the context
of things that are not necessarily
databases but they call on resources
that are sort of out in your environment
and may have failures but do you want a
transactional semantics so you either
want all of those things to succeed or
you want to unwind all of the things in
your state back to the original point
right you don't want to have partial
failure so some use cases that sagas are
really useful for are things like
staining up cloud infrastructure so if
you want to create 50 compute nodes in
cloud infrastructure and you know you
might have partial failure on some of
those things you don't want to have to
have a human or an Operations person or
yourself get paged at 3:00 in the
morning to get up and unwind all those
things by hand you want some sort of
automatic recovery mechanism or
compensating mechanism and those are the
sort of things that sagas can provide
for you so let's talk about the
different types the backward type is
what I just described so it provides
that transactional semantics where you
either move from state point a to state
point B and it's completely successful
or you unwind all the way back to state
point a and that does not necessarily
mean that all of the things that
happened in between during when you were
processing that are no longer visible or
didn't happen but the semantics of it is
that it's unwound right if you've taken
compensating steps to get back to that
original state so that's one type of
Sakha the next type of saga is called
forward recovery and what this does is
an idea that says before we execute each
step in our in our transaction we're
going to take a checkpoint we're going
to save the state somewhere persistent
and later on if that step fails then we
can use that save state to recover and
try again
right and eventually you're going to
either succeed or you're going to fail
and so that's kind of the idea for
recovery so the idea here is that you
don't sort of unwind all the way back to
the beginning but that you checkpoint at
each step and if you have a failure then
you can use that safe state to
again the next thing is a recovery block
which i think is a really interesting
concept a recovery block is the idea
that you know there's multiple ways to
do things so in the Perl community
there's this idea called Pinto D there's
more than one way to do it and recovery
blocks is kind of a formalization of
that concept where if you fail doing it
a certain way then you can try again
giving it a different way so for example
if you failed calling a micro service
with an endpoint that was in region A
for example and it fails then maybe you
try with region B right you try some
other region say micro service same
state mutation in some back-end system
but it's in a different region so you
would you know it's available whereas in
region a it was not available for some
reason right meteor strike kaiju you
know something like that who knows so
that's the idea of a recovery block I
think that's a really interesting
concept and I'm going to dig into that a
little bit more later on in this talk so
the last one here is a parallel saga and
this is the most interesting concept to
me I think in the concept of in the
context of Erlang especially with
futures and I'm going to talk more about
futures later on probably in about 20
minutes I think and the futures idea is
that you know you're making a promise
right you're sort of assigning a token
to a value which you hope will
eventually exist and in the context of
parallel sagas at least within this
paper that I decided originally the idea
was is that you wanted to have multiple
parallel tracks of transactions
executing but those things were not they
were all independently right they're all
independent from one another they didn't
entangle and all the things that
entangled were in a single saga so for
example the way I'd like to think about
this is like you have a saga of sagas
right so you have like this top-level
container and then you have a whole
bunch of executions that are going on
that are independent from one another
and they're all executing concurrently
and independently
a synchronously from one another so
those are the four different types of
sagas that are described in the paper
now I want to talk about my library
which is saga as an Erlang so really the
big idea here is not as new one how many
of you have used fold L oh yeah just
about everyone alright well so this is
the idea that we're going to use fold L
but we're going to use fold L sort of in
the context of distributed transactions
so the big idea is that we're going to
fold over a list of closures and we're
going to maintain some state that we
pass between each one of those closures
unless there's an error and if there's
an error then what we're going to do is
fold over a list of closures and we're
going to unwind all the steps that we
took previously okay so let me show you
kind of what this looks like graphically
so here's a here's a saga that I've kind
of represented and you can see that I
have two tracks of blocks the top the
top row kind of represents forward
progress and the bottom row kind of
represents rollback progress right so
compensating actions if the forward box
fails then that lower box is the one
that's going to compensate for whatever
the top box did does that make sense
and then I have this arrow between
forward one and four to the kind of
represents state right so this is our
fold and that arrow represents the state
that we're transferring between each
closure and we're just going to roll
through this and we're done we're super
happy right
big blue happy face everyone is smiling
yay
closures we like them they're awesome
all right so oh I turn you didn't see
the big blue smiley faces only on my
my-my-my preview screen here but anyway
so so that was a happy path right that's
that's that's the normal case that's the
case when when everything happens
exactly as we expect it to happen and
that does provide the semantics I talked
about originally which is you start at
state a and you end up in state B and
there's no partial failures and you
don't need to compensate for anything
you just complete you just continue to
proceed state to state to state to state
right so you just accumulate all those
mutations and when you're all done you
reports all the mutations back to the
caller and you say hey I was successful
and here's your final state and here's
all the transaction or
right here's all the execution
information from each one so let's take
a look at a failure case right so what
does that look like graphically it looks
like this okay same same setup top rows
forward progress bottom rows is roll
back progress if you can think of it
like progress I guess
and again the arrow represents state and
so we transition and look we had a
failure boom
something happened in closure number
three something incomplete in time or
there was a time out anyway there was a
problem so what happens then the library
basically takes a list of closures that
we were executing and it switches to the
bottom row so it takes the state from
the top row puts it into the bottom row
and then we roll back and we roll back
and we're done
okay does that make sense so there any
questions so far
awesome so I wrote this library called
Geetha
I wrote this library called G flow which
I'm sure I'm not pronouncing correctly
if there's anyone here from Iceland
maybe you can tell me how to pronounce
that because I don't know but the to my
American ears its key flow I'm sure it's
probably something actually really
different from that apparently this is
actual Icelandic saga naming things is
hard you know so anyway this library is
on github and it's a open source you can
download it use it in your own projects
if you wish but the thing that I really
wanted to talk about in the context of
this was kind of the genesis of the
library I was at Strange Loop in st.
Louis last September and I thought talk
about sagas and the context of the talk
about sagas was kind of in the context
of building Amazon infrastructure so
setting up a whole bunch of Amazon
compute units and they were using key
distribution so Amazon has a service
called kms and what it does is it helps
you build encryption keys and store your
data arrest securely and all the sorts
of things and unfortunately there are
some rate limits on that so if you call
the service too many times in Amazon
says nope you used up all your
allocations for this period and that was
causing downstream failures so if you
didn't get a key from kms then you
couldn't start ec2
if you couldn't start easy - then you
couldn't do the compute job and so what
happened is they had all this compute
capacity that had been allocated in
Amazon that they were paying for by the
hour and it was never going to gun mount
right so we just start up and it would
just sit there in the environment and
run and run and run was just really
great for Amazon it's not so great if
you're being billed for it and so he
wrote this library when I say he should
talk about the guy who wrote it it's
another guy from Houston who was working
on a contract and his name is Daniel
Solano and he wrote this library in
Scala that does few that does Saugus and
I was like sitting in the audience and I
was thinking that is a really cool
pattern we should have a library like
that for early and I was like surely
someone's already written a library like
that for Erlang but no one had so I
wrote one and it was kind of fun and
like I said I think it's a really great
pattern for interacting with micro
services so next I want to talk about
some of the terminology in a library so
the library has sort of three big
abstractions three big abstractions are
on the slide at the bottom level going
kind of for most specific the most
general we have an operation so an
operation is essentially the closure
that I tried to represent earlier in my
little box diagram an operation is
anything that you want it to be and it
can be of any length that you want and
they're executed sequentially okay a
step is essentially a container for the
forward closure and the rollback closure
so those get linked together and they
get put into a step which is basically
container that has a name and then steps
get organized into a list that's
executed serially in a transaction so
transaction is the top-level container
for all of the steps and steps remember
has one forward closure and one rollback
closure and a name so that's kind of the
organization of the library the
operation also has some extra stuff in
it
it's a record in Erlang record it's
implemented as a record and the other
things that it handles and does are
things like timeout values so how long
do you want to let this closure run
before you say that it took too long and
you fail it
what state the closures in like is it
ready to be run is it already run is it
are we doing forward or rollback right
what is its type it has all that kind of
information in it and then we organize
it kind of into this into this row again
right so this is the same diagram as
before but now it's organized kind of
into the operational parts of it you can
see I have these brown boxes for each
one of those five steps the brown boxes
represent a step and the sort of outer
blue big box that represents a
transaction so you can think about the
orange boxes being the operations and
the brown boxes being a step right and
they're organized left to right so
they're executed left to right and then
the top level is this blue box is the
transaction itself okay are there any
questions about it about this so far
okay so I mentioned several times that I
think sokka's are a great way to deal
with micro services but there are some
implicit assumptions that you need to
understand or at least accept if you're
going to use saga pattern in production
and there was a really really good talk
done by Katie McCaffrey and she is
really done a lot of work about
publicizing sagas and talking about how
sagas work in production
she's a software engineer at Twitter and
as written a whole bunch and given a lot
of presentations about sagas and a
couple of the next slides are kind of
inspired by things that she's talked
about but I have another friend Tyler
who works at fastly and has thought
about how Saga is sort of in the context
of messaging right so if you if you're
setting up your sagas you need to think
about what your messaging your structure
looks like right because you don't have
failures that are sort of caused by
brittle messaging I think this is a less
of a concern for Erlang people then most
other communities that I might talk to
but it's still something to be mindful
of some other important really implicit
assumptions and requirements about sagas
are are out there so I just wanted to
cover a couple those this is the most
important one though when you're
compensating for a rollback it really
cannot abort you cannot have that thing
fail if you're a Turtles all the way
down kind of person what's going to
happen is that is that at least in my
library if your rollback closure fails
that's it game over the whole thing's
done and you are going to have that
partially failed state I guess the
question about that is is like maybe
that's not the best choice there are
other ways that we can handle that or
there are other ways that you could
implement that but the easiest thing to
do is just make sure that those
compensating things don't abort
they just don't fail you say oh well
that's not possible
in fact Torben said that right before we
started the talk and I don't know it not
it may or may not be possible for that
to be true but in the general case you
know that's what really striving for is
that you're complicating closures don't
fail the other thing that's really
important about this is that if you're
going to have a saga where you're where
you're retrying things then you need to
have item potent requests right you need
to have a request that you can send over
and over again without having a lot of
state mutation in these services so if
you have something that's very stateful
they need to take care of that you need
to be you need to be very mindful of
what state you're changing and how you
can compensate for that right so if you
have a staple mutation that cannot be
item potent and there are certainly a
lot of services like that then you just
need to be mindful of that when you're
unwinding it it may not even be possible
to unwind right if you're assigning a
user ID or something maybe you don't
want to unwind that maybe you just want
to mark that thing as failed
and move to the next user ID you know in
your database for example so that's one
example yesterday I had a really
interesting conversation I'm at the
tutorials we were talking about sagas
and I was talking about my talk a little
bit and we were talking about like what
happens if comp tuning transaction does
fail and I was like well you know kind
of we're done you know there's nothing
else to be done there and he's like well
what else could you do and I was like
well this is one thing that we could do
right what if what if instead of going
from this failed state and rolling all
the way back to the left we had this we
had an arrow that just did a
compensating action and then it passed
that state right back into the top box
and tried it again right and you could
try that a few times and hopefully it
would succeed maybe it's a transient
failure that was sort of my use case
there so if you call a web service and
maybe it's overloaded or it's too busy
or you know the network had a hiccup or
something it's a transient failure you
do a back off like you wait for a
hundred milliseconds and then you try it
again maybe it'll work that's not how my
library is written today but I think
this is really interesting excuse me a
really interesting idea so it's
something I really want to explore but I
haven't gotten to it yet
all right so the next thing I wanted to
talk about was futures so why does there
only need futures it doesn't meet
futures except if we're going to have a
synchronous saga operations then we kind
of need to have something that's an
abstraction that's useful in that
context and to me that was a future so I
wrote another library called Criswell
and Criswell is pretty simple and
straightforward implementation for what
a future is and I'm calling them futures
because that's what it made that's what
makes sense to me so you think about a
future in the context of something like
Scala really what you're asking for is I
want you to perform this computation but
I will a synchronously look up the value
right so go out and do this thing and
then later at some point in time I will
resolve this value and hopefully the
computation will be finished and it will
resolve to a value that is useful but in
the meantime I don't have to wait for it
to process I can just dispatch this
request and continue on my merry way
and asynchronously I will get the value
out of it so the way I wanted to
implement this in Erlang was that
essentially it's again closure based you
take a closure and you assign it to a
reference the reference is stuffed into
s and then later on when that value in
that computation is available that goes
into x2 and then later when you ask
Criswell for the value it pulls it out
of X if it's available or if it's not
available it tells you hey this
computations not finished yet so it's
not available yet
of course you can have blocking you like
you can wait for the value to show up or
you can just continue to compute and you
know except that it's not done yet
so the thing that's been a little bit
confusing to me and the thing that I'm
still thinking about and the thing that
I would love to discuss with you during
the context of the conference is what
are the semantics of this what does it
mean to have futures in the context of a
saga so the idea of a saga is that you
want to have this transactional
semantics you want to go from point A to
point B and you don't have any partial
failures but if you have an asynchronous
operation in that what does that mean so
for example if you had a step in my box
diagram where you went off and you
asynchronously competed something and
you had a failure do you just do the
compensating transaction for that one
thing right and then what happens after
that you have a saga then that where not
all the steps succeeded but the socket
itself is done and if you execute the
whole saga asynchronously then that
opens up a whole new can of worms right
so I'm still trying to grapple with this
and wrestle with it and I don't really
understand exactly how it's supposed to
work in the context of a saga yet but
the thing is the thing that's really
interesting to me is that in the
original paper from 1987 as I mentioned
there's this idea of parallelism and you
know that does delve into this idea of
concurrency and how you're going to deal
with asynchronous computation but in
terms of how you implement that I think
that's an open question and it's
certainly not something that crap I've
thought about a whole bunch of different
ways to approach this and none of the
things that I've tried really makes
sense to me at all so if you have any
bright ideas about this I would love to
hear from you I'd love to hear what you
think about how an asynchronous saga
might work semantically so yeah please
think about that you're you're all smart
people and would love to to harness your
brainpower so let's finish up with
talking about property based testing how
many here are familiar with property
based testing already all right cool so
all of you kind of know what it is or at
least mostly know what it is and the
thing that I think is really great about
it is that lets you test your invariants
so
for example one of the invariants I
wanted to test for this proverb from my
saga library was that is was that if I
have a forward based if I have a forward
based saga and it completes successfully
that all of the mutations in state
actually happened right that it was
completely successful and there was no
partial failures and so I wrote a
property-based test that does that and I
just wanted to quickly mention there's
there's this nice academic history which
you if you haven't read
maybe you should delve into there's this
paper a very famous paper that deals
with it called quick check and it's well
worth your time and of course there's
lots of implementations for different
programming languages one of the things
I thought was really interesting was
Thomas art's talked about how did you
could check in the context context of
elixir at a conference in 2015 and
there's a link to the video on this
slide and I'm going to publish the
slides after the talk so you can watch
it if you like but it's really great so
in the early we're sort of blessed with
a richness of implementations for
property based testing there's the
commercial quick check version which is
fantastic
and there's also quick check mini which
doesn't handle statum which is
understandable there's also the proper
library and trick again sorry about that
there's the the trick library that's
also available so the idea here
basically is that we want to have
generators that randomly generate values
and those are going to help us build up
basic types and we can combine those in
interesting ways and be able to test
more complex generations there's a set
of macros that are available for each
one of these libraries called let and
such that that let you control how those
generators work and what sort of values
they generate and then finally you want
to test your proposition you want to
test your invariants and those again
have a macro that's kind of that you set
up a variable in your generator
functions and then you have a test
function that feeds in that variable and
that's a is going to let you test all of
your invariants so currently I have a
four
a forward based property based test and
I'm working on a one that has a failure
of occasional failure and I had a really
interesting discussion with with Thomas
arts this morning which I'm very
grateful for about how we might
implement a generator for that and so
I'm eager to explore that idea as well
so that's that's that's what I have to
that's what I had to tell you about
Saugus and the implementation that I
wrote for sagas here's a list of
resources all this code is available on
github right now the sagas paper is
available at that link and then there's
a couple of talks from Katie that are
really great and then this slide deck
will be published very shortly after the
talks finished so I'd love to take
questions thank you thanks and questions
one thanks in one of your really early
slides where you show the crashing state
3 and then you called the redo or undo
function of stage 3 there yeah I guess
you don't really get the state from
state 3 in that case you get the state
from how it looks after state - right no
we get it from state 3 because what
happens is that all the all the closures
are dispatched into their own we spawn a
process for every closure that gets
executed so if it fails there's a
monitor that takes the failure message
and goes back to kind of a temporary
supervisor if you will that manages the
whole sagas execution so the failure is
isolated just in the context of that
spawn and the message comes back to the
mini supervisor the mini supervisor
processes it and says oh I'm going to
take the state that I have and feed it
back into the rollbacks
okay so and at the same callback for
that you use if you crash in this state
or if you've crashed in an earlier one
because I get the message that you get
in this hole I couldn't look a little
bit different
I don't have my mic on so I am a little
bit confused about what you're asking
for
if I'm crashing in stage three and then
I get called in the undo function of
stage three yeah and I get one type of
message but if I instead when I'm
getting called back to stage two there
when I go back all the way I guess I do
then it's them then I wouldn't get an
error message from they - this is hard -
this is sorta - so the way the way that
the semantics work is that just just to
be really clear about it the way that it
works is that every closure spawns into
its own thread into its own zone process
sorry
into its own process space and there's a
monitor on that on that closure and if
the closure fails then that message
comes back to the supervisor the
supervisor has a state stored inside of
its loop that it's asking in the receive
loop and so when that message comes in
it says oh here's my safe state I'm
going to start I'm going to figure out
what closure to execute next by taking
the list that I have currently and
reversing it and then chopping off the
parts that I don't need to execute and
then I'm going to take my safe state and
use that as the state to inject into the
rollback okay so then it would roll back
from state 3 - 2 - 1 and then done
exactly and then around taking up every
time hello timing but in state 3 there
then I get the crash from state 3 but in
- then I had didn't crashing in in
number 2 you're asking why are we
rolling back to state why are we rolling
back the progress that means it's day 2
and day 1 I like that I understand why
you roll back I just think that with the
roll back functions for those who would
look at different because they stay -
succeeded right sure the but the idea is
is that you want to be able to so the
overall goal is that you want to move
from A to B and you don't have any
partial failures and if you do have a
partial failure then you want to unwind
the whole thing yeah so yeah so the way
that you would handle that is that you
know you would you would have to roll
back all that but if you had not failed
in earlier steps the closure that you
have to unwind that progress might be
different based on the state that you
get it
so we when you're in those compensating
those compensating closures the state
that is added to that function call has
all the information about what the
context is that you failed in okay yeah
does that make sense like yeah that's
what it was when I get so that you have
different compensating functions it's
like if I was crashing in this exact
state or if I was crashing in a earlier
state I guess the the callback functions
would have just kind of take care of
that yeah so a lot of this is up to the
callback implementer there are a few
like sort of utility things that I
provide like one of the things that the
library offers is checkpointing so if
you are in the middle of a very long
forward progress you can take that
partial state and send it to the to the
mini supervisor so that it has it in
case there is a failure then you don't
have to to lose any of that right so if
you have an operation that has like
three or four you know individual
discrete parts to it then those can all
execute and you can checkpoint that
progress and then if there's some risky
thing that you're doing that you think
might I'm out or might fail then you can
checkpoint all that progress before you
execute that if you want okay
cool thanks yeah thank you thank those
are good questions appreciate it thank
you
any more questions it's one here so one
of the things that properties of
transactions is that you cannot observe
what's going on in the transaction from
the outside is yeah here's the case too
because it's no seams to me it's not
pure it's not a pure transaction it's a
transactional semantics but it's not a
transaction like in the sense of a
database transaction yeah so we're going
to follow up on this question so if you
have made a couple of changes right
unfound your step
yes somebody else has observed it yes so
this other guy also be wrote back then
there could be dependencies right
absolutely there could be dependencies
the the thing that is important to think
about in the context of building a saga
is how you construct those dependencies
right and my suggestion for that would
be to defer all of the other sort of
things that you want to have visibility
into until the saga is either complete
or roll back all the way but it is true
that you can see impure sort of partial
updates and partial state and partial
failures for outside of the system right
so you can have a saga that advances the
state in these different micro services
and then you might have a competent
transaction that revokes that that
mutation right and if you are in that
situation then you know you need to be
able to to recover from that you need to
be able to do that the way that you can
do that is really up to to
implementation right so I don't to my
mind there's no way that I can think of
that would really solve that within the
context of a saga other than to see if
the saga itself completely succeeded or
completely failed thank you thanks good
question that's a that's a really
important subtlety about sagas is that
you is that it's not a pure transaction
in the sense that visibility is not
preserved
you know atomically so you so external
things that are looking at states of
things can can see the mutations even
before the saga itself is completely
finished so okay any more questions
no all right thanks very much I
appreciate it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
