from my affiliations I do sort of three
different things and this is the the
least profitable thing I'm doing well so
data science and F's are consulting is
that sort of more profitable but
philosophy of science is it's something
that I really got sort of interested in
as I was finishing my PhD where I think
a lot of people at that stage are like
oh what am I actually doing here and you
can you can sort of just take it as a
lament or go to your psychiatrist but I
sort of thought it's really interesting
problem how programming as a discipline
or computer science as a discipline how
do we do what we do and why do we do it
and in certain ways and this talk as
sort of using some of that some of that
reading and I'll end with a useful list
of references I'll have movies you can
watch and books you can read sorry I'll
warn you at the entity so that you can
take your take your phones and take a
picture but to start with the talk
really sort of started with a twitter
discussion and I've sort of I thought
all better and only anonymize those but
there's a threat where someone was
saying hahaha are pure functions
invented or discovered and one of the
answers this is really interesting I
wonder if there's a paper about that and
I sort of came in and said well there's
an entire academic discipline about that
but sadly it lives in the humanity
school so we don't really know about it
because like hidden in the other
building there's there's a discipline
called philosophy of science philosophy
of mathematics and this is one of the
sort of basic questions they would they
would think about so what I want to
start wave if you just to sort of give
you a couple of pointers to some of the
interesting ideas that people have
thought about in this other strange
building on the campus it's not going to
be complete at all I'm just picking a
couple of random things that I've read
because my background is computer
science a lot of philosopher so even my
knowledge is just sort of a couple of
random books that's the more than a
paper and the sort of basic thing that
many people probably have heard about is
Platonism and this is the idea that goes
back to Plato that mathematics or in the
sort of modern incarnation that
mathematical objects are some sort of
independent eternal entities that exist
outside of the world as we as we humans
interact with it so if you if you
believe that when all the mankind dies
and the universe explodes there will
still be number five then that's
probably a plot honestok belief because
you sort of believe that the the
mathematical entities have some sort of
objective existence outside of the world
and this isthis is sort of a perspective
that quite a few people believe I think
a lot of people who don't really think
about it will will sort of think about
something like this
until they start thinking about it and
then then you sort of discover all the
potential problems and one book that I'm
going to refer to later on talks about
this and says this is this is fine but
there's a problem with this and they
call it the Romans of mathematics the
problem is that it's it's a great story
that really attracts lots of people to
mathematics because you get to work with
this perfect world but it also is what
intimidates people it sort of helps to
maintain
Eliott because you can say well either
you see the eternal truth or you don't
and if you don't that's probably yeah
and it sort of rewards the
incomprehensible 'ti partly as well so
the sort of platanus twee is something
that makes the mathematics looks like a
perfect sort of universal truth and that
really disconnects it from from people
which has nice aspects but it also has
said aspects meaning that it makes it
really hard to learn or engage with it
so another interesting perspective is
that a lot of a lot of science is
release or this social process a lot of
mathematics has really interesting
social process behind us and there's
really really lovely book by America
Tosh where he's saying something like
mathematics doesn't grow through the
increase of number of established
theorems so it's not just we sort of
discover more and more of this ideal
world but it grows through improvement
by speculation criticism and that's what
he calls the method of proofs and
reputations so the idea is you sort of
come up with some mathematical thing and
then the community which finds it
someone criticizes it you find a counter
example you have to go back update your
definitions and so on and so on the book
he talks he he sort of goes through an
example of a polyhedra so there's the
famous Euler formula for polyhedra and
once you sort of start digging through
it and he say well what if the polyhedra
actually has a tunnel through it it
breaks the breaks the formula so then
you have to do this sort of revising and
so on just a wonderful quote from the
book is by a mathematician I forgot his
first name but his Halasz name was
hermit who's sort of well-known
contributor to
I calculate to sort of differential
calculus and so on where at one point he
writes a letter saying I turned aside
with a shudder of horror from this
lamentable plague of functions which
have no derivatives and he does this
because at that point the definition of
a function just didn't allow this like
this is a monster this is something that
just shouldn't exist and maybe we should
just drown the people who create these
and that's that's part of the process
we're later on the mathematical
community says well we'll have to update
our definitions to make this work and
it's the sort of social process that
that makes mathematics happen
the other interesting thing you can say
about mathematics is that it really
depends on some on some culture as well
and there's sort of more extreme more
extreme takes on this idea that really
mathematics
everything is just culturally determined
it's just a social construction but
fairly fairly sort of reasonable take
you can you can have is that you say
well a lot of mathematical ideas are
really have some have some cultural
aspects in it so culture specific ideas
often find the way to the very fabric of
mathematics and a couple of examples and
people always computer scientists like
pictures of how the hilbert so I put
Hilbert here but he's he's actually
irrelevant because all these things here
so one of those sort of Western Western
culture things we have is going back to
ancient ancient Greeks and it's the idea
that there is some sort of notion of
essence and in in Greek I was like you
built everything from fire or everything
is from water there that that's the
essence
but there's this idea that things have
essence really is something that sort of
part of the Western culture and the the
sort of hilbert idea or idea around the
time is that human reason is really a
form of you can sort of treat it as a
form of logic and the other thing is
that given the subject matter we can
look for foundations that's that's
something that's very very Western why
don't we look for truth where we look
for foundations and so this is sort of a
point that maybe if you if you didn't
even have a Western culture if sort of
Chinese mathematics evolved
independently from from the Western
mathematics maybe even the Chinese
wouldn't have wouldn't have lambda
calculus because they just don't need to
look for essence and logic and and
foundations and finally so this is
probably going to be the sort of biggest
chunk of my talk is and alvaro who is
giving a talk yesterday already
mentioned this book by lack of and Nunez
called
where mathematics comes from and it's
written by by cognitive linguists and
sort of cognitive scientists who are
saying the only mathematics we we can
say anything about is the sort of brain
and mind based mathematics so if there
is some eternal mathematics well then
might be but you just have no way to
work with it the only thing you really
have access to what happens in the brain
when you do mathematics so let's use
cognitive science to try to look at what
how people think when they do
mathematics in in practice this means if
we want to find out anything about
mathematics how it's done what it is we
should look at cognitive sciences and
and find the ideas there and
how they what they tell us about
mathematics so what I'm going to say now
it's just a few more sort of a bit more
background on this cognitive science of
mathematics what we actually know or
what the cognitive scientists know about
how our brain does mathematics and the
one really really important thing there
is that cognitive science they're sort
of lot of work in that area that shows
that abstract concepts are understood in
terms of more concrete things by a
metaphors so metaphor isn't just
something that poets use when they want
to write a best-selling best-selling
poem it's something that we just use in
our everyday thinking without even sort
of consciously realizing it and I think
this is this is really important I think
someone mentioned yesterday a recent
debate about about something like like
functors or other other fancy category
Theory constructions even those things
there is a is a scientific evidence that
when when you're thinking about very
abstract stuff you're doing it in terms
of concrete things so I think this is
this is a really really important note
that is worth keeping in mind even when
just when you're programming remember
that abstract concepts are really
understood in terms of concrete things
and interesting part is that they sort
of the lot of mathematical ideas are a
mathematician of something some
real-world stuff some ordinary ideas so
for example a derivatives are you can
sort of understand them you learn to
think about them in terms of changes of
speed or immediate change
so derivatives are the artists sort of
think you do when you when you're in
physics when something changes changes
speed you sort of think about it in
terms of derivatives but also that's how
derivatives actually are sort of
explained that's how people think about
them and how do we use all this to
actually understand mathematics there's
a couple of things so there's some basic
mathematical concepts that you can
actually actually find by doing
experiments on babies so there are some
there's some basic sort of built in
maths and then from this you can you can
sort of construct more complicated
structures by metaphors and there's
conceptual metaphors which sort of
explain basic things like numbers and
then you can get more more complicated
structures that are sort of more
abstract by building metaphors on top of
other metaphors
does anyone have baby around six months
ideally you can do this so the trick
here the idea is do we saw this can we
check whether babies have some built in
maths like one plus one equals two and
the experiment you can do is that you
take these two Mickey Mouse's put them
somewhere and then hide them so that if
you remove one that's happening here the
baby can actually see that you're
removing one of the two Mickey Mouse's
and then you put down your your your
blind and either the expected thing
happens so there's just one Mickey Mouse
because you removed remove the other one
and you'll see one or you can you need
to have some sort of hatch in this where
as you remove one you'll sort of stick
in stick in one so even though you you
have to you removed one you're still
left with two and the experiment is that
you will sort of watch babies don't
really tell you very much and six in six
months but you can watch how long they
stare at this thing
and the the the sort of result is that
when the unexpected things happen they
will be confused and they will stare at
this longer I think you need a lot of
babies to actually make any conclusions
but you can try it with one so that's
the sort of built-in mathematics that
babies have and this works for like one
two three and I think four is too much
but the way we construct sort of more
abstract mathematical concepts like
numbers is that we will link them to
something that happens in the world so
in the world even if you're six months
old you can recognize two three Mickey
Mouse's and their objects in some and
some collection and that's the that the
metaphor here links this collection of
objects to to number system so you will
say think about numbers as collections
of objects then you'll say the size of
the collection is the value of the
number bigger collection means greater
number and you built this mapping
between the concrete real world stuff
and abstract mathematics and the way we
can find this is through linguistic
examples so the way we talk about
numbers and and the way we talk about
numbers very often uses the same words
that you use for collections of things
so when you say add onions and carrots
to the soup this is addition you're just
putting stuff in a collection or if you
say which is bigger five or seven well
no I don't know they're both 14 points
on my on my screen and not bigger so the
bigger really sort of refers to this via
this mathematical metaphor and the
equational properties of numbers that's
something that you can again get from
the real world stuff so if you have to
up to object collections you put them
together or
if you have three right if you have a
and B you have some object collections
you put one into the other or the other
into the first one there will be same
number of objects and that's that
commutativity in mathematics the
metaphorce often have some sort of
limitations so if you have a collection
there really is no good way to talk
about zero you need other metaphors like
movement where if you make 0 if you
don't move at all that's zero if you
make one step that's one so another
metaphor can blend with this one to give
you give you other things like zero in
this case so what does this what does
this tell us about lambda calculus or
what's the sort of cognitive science
that would be behind lambda calculus or
what would the sort of sociologists and
and philosophers say about lambda
calculus so again this is I think
another intriguing Twitter discussion
where someone says pipe theory and
lambda calculus are are eternal but
libraries they're they're ephemeral and
they're just no good so I think that the
highlight is this so lambda calculus
that's really like haha discovered but
angularjs they're the ideal world of
mathematics doesn't have angular in it
maybe a baby react is there I don't know
so what what can you say about these
claims well the the one that I'm really
going to sort of talk relate this to you
is this is this really intriguing idea
from computer science that links
programs and lambda calculus with with
proofs in mathematics and and category
theory called also Curie Howard lambic
correspondence and I think that's one
argument that people sometimes
sort of
use or refer to when they want to say
are there really is something deep so
the idea here is that a lot of lambda
calculus constructs like types functions
and tuples you can they happen to
correspond quite amazingly to two proofs
in programs so type is like a formula
and if you can construct a program of a
given type then you prove a formula
function and programming happens to
correspond to implication and function
application as the modus ponens rule
from logic subpool will sort of happens
to correspond to conjunction and it
links with with stuff in category theory
as well so the idea here is well there
really must be something deep about the
universe here because we've just found
that the same thing exists in three
different branches of sort of human
knowledge so is there something deep
well the first the first answer or the
first potential issue is that you just
can't even relate programs and proofs
because it's something that philosophers
call category mistakes proofs refer to
some sort of world of logic and programs
really refer to two empirical a
posteriori knowledge so program is this
like physical stuff and proof is a
mathematical thing and you can't just
sort of take these two together and
treat them as the same as the same thing
this is this this sort of criticism was
really well they didn't have Twitter
shitstorms in 1988 but it cost something
like this where James Fetzer a
philosopher wrote this paper the very
idea of verification where he says
program verification is a category
mistakes it's literally nonsense because
you
and have proofs about programs proofs
are different worlds than than than
programs you can observe programs you
can do sort of empirical tests like
scientists but they're not mathematical
so that's one sort of possible thing to
say about about proofs and programs I
think that the another sort of may be
more easier to swallow perspective is
this this idea that it really depends on
the sociology behind it so what what
Locke etosha spruce and refutations
would tell us is that the analogy
between the three is very carefully sort
of evolved evolved fit and if you look
at what you need to link the three you
just don't take any arbitrary category
theory
you take cartesian closed categories
which is a very particular monster you
just don't take any proofs you take
proofs in certain kinds of intuition
allistic logic and you take special or
one of those sort of several kinds of
lambda calculus so the fact that the
three match might very well just be
because through the process of proofs
and refutations we've learned how to
carefully construct them so that they
they align but it's just the sort of
sociology the the human word behind it
that make them fit it's not just it's
not like a curry Howard who are two
people woke up in the morning and
they're like haha boom now I have this
perfect eternal knowledge dropped on my
paper it matches
it's really the sort of human process
behind it that that made it work and one
more part of the human human process
behind it I think is the sort of
cultural cultural background where even
in science it's very often
happens that somehow magically to one
idea gets sort of independently invented
or discovered around the same time and I
think this very often happens because
there's just a community of fairly
well-connected scientists who sort of
talk to each other work on similar
problems perceive similar things as
important and use the same methods for
for investigating these so I think these
three really you could you could see
them as the sort of the mathematics
mathematicians Network solving the same
problem with logic and lambda calculus
that's sort of going back to Hilbert
again and it's it sort of all happened
in this in this enterprise of searching
for foundations of mathematics and
trying to formalize this the sort of
human logic inference so that it can be
done mechanically which back then meant
you'll hire some cheap labor to do the
symbol pushing but those the the three
ideas really sort of come from the same
sort of soup of ideas so that's why
that's that's one way of explaining why
they happen to be so similar and you can
you can fit them together and the
cognitive scientists they would tell you
well they probably they're probably the
same because they're all derived from
the same embodied experience using some
some conceptual and layering metaphors
to sort of understand this or construct
this this abstract way of thinking about
something that we experience in the
world and sadly they didn't pick lambda
calculus as one of their examples in the
book but really the sort of interesting
question would be how are these
these ideas constructed from embodied
experience and that's a tough question
and I don't really have a have a full
answer but I do have a couple of points
or a couple of pointers of on sort of
what they might need what the aliens
might need to understand lambda calculus
or what's the sort of embodied
experience that you need to have for
something like lambda calculus to exist
so with aliens understand lambda
calculus I'm not using Twitter codes
this time this is this is from a korra
question and i think it was even not
talking about lambda calculus but about
Lisp specifically so that would make
james Fetzer the philosopher who's angry
about category mistakes very upset would
aliens understand lambda calculus the
quest that was the question and one of
the parts of the answer is were any
intelligent species is bound to come
across logic so and this is this is a
this is a well-known computer scientist
answering without really giving any
evidence so we're we're sort of in
science we're all very careful about
arguing carefully except when it's in
for our answers it's just is the case
and once they have logic they'll run
into program prove duality and boom
here's less and I think it's very
tempting to believe this if you if you
subscribe to the plot honest ideas or if
you if you really because the sort of
experience you have when you work with
logic really is that it sort of has this
romance of mathematics you're you're
working with eternal truth so surely
that the aliens would also have some
sort of reasoning so I don't really want
to blame anyone for sort of saying this
because
if I didn't didn't spend the last few
years reading philosophy of science book
or philosophy of mathematics books I
would be I would say the same thing and
it's very natural thing to say but let's
let's try to look at a couple of things
from the sort of cognitive science
aspects and as I said I don't have a
clear answer of like how lambda calculus
is sort of constructed but I think there
are a couple of basic constraints that
you would need
so one thing and this is in the in the
lock off and Nunez book where they're
they're actually do a bit of work to
understand understand logic and one of
the points there they're making is that
that sort of build up from by a chain of
metaphors through things like set theory
from something they call container
schema and this is a this is really sort
of physical embodied property of the
world where if I have a little black
thing and I put it in a glass and I put
the glass in a jar then the black thing
will be in the jar so that's that's
something that sort of is a property of
offsets as well when I have X is a
member of a and a is a subset of B well
then X will also be in B and the sort of
mathematics here is constructed because
this is how we perceive the world so
that's one thing that's sort of and when
you think about it you say well is there
any world where if I put a coin in a
glass and then the glass in the jar the
coin will be outside well that takes a
bit of creativity but might be and so
what the book has is that this is how
you can explain the modus ponens so
given two container schemas a and B
and some object X if a is in B and X is
in a then X is also in B which happens
to have very much the same structure as
function application so if I have types
a and B and the value X and a function a
to B and X then the sort of f of X will
be in B so I haven't done all all the
sort of cognitive science research that
would be necessary to really really
claim that this is how things like
application in lambda calculus can be
understood but I think there's there's
definitely sort of some some link with
what will they call the container schema
so that's one thing you might need the
other interesting thing about lambda
calculus and this is going back to the
to the method that the cognitive
linguists use is to look at the language
that we use to talk about things because
the language is often an indicator of
how we think about stuff so evaluation
in lambda calculus is done using beta
reduction and reduction has a lot of
sort of language intuition associated
with it so when you reduce you it means
to bring down to a smaller extent or to
lower in degree or to bring down to a
lower rank so your you have something
that's sort of bigger and you reduce it
to something smaller and this really has
an important sort of property is that it
has some direction when you're reducing
you go from one place to another and you
can't go back if you have two plus four
and you reduce it to six when you're you
can't really easily go back because you
don't know whether six was two plus four
or one plus five so the other I think
important met
for that you need four four actually
even having lambda calculus is the sort
of notion of direction or directedness
and I'm going to wrap up why by looking
at some concrete aliens
so et is very much like humans he would
probably have lambda calculus but the
the two other interesting ones is lamps
solaris and the arrival movie so how
many people have seen the arrival how
many people don't want to hear any
spoilers about the arrival I'll try to
be I'll try to be careful but the the
arrival movie is really sort of about
this these aliens that have very strange
language and the language has this sort
of circular nature which in the movie
also sort of affects the perception of
time but they don't have any
I think they can't really have any
notion of of directedness direction so
given that for reduction you need you
need this directedness maybe they
wouldn't have they wouldn't even be able
to think that something can be reduced
and they might have the difference or
the foundation of reasoning that's based
on sort of everything where you can sort
of morph between states and reverse
everything but they wouldn't really they
might really not have any sort of idea
for reduction the other movie is a
Solaris or sort of stanislav lamps book
and this one is even more curious
because the alien life-form or the the
thing that's in the movie as the
sentient be being which sort of seems to
be the entire planet so this kind of
alien there really is only one thing in
the world and would would that would
that would that sort of alien living in
the universe
there's only one thing would it even
have numbers one and two like six months
old planet doesn't look at your Mickey
Mouse's and says haha one two and three
because there there's nothing like that
in that in that sort of cognitive
perception so that's another sort of
creative creative alien that maybe
wouldn't have lambda calculus and the
last one so I sort of made this up and
then because I wanted some some alien
that lives in a very chaotic universe
maybe in sort of gaseous planet then
obviously I looked up on Wikipedia
there's a list of aliens by life-form
you scroll down to K gaseous aliens
there's like five of them so pick one of
them
there's interstellar dust cloud and I
think what would be really interesting
about sort of aliens that have this this
sort of very chaotic nature is that if
you look at chaos there's no clear
boundaries there's no like inside and
outside because it's just sort of all
flowing in the space so those kinds of
aliens even if they if they as although
there's one there's one in Star Trek as
well if you're Star Trek on those aliens
if they have reasoning it must be based
on something else than on containers
with this with this clear sort of
distinction of inside and outside so
that's another that's another potential
thought so would aliens understand
lambda calculus I think I I sort of
tried to use this question to make a
couple of important points the one is
that this is really a question that the
people in the humanities building have
been thinking about and platon ism
which is this idea that mathematical
entities are universal truths is really
just one of the beliefs and some people
who mainly people who don't believe this
will say it's just a religious belief
it's a religious claim because you can't
tell there's no experiment you could use
Y you could blow up the whole universe
and then check if there's still
mathematics but it's kind of hard to do
so you you can't test this and hence
it's not really a scientific claim it's
just a religious belief and philosophy
of science and philosophy of mathematics
has lot of lots of interesting thoughts
so there's the sort of social aspect of
mathematics where it really you can
explain how things evolve by looking at
what people are doing or that the
cognitive approach where it's product of
embodied mind and I think in in some ray
it really depends like boring boring
aliens would probably have lambda
calculus but if you try to be a bit more
creative there's a lot of things that
you could say where they wouldn't thank
you
I think I started five minutes late so
we might have some time for questions in
the meantime here's the books you can
read so tremendous talk I wanted to
address the question of directionality
with the the aliens from arrival and
again trying to steer clear of spoilers
but like they they do clearly have an
understanding of physics they build
starships they travel across the
universe
they actually talk about things that
will happen but even putting that aside
you know at least on the macroscopic
scale observational physics does appear
to have a directionality despite the
fact that the equations appear to be
symmetrical so time itself must give
them some notion of direction even if
they can perceive things concentric ly
so I would posit that such aliens would
still have a notion of directionality
they must in order to interact with sort
of the physical universe even if their
their mental processes are able to
abstract beyond that yes so I think this
is a I think it's really really hard to
sort of look at these concrete ideas
like the the sort of arrival or even my
chaotic things because whenever I start
to think about it I really get into the
same problem where they really must have
some insight outside or some
directionality and I I sort of think

projection of what the aliens do so we
see them as sort of behaving as if there
was Direction ality but maybe there's a

these things they do without having
directionality and I I don't want to

problem like God wouldn't have lambda
calculus if he's timeless but
