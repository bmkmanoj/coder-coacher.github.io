doing this little journey I think that
the screen is a bit off so some I hope
the content isn't being cropped away too
badly but we'll see so we will start
here in the valley of programmer def and
the vast lamps of implicit state and try
to escape over the c2 MTL style where we
will pick up type classes and index
monads and stuff we will cross the kind
of value type level boundary go into
Adria's land and eventually we will
settle down on these type safe Shores
out there this will be a very fast-paced
tour of state machines and type systems
I'll show you a lot of examples and a
lot of code and try to highlight what
your compiler can help you with and
hopefully I can inspire you to
investigate more and learn more about
this I won't have time to explain
everything ok state a stateful program
is one that remembers its previous
events we call that a program state and
stateful program may transition to
another state based on its previous
state one problem with stateful programs
is implicit state and with that I mean
that the program does not explicitly
define the set of legal states hope you
can read this state this instead can
scatter all over many mutable variables
and it's very hard to follow the program
execution and see what's going on and to
see kind of verify the integrity of the
state transitions and then you start
sprinkling runtime checks all over and
do defensive programming so instead we
want to make States explicit then it's
much more clear how we transition
between them and it makes stateful
programming less error-prone one
technique is finite state machines and
with those we model a program as an
abstract machine and that machine has a
finite set of states the machine is in
one state at a time and we have events
that trigger state transitions from each
state there's a set of legal transitions
expressed as associations from events to
other states many of you might have
heard of finite state machines before in
one or another way it's a well-known
thing but and there are many ways to to
can express them so for this talk I'll
borrow this definition which actually
comes from
erlangs documentation so maybe you have
seen this before it says that if we are
in state s an event e occurs we should
perform the actions a and make a
transition to state s prime this is a
conceptual module ma model we won't
necessarily write everything as
functions with this signature but we can
think of it in this way also we're not
talking about mealy or Moore machine
strictly we won't be doing any explicit
hierarchies of state machines we won't
use guards on transitions with one small
example one one exception and also we
won't go crazy with kind of UML shorts
and and state charts and all that so
I'll spare you those those paints
instead we will simply model the set of
like legal states as a data type where
each state has its own value constructor
and you can actually do this in most
programming languages even in
object-oriented programming languages
but as as Phil said this morning you
should object so instead we'll use
Haskell of course we will encode with
algebraic data types instead in the
first can real world example which are
borrowed from from a work thing was this
shopping cart checkout and this is a
common example as well
we begin with having no items and then
one or more items can be added to the
cart then the checkout can start and all
those days states in the big box can be
cancelled from so there we have kind of
hierarchy going on but yeah it's a
notational thing so we select the card
when you end up in this card selected
then the card is confirmed then we place
the order and then we're done so this is
a bit simplified from a real world
example but it still contains small
complexities to make the some
interesting points a bit cut off here
but you should see everything okay so
here's the state data type representing
the same state machine we have
constructors for each value state some
of them are empty constructors or no
Larry constructors and some carry data
like pass items has a non empty list of
cart items and that guest can pass
through all the way and when we have
selected record we also have a card
which is passed through the events are
also a data type here so the checkout
event has one constructor for each event
and some events carry data like when you
select a card item that card item gets
its passed so when we have that in place
we can make our first stop at coding a
finite state machine and we will do this
as a function from state to event to the
next state and this doesn't look too bad
right this is very close to the ER line
thing but there is one important thing
missing actions yes the problem is that
we cannot inter leave any side effects
here this is a pure function so we could
kind of simulate what would be going on
but we will still just end up with a
terminal State and nothing has happened
not so useful so we changed the type to
distance Ted and put an IO on the end
and this means that so it's a function
from state an event to IO of state and
this enables the machine to perform side
effects at each transition we write a
new version of check out that uses this
impure IO version and here are some of
the the pattern matches of that function
so in case we have no items and we use
like an item we we construct a list with
just one item and the second case here
then we already have some items then we
just prepend it suppose we have this
payment provider module some card thing
we can interleave the side-effect of
charging a card when the order is placed
all right so here we use this i/o
capability when we run this we can
provide a simple runner looking like
this so this is a function taking such a
impure
- like machine the initial state s a
bunch of events in a list the ease and
then we end up with the i/o of the
terminal state and the definition is
just fold them so it's quite simple we
can easily decorate this thing with
logging so here I have an example which
takes some imperialism and returns
another one but where each transition is
logged when we run this yeah we will
wrap it with logging and we have the
initial State no items and then a bunch
of events we will see this output so we
see each transition being logged and
then we have the interleaved effect on
the second to last line so to summarize
this part we have explicit states and
explicit events using data types that's
very good
we can provide provide these
standardized runners and logging metrics
whatever you want because it's it's kind
of refined into two data structures
instead of having just a list of events
you might think that's a bit naive you
might consider driving this program in
another way like maybe using pipes or
whatever library because usually you
don't have the full list of events that
are going to happen there are some
troubles with this or concerns one is
that our transitions are coupled with
i/o we're using i/o directly this makes
it a bit harder to test this state
we can't do that in pure setting we
could abstract that a bit kind of easy
but I'll show you another technique also
a bigger issue I think is that while we
have the states and the events as data
types we don't have anything expressing
the the valid transitions between them
so there is nothing stopping us from
making an illegal transition at any
point so can we get more flexibility
around testing and can we get more
safety now we'll go into this style
which I kind of called it's it's known
as MTL style but we've extended it we
will extend it with some other things so
we will use associated types also and
basically we will bait we will start at
MTL style and then we will have some
conventions for state machines benefits
are that we can combine this with
regular monad transformers with the MTL
style stuff that's already provided for
you like error handling logging and so
on and you can build higher-level state
machines using kind of lower level once
composed them together even though it's
a bit fiddly with em tail style because
of the classes all have to to go
together so we write the type class
encoding the legal transitions of the
state machine we represent each event as
a method in the type laz those methods
take the current state as an argument
and return the next state we use an
associate the type alias to make the
state type abstract for this type class
this means that the instance of the type
class will choose the concrete state ID
and we will just talk about some
abstract state ID and then we write a
program depending on only the type class
and together they form the the state
machine program at some abstract level
to actually run it we need an instance
so this need to be an instance of this
transitions
typeless it will define which side
effects are to be done at each
transition if any so it chooses the
concrete data type and that concrete
data type can contain all kinds of
implementation details like database
connections or sockets or whatever you
whatever you need okay but we can also
write instances which don't do any side
effects we can have like testing
instances which are pure okay so with
this technique we will define our states
as empty data types so here we have a
bunch of types with no constructors so
this might seem a little odd but yeah we
we can't construct values inhabiting
these types they are only used as marker
types you see how very soon
then we define this checkout type class
which will contain all the events and
the transitions the associated type
state of em has kind start to star and
how many of you here are familiar with
Kimes in hospital okay almost half
that's good so a kind a kind signature
like this it's basically you can think
of it as a function from one type to
another so star to star basically means
type to type so it's a it's a kind of a
function at the type level so this state
will will take a type and return the
type and that type that we pass in are
those empty types that we saw before so
we dramatize it by some marker now let's
look at these methods the initial method
is simple it just gives our gifts the
starting state so we don't pass any
state into it we just get a starting
state it's parameterised The Associated
state type here is parameterised by the
type for a specific state in this case
it's no items
some events are very simple so the day
transition from one state to another
so confirm in this case transitions from
card selected to card confirmed right
some are more complicated so if you
remember from the diagram we had both no
items and has item States accepting the
select event you can select one more
item at the start or when you're already
had some items so they it's the same
event being kind of overloaded we so we
have to be able to pass one of those
States either the House items or no item
States into the council event so we
could use them either for this but I
think it's a bit more clear what's going
on if we have a specialized data type
for it this communicates what's going on
better so we define select state and
this has one constructor for each value
of state where you can select one more
item so we kind of wrap two different
types in a sum type because then we pass
a select state instead to select and the
court item the the next item you want to
select and we get back has item States
so we have to can source states in the
event and 1 1 state on the outside on
the in the returning in the same way
basically but there are 4 cancel there
are three states accepting council you
saw the big box and you can cancel it
can all the way through so there we
couldn't use either it would be even
more confusing so we create the data
type again cancel state which has three
constructors same thing going on in
council we pass a cancel state to it
here's the complete type class it's a
it's a bunch I know but this if you
squint a bit you can see that this
corresponds very nicely to the diagram
we had before this this contains the
same information in a way so let's write
the program using our type class instead
Phil cart constraints constraints em to
be a monad with checkout and IO
operations so now I should point out
here that I'm using i/o directly in this
this part of a program just to drive it
to get the user input and to make some
progress
you could abstract that away if you like
to make it more testable and I haven't
done this here just to keep the
complexity down a bit anyway so this
this type says that it transitions from
no items to house items it asks for an
item and select that and then we have to
wrap it in this selected state
constructed finally Phil kart hands over
to select more items which we'll see now
this type says that it remains in the
house item states it oops there if the
user wants one more item it selects that
and recursos
otherwise it just returns the state it
had start checkout as a type saying it
goes from house items all the way to
order placed so that the end of the
whole thing that matches very nicely
what we have so far we ask for a card
and a confirmation and as soon as we
transition state here you see that we
need to start using the resulting state
value instead so we we have a state
value pass it into to an event
transitions we get back a new state
earlier and then we have to start using
that so each time a transition we need
to start using the new state value we
can't really cheat and skip a step so
that's good in the end if the user
confirmed we placed this order if not
then we cancel go back to selecting more
items and restart to checkout so it will
just loop until we reach or replaced
this is the main programming main
program creating the checkout flow
running it and then eventually ending it
we get back an alrighty
when we are completed so far we have
only seen this abstract part of the
program depending on the type class to
run it
or sorry the the part we have seen so
far forms this this abstract program
that can be run in different ways to
actually run it we need an instance of
checkout in this instance we'll decide
both the the concrete state type which
is used to pass that around and also if
there are any side effects going on and
so we will use this instance to run the
checkout program the abstract program
this is the concrete state data type
that we will use and this is a bit
daunting but okay this is a GA DT which
is extension in Haskell so basically
it's the data type but we provide the
site type signatures for each
constructor ourselves it has one
constructor for each state and each
constructor maps to one of those empty
state data types from before those with
no constructors at all so here we can
tie together this concrete state type
with those abstract type tagging types
no items here if you if you are familiar
with Haskell you might notice that the
no items constructor here it's not the
same thing at all as no items the type
no items here is a constructor in the
DAT T and no items the type it's that
empty type from before so you could say
that this check out state type is a
concretions of the abstract state type
okay given that we have a bit of
machinery to to run this MTL style check
out T type this is the regular kind of
boilerplate you do with them TL
unfortunately we can then define this
instance so we say the check out the
instance for check out T and then we
associate our concrete check outs the
data type for for check out state with
the kind of
stay tight so for this instance States
will be checkout state basically let's
look at some of the instance methods the
initial method simply constructs an
alert no item state
no sorry fax going on select will
prepend an item to a new or existing
list basically like before returning has
items but you can note here that we work
with our concrete state data type in
these methods and we don't have to
handle any state event mismatches
because the we have the type system
checking each transition and the
compiler actually knows that this is
exhaustive so each state we we parent
match on will be just a valid state that
that could go in there same thing goes
on here we're in place order you see car
confirm it's the only thing that can go
in here so we don't have to you know fro
errors on on the incorrect transitions
this generates an order ID calculate
some price charges to customer so here
we have a bunch of side effects going on
and finally returns this order play
state we can run this abstract checkout
program using run check out T and we end
up in i/o we could again write the
instances for tests which didn't use i/o
okay to summarize this technique we've
model state machines using type classes
and ntl style we've used associated
types to abstract the concrete state the
state data type for each implementation
and we use these explicit state values
being passed in and being returned from
each each transition also we have this
abstract program which only cares about
the the type class and then we run it
with some instance okay this is a bit
stricter than the ADT based version we
had in start because
we also encode the state transitions in
code and in types but it's not
necessarily safe because these that
estate values that we pass around those
can be reused or discarded they can be
consumed zero times one time or more
than one time this makes it possible to
Reaper form side-effects illegally or by
accident and there is nothing really
enforcing us to go to the turmoil state
to have the program eventually do - you
know cancel and exit properly or perform
the whole check up flow so as an example
of reusing state values or consuming
them multiple times yeah we place the
order and then we do it again and we
kind of mock the user and yeah and then
we end so they have been charged twice I
think there was some Bitcoin exchange
doing kind of this the other week I
don't know but this is not our business
model right so the compiler compiler
should just say like you you X broken
like do it right okay so one solution to
this problem would be to grasp for
linear types right we then know that
each value is consumed exactly once and
we wouldn't have this problem but
another problem is that GHC or haskell
doesn't have any linear types at least
yet so i won't be using that instead we
will use the solution where we take the
the state instead of passing around
states explicitly we will bake it inside
the mana and then we can do this instead
so if we place the order twice we get a
type error second time we're not in that
state we can't we can't do that
operation to accomplish this we we have
to parameterize the monad by or index it
as it's called by the state types
otherwise we couldn't get any type error
here and that that brings us to index -
index monads have anyone heard of this
concept before
a couple cool then you learn all kinds
of new stuff or at least have heard of
it so an index monad is as the name can
suggest a monad that is indexed what is
it indexed by well to new type
parameters input and output you can you
can see this as the type before and
after this computation so if we look at
the IX Mona type class this is from
basically from the the index monad
library in Haskell I think it's just
called index like a tremor anyway this
this is the kind of head we see it that
the index mode of M has the kind k2 k2
start to star that sounds very scary
right but the K is any kind and it's the
same kind for the input and the output
and then the star is the Magnetic return
value as a regular Mona so a regular
Mona would just have the star to star
here but now we have to case as well for
the input and the object okay and there
is one interesting operation here called
I bind which is analogous to bind in
monad so I will do a comparison how many
of you know how bind works with Mona
yeah that's good
so this is this is the signature for
bind basically where m is some monad and
yeah this is not a moaner tutorial this
is an index monitor tutorial so let's go
okay we have a bunch of new things going
on here I J and K all over so what's
going on this looks a bit messy right a
lot of letters everywhere the input of
the first magnetic computation that's
the left one the input type is the input
of the resulting magnetic computation
that's a red arrow going all the way
over and the eye eyes being mashed the
output of the second magnetic
computation the one that's
bound that's the output type of the
resulting magnetic computation that's
blue arrow there Kate okay and then the
J is the intermediate index and that's
the green arrow okay so if you squint a
bit this might remind you of function
composition right you have two functions
and they kind of the type in between
goes away you get a bigger function okay
same kind of thing going on here but
with the indices instead if we format it
a bit differently and specialize this I
bind to our state types maybe it could
look like this
so if you I bind one computation from
state one to state two with the
computation from state two to state
three we get one big computation from
one to three directly as a last concrete
example we will use these two operations
from their checkout flow so we bind them
together and the result transitions all
the way from has items to car selected
okay okay we'll take questions
afterwards I think but keep them keep
them in memory if you can okay so using
this index state monitor we hide the
state inside the monad only the type of
the state is visible and we cannot use a
computation twice unless the type
permits it okay the index Mona can
describe one state machine at a time
like one yeah one resource or one state
this makes it hard to compose because we
want to have multiple state machines in
a single computation possibly like
opening two files being two state
machines and copying stuff from four one
to another or a ticket may ticket
vending machine or whatever having a
printer and a card reader so on so one
solution here is to have a type as the
index which maps a name to a state or
Maps multiple names to multiple states
so we can represent many state machines
going on
at the same time and then those are
independent and we apply events by name
so now let's look at some pure scripts
just for fun
pure script because really this is much
harder to do in Haskell so we will use
pure script for this example in pure
script they have a row kind which is
like a type of a record so here we have
a row saying out is a file and in SS
akut so out and in are the names fields
labels I think is called these can also
be polymorphic so we can say for all are
like a row type variable we will have a
row that has at least out file and in
socket and possibly other fields and
these are used regularly in peer script
to to do records and effect types so
here we construct a record with those
two fields which this is just syntactic
sugar for the same thing
okay these can be used in our state
machines so here's the small example
where the initial event goes from from a
row our and ABS the my machine in its
initial state to that are the second
example transitions from state 1 to
state 2 only for them my machine and
their other resources or things in art
remain the same so you can combine these
and this last one goes from a row with
my machine to a row without it so it
deletes it and then we can have a type
signature requiring that each create a
state machine must be removed so in this
example we go from an empty row to an
empty row so everything that happens in
this computation has to kind of clean up
after itself okay there are some
examples here I'm shamelessly plugging
two libraries of my own the two last
ones but the first thing is a cool
library in a dress which I'll if I have
some time I will show you show it to you
now these are pure script in Haskell so
you can do some stuff in Haskell as well
if you're interested in index monads
check out this blog post an introduction
on quang's Haskell blog very good
there's a package
spoke all indexed you can use this
extension rebind herbal syntax to use do
notation with index bonus you get crazy
and yeah you can do weird stuff with
session types together with this so lots
of cool things very quickly I'll just
throw some Idris at you and you'll see
what happens so it is is nice a very
cool language which we can grab some
ideas from maybe not using production
actually the website says like it's it's
not for crucial things but I like to
steal some ideas from this language so
it makes it nicer because we have
dependent types and we can use that for
things like error handling and having
independent state types which is really
nice and the thing where we had multiple
states accepting the same event we can
express that cleanly yeah check out this
tutorial this one okay so this is what
we had before but in Idris if you if you
look at those two in it to first dates
no items in house items they kind of say
either zero items or more right that's
very close to a natural number and the
natural number encoding you usually see
in Idris so what we can do is to use the
natural number and collapse those two
into one thing being parameterised
by the number of items we have and then
the select operation increments that
number and there's a guard when we do
checkout we have to have at least one
item otherwise it's the same okay in a
dress we have these type a aliases for
things so this is just some
prerequisites the items of n is really a
vector of n items okay other things are
strings our state is a sum type here as
well we have this natural number than
that through all the states too to keep
track of how many items we have the
checkout interface has this state type
this is very similar to a so
type of thing we had before so here we
say which is the concrete state type
okay here's an operation this adds a
state of has items of zero right we and
we get this VAR back C bar so we don't
have to name our state machines come up
with cool names like my machine we just
get this bar back which is like an
opaque identifier we can pass around so
when we do the Select operation we pass
in that identifier the bar and the item
and we go from having items and items to
having the successor of n items plus one
we do a check out we require it to be
not 0 so the successor of some number is
not zero right and then we go into the
no card state with the same number of
items again we have this thing with
where we have three states accepting the
council event and we want to encode that
so we can use a predicate over state
types in address and basically say to
the caller of this operation can you you
have to give me a proof that your
current state accepts cancel the proof
is a value of this type yeah I won't go
into much detail here but basically in
the signature you say you tell it risk
can you automatically create a proof
that my current state s that's s is a
cancel state that you can create a value
for it with with n items and then we
continue with n items okay then we write
the program using these these these
operations so select more we'll just
select one one more item and ask a
question nicely check out with item
transitions from has items to order
place all the way to the end okay or it
stays in house items if the checkout has
canceled so here you see the dependent
types going on where
the return type decides that the return
value decides to return type we asked
for a credit card and eventually will
place the order and you see all these
continual cancel be a sprinkle few those
could only occur on those places because
of the types that's kind of cool
check out or shop remove the resource
from the in-state has items okay and it
will try to check out with items and
complete the checkout flow but if the
user cancels it loops back to go
shopping which we will see now I know
this is a bit confusing and fast but
let's go go shopping we'll select one
more item then we ask if the user wants
to check out if not then we just go
shopping and these two less functions
that you've seen those two will go back
and forth until the user has reached the
end and brought their stuff right so we
start this program by creating the
initial state machine and go shopping
okay and if your I've seen this total
keyword we tell it is to to make sure
that all the all those functions are
total right so if you have a hard time
at work convincing your boss like I want
to use it this you can tell them that
you can prove that your users will buy
your stuff very good to have these total
functions that loop we need to run use
run loop and there is one little trick
here this value called forever that's
partial that's like recursive value so
which fuels this computation so to speak
and if if we run out of foreverness we
print tubes yeah that's dangerous one so
to summarize this implicit state is is
hard and unsafe when it grows we can
have a better documentation and
understanding of our program by making
it explicit and did not have to do
defensive programming
you probably have this these hidden
state machines in your code which you
might benefit from from formalizing in a
way and you can use data types for
states and events and possibly
transitions like I shown you and you can
gain a lot by just doing that in in most
programming languages we can lift more
information to the type type level and
get some more safety around transitions
and stuff so like Haskell and pure
script are good examples but you can
also steal some ideas from from a dress
and similar languages or linear types or
whatever but I urge you to start simple
use you know data types and and take
that step first and see where it gets
you because that's like the 80% of the
journey but it's fun to experiment right
so key tech ways to redefine this design
in the code yeah now with that I will
take some questions
thank you for a nice presentation okay
any questions I thank you for the great
presentation I will have one question if
you have a more complex use cases won't
there be a problem that the restriction
rules for the state machine in Haskell
go out of hand so they grow quickly and
how can you deal with such a problem do
you then split the one use case to
smaller ones and then they interact like
separate state machines or how do you
deal with such a situation thanks yeah
good question so I guess the happy path
is is kind of nice like and I only
showed you basically they have happy
path in the a scope version right so
error handling can become a problem
I guess that's that's tricky that's
where it explodes and it's if you look
at the the idris examples more closely
you can see error handling being like a
first class thing in that framework so
to speak so it's not so easier in in
address to do that our error handling in
house calls you you'd have to do it a
lot of explicit stuff and as you say it
might blow up
but if you can split it and somehow you
know isolate the error handling within a
smaller area then then it might work
also worth noting here is I think you
shouldn't like okay let's rewrite or a
whole system with this technique you
can't use it just like a local thing and
I've experimented and with using this
for a part of a web app for instance and
there's a framework in Haskell called M
flow for doing basically these like
workflow web Wizards basically and then
you can use this kind of technique in in
isolated area so yeah hope this answers
your question
okay other questions thanks for the
presentation and do you happen to know
the alternative approach to modeling
state machines based on phantom types
and how it relates to the ones you've
presented modeling with phantom type
phantom types yes I'm not exactly sure
what you're going okay okay I believe
that to explain you yeah we can okay
thanks okay okay
one more question yeah please yeah so
the question was what was my use case at
work so this I didn't use the Haskell
implementation at work they I just took
the example from work but we had a big
complicated checkout flow where you know
a lot of stuff going on in this session
so we had and that was in closure so and
you know requirements change can you
please put in a step between step four
or five you know and also do coupons or
do like a optional login wherever and
you know the just explodes in complexity
and we have no idea what was in the
state type or the session type and yeah
so that kind of led me into to looking
at this would it be reasonable to to to
make make this like a explicit state
machine or a business kind of flow but
yeah I didn't use this technique at work
there's one question on the back
for safety yeah but my question is that
what are your experiences on on this
method as the size of the state machine
starts to grow and and and as such the
number of invalid transitions start to
grow which you have to handle as you
said error handling and logging become
explodes it that in that case and I am
specifically thinking of if one would
want to re-implement opengl in a higher
language and the opengl state machine is
fairly large with a lot of with a lot of
bad transitions yes over here
and would you consider doing something
that or that is just too big yeah that's
interesting because I think when this
was the the hotness around UML as I
understood it people were trying to use
these hierarchical state machines so if
you had you could like compose state
machines and you get error handling
locally and you get error handling
composed in some way and that tried to
tackle this complexity of large system
expressed as one big composed state
machine I'm not sure if anyone succeeded
doing anything useful with that but in
this this approach I have taken here
it's it's quite simple so we I don't
have that hierarchical thing so trying
to tackle something like OpenGL would
probably you need to be more you would
need something more powerful to to go
there so yeah I I wouldn't put him
through that I guess man but but in a
way if you look at it like this
basically what this does is highlight
the problem more you know by making
these things explicit you said you have
a lot of involve transitions everywhere
just start falling errors you would do
that anyway but you wouldn't know about
it kind of yeah so it's not that you
can't do it with this technique it will
you
will you will you will see how much it
hurts basically yeah okay thank you for
nice discussion and yeah baby yeah we
can have one more yeah I I listed this
motor library for Haskell which uses
this convention and if you use that it's
extremely experimental I put some hours
on it but you can you can generate like
a graph this thing from the type class
yeah yeah so I think you thank you for
this discussion it was a nice session
and I think we're just in time the lunch
should be upstairs as far as I know we
are going to meet again in one hour so
if there are any speakers for the next
session you can try the projector and so
on and yeah let's thanks Oscar again
thank you
