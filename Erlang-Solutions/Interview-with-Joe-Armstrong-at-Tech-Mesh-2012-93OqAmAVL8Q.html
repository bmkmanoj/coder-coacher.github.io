yes did you have a talk or aqui na worry
ya several with meeting and my between
the three of us careful talk by la
history for on the history there yeah
well Tommy could we talk together for
bucket since we made the movie service
yeah the famous movie that is moving so
we just talked everybody
and I'm how like like people I I felt
that in this discomfort people are more
receptive to really technical details
and new technology new languages yeah I
mean I been speaking of developer
conferences though several years if i go
back to four or five years ago where
does it became fighting them did one
track where they were talking about
funky languages and that was basically
sort of okay so we've got lots of
that's entertainment with funky
languages and now it's not just one
tracking funny language thinks of two
days but the four types of five tracks
and half
not so good yeah it's a funky language
is a
every day I talk to you like you can
with this new problem yet that you see
you think we should be solving I don't
know I have my rastrick time moment
yesterday the day before yesterday
because I think the term
hardware and software have been
very distance which other if you know
the guys making hardware
it's often they never talk to each other
it's like a Venn diagram the number of
people who know both hardware and
software it's very small and so two days
ago I just we're running grasping
positive value must be PI little
breadboard and just connected some
diodes and things in interpreting job is
over
I need some lights flashed and then
suddenly I was thinking what can we do
it hardware that we can't do the
software
and so I was googling and looking up
chips and things and trying to find and
I know nothing about how where would we
choose to buy but i was thinking I'm
into electronic music so I was thinking
well maybe we could recognize every note
in an orchestra but you have to do like
six or seven hundred fast fourier
transforms
just get food DSBs and stick him on the
card roll them from computer and that
should be quite simple and if it wasn't
else in a pretty parallel or I did not
buy doing software but by buying more
chips and then oh well show me so what
do you do then turn on a breadboard or
you could just download this program in
you draw it on the screen and press
something and order it and then it comes
it comes in the past a little printed
circuit board and then your surface
mount components and merciless really
selling a you know a few hundred of
these thousand wouldn't go to the next
step you wouldn't build never games so I
think you're going to see new pathology
actually write write new possibly using
so it's back to you know I want to find
out they are the part of your kids or
whatever it's called
like 79 bureaus in the book and two
stepping motor nearby
a big one well thank you that's very
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
