I've been working for Ericsson for the
LA
42 years which I think Ernest me the
title of a grumpy old man I'll be
retiring in August this year which has
the great advantage in a company that
you can say and do exactly what you want
because there's no point in trying to
fire you because you'll go anyway so
there there's some advantages with age
not many but some and I was going to
talk about what am I experiences of the
last 20 years in managing organizations
which produce large volumes of software
so i think that large well as the
software are actually not very good
thing but unfortunately they do exist
and it's very difficult to see what we
would do without them i think most
software projects are small that for
people is a fairly sort of typical sort
of software project i guess that most of
in this room do small projects but if
you press a very large several hundred
people in fact some of the projects that
i've been working with i've had over 500
people involved when i asked a show of
hands how many people have actually
worked in the project with more than 10
people here that's actually surprisingly
much how many people to work in a
project with more than hundred people
will get in there and how many people to
work to poke more than 500 people well
I'm just amazed two of you I have to
talk to you after it to see if you agree
with what I have to say but why of
projects large well what makes them
large well basically the main reasons
for things being large is that the
problems we have to solve are very large
problems the things I worked on the last
ten years have been mobile radio base
stations can anyone guess how many
millions of lines of code there are in
the base station either a cdma or there
were 3g or a 40 base station with anyone
guess 1 million lines of code two
million three million are you getting
there halfway in between something like
six million lines of code which is awful
lot of code and
requires an awful lot of people working
on them and why are they large because
basically the salt the hardware we use
is special purpose that the streams of
data which come down from the antenna of
the aerial er large we're talking about
gigabits per second which has to be
analyzed in special purpose DSPs these
monsters are programmed in DSP see which
is a strange dialect of C and you really
don't have a choice except using DSP see
for that sort of thing because you
simply just have to crunch the day to
reach gets through nothing else you can
do about it but on top of that we have a
lot of people called operators now we
like the operators because they give us
money we hate the operators because they
tell us what they wanted us to deliver
the they want to be able to manage their
sort of several hundreds often there's
even thousands of base stations from one
single central point now that makes life
difficult they also have a certain
amount of problem with the software in
their base stations they want to be able
to upgrade their software in very
strange places that a lot of base
stations are sort of very unaccessible
in in certain countries base stations
inaccessible because you have to have
armed guards to take you to the places
where the base stations are otherwise
you'll get murdered on the way they're
not a sort of good idea other base
stations are difficult to get up because
the copper thieves will be there and try
and steal the parts of it and we have to
sort of guard them with sort of Mad Dogs
and this sort of things sort of keep
people away from them so upgrading a
base station has to be done remotely and
it has to work
most of the software that we write for
these things had written from scratch
let's say I sometimes think that the
standards which you made for writing
base stations are actually made to make
programming pay stations difficult we
don't want small companies to be able to
take us over and therefore we make the
standards incredibly complicated so no
one else can do is I think that's a bit
of a sort of naive approach butter with
there's a lot of stuff which has to be
done signal processing protocol handling
traffic setter resource handling
adaptation to low-level operating
systems to make life difficult we tend
to use weird operating systems you may
have vaguely heard an operating system
called OSE Delta no one else uses it I
think Nokia use it as well actually but
no but we're fairly sort of unique so to
make life difficult of course if you use
that it makes life even more hard
because there are no proper tools we're
actually moving everything over to limit
Linux nowadays so that makes things a
bit easier another problem is that we
have a lot of hard real-time that the
data which comes down from the antenna
you just cannot sort of wait a bit if
you miss a bit of data then you miss a
bit of speech and people don't like it
it's even data is actually better than
speech because data the tci to be
protocols and this sort of thing will
clear it up for you but people don't
like some talking when it goes tick tick
tick in the middle or something like
that it's sort of people find it
somewhat irritating another problem is
the people's lives depend upon our
systems if you have a accident on the
highway you want to be able to phone 911
or 112 or 999 depending on what country
you're in and you want to know one
hundred percent that it works you don't
want to sort of a little pause because
someone is busy upgrading the system
just then and nor do you want the thing
to crash mobile systems a lot easier
than wireline systems because people
expect things to crash from time to time
you off to all you drive through areas
with no coverage or you drive under
bridges and things break so the plan
things break with people a little bit
more tolerant than they are with
wireline systems but nevertheless you
have to remain a certain standard in
your traffic
so that where we correct che make
changes we have to make changes on the
fly with as little outages as we
possibly can have and our upgrades must
work we cannot upgrade a base station
and then find we have to send a little
man out on a bicycle in China somewhere
to repair it operators just don't like
that so we have millions of lines of
code we have hundreds of people working
on it and this requires an organization
the organization's which I managed was
only partes you used to say that there
is a manager of about 500 people at one
stage and people say gosh you must be a
big manager name and big guy and I said
no no it's far as Erickson is concerned
I'm a sort of middle of the range
low-lying manager because that's a sort
of scale of the sort of problem and they
own organization that has to be run now
that I found it actually a few months
ago a very interesting bit of research
which came from you can get the others
you can read the URL a bit later it came
from the Virginia Tech carillon Research
Institute where they actually did
experiments on groups of people and they
found that if you put groups of people
and I regret to say that I hope that
have known in women here because it was
founded with work went worse for women
that did for men you have a dumbing down
effect of the more people that you have
sitting together in the meeting and this
is actually has it also implicates and
nothing else that jewelry services are a
bad idea because juries are actually
less intelligent than
individual people however i'm not
talking about legalities now i'm talking
about sort of programmers and putting a
lot of programmers in a room together is
apparently an idea to make them produce
worse code than if they work
individually I think the fact that going
to meetings makes you stupid is nothing
really sort of a surprising nothing that
you only we all knew about that anyway
but how are going to meet these is nice
you can have sort of a donuts and coffee
on this sort of thing and talk to your
friends and don't have to do any real
work but in point of fact it does make
you stupid and so there's a problem we
have an organization of several hundred
people were trying to do things and
putting them in meeting rooms trying to
stop them being stupid well how'd you
get how'd you get around it how'd you
get around the dumbing down effect of
putting a lot of people in the room
hoping that they sort of opal do said
something sensible how'd you get around
the fact that you have manages that say
do it this way and the programmers say
don't don't want to and the problems
this is really how we made software I
think you all recognize that this that
so we have some formal requirements
sometimes requirements are actually
written down my bits of paper sometimes
they're in your head sometimes there are
standard and then we design a little bit
at the time a design increment we then
test and verify what we've designed to
find that it doesn't work and when we've
got it right we correct it and we go
around that cycle until we get something
which works reasonably well as I think a
fairly normal way of doing it now the
point I'm making here is it's very
important that you can go around that
cycle very very fast the Tay as time has
gone on we found all sorts of obstacles
that we didn't know existed began to
exist that we used to use a version
handling system called clear case which
and restore some of you have come across
unfortunately clear case slows down that
loop because every time you check
something out it takes time and just a
small just a few minutes checking things
out of one period of time will actually
infect the whole cycle which is why
we're slowly moving from things like kk
like get instead which is a lot faster
if your tests go slowly then you're
going to have to wait and I want like
drinking up to coffee but you if you
wanted a testing is important that it
goes fairly fast building integration is
important that it goes fast so
everything which delays going around
that cycle is a bad idea now that's an
ideal picture an ideal world life isn't
really like that but it's like this that
I have a lot of the cycles going on the
outside with a lot of different teams
and la de Paz developed independently
and then I get in the requirement and I
have to have a big team at the end of
the day that put everything together and
make everything work and this here is
the here is the problem there is where
you have the dumbing down effect that's
where you get people working together
and you get people coming to coordinate
that the teams on the left have to
deliver at the same time and produce
things which get into there so the whole
idea of there's no popular nowadays with
agile and scrum and everything like that
everyone keeps on talking about it all
works very well in the small teams but
it simply doesn't work when you put
everything together because you simply
have to put everything together you have
to coordinate and as soon as you start
coordinating large numbers of people you
get a non a gr situation so what do you
do about it the hard thing is that
features are not independent of each
other I can give you a very simple
example from the radio field though a
feature we have there is to change the
propagation characteristics of a base
station we have a little look motor on
the top of the aerials which means you
can tilt them and you can tilt them
backwards and forwards and you think
well that's not a hard job to have a
little synchronous motor and little
feedback loop and work out what angle
you're pointing it right anyone should
be able to do that but unfortunately if
you do that you actually change the
characteristics of yourself so that
actually means that the feature of
tilting the aerial actually changes
means you have to re parameterize
yourself so that you know what what
coverage you've got a simple thing like
that that means that one team who is
writing the software the tilting the
area has to coordinate with the software
of the team that
doing self control that's the way that's
life another problem is that at the end
of the day we can't have people writing
parts of the software for our base
station in or whatever it is in there
one language and other people writing
other languages certainly we can do
operation maintenance in one language
and we can do DSP programming in another
and we can do a traffic controllers in a
third language but that's okay but we
can't simply talk different parts of
traffic controller in different
languages simply because at one stage we
have to move people from one team to
another we have to have common article
agree architectural principles so what
we do is we do need an organization to
do that but we need to minimize the
dumbing down effect of having people
working together very few top-level
architects are necessary we have to make
sure the top level architecture that we
actually have our clever people that
understand what they're doing and this
means that we have to have people that
have worked with these sort of system
for years they've had to work the system
maybe for 10-15 years to know what's
going on and hiring people like that is
difficult because we have to sort of pay
them a lot to make sure that they
actually stay with us and give them all
sorts of shares and options and all
sorts of things to keep them that's
difficult that's a present engineers we
all understand that hadn't important it
is to have these clever people working
on that but unfortunately as you get to
our personnel and HR departments they
don't they don't understand why we need
to pay people so much to do this sort of
thing you get the whole politics for a
whole organization which cannot come out
in that sort of thing it has to be
overcome ki a space what do we need we
need clever people obviously if you're
going to design a big system everyone at
every level has to be reasonably clever
you can't have poorer programmers and
that's a problem if I'm going to hire
500 people to produce a system it's
going to be very very costly for me to
hire 500 of the top notch programmers
it's just simply not going to be
possible so I have to accept the fact
that I have a varying levels of skill
level of various people writing software
we have to have an organization when
organizations as soon as you start
organizations you start talking about
management hierarchies and people that
think they're better than other people
and that sort of thing we have to have a
way of working which works the three as
a principle we have to have a documented
way of working this is how all these
people work together and there's nothing
that people really hate more than being
regimented against processes and on the
rest of it people want to work in
different ways and we have to have a
technology at the end of the day which
which works now the whole of industry
you'll find people that will talk about
all of these and talk about some people
know how to gather people some people
know how to build organizations some
people know they'll talk about ways of
working nowadays that you want to make
money you write books about scrum and
agile and their extreme programming
that's the best way of making money
nowadays far better there's more money
in that there isn't technology and I
think in Francesca isn't the wrong
branch you know sort of it on the other
hand at the bottom level is technology
and people tend to forget technology I
hear time and time again it doesn't
really matter what sort of programmers I
employ as long as I have so what's of
technology I use as long as I have good
technology well that is a sort of
greatest you can hear from many
people i mean if that was true we'd all
go back to programming assembly language
and we won't forget forget about
everything else technology is absolutely
crucial and this is why I think airline
and OTP is a very good technology for
this sort of thing we use it in certain
parts of our system in ericsson we use a
lot all sorts of technology and they
along ought to be using some places not
as much as I'd like to see it used I
think there are always the problems that
people have various ideas and we've
inherited a lot of systems we brought up
a lot of systems but we do use it and
why is it does it affect that little
loop are talking about well strangely
enough one of the things which people
don't think about is the ability of
loading code into running system that
actually makes incremental programming a
lot lot easier and it makes it easier
simply because we don't have any build
times if i'm testing something and it
doesn't work and i can rewrite my code
and loaded into the system i can do that
in a matter of
seconds if I have a large system built
with C or C++ or Java and I have to
write make and then wait for 15 minutes
for the whole thing to recompile and
reload that costs me time so being able
to load code incrementally minimizes
test times and it minimizes build times
and that's very important it's also very
easy to to debug and the tracing because
so much dynamic information is always
available you can always find out where
things crash very easily and very fast
it's a lot easier than for example
system of large system built with C++
which you largely probably have had to
turn off the minus G option in your
compiler simply because it generated too
much code to fit into your memory so
when things crash what you have to do is
recompile the G option put in debugging
stay debugging printouts and all the
rest of it now like you don't need to do
that and that's that is another thing
the finding above when the things
crashed or when things have gone wrong
you can do that very fast and another
reason of course is the compact code
line it's incredibly compact code we
reckon once upon a time that it's about
a factor for shorter than C++ code on a
factor six shorter than normal sea code
straight up and down and because code is
small that you can find you can navigate
your way through it easier and unique
need significantly fewer people far as I
work with respect to achieve more
important the fact that I can isolate
errors I mechanized lies hardware
failures and software fares recover from
the fast is very important they're
handling things which I've actually was
wonder people behind that back in about
nineteen ninety-two that is a very
important in our systems simply because
we can actually recover from areas very
fast keep things up and running another
thing which people don't really realize
when Francesca was talking about evening
classes in airline you actually learn
our line is very very simple it's a lot
simpler than C++ it's a lot simpler and
Java it's a smaller language easier to
understand and you know people say well
it's that easy it can't be
very powerful well the reverse is true
it's actually more powerful it's
difficult to learn that I think the
difficult bits about our line is not
actually the language difficulty bits is
about OTP and how everything works
together now everything fits together
how to build system that's that's where
you landed it i think yelling you can
learn the couple of days learning OTP i
found everything works around it well i
think it takes you a few months to be
sort of really up and running and going
fast but i think that's very true if you
would start learning java from scratch i
think you'd find the same problems there
do you have the same problems I'm
looking all the classes you need to
learn the hand everything works so if
you want to do anything you know star
for the airline you think gosh that's
easy they said oh gosh I've gotta learn
this ATP stuff that's hard you can
concentrate on developing software not
fighting the language which i think is
important that it's go okay I must admit
it does have a bizarre syntax that there
were reasons for that I think Robert
just escaped out of the door their
association if he didn't want to really
explain that okay that was the first
part of my talk what's happening my
background what I think about developing
large systems I gave part of the same
talk here i'm going to give now in
london and this is the sort of fact that
if you become an airline program and you
think you're very good at it what should
you not test to tell your manager about
telling what's a difficult bid the first
part is that software development is an
art not a science people talk about
software engineering well that's no
 it's not engineering the
largest way you write soft is trial and
error and we all know that it starts off
from I write code and I put it into the
a in editor or whatever I mean you mean
some people use bizarre systems like it
clips for writing code I don't
understand why that sir I even found
someone writing code using VI the other
day that was a really bizarre i think
that sort of
now it is trying to process all methods
or formal methods for looking at code
have always failed the Tay formal proof
has failed people lightning this you
learn about this in universities and you
learn about psychology about formalism
again total failure totally useless
forget it all the software developers
have almost also religious beliefs in
the languages in the way of working
which editor to use which programming
language to use and so software software
development is an art it's not a science
and but unfortunately we have managers
who come from another part of where they
have a terroristic view of the world
they think about software factories I've
always thought first toy factories is a
wonderful idea that the first row writes
the assignments the second row right sea
of statements the third row right Sakura
ma'am in a company very close to me
which I will not mention because it's
Harry do me a bit embarrassing other
hand it doesn't matter because I doesn't
matter if they find me just now because
I'm going to retire soon we actually had
someone in from the personnel department
the kindest wonderful idea he said well
look that we're out active in all sorts
of corners of the world when people are
sort of a waking up in the United States
people are going to bed in Europe so
they could hand over the code they just
developed in Europe to the United States
and of course when people are sort of in
the going to bed the United States
people wake up in China so they can hand
over their code and this blog actually
thought you could actually develop code
this way sweet true amazing so people
have really weird ideas about the way
you develop software especially if you
don't do it so basically my message here
is forgot it don't tell your manager
little pointy-head manager that
developing software is trial and error
trial and error doesn't sound so good so
tell them it's very scientific in your
very clever the term disadvantages
another problem that I have is that
anyone know professor brainstorm by the
way there's a wonderful book about that
with pictures from here what if she's
not very well known a lot of people have
been indoctrinated in the ideas of
object-oriented programming everything
has to be object-oriented the number of
people have asked me how do you write
out daljik programming object-oriented
programs in airline has been large my
always answer is you don't and please
don't and then those people either say
oh that was interesting or this will go
away and said shape the head these nuts
can't be done so a lot of managers think
that you should do everything an
object-oriented way and there's a funky
programming languages of single
assignments and the bizarre syntax the
mean watch out for them so the answer to
this question is that you tell them that
airline is actually used in banking now
that used to be a good thing to say
because until the crash of Lehman
Brothers a few years ago but I don't
think we were responsible for that the
banking is solid people believe in
banking software so that if you have
people o mighty ending managers to think
that you're doing it the wrong way point
out banking that's good that'll comes
down a lot of people another problem is
easy to learn now that is a problem it's
a if it's easy to learn and so why
should I pay you more for learning it
it's actually a heck of a side easier
than C or C++ nice little example at the
bottom there i equals 10 I i equals J
cuz i plus plus plus plus I does anyone
know what the answer to that is whether
the answer is actually I should be 20 or
21 strange thing is in sachse see that
is undefined and being undefined you
never know what's going to happen that's
why a lot of software comes in one works
in one compiler doesn't work in another
it's not much of a problem and see since
everyone uses GCC and their most
compilers are based on GCC now that's
interesting that you that C is a mess in
as far as that's concerned so the best
thing you can say is that
yes it's hard to learn but it'll make me
very much more productive I'll not tell
people is easy pretend it's hard but
hard things you get paid for doing hard
things you don't gonna get paid for
doing difficult things see now this is
an interesting I've come across this
many times it's communism it's open
source I don't know the ant there's an
easy answer to this one if you have a
point here in manager who says that's
open source and that's communism are not
good you ask and what compiler uses now
if the comp I if the boss says he
doesn't know then that's all right but
he doesn't want a compiler is you know
problems you can get away with that but
if you says you say GCC you can say yeah
we use that that's open source as well
problem that never mind is asking get
around that one easy to interface to
other languages now that also is a
problem that managers have friends that
work for companies that divided into the
develop all sorts of weird software they
develop databases and they develop all
sorts of GUI tools and all the rest of
it because they've got friends in
different companies that would do that
sort of thing they think they should use
their components on my friend Joe over
there your boyfriend Fred over there
he's got this wonderful system can't you
integrate into that Oracle produces
wonderful database can't we can't we use
Oracle databases in our system that'd be
a lot easier than using venezia or
something like that so you get this
thing that if you say it is easy to
interface to other languages people will
want you to interface it to other
languages and other products if you say
it's hard they'll say well we can't use
that because it's hard so this is a
difficult one you know whatever you say
you ever you say that
you get it wrong you have to play this
one by ear I don't have an answer saying
this to this one yeah all I can say is
that you're in trouble in the in this
respect that take it easy and this is
the classical one that about 10 years
ago I was talking to a researcher from a
manager of a research group in other
company which are the three letter
acronym beginning with I and the second
letter would be in Paris the third one
you can guess what it was and I said to
well it's ten times easier than writing
writing software in the in C or
something like that as these men he was
French in his book legs is I won't i'm
not trying again irritate him and he
said well look i haven't managed of 10
people and he said that if what you say
is true that i won't need those 10
people and what's worse i'd have to do
all the work myself so Brooks Law I
think man to our to a late software
project makes it later is still very
true the Tay making doing things we seem
to be too easy means that managers lose
status and manages it largely throughout
the world get paid in direct proportion
to the number of people that they manage
that's why I don't manage anyone
nowadays and I'm absolutely practically
broke I last slide more or less last
like that this is my view of the world
I'll show you where the good wouldn't
agree that once upon a time we had
assembly language and then someone came
along invented Pascal Pascal was
actually quite nice but unfortunately no
one used it and it had awful compilers
and when we're very slowly that after
Pascal the kerning him Richie invented
C++ oh sorry see not c++ criminal and
then it's great i like see see allows
you to do things without having to go
into assembly language if you've careful
you can do things which are reasonably
portable you can write virtual machines
for languages like java and airline
and all sorts of things that she's great
at the same time as the sea was being
developed that we're actually other
languages being developed like ml was
being developed at bell labs and later
later on we've seen languages like
Haskell being developed we've seen o
camel being divided developed at the
same time some idiot went once invented
C++ at the middle now I just don't
understand why they did it it was
completely utterly unnecessary if you
want to do the low level things in you
need speed you see if you want to use to
do things which of efficient and
which easy to program and you don't
require an awful lot of capacity well
you ask girl you've got airline I'm not
saying if T was a line for everything
use Haskell for Android a compiler use
Haskell for goodness sake is ladi it's a
lot easier it's the best language for
doing you that say c plus plus and Java
are a necessary step in human evolution
I should have had never been avoided ok
I think he'll using Airlines a good idea
but if you have an application for which
airline is suitable and I'm not claiming
the airline is suitable for everything I
have had people that say well if
Airlines so great why don't it use it
for blow programming DSPs and I say well
that's not quite the problem with the
reasons without doing that but new
approaches will always meet opposition
from pointy-head managers that's always
going to happen and you have to know
it's going to happen then and we see the
number of people in this room I feel a
certain confidence now that I can retire
happily and sort of grow tomatoes and
forget about programming and see that
it'll all happen by itself which makes
me very pleased so good luck to all
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
