welcome everybody this is a talk
of working progress we are trying to use
Erlang for automatic testing of web
services so i will report whatever we
have done so far and the things that we
have in the pipeline this is how my talk
will go i will start with a very brief
overview of prop of what property based
testing is and i will give a short demo
using proper for those that have not
seen it so that we you can understand
the rest of the talk then i will talk a
bit about how traditional testing of web
services happens and i will try to
describe how i think that testing of web
services has to happen during using a
line we are building a tool based on
proper of course xml and yaws which are
things that you can find in the Erlang
to library i guess and then i will show
how we can use this to do fully
automatic response testing of web
services and i will give a demo on this
which will be the main part of the talk
and then i will show a brief demo of how
you can extend this fully automatic way
of doing response testing of web
services to do property based testing of
web services and i will again use a
short users do a short demo there and
end up with some ideas of future work if
time permits so the idea of property
based testing is to express the
properties of a program using some input
output relations that the problem that
the program should satisfy so the user
expresses just properties that the
program should satisfy and then there is
typically an automatic tool that tries
to find counter examples for this
property and it does that by
automatically generating progressively
more involved random test cases and
provided
you generate enough test cases either
you find a test case for which the
proper does not hold in which case you
have found a bug either in your program
or in the property that you expressed or
you pass a sufficiently number of of
different test cases and then you gain a
little bit more confidence that your
program is correct or at least it
satisfies the properties that you think
it should satisfy you don't of course
have a proof that your program is
correct but at least you have good
confidence that it's doing something
reasonable for many cases now this
typically happens based on a general
description of the structure of the test
so typically the inmost property based
testing tools the the programmer is
responsible for describing how the input
the test inputs should look like so
that's the general idea of property
based testing probably you have heard it
before in the last one half years we
have been building a property based
testing tool for airline called proper
it's a tool that is freely available as
open source out there you can get from
this URL proper tell dot soft lab dot
and the you 80 gr and it provides
support for writing properties in test
case generators it has components for
concurrent and parallel testing both
based on a state machine and finite
state machine and the salient feature is
that has a full integration of with a
language of types and functional
specifications of airline and because of
that generators often come for free so
you don't have to write generators
because if you have the types the tools
knows exactly how to do this
automatically so for those that have not
seen how proper looks like you typically
write tests
looked like this one property tests that
look like this one you light your module
with the properties you have to include
a header file that does most of the
magic and then you write your properties
and properties are functions that start
with a prop and then the tool nose
automatically these are properties and
can test them for a number of times and
typically the properties that will look
like this one they have a typically for
all so what this property says is that
for all terms if you do term two binary
and binary to term this supposed to give
you the same term back so I think this
is a property that one would expect from
the two built-in functions turn to
binary in binary to terminal end and
indeed we can actually then compile this
program and run it with calling the tool
on this simple property and that it runs
for the default number of tests which is
a hundred and it passes a hundred tests
so we are a bit happier than that the
program does what it's supposed to do
okay so this is known stuff what's a bit
more interesting for proper is that you
can write either using you can write
generators i'll either using the
language of types of of generators that
it you have like that so this is another
property that says that for all messages
which are either binaries or lists of a
ski or ASCII characters then if you
encode and decode the message using the
base64 module over language EP then you
get essentially back the same message if
it's a binary it's the same message if
it's a list then decode always returns a
binary so
didn't design this interface but
basically that's what it does and you
can run this again for a hundred tests
or even more if you want and it will
actually satisfy it will not find any
counter examples of this property now
why am i showing you this is that what
this is what you would have to write if
you didn't have types and specs in your
program proper has a magic way of
actually taking a type declaration that
you might have in somewhere in your
program and turning that automatically
into a generator so you don't really
need to write all these generators
yourself provided that you have
annotated your airline program with
types so this is all stuff that I have
presented before so I'll go a bit fast
on these you can download the tool and
play with these examples i will show you
another example that's a very well-known
one in the area or actually in tutorials
and talks and i would show it because i
will use it afterwards as web service
and i have to show you this in Erlang so
that i show you then the analogous thing
as a web service so this is an
implementation of a list delete function
and it does these things it calls we
want to delete an extra man from at
least L we call an auxiliary function
with an accumulator and we do the
deletion with an accumulator and what we
can do here is we can write a property
that we might want to our function to
satisfy so this is the property and it
says that for all pairs of X's adele's
where X is an integer and L is a list of
integer if you delete the X from L then
x is not a member of this list anymore
so this is something that you would like
for a
undelete function to to hold a property
let's see in a leg in a demo whether
this holds for this delete
implementation so I will do the demo
right now I guess this one
I can think
so I load my simple and compiled my
simple props a module which has this
property and then I call proper quick
check on the simple props and i called
it prob delete oops and this property
fails after thirty two tests it has
found a element X and a list of integers
that contain this X but they contain it
twice and this is an implementation that
does not recursively delete things after
it has found the first element so there
is a discrepancy there either in the
implementation of the delete function or
in the property that we wrote so one of
these two these things don't match
perhaps the property is the one to blame
perhaps the implementation is the one to
blame what it will also does notice here
that it shrinks this test case to
something smaller it started with a list
of I don't know how many there were ten
say elements and it has shrank it to as
to a much smaller list that shows
exactly what the problem where the
problem is it's the minimal list that
shows the problem that it has it's a
list with two elements they are
identical and only one of them is
deleted by this delete function so
presumably the programmer can understand
the reason why the property is failing
much simpler in this simpler example a
test case than the complicated big one
that has tried so let me continue here
so this is what it does it shrinks
the previous time I tried this it failed
after 42 tests and I found it cute so I
put it there for you to see so the same
thing happens with improper with
recursive types suppose that you can
have a not a list which is a building
type in most property based testing
tools but some other user-defined type
and here is a relatively complicated one
which shows a binary tree which is also
parameterised by a type parameter and we
can write the same property for a
function that deletes an element from a
tree of elements of that type and we
expect back three of that type so what
this is the auxiliary joint function
that we have to write in the case where
we delete so we can again write a proper
to delete for this type of elements we
can just write it like that we don't
have to write anything complicated for a
generator for trees the tool knows
exactly how to generate automatically
trees given the type specification and
not only knows how to generate trees but
it also knows how to shrink trees and
you can see it here I will not show it
as a demo you can believe me that the
tool does that after 24 tests it has
found an example of deleting something
from a random tree and it has ranked
list with a minimum 3 that shows what
the prob where the problem is ok now
notice that this has happened
automatically we just didn't have to
write any con anything complicated for
the generator we just used here in this
tree
it will knows how to search for types
around it and generate proper generators
for them and do the shrinking
automatically okay so this is where we
are but this talk is not about property
based testing in general is about test
property based testing of web services
so i will start now talking about
testing of web services so in principle
is very similar to other forms of
software testing so what happens in web
services the in testing of web services
we are we need a way of to acquire a
valid input we need a way of invoking an
operation for the web service the web
service probably will do its service and
give us some output and then we need to
examine this output and declare whether
the output is correct or not so the
problem with this is that it's very much
it's a difficult operation because this
there is no the very few automatic ways
that this happens so typical is the user
that has to write how to acquire valid
inputs they have to write some typically
complicated programs that generate valid
inputs and this valid inputs have to
follow some specification and i will use
wsdl as the specification of web
services here the tool currently only
handles wsdl but it's pretty in
principle extended can be extended to
other specification languages if people
want them so then the automatic way is
to just invoke these operations the
difficult part is to how to generate
valid inputs then we can use some
existing framework that knows how to
communicate with the web service for
example use and invoke these operations
automatically but in the last part is
again user based
user has to check whether the output
that they get back from the web service
is correct according to their
expectations or to the specification of
the web service so we wanted to make
this more automatic so this is what we
have done so far we do proper testing of
web services and it's mostly automatic
and goes as follows unsurprisingly we
need a way to acquire valid input we
need a way to invoke the operations and
we need a way to examine this input okay
nothing much so far what the tool comes
and does is that it does automatic
generation of valid inputs it knows
exactly how to read the wsdl
specification it knows exactly how to
generate valid inputs from that end uses
the technology in proper to
automatically generate more and more
complex valid inputs for the web service
again the second part is not surprising
that happens automatically because you
could do it automatically in traditional
testing we use yours to invoke these
operations and then we need to examine
this input somehow and there it depends
on what sort of prop of testing you want
to do if you want to do just response
testing my webservice handles all valid
inputs we have an automatic way of doing
that we don't the user doesn't really
need to do anything if so for what we
call a response testing this is fully
the tool is fully fully automatic if you
want to do something more than that like
write some complicated properties and
check that this complicated properties
hold what you have to write the
properties the tool cannot figure out
properties on its own so but we are
going to see that it's very very simple
to actually extend the already given the
erratic automatically generate
infrastructure for response testing
to extend them to actually write
properties for the tool so here's how
the high level view of what we have done
looks like at the one end we have the
user and at the other end we have the
web service and the web server is
supposed to have currently a wsdl
specification of this web service so the
user just says go nothing really more
than that and has to write the URI of
this web service just just have to give
a URI so there is a gate URI request by
the tool this brings back the wsdl
specification and this wsdl
specification is split into two parts it
split into the types that the wsdl
specification contains and the
operations the types get past to xml and
xml knows how to parse these types and
gives back a past form of the types that
exist in the wsdl and then this part
form is fed into proper and proper then
nose automatically how to generate valid
inputs for these services based on the
types that they specify now the wsdl
doesn't contain only types it also
contains operations at the web service
supports and these operations are fed
into yours so proper generates now data
based on these types it and the hose
rights to the test file some in
information about the operations that
they are supported by the web service
and then this test file together with
the data they are fed back to yours and
your souls so sends soap tests to the
web service and gets back the responses
and the responses
they get back to fed into proper to
check whether for all the tests that
proper has automatically generated we
got back responses that make sense that
our core are valid that don't break the
web service so this is totally automatic
and this is the response testing part if
you want if the user wants to do more
than that to property based testing they
have to go and edit the test file that
has been automatically generated and
write just the properties all the rest
is there for the user sounds like magic
so let's see this in action actually
before that i will just describe a bit
about wsdl actually i don't know much
about wsdl so perhaps there are people
in the audience that known more about
wsdl that i do so excuse me if I say
something that isn't totally that's
totally wrong so a wsdl specification
contains all the necessary information
to invoke an operation it contains
information about ports that will be
used bindings messages parts and most
importantly for us it contains the types
that the web service is supposed to
handle and these types have information
they they are part of types xml tag and
they have simple primitive types like
integers long strings boolean and so on
the ones that you would expect if they
have aggregates like lists and unions
and they have complex types like
sequence choice and on and so on the
most frequent one is the sequence
complex type and they also contain types
that describe enumerations so the tool
knows exactly the semantics of these
things and has a not automatic way of
transforming these types in two types at
the Erlang language has and then proper
has a way
of this of translating these types that
the Erlang language has into generators
and shrinkers automatically so the wsdl
specifications look like this let's see
them because you cannot really expect to
be reading this stuff I will just focus
on various parts of it there is the
cooking's simple type which has this s
colon restriction base equals s color
string which makes a restriction of the
primitive type string and says that the
base is a string it has enumeration
types which have values and adds values
to the enumeration there is another
complex type declared there there were
two there is the change cooking unit
complex type which is a sequence and
it's a sequence of the nested elements
of this thing and these elements are
things that they will have a value of
type double that appears exactly once
this mean occurs and max occurs says how
many times this value has to occur so
since the mean is one and the max is one
the value has to occur exactly once in
this case there are examples where you
can have be no curse one and the max
occurs unbounded or something like that
I think and then it says that can be a
list of as many elements as you want so
we need a way also to invoke the web
services with yours and this can happen
with the soap library of yours it
contains a function called call would
you give it a URI of wsdl web
specification you give it an operation
that you want to invoke or to call and
you give it an the arguments and the
arguments actually is the problematic
part here you
up to they might become really really
complex when you want to call an op
specific operation and yours for reasons
that I don't really know it needs most
of the arguments to be converted to
strings but not all it has some strange
ways of doing that perhaps some jaws
developer can tell me why but anyway the
tool handles all these things and
actually if you try to do this by hand
I'm sure that if you have a complex wsdl
specification where large one writing
the input by hand will be very
error-prone you will not be able to
actually make proper general generators
for these things okay so how do we
automatically create generators we need
to pass somehow the wsdl specification
extract all the type information in the
way that i showed in the figure before
break the types into primitives handle
all the yo string conversions output
your jaws record as an HR l5 and now to
proper generators i will show you this
in a demo so the tool does all that
automatically you don't need to write
anything but just go okay so given the
previous example that I showed that the
cooking unit the unit cook the tool
automatically generates all this code
which looks hairy and terrible but what
this code does it has a generator for
the change cooking unit type which is a
complex let expression given three other
generators that will also automatically
generates given what the wsdl
description has
so this is all automatically generated
you don't need to write this or
understand this at all if you did not
want to if you don't do it by hand you
would have to write something analogous
and even carrier because you would not
even have the language of property based
testing tools so we can all you use all
that to do automatic response testing
and without doing anything really just
because the tool knows that when another
error occurs we get back a soap fault
message and we can just recognize the
shop fault message and say that hey your
web service doesn't handle input like
that because you have written some types
and the your operations don't handle all
the types of the input imagine doing
that by hand you would not be able to to
find all these inputs and we can
conservatively accept any other response
so without really knowing what the
response are we can do automatic testing
of whether we get some response back
okay in this case the property creation
is fully automatic so let's see this as
a demo in this part here what I will do
is I will compile a file called demo
don't know I would don't you don't need
to see this actually you will need to
see some other one so what is demo does
it just brings up a web service that i
have written so you just need to see
that it says yours listening to that to
that line to that port there for virtual
servers okay and this has brought up a
web service that i have written based on
a wsdl specification i will show you how
it looks
so the wsdl looks like this it has
various weird stuff this is the delete
example and this is what we would have
to write in wsdl for the built example
there are easier ways of generating this
I've done it with some tools but it's
hairy stuff there is also an x SD
thingee here which has this
specification the interesting part are
these two lines in the sequence there
under complex type and this list is a
list of integers it's can have length
from 12 unbounded and the element is an
X which is an integer and just to show
you that I'm not cheating I put the
other I've put them the other way around
the list first and the element second
while in the implementation that I've
done I do it I did it I use this yeah
yep in the example I showed in head lang
it was the other way around so this is a
different 1 i'm not using the same
example that I showed before so for
convenience I have my webservice
implemented inner line here but this is
actually not interesting and not
something that the tool cares about it
doesn't really matter if you are using
airline JavaScript your favorite
language to write your web service in
the toolies agnostic of that and can
control all the languages that you have
the choice of language does not matter
so and this is what you will have to
look here so let me start it again and I
have to cheat all I need to write is
this oops this line proper WS which is
the web service part of the web service
testing part of proper generate under a
file I have to give it a file name I can
it can be any file I want and the file
that it's a file where the wsdl
specification is it could be a URI and a
file that it wants it will generate all
the tests under that's all now what this
has done it has automatically generated
this proper WS might delete file
you can see that has changed it has
automatically generated now and it looks
like this this is automatically
generated code it has the generators for
lists it has generators for integers
because the integers in wsdl are not big
nums they are in specific ranges it has
a generator for the delete which has a
list and an element their generators
here for list generate delete L list and
generate delete LX for the list and the
element it has stuff automatically to
know how to call the delete and the
property here I can show in the in the
slide so that you see it in bigger font
what this property says that for all
change cooking units if I call now oops
not this is not one this is the property
sorry for the list delete we need to
generate delete arguments and pass them
with cold elite and get back some
response if we get the response that
says that there has been a fault then
the property is false otherwise no
matter what the response is it is not a
false the property holds that are not a
problem this property holds which is
just we got a valid response okay we got
a response back that made sense
I mouse does not collaborate so what I
can do now is I can compile this file
that has been generated this file also
has a associated header file that has
all the records it compiles let me copy
then paste it rather than writing it
because my type is terrible come on
and it has fed the web server with a
hundred different combinations of his
delete calls and the web server didn't
ever send a fault a soap fault so it it
looks like it's working let's call do it
again oops it's not working really this
is actually a bug in yours that I told
one of those maintainer to possibly fix
it tries to shrink it I can show you
exactly where it happens I think it
happens ok I will stop this because
doesn't really matter this is some case
in Jaws that is uncontrolled you get
back a message that has a some crash and
in if you go to your server line 3482
you will see there that there is a funny
comment let's see this demo or not demo
depths your source nas server line 34 82
or something like that ah it's this
amazing common egg yet another crash
user crash and it gets back this
internal error and actually something
he's not really properly handled in
Joe's yeah they will fix it I hope the
property is correct so this is so far
this is totally totally totally
automatic you just have to write a uri
and a file name that you need to
generate your proper tests I can show
you something more where we are now this
is the easy part it generates all the
stuff
automatically oops the tool you don't
have to write a single line of code
provided you have a valid wsdl
specification for your web service it
knows how to handle it go read it
generate generators for it generate
simple response like properties for for
it now perhaps you one of course what
happens here is you just test that your
server your web service handles all
requests nothing more there is no
semantics in here it doesn't really say
anything now if you want to do something
more than that if you want to do a
property-based testing you need to
actually what's what's happen here has
jumped if you want to do property based
testing you need to modify this slightly
but the modifications are really simple
you can take all the code that was
before everything that is in blue and
black is the thing that was before and
was automatically generated and you just
have to write your property so the
interesting part here for the list
delete is what will have written before
there is not a list if you delete
something from a list the ex that you
get back is not a member anymore now for
reasons that I don't really know you
also have to write this undefined case
because sometimes your returns back and
define stuff rather than just the return
I don't know why this happens but
sometimes you don't even get back lists
but and now you can test now this
property i will show you this i have
done it before and i have edited
manually this file and the only
difference between what i showed you
before is just these red lines
you can believe me on this right now
because I don't have enough time to show
it by doing it manually so oops let me
start it again from here there is a
another file called customize my delete
that is like the previous one but I have
added these two lines these two red
lines of code and now I can do a
property based testing of that of the
property that it all the x's are removed
and you can see now that my web service
that implements this service of deleting
elements from a list does not satisfy
this property that I was hoping that
would satisfy that my Navy
implementation of the office delete
deletes all the elements of the list so
now after 52 tests it has found a case
where this does not work it does
strengthen automatically and find you a
minimal test case for which the property
does not hold and you can see that this
is not the previous example that I
showed you because now i'm using the
list as the first element and the
element in the second part so i think
with this tool that will soon be part of
proper it's not yet the testing of web
services is considerably simplified
clearly it's very very nice that you can
do response testing of web services
automatically fully automatically you
don't have to write a single line of
code if you want to do something more
complicated than that you just have to
write the properties everything else
you get automatically it gets
automatically generated we are also
working into testing restful services I
don't have anything to report right now
on that we are just working on it more
info are will happen will appear sooner
a proper website if you are interested
in this try to check it out in some days
or so okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
