industrial on user group we are a group
of companies i use airline for
enterprise purposes and together we
together with member of the OTP team
here Lucas Russian and we represent the
OTP team from erickson to to bring to
you the latest news from the OTP so
Lucas will tell you about the technical
items focus area and what's on the maint
and master track and after that some bit
about the community side of the OTP so
yeah hi everybody so some of the things
we've been working on on the last year's
and going forward I have to have a look
at see what we're doing so we're
focusing a lot it's been a lot of
performers focus at the Allen gotta pee
team for the last year or so the kind of
customers that were been working with
and the kind of problems to very trying
to solve has been at the moment in
working on both in in both directions of
scaling so we've been working a lot of
small systems small embedded devices so
making the a language machine read a
really tiny in that sense and we're also
working with customers that are scaling
hugely into the cloud and getting the
virtual machine to work better in a
virtualized environment some of the
examples of the things that have come
out this is that we've been doing a
complete rewrite of the way that time is
handled in the LM virtual machine in
order to both improve scaling on huge
systems and in order to better deal with
software that's been printed onto the
hardware in the factories of things so
that we can deal with both of these
scenarios please come to my talk later
this done before lunch if you want to
get more details about that we're
continuing our work with making the
virtual machine more responsive by
making more travel to biffs we're
looking deeply at the car burst
collector to make it work better faster
all the good stuff in i think it was set
point two or something like that we
introduced something called eager check
ayah which is a feature where we can
more decrease the latency of your
inbound tcp UDP packets of what not when
they delivered into user space this
feature will be enabled by default in 18
I believe we're looking at ways to
reduce the amount of message passing
that the message copying that goes on in
the virtual machine so that you can do
message passing more efficient and we're
continuing on with the jet compilation
work that we've been doing now for four
years or something hopefully any year
now it would be done we hope so
specifically so i believe on wednesday
in four days time by this time there
will be a 17.5 release and yeah 31st of
march usually we keep those dates
nothing major happening just bug fixes
lots of user contribution as always and
we're very grateful for all of them
specifically we'll fix some bugs in the
crypto language since this ssl to make
that work and a lot of different
applications going to next one on the
master track we have some more
interesting things going on so i don't
know if you notice but all i think it
was on wednesday we pushed a the first
release candidate for 18 dot 0 that you
can go out and try we encourage you to
try it we release these things early in
order for us to detect backwards
incompatibility issues and also
performance issues with these things so
if you have the possibility please try
it and get back to us to see what is
working in so on we've made mistakes
before when it comes to backwards
compatibility and people not working
that we thought like I this is not a
problem it's no problem if you break
this but it turns out to be huge
problems for people so please get back
to us there will be another release
candidate and later on in May and so on
yeah in i guess the major things that
we've been working on for the master
track is to complete the implementation
of maps so we've had a back end for
larger Maps
I think they've been testing with
something like a couple of million of
keys in the maps and it seems to be
quite working quite nicely and also the
timing things as I said would be going
into that track yeah nice encrypted
changes that I don't know much about for
the long-term plans we're looking a lot
at virtualization at the moment so the
beam running inside some kind of virtual
machine abstracting away the hardware
things and there will be most probably
in 19 and 20 and so on coming a lot of
changes to make it work better and adapt
it better to that kind of environment
we're also most probably going to look
closer at the distribution the way that
works in order to get more of a
heterogeneous cluster up and running
where you don't have to have a photo
connected mesh and so on also
introspection in the virtual machine is
very important to us and we will most
probably add support for LTE TNG Linux
racing into the vm as well to complement
the system tap and D tray support we're
going to extend the build support so
that it becomes easier to build the
unlimited machine for really really tiny
devices as I said before we're working
about with small devices so in order to
integrate the battery in to build tools
such as yocto and so on to and to
stripped the allen bosh machine into its
minimum so that you can get it into a
two megabytes flash drive or whatever
you won't need a degree in their work on
documentation file i/o and so on is
ongoing so that's our focus area for the
next I don't know year two years and
then whatever other obstacles we bump
into to the road these plans tend to be
true until I step off the stage and then
they change so it's always different
things every week and also things are
happening around Ellen community the
English vol on user group set up a
community manager to set together with
the OTB team and we want to see improved
cooperation between the open source
community and what's up what's happening
outside of Ericsson
specifically we will have soon a
licensed change from the existing public
l on public license to Apache public
license version 2 and I think last week
or a couple of days ago can it's just
send out an email to all of the
contributors of airline OTP and it's
really important that all of the
contributors reply to that email so once
we have all the replies back we can go
on move on with the process and
hopefully we have the license change
with along with the 18 release and also
we're looking into a issue tracker to
replace the existing alarm box mailing
list it's one of the initiative of the
industrial and user group to improve the
interaction between open source
community and also the industrial our
user group is helping OTP team to look
into a package manager for a lie and
also the airline central website for the
community set up by the industrial and
user group in order to provide a place
for open source users to sort of a
better place for a long community out
there right and then a network a network
of trust which means OTP team wants to
extend the development in long run that
means to allow contributors from outside
to help with the development that means
better contributions and quicker
adoptions and so on I'd like to
introduce quickly about the industrial
on user group today we are ten
enterprise airline users and together we
want to secure the future health
well-being and commercial success
outside of Ericsson today were ten
airline companies and we plan
to growing numbers and hopefully when we
when we get to 20 members we transform
into a long software foundation from
there we can better support airline in
the long run and we are welcoming new
members to join so if you love by line
and you want to see the future success
of a lie please come to us and we are we
welcome new companies they join our
mission is three aspects we want to make
lr more open source a better interaction
with the community and we want to have a
better perception and image of airline
to be able to compete with other major
languages in 21st century and also the
technical road maps in terms of tools
libraries and productivity so that's the
industrial on youth group I hope to talk
to you during the jewelry in the day and
yeah that was the news from OTP team I
hope you have a good day in conference
in Long factory conference in questions
ok Simon sorry ok so we had a question
in the back how sophisticated is the JIT
thing you're working on compared to java
it's a baby in comparison you mean
they've spent more man years to know you
could dream of spending on doing this
it's it's in the working stages at the
moment we just want to have something
that it's an improvement on the way that
it works today and then we'll have to
build upon that the as far as i remember
the latest performance figures is that
it's somewhere just in the ballpark of
how what you get to a compiler system
something like that the really nice
thing
about it is that the way that it works
is that we can most probably just in
time compile the Biff's that we all
totally loved and talked about before so
that we can get the optimizations and
the code paths to work much better when
doing mathematics and so on and it
should be quite easily to extend to that
so it's a it's a very interesting piece
of technology I think and it shows quite
the great focus when it will be done I
have no idea I think it's about time it
should be I have one question there were
a lot of patches in the Watsa which
whatsapp have released are they slowly
being integrated the main branch the
ones that we can take without breaking
backwards but compatibility I believe we
have taken already all the ones that
we've looked at so far I have some
specific features that are good for
their system but cannot be applied in a
general sense of things with these
timing time changes now one of the large
big bottlenecks in the virtual machine
that they fixed have been fixed as far
as I remember I don't remember all of
them by heart but that's my
understanding of it anyway and they have
some other patches in the niche and so
on that I don't understand or know about
but I think we've taken the ones that we
can at the moment Kenji yeah one of the
things I have to make a comment come
here I I'd work to Lucas to the OTP team
is that please make 17-point 4.12
release or something like that if you're
thinking it's really improvement not
just a get tagged please one of the one
of my friends on Oh Jimmy organic foods
the maintainer of the freebsd ports of
iron has the difficulties on was I
making those making making his port
stuff from non-official get stuff get
get like builds so please do make all
those release those who passed the races
as the true races
and I hope the this process will be
improved on their 18 point 18 thank you
I think if you want to have that then
it's an excellent opportunity for the
open source community to do that I don't
think that the minor releases and so on
we will publish them on the website
having said that I'm not involved in
that process so I don't know it might
happen but it's a perfectly it's very
easy to do then do the scripting it just
it for us getting it pushing a get
tagged it's no work getting the release
i can and so on because we have quite
high verification requirements on when
we do these releases okay okay Simon had
small announced both ways thank you
sorry it's not a question it was an
announcement we're doing some work at
Kent to try and move the university into
the 21st century and so build some
e-learning for arm for Erlang we've got
some members of the community of
recorded some master classes which I
hope we're going to release quite soon
but in particular we've got the draft of
a beta version of a MOOC for Erlang
which we like some some beta testers it
from the community to join in we're
going to run it's not it's neither n or
oh so it's an awk if you like it's an
online course which will cover probably
the functional part of Erlang not the
whole thing for this arm for this pilot
will be a three-week pilot in the second
half of May if you have if you yourself
or you have colleagues want to learn
about ur line from scratch and be part
of this please let me know my email is s
JT at Kent AC UK I'm around today we're
looking for between 10 and 20 people to
take part in this and then we hopefully
can produce a really good massive open
online course for Erlang to try and and
and match what people have got four
Scala and other languages so do do join
but it is it is a beta so it'll be a
little bit of a rocky road but we hope
that your participation can help us
produce a really very good course thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
