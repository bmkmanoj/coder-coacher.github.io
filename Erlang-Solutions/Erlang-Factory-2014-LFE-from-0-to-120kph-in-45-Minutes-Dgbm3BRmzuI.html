thank everyone to coming to something
that is not whatsapp there's also a
half-scale tutorial happening right now
okay so LFE this is one of the more
exotic and lesser-known parts of the
airline community I want to go over
there just very briefly what you're
gonna be seeing the ground we're gonna
cover during this talk there's a bunch
of things I want to cover gonna try and
cram it all in here I'll try to leave
time for questions as well it's not all
code I want to give a little bit of
background on Lisp and you know why
would you want to use Lisp the
historical context for this I want to
show you what it looks like and get a
sense of the language itself
syntactically and then maybe we can take
it for a little Drive if we have time I
hope to show you some larger projects
and what those look like in LFE and then
there's things I didn't get a chance to
dive into and some tantalizing things
that I'd like to touch on at the very
end and then of course we'll do a quick
summary it's a big question everybody
always asks is Wireless and there's lots
of discussion about this in any list
book you you buy they will devote like
the first several chapters sometimes to
why Lisp this is a fairly as a result of
the AI winter this became something that
people don't they had to do every time a
list book came out
you don't hear as many complaints as you
used to about Lisp
it has become quite quite popular
recently but you know still I should
answer the question why are we looking
at it this is a 50 year old piece of
technology 1958 and a lots happened in
that time we're looking at 50s 60s 70s
and of course the 80s the infamous 80s
what does this have to do is our second
oldest programming language currently
and use and what is it
to do with the modern world do we even
need it you've seen things with Ruby and
Python and Perl taking over the the
space where Lisp used to dominate where
he didn't have to have a compiled
language not by the way that slide was
from a a presentation was given on high
which is a Python flavored Lisp
Alan Kay said some beautiful things
about Lisp there's a nice quotes here
the power of scripting languages which
Lisp really had a stronghold in the in
the 70s and 80s is in their specificity
it's kind of like a DSL for programmers
who think in a very particular way but
Lisp is actually a bit of a different
beast it can suit that purpose because
it can suit essentially any purpose but
its power comes from the other end of
the spectrum it's a tool for the
generalist it allows generalists to
design and create the things that they
need
Allen Kay's fantastic summary is that
the the code that he was referring to
and page 13 and the list 1.5 manual is
that in half a page you have something
that can describe the entire language
itself and he refers to these as you can
see is Maxwell's equations for for
software and that's that's quite
beautiful
he also references it as something he
could put its hand over and interesting
ly enough that's the same sort of
metaphor you hear a parent talking about
the miracle their newborn child here is
the first half and this second slide is
the second half of that code note that
this is actually M expressions and
knotless proper Lisp was originally
thought John McCarthy wanted to actually
have a nice algal like implementation of
Lists but people got so into the S
expression ast part of it that they
never want anything else back up there
real quick Brian Hayes this is from an
article called the semicolon Wars and he
a great quote there it's not the
original quote I actually rearranged it
so that it would be functionally correct
so you have to read it from the bottom
up but yeah he said what the world needs
I think is not a list with fewer
parentheses but in English with more but
people are always complaining about the
parentheses I can tell you parentheses
blindness happens within two to four
weeks so just give it some time
but you know on airline really so Robert
had a great quote and a blog post and he
says yes I have implemented another
syntax front-end for airline but it is a
list base it's quite a natural thing to
do this has such a simple and powerful
syntax so how could I not do it and it
skips past all the rhetoric and just
gets right to this experimental
scientist in all of us why not let's try
it not yet because before we dive into
LFE I want to explore a little bit wider
context with you that's how we got to
LFA this was not the year that Lisp was
invented that was 1958 but this is when
it got its interpreter John McCarthy and
some of his grad students I've been
hacking for about four years and and
someone had this brilliant idea of
putting together I'm pretty sure this
was the year I might be mistaken but I'm
pretty sure this is the year they got
the interpreter going and that was
essentially the unofficial death of any
future for mmm expressions but what else
was going on in 62 oops did I do
something
huh
okay just to this is what we were
driving I might have lost my speaker
notes here hang on bear with me and that
is actually a Volvo p1800 it was a very
sporty thing and
okay back and running so that's what we
were driving what were we wearing
nice this is how we were computing it's
an IBM 704 and all of its massive glory
bestsellers list another bestsellers
list so in the world of list 62 we just
published the 1.5 manual within a year
list was implemented on a PDP one and
they were already doing AI problems that
was the whole purpose of what McCarthy
had wanted to do was really solve some
of the tricky AI problems to give you a
sense of scale this is a very different
technological world and the one we live
in now ENIAC I was a press sensation and
1946 computing had lived by this point
computing had lives in the minds of the
public for only 16 years like all of
computing univac the first successful
computer commercial computer had shipped
in 1951 which is seven years before list
was conceived and IBM's first a
mainframe the 700 series shipped a year
later and so this is just shortly after
this time period everything was new and
Brian's tweeting okay come back
it's okay right
so the 704 Lisp was implemented on this
who was billed as a for 40,000
instruction per second machine there
were about 10,000 computers on earth at
this time which works out to six point
seven times ten to the negative
seventeenth instructions per second per
kilogram of planet if you were to
convert this to length you'd be looking
at about seven atom eaters and that is
the around the same length that you have
with a nuclear weak force so we were
down in the tiny tiny Planck scale jump
ahead twenty-five years later the birth
of airline 1986 this is what we were
driving I'm sure a ball of phones he was
wearing this and look who he should have
made the cover of a magazine this is
what we were computing with just about
ready to fall from grace the rise of the
Clones was happening and I couldn't find
a picture of a 750 because airline was
actually implemented on a 750 but this
is as close as I could get and in fact
it was implemented on a fax 750 running
bsd unix it had 16 megabytes of ram and
to 512 megabyte discs I had asked Joe
about that and Joe had to actually ask
Mike so this is what we were reading and
the very famous common list by guy
Steele was a came out right around this
time and this is what we were writing
you can't see it at this distance but
this is the first version of air Lange
itself the world of Lisp things have
really blossomed this was essentially
the time when when the list machines
were taking over everybody was doing a
list machine Texas Instruments was into
it they had licensed it from I forget if
it's just symbolic sir list machine e
and Cal he was alum I they we had an
operating system compiler and network
server editor all this stuff and Lisp
itself the a our winter hadn't set in is
still three years away
listen bollocks calm they were the first
registered domain on the Internet
okay sense of scale 86 we're looking at
of Acts 11 753 1 million computers on
earth just 25 years later this gives us
that great figure 5.2 times 10 to the
negative 12 instructions per second per
kilogram of planet and this is about
five picometers which is converted to
length we're looking at the radius of a
helium atom so you can head again ten
years after the AI winter let's started
making headlines at this point this time
period saw the birth of LFE and as well
as closure haskell had a version of lisp
as well
we were driving driving nicer nicer cars
vogue look at L this is what we were
wearing them to and this is what Lisp
was are running on I think it's the XPS
right Robert yeah okay so Dell XPS a
long way from the 704 IBM 704 and the
VAX 750 this believe it or not was on
the best sellers list so literature had
reached new heights and I have not read
this one yet but it's on my list so some
of us are reading this this came out so
the world of Lisp was quite huge during
this time a lot of changes I'm gonna
skip past a lot of this but there in the
slides if you wanna go back later
quite impressive I only scratched the
surface here there's three slides of
major bullet points that happened during
this period the last one is for us here
it's Robert
and in fact err lying and lf-ii had
influenced the scheme community and they
had produced the gap gambits had
produced termite which was based on
lightweight threads and
sense of scale huge changes the
processors have made great strides 1
billion pcs almost 300 million
smartphones 1.3 times 10 to the negative
5th instructions per second per kilogram
of planet and that brings us into the
micrometer range this is the typical
size of fog or a cloud water droplet
just a few years later six years but a
lots happened as big as it was in 2008
for Lister's it was it's been even
bigger since then we see there's a yeah
there's a lot lots of big things the
previous slides I'd mentioned Heller's
an acquisition by Google for a list of
company lots of things going on cores
are everywhere so in these six years
with all these changes we are seeing a
completely different world
we're now at this the size of human hair
or bacterium as far as that and the
analogy to length goes and this is kind
of mind-blowing in 50 years we have seen
this change that has taken us from
something an equivalent of the planks at
the flank scale all the way up to living
organisms
that's something the universe took 13
billion years to do that's a big change
very different world is it still a world
for Lisp
this was born three years after the
death of ENIAC it's been with us from
the start we can't kill it there's been
a lot of attempts to dead simple syntax
the beauty of lists for me is its home
electronic what got me into lists
originally was genetic programming and
the homogeneous ad allows you to do some
really phenomenal things with generating
programs and of course as everybody
knows you can quite literally write a
compiler in the morning a DSL in the
afternoon and it is the candy store a
syntactic sugars I've been really
resisting the urge but I have already
two macros that give us some nice and
active sugar an LFA and it really this
is a common phrase you'll hear is it's
an ultimate language lab YLF e for Lisp
use the actor model you've always wanted
it and you know it OTP for Ehlinger
that's a little bit different question
got it yeah gotta play the fun card
little syntax change is always nice but
you don't have to lose your platform you
don't have to go to closure and learn
all the JVM you can still play with a
lisp and stay right at home now we
finally get to see some LFE you've got
the backstory so here's what numbers
look like different bases operations on
them is this legible I can't really zoom
so I apologize if it's not okay
atoms and strings very straightforward
borrowing from Common Lisp pure
bit packing this was taken from Joe
Armstrong's book I hope I got that right
I'm pretty sure it was in his book where
this example was that's the packing
unpacking you can see there's some
pattern matching taking place in the let
lists this is the bread and butter of
Lister's so this is how you mean to
manipulate them using you can see the
calls into airline itself more list
manipulation the famous car and Qatar
Qatar to deter cons records you can use
airline records
this is a setting the creative new
person record setting some data on it
changing some stuff which of course is
not mutable and pattern matching there's
a bunch of these are going to zip right
through them but this is a standard let
let has been modified and lf-ii to allow
for pattern matching so if you're
familiar with lets you can see there's
an extra little structure in there to
accommodate the data assignment and
these cascade through the rest of these
various forms case cond
def fun and if you have a function with
here that want to get this right the
same arity like you can airline you can
create multiple functions with the same
arity and lf-ii what you do is you
actually create a block like this where
if you have a function where you want to
define match across a pattern with
different era T's you do it in the same
function and so this would be an example
of that you can't actually as far as I'm
recalling you can't actually do multiple
functions of the same arity right okay
Roberts got a little frown so I'm I can
say something a little bit wrong gosh
this was the this is the one who finally
sold me over to LF he was being able to
do the the message passing in this case
it was so clean and I'd seen a lot of
stuff in various lists that were trying
to do what airline was doing and this
was just absolutely phenomenal quite
beautiful and I was hooked after I saw
this example macros this one actually
lets lets us do very closure like you
know unit tests in LFA a very simple
macro and again this is what you would
have normally without this macro and
over there you can see a little bit of
sugar you don't have to do the
boilerplate under test and look on the
parens similarly if you want to be able
to like this is from a project that
defines HTML elements using s
expressions and it generates three arity
functions in the macro simple as you can
be and you have all the possibilities
you can to
your HTML and has expressions the church
numerals quick little glimpse this is
from the examples in the source code LFE
source code and again these this one and
the following one are also HTTP async
requests uses plist to gather the
results bi-directional messages and of
course we all know this alfie runs on
airline and this is a piece of the
airline code and lf-ii that I was
digging into recently adding some more
macros I will explain this very very
briefly and partially incorrectly but
this is Ella fees ast syntax basically
in airline lists defining Lisp macros
used with records that are also using
airline macros so Joe dog I heard you'd
like meta so I got meta for your meta
this is what airline looks like inside
LFA and it's fairly easy to hack on
let's take it for a drive if you really
want to get to know LFE the next logical
step is to create a project with it and
can't just jump right into that I got to
tell you about the dependencies they're
not too long I suggest curl
I like curl lets you do multiple
parallel inversions on the same platform
without having it mess with you know
rebar is going to be absolutely
essential for right now all the LFE
examples and that we've put together the
project that we put together use rebar
itself very very easy to get up and
running with just a quick download LFE
obviously but if you're using the
standard tools then you'd have to worry
about this l if you will be downloaded
for you and there's a new tool put
together called LFE tool and i'll show
you that right here so here's an example
if you want to run scripts that's the
first thing I look at is scripts you're
going to want to have LFE installed
system-wide if you don't think you will
ever use scripts and don't worry about
it you don't have to install LFE you'll
just use LFE as its downloaded in rebar
and so if you want to if you want to do
the script thing download it set the
environment
variables install elevates your whatever
been director you prefer get LFE tool
install it and you can do an update it
updates itself if you have it installed
and so yeah now we'll take a look at
what you can do with this and these are
the different options were gonna explore
very quickly creating a script running
up creating a library to service this is
as simple as it is to create an LFE
script run it through the lfyou tool
it's going to generate the script for
you this this scripts that it generates
is actually out of the examples in LFE
pass it that's a Fibonacci pass at 40 to
get your response back plain and simple
this is what the script looks like it's
generated it's got the hashbang some
options you can set I think I can scroll
to the bottom here just a little bit
more usage fairly straightforward
okay and when it alright to the next
step I created a library library
projects have a hold that what's a
single file and this is it creates a
subdirectory with subdirectories and and
all the appropriate files for for
getting started and by library I mean
airline code you're not actually calling
gems your answer and stuff something to
be used and imported in another project
the filtered after that we run the tool
new library my libs these are the files
that exist taking a look at some of the
code here's some broken code that is
inserted intentionally so that when you
run your unit tests this what unit test
will fail TDD from the start and
creating a service very similar instead
of library you say Lib tool new service
BAM here's your new new OTP service it's
a lot of boilerplate here's a quick look
at some of the my service lfyou file and
here's the API section of the server
file and the full the you you run this
and you actually have a functioning OTP
app and you can take it for its paces
here make a couple of calls and reports
the output as it is defining the API the
little test API so if you want to run an
OTP service very very quick and easy in
LFE so that's what l if it looks like
let's see what looks like in a bigger
context using a low fee tool will create
a new project called cloudy we're gonna
use Amazon's web services first so we
add a new dependency update your rebar
tool I'm sorry your reball rebar config
file the right now you have to manually
update you the make file with your new
dependencies
I have plans to create a series of rebar
plugins in LFE that'll do this stuff for
you for now update your make file divine
you run the script create your your tool
officer LFE tool create your code and
now you just go in here and
the the file that's created for you
klaudia LFE add your implementation and
that just makes calls out to it AWS pick
shell you're running into the repla
right now slurp in the file that you
just add the function to pick a an ami
for Amazon and tell it to run that
instance you get a response back with
all the metadata and to double check
take a hop over to your console your AWS
console and there you see the instance
running again from here the world is
yours you know what to do on AWS make
all the changes configurations you want
create an image that has a stuff
pre-installed and you are off and
running with the production instance of
air lang and lf-ii Rackspace cloud
competitor very very similar situation
there's there was no SDK for air Lang or
obviously LFE for this presentation so I
just simply started creating one it's
partial implementation lets you create
instances so far deletes maybe not but
basically enough for this demonstration
make the changes to your your make file
also yeah you need to have this actually
includes jiffy and so jiffy for right
now I haven't found out why but jiffy
needs an extra compile run inside the
project directory itself so you update
the make file target here to do so then
just like we did for AWS we create a
little function here that's going to
make your instance and the Rackspace
Cloud it is a little bit more verbose
but because Rackspace does not assume
that you are using a particular region
it makes it fairly easy for you to swap
out regions whereas AWS code is a little
more cumbersome in that regard jump any
ripple make the request please turn on
this instance and bam you get your nice
- OH - popover to check your console and
sure enough there it is running same
story from here you can create your own
images make everything spin up so we've
just enter faced with two cloud
instances we
how to essentially with whatever
configuration management system using we
know how to push LFE code and airline
code into the cloud we can run these OTP
applications what might rerun let's say
you want to build an SOA restful
services can you do this with LFE
absolutely you wouldn't believe how
simple it is we're gonna use Yas here
dead simple and it's awesome I love it
Yas was actually my first experience
with airline back in 2006 I think was
when I read that blog post that blew
everybody's minds the comparison that
patchy again I'll take your dependencies
update the target you need to free oz
needs a couple of directories you create
some directories that you need create a
configuration configuration local
directory etsy.com
and then awliyas really needs is to
integrate is you need to define an
outcome that takes a single parameter
that's it
and a story the rest is just reading the
docs on what sort of content types you
want to return that sort of thing so
we've created something simple here
we're basically going to extract the
path info for our arrest path info and
Method then we define some function for
routes you know was a this is the
classic coffee shop example converted
for Volvo's you know given the theme
here so order with no ID order with with
a with ninety actually passed orders to
get a whole list of orders and then
payment orders that you're an order that
you are going to operate for a payment
it's it's a classic example I think most
anybody that's unrest is seeing this
example and on the web each route here
makes a call to an API function and
here's the example of the API function
for order with no parameter order with
an order ID additional arguments that
aren't used or passed here and you can
see it's doing that pattern matching
against what your HTTP verb was get put
delete likewise for orders if you want
to check the status of all the orders we
get a list of all orders they're pending
and then
payment API get input these are just
utility functions implemented to help
support this these are this is all
running code by the way if you go to
obi-wan on github and do go and slash
cloudy this all this code base is there
it actually runs you can check it out
for yourself
we've the make target that we created
for writing up as dev server go ahead
and fire it off and then let's just walk
through and make sure that the that the
that all the code you saw that's all it
takes and make sure everything there is
running run curl against the the various
endpoints and bam here we go data you
just made a new order I got the status
for you new order you've updated the
order with a put you're getting a list
of orders payments getting the payment
paid for an order delete the order now
that you have to pay and you've got your
Volvo okay so I'll look start to get to
the Amazon Rackspace instances was a
couple of functions this is barely
scratching the surface there's a lot
more to do there but likewise the rest
server side ant the rest were dead
simple again there's a lot more to cover
there obviously the implementations
calling out the data sources and whatnot
but you got the idea I I had planned
originally to dive in a little bit more
deeply there's some areas of exploration
that I wanted to cover and didn't quite
have enough time but I wouldn't mind
chatting about that right now and the
first of these that I wanted to cover
was hierarchical task networks this is
going back to AI and these guys are sort
of like the new planner if you guys are
familiar with planners from the 70s and
a little bit in the 80s Alan Kay has
talked about these Brett vector if
you've seen that the future of
programming video he did at the Dropbox
conference last year's also talked about
this and they have this dream the world
without api's what does that mean
submitting goals to a service goal
oriented programming and letting these
services behind the scenes do the
calculations and say oh these are the
steps that are sorry these are the goals
let me calculate what the steps are
necessary to meet those goals and this
is computers talk to each other if
you've seen the Alan Kay video he's like
doing all these like computers should
just be talking to each other
programmers no longer having a need to
use api's when talking to services kind
of a mind-blowing concept the first step
would be humans not having to program
api's but the steps after that are
actually services that can talk to each
other do auto discovery and eventually
we could get to the point where you do
not have the vast overheads and services
communication development can can focus
on other areas this is not actually a
pipe dream UMD university of maryland
wrote an award-winning HTN in 2002 and
common lisp they've recently done a
python version it's pretty ok but a
little bit lobotomized
I've got an LFA implementation that is
like 90% done I'm wait to get the extra
10% I'm gonna go back and rewrite the
whole thing from what I've learned but
this is Maryland's this is all stuff
this is what it looks like an LFA when
you just run the the goals I've got a
couple of bugs in this and then I'll be
ready to release it so that that's a
fascinating area of exploration and
there's a lot of interesting things to
do there with services talking to each
other rebar plugins started hacking on
this stuff for this talk as well I
wanted to get something interesting but
I only have a few dead simple examples
you can actually write rebar plugins in
LFE right now this particular rebar
plugin does this it makes sure that
anything that you are going to run only
happens in your in your actual project
directory it's a little bit trickier
than what you might imagine because by
default rebar runs across all depths and
the current directory this does the
inverse this code right here as you can
see with a swap between true or false it
runs in every single directory you can
spend the output besides your current
project directory and again very useful
things when you run a want to run dev
sprinkling things I'm a
files or not have to use make files
another project that I started building
a rest client again this is all you
would not believe the amount of the act
shaving I did for this presentation
building arrest clients this is already
done I wanted to do something with neo4j
database so and I already written the
Rackspace and the OpenStack clients so I
started pulling out code into a common
library LFE rest client yeah I've
already converted one of the libraries
to use it more to come genetic
algorithms is what got me started in the
first place and in fact this probably
genetic programming is a better way to
say edge and I gala rhythms technically
is the string manipulation but it's
there isomorphic you're manipulating
programs instead of strings Robert and I
actually chatted about this a while ago
and I showed him some example code he
was helping me debug some of that I
don't know about a year ago or so there
is a huge amount of work that's been
done with TAS and GP Jeff Kouzes sorry
john Kouzes the most famous for this
he's got literally volumes of the stuff
i've got his first volume it's about
this thick and I've made it through
maybe two or three hundred pages lots of
stuff to mine people just haven't even
seen anywhere and then the real world
almost all the examples are written in
list again houma like Anisa t and this
is the part that intrigues me most like
we could actually do many lab scientific
programming using distributed
distributed processes from from airline
and that's what drama it draws me to air
lying and the ability to run these
things so quick examples i actually do
have some code that's working right now
this is all a randomly generated code I
don't have the fitness functions done
yet partially implemented replacing
nodes none of that's done crossovers
this all stuff I have to do evaluating
generations so I've got some time just a
little bit
cover the lots Lisp is it so interesting
how we got to LFE taking a look at
itself you
loved it right took it first been racing
him with bigger projects and a little
bit off over there with the research
projects I want to act a little bit
philosophical and closing and I hope you
forgive me for this but modern computing
started with the war we proposed
violence as a solution to violence we
were working with very very powerful
tools code that can modify itself
systems that can spin up processes
across the entire entire globe like you
guys if you guys have seen that blog
post by Joe Armstrong where he just put
up all these air link processes on on
planet net extraordinary concepts home
iconicity the actor/model meta
programming we can actually take a
different path than what we started with
we can rewrite our own history one of
the early research not early I guess
middling researchers in the actor model
in concurrency was gulaka and you wrote
a dissertation for his PhD in 1985 it's
just brilliant he is currently a
professor at illinois urbana start his
career at MIT and switched to Michigan
when his professors moved over there
throughout his studies he was left with
a deep impression regarding the power of
this particular model of distributed
computing the actor model blew him away
inspired by colors Carl Hewitt as you
might imagine he's got some great quotes
from his preface and this is the
philosophical part and he made some
great observations and made an
altruistic plea that resonates again he
talked about the power of computing the
possibilities that that come out of all
this incredible stuff and he noted our
history and this is the quote some well
somehow we have to develop an ethic the
values compassion rather than
consumption to acquire reverence for
life itself and his vision is unusual
but it's compelling especially given the
context of our industry's early
beginnings and our future is open source
and
this is how I think we can accomplish
the goals he was looking at in 85 the
open-source community was barely barely
there a lot of stuff from MIT had spread
out across the globe but nobody had like
solidly to find it and working together
as we are with conferences like this
we're actually helping this guy's dream
come true lisps make great language labs
distributed fault tolerant platforms are
precious precious things we're heading
down the road towards incredible
complexity in computing emergent systems
are the next step and my plug for LFE we
get lisp we get airline we get the
language lab and we get a distributed
systems labs perfect combination go make
something awesome this is my contact
info LFE sorry mine and thank you any
questions Roberts here so he can answer
all of them
okay the question was why use some of
the syntax that is present for for
instance calling to airline that is
actually a Robert question
it was the most convenient way to as far
as I recall to actually be able to make
those calls into and it's not the fun
call the fun call and apply can both be
done outside of that and you actually do
have to if you're in the repple and you
can't yet robert's working on stuff
where we can define functions and
machers in the repla but right now you
can't so you define a lambda and you can
just do a phone call in the lambda that
you define on the repple assume for
apply if you want to in macros if you
want to like do the back quote sorry the
unquote list you know you can do the
apply with all those but Robert if you
if you wouldn't mind
I've thought about that
thank you
and and the airline food the LFE airline
code that does that the parsing is very
easy because it sees that form as a
colon and yeah just Falls right now
there's a question over here was it you
Brian yes so the question was it's
possible to call two airline from LFE
can you do the reverse and yes you can
the standard syntax are the the
convention and less common lisp is to
use hyphens and names so this doesn't
actually work for atoms you actually
have to quote atoms you actually quotes
your atoms they're module names are
atoms you quote them single quote an
arrow and airline proper and you can
actually do the call so I've actually
run LFE libraries I've created and
straight-up airline and just by doing
that sort of thing science you have it
looks a little bit funny when you have
names with hyphens in them but a little
more verbose but the questions
right yes that's an excellent question
I'm probably not the right person to
answer that however have you seen the
Joe Armstrong's blog post about elixir
and how he found it very inspiring so I
think that that is already happening
with elixir and in fact liquor was
originally inspired by LFE I think he
made some commits to early commenced to
LFE itself I was a dead
Robert has recently taught a course on
elixir and or prepared one and will be
teaching and he's actually got some new
ideas for LFE based on the stuff that
has been done in a lick sir I would
imagine with the cross-pollination
happening here that we're gonna see more
and more of that but that's an
optimistic personal view excellent well
thank you very much
