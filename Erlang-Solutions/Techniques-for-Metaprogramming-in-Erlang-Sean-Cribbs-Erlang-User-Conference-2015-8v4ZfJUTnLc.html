this talk this wasn't the title and at
the last section of this talk will get
to what the actual original point of
this was but there is a lot of talk
about meta programming in list flavored
Erlang and elixir and how easy it is and
how you know amazing it is and i kind of
wanted to show you that actually meta
programming isn't that well it is
complicated it can be complicated but it
is accessible ok so a little about me
i'm currently senior principal engineer
at comcast cable the technology and
product division i'm in a team called
cap as the abbreviation for it that is
an intentional backronym but we build
infrastructure software for basically
the largest cable and internet and media
provider in the United States formerly I
was a technical lead for react at bosch
oh I basically touch every part of the
product at one point to another in my
five years at boccio and in but way back
in 2009 I created neotoma which is a
packrat parser toolkit and uses parsing
expression grammars and if you don't
know what those mean that's okay we'll
talk a little bit about it later but
basically the last time I talked at an
erlang specific conference was about
neotoma in 2010 so I'm glad to be back
so a little background what are we doing
with meta programming what even is meta
programming meta para is basically code
that writes code so um in before i came
to Erlang i was in ruby and we used to
say that meta programming is just
programming well it isn't relying too
but the other thing that paramedic
program might be concerned with is
treating programs as data so taking a
program making a data structure out of
it and manipulating it into a new
program so these are essentially the
same thing but they have a little
different perspective on on what meta
programming is if you are able to treat
programs as data and you can even
farther you might have what they call
reflection reflexivity which is
basically your program
is able to inspect itself and modify
itself and then there's the whole idea
of homo iconicity which the data
structures you work with are the same as
your program structure so those are
little flavors on programs as data and
there are many ways to do meta
programming but a lot of it depends on
when you're trying to do the meta
programming some systems like that are
basically open runtimes like Python and
Ruby I'll let you do meta programming at
runtime so you can go in and modify
classes and objects and other aspects of
the runtime system at runtime very
easily but inner lying were mostly
focused on compile time even if you were
loading a new module into the code
server when your meta programming you're
still compiling it first so i would say
Moke for the most part everything is
meta programming is that compile time
other systems that do compile-time meta
programming for example if you've used
C++ Java has some reflection but I will
also allow you via templates and stuff
like that to do a compile-time
metaprogramming so why would you even
want to meta program you might want to
reduce duplication in your programs so
if you're doing something that's very
repetitive and potentially noisy and you
want to clarify what what your your
program is doing you might you might
want to use meta programming another
thing you can do is inject optimization
after you've written the program so you
can rewrite the program so that it uses
a more efficient algorithm a lot of meta
programming opportunities interlining
simplify existing api's so they'll put a
little shorter wrapper around a more
complicated concept than can be thought
about as in an abstract unit a lot of
tooling for example if you've already
used macros which we'll talk about first
if you pass and you know at define a
macro you can switch things at compile
time so we'll talk a little bit about
that and of course implementing dsl is
like one of the most famous dsl's at
least for me is a quick tech which has
the for all macro and the lazy macro and
all those things but you can also
implement dsl's that are actually valid
Erlang syntax and don't use the
preprocessor so we'll look at at all
those
so what are the stages at which you
could met a program there are lots of
them I'm not going to talk about all of
them but essentially this is your your
diagram and it's a light my apologies
it's a diagram of the pathway from the
source file of your airline code down to
the actual runtime so at first the
source is tokenized by the scanner and
then it's parsed well you have I skipped
a section there where the preprocessor
comes in essentially it's parsed in the
abstract form and you have a syntax tree
of your program and then you can either
compile that program or if it's maybe an
expression and it's not an entire
program you could evaluate it or once
it's compiled you could load it and then
you have that code available in the
runtime so those are all the the solid
arrows in this diagram the dashed arrows
are where most of the meta programming
happens so for example the preprocessor
will do rewrites over tokens at the
second stage if you wanted to be really
simple about how you're doing your meta
programming you might just treat your
program source file as a template and
substitute things in the middle so that
will be working with the source level
and obviously the abstract form you can
transform the syntax tree into a new
syntax tree or you can actually take a
transformed or a real syntax tree root
original syntax tree and print to print
it back to source so there's all sorts
of directions you can go with meta
programming here ok so let's talk about
the first technique that I want to cover
which is macros macros are really
familiar to most of relying programmers
they're used all over the place but
essentially it generates code in the
preprocessor and I say it operates over
tokens mostly the other day I was
reading the preprocessor and I was like
yeah it's kind of like going across the
tokens and then when it hits a token
that's a macro goes okay I need to think
about this and rewrite some things there
is some like some part of it that looks
like it's doing some some tactical
analysis like very minor some tactical
analysis but for the most part it's just
read a token and then expand that token
if it needs to so a typical thing like
we did this all the time and react if we
want to have a constant that's a default
you might define it as a
so you could define a static term as a
macro and in that case you know I'm
using all caps you don't have to use all
caps and macros but you say dash define
given the name in macro and then the
value which is an eight you're lying
term and that Erlang term becomes a
token or a set of tokens that the
preprocessor will insert into wherever
you refer that macro you can also pass
parameters to Mac macros so this first
one wraps whatever expression is handed
to it inside an anonymous function so
this is sort of like a lazy evaluation
type of macro and you know so you get an
anonymous function which you can call
later which will return the value of
that expression and there's this one
that I lifted from me unit which will
also talk about in a minute which has a
thing that looks like if so if you're
used to if you came too early and you
need to do testing with a unit and you
were used to using if then else if the
if macro kind of gives you something
that looks like that and then the other
thing that that is interesting about
macros is you actually take the
parameters to the macro and escape them
so this basically takes the tokens it's
given and turns it back into a string
and this is really useful when you want
to inspect what a macro is doing so in
this case my quote macro actually just
takes the argument that it's given and
turns that argument that list of tokens
in the argument into a string and then
you say i owe live format you know it
prints it as a string okay so how we
might we use these this is a pretty
familiar thing we're doing a gen server
call and we use the module macro which
is defined it defined by the
preprocessor and to the current module
being compiled and then we use that
constant time out and this gets expanded
to Jen sort of a call my module being
5000 ok that's pretty straight forward
substitution now if we want to launch
the missiles but we're not sure yet we
might want to wrap that in a thunk so
this will expand to a fun that has that
expression inside it so that's a
parametrized macro and then finally the
quoted macro the the escaped argument in
the macro will be expanded to the
textual representation of that or long
term so in this case we're saying the
value of foo is whatever food is that's
kind of a neat neat one okay so one of
the my favorite uses of macros is Annie
unit and it uses macros to create
assertions in your unit tests so I'm
going to step through how the main
assert macro works there are a number of
others that do things slightly
differently but some of the macros are
are built on top of the assert macro so
basically your assertion is saying this
is a boolean expression which I want to
be true so what it's going to do is for
some safety of whatever you may pass
through that boolean expression we don't
know it could be you know a very deep
section of code it could be the you know
calling a function inside that
expression as long as that evaluates to
true or false we're okay with it but
because we don't know what you're going
to pass the macro you have to have this
begin end first of all at the top and
the bottom and then it wraps it inside
and honest function with zero arguments
and calls it okay so this is this is a
big safety thing in terms of getting
correct expressions for the compiler
remember macros happen before the
compiler come so now we do a case
expression case the boolean expression
wrapped in friends of is it true if it's
true we turn return okay so that's
that's what you expect out of your unit
test if you're building expert if your
expectation is true then it should not
do anything bad but if it is not true
then we raise an error by calling Erlang
error and here's where some of the other
use cool uses of macros come into into
the way unit expresses assertions so it
tells you the module and the line number
that it failed on and then it quotes the
boolean expression so it turns it into a
string so whatever you pass to this
macro you get to see which assertion
failed maybe have more than one
assertion on a line and it says I
expected true and I got something else
well what was that something else was it
false if it was false you just return
false if you
got something else you say this was not
a bully and I was expecting a boolean
okay so how does this work in practice
let's make a test for our fizzbuzz
algorithm so we know that fizzbuzz of
three needs to be fizz and fizzbuzz of
five needs bebas and fizzbuzz of 15
needs to be fizzbuzz well we think
fizzbuzz of 10 is 10 let's run that test
and I if I run that test I get that that
assertion failed because 10 does not
equal fizzbuzz of 10 now there is a
macro for equality I didn't use it in
this example but if I had used that one
it would say expected 10 got buzzed okay
so that's a way you can use macros to
simplify an API as unit does so to
summarize macros macros are easy and
familiar they are things you one of the
things you first learn when you start
learning or laying there in line with
the program which means you don't have
to go somewhere else to figure out what
the macro does maybe you have to read
another file but you don't have to like
pull out a whole other program and
understand it it's right there and
because it uses the ? syntax most
editors highlight it differently than
your keywords and your other terms so it
kind of draws attention to it you're
very aware when you're using it on the
flip side macros don't have much expert
civet ii they just operated the token
level so if you wanted to do more
complicated metaprogramming mad at
macros are probably not for you and
honestly I think they look kind of ugly
they don't look like early in syntax so
they look like something else which they
actually are so what're macro is good
for what can you use them for obviously
small I ppapi rappers like a unit in eq
see those are good examples you want to
name constants in your files without
having just magic numbers littered
everywhere I mentioned before if you
want to do compile time feature
switching so one of the things we've
done in previous projects is if you if
you define a constant at compile time at
build time based on what OTP version
you're running you can get around some
of those errors like when you go from 16
to 17 it's like oh the undecorated dicta
type is not a type anymore used
conduct I think everybody is probably
run into that if they're upgrading and
legacy projects so macros are good for
that and then debugging statements so
you could insert you debugging statement
and at at build time for production you
would just say well this evaluates to
okay and doesn't do anything otherwise
like if I'm in development I can make it
print something to the console okay so
let's talk about parse transforms and
this is an old fun topic for me the
essential aspect of parts transform is
that you are compiling your module and
you say I want to apply this parse
transform to the module and so what
happens is Erlang the compiler it will
tokenize and then parse your code of
course it pass through the preprocessor
and then it hands off whatever was
parsed in that code to your powers
transform modules so you're basically
getting a syntax tree of the module is
being compiled past your parse transform
function and of course so your app
you're operating over the abstract form
and then you also get this options
argument which is just the compiler
options so you know the goal of this
parse transform is true verse over the
forms your past and I think this
deserves a short segue or a short aside
that there are two syntactical levels
underlying forms happen at the module
level inside functions are expressions
so if i switch if i mix those up please
you know shout and correct me throw
something but you are handed forms not
expressions to your parts transform okay
so there's a cute little trick that if
you are wondering how your parts
transform works how it does it you can
say Earl C Dash P and give your module
name or your file name and then if you
it'll print the resulting it'll pretty
print the resulting code after your
parse transform to this dot P file so
this is a good way for debugging and I
thought I'd just throw that in there
first but we're going to essentially do
the same of that same thing as that
so let's talk about this parse transform
that's in logger I imagine many of you
have used lager it's a logging library
one of the best parts about it is that
it does not overload the the gin event
if you're using the parse transform it
prevents you from sending too many
things to the gin event that handles
logs and it also injects call set
metadata so like what process was this
thing that logged what you know what
module in line was it in you know what
what other metadata has been stored in
this process is processed dictionary so
it will take this call to any severity
level in the logger module and expand it
into that so in this case we've taken a
very small thing that's in Erlang syntax
and we've turned it into a much larger
thing that's in early and syntax but
puts the optimization on the producer
side rather than trying to throw away
events in the gin event so if you take a
look at the red pieces those are the
bits that came in and were transformed
into this this larger statement that's
where they ended up so you see it's
actually completely rewriting this and
it's calling log or do log instead of
this thing called warning and in fact if
you look at the source warning is not a
function that exists in the logger
module so if you don't use the parse
transform you call logger warning it's
going to say undef and you're going to
crash so use the parse transform but
essentially the the key points here are
it checks whether it can send a message
to the the Jenna been that runs that
accepts log messages it checks that the
configured log level is correct and then
it adds all this metadata of where you
know where the stuff was coming in what
line it was on the pit the note is
running on etc in addition to the things
you just want to format into the lungs
okay so how do we know what to do when
we got these forms well a good way to do
it aside from the Earl Dash P thing is
to read your file and
you're Erlang file and then use else can
so use Earl scans string and I used
unicare characters to list here because
the scanner requires strings not
binaries and then you pass the parsed
oaken's to oral parse parse expressions
now assuming you're not using any any
macros in this file you won't have to
run the preprocessor across this so then
you're given the AST so what does that
look like so if I took this example down
here starting with the case expression
and I expand that I get this big huge
term and you don't really need to know
what that is right at the moment but you
can see that all of those syntactical
elements of the program were turned into
this list of tuples and nested tuples
okay so what is the log or transform do
if you look at the things in red here it
actually just grabs a lot of options out
of the compiler options and then down at
the bottom says I'm going to walk the
AST and so this is a recursive descent
algorithm to transform the the AST and
then it does a bunch of things where it
just says ok i'm going to keep track of
some state and then recurse down into
those clauses that are within this
function and then when I'm inside a
clause I'll walk the body of the clause
and then when I'm inside the body of the
clause I'll go ahead and transform a
single statement so a single expression
the interesting thing about this is
that's really manual like you'd have to
know exactly how you're traversing that
and we'll see a better way to do that
later but the once it gets to an
individual call they're a bunch of keep
in mind they're a bunch of clauses of
this function I'm not showing you
because this is the core of it you will
get you match on this call and it's a
remote call because you're calling the
logger module ok and then it passed it
has an atom which is the severity so
assuming it's one of those
configured severity levels so any of the
syslog severity levels then it will go
ahead and transform that statement if
it's not it's just going to leave it
alone so this is you know this is a
functional transformation if if it
doesn't match a syslog level you're just
not going to do anything with it but if
it is you can go to the next bit so
there's a whole bunch of stuff that it
computes before it gets to this section
but this is essentially how it builds it
up it takes the original line so this is
a neat thing about parse transforms you
can actually keep the same line number
as you create a huge new AST and any of
these things that are in that case
expression will appear as if I on the
same line number as the original one but
we make up some fake of our variable
names and then this is basically the
expansion of that case expression we saw
before so where is logger event so we
call whereas logger event and then we
call a logger config get and the log
level so there's an atom log level and
it says log none is the zero level or
the empty list so those are that's the
head of the case expression and then
individual clauses we're going to skip
over a few of them but the main one is
that you got a a paid back for the
logger event process and then you got a
some of the configuration back and you
have so this is your match part so
clauses c5 tuple and it come it starts
with Klaus is the name and then the line
number and then it has the match so
whatever is in the left side of the
arrow and the claws and then you have
the guards and this is an expansion of
the guards not going to go through it
too much and then finally you do the
call to log or do log with all that
extra stuff that he competed so that's
kind of complicated but you know oaf
he's cool he's got your back don't worry
he created this cool thing called par
strands and par strands lets you rewrite
your parts transformation instead of all
those manual steps of ok I got a clause
I need
recurse into that cause I got a function
i need recurse into that function I got
us a list of expressions i need to
recurse in those list of expressions he
just says well you can actually write
one function that just matches on the
the syntactic form that you want to
modify and so you basically write it as
a visitor like if you ever done antler
or something like that you write a
visitor for your syntax tree and antler
this is the same idea so you don't have
to recurse manually and all your visitor
has to do is return a new form when it
wants to replace whatever it received or
returns the atom continue when it says
okay I want to curse down into that next
step you can also return done and say
you know I'm done transforming this
module but these are probably the two
main forms you use and so then we create
this do transform function so this would
like greatly simplify all that stuff
that's in the logger transform I hope we
can get that new logger that would be
cool but you basically do the same
pattern match and then pass it to that
you know I don't want to transform this
call so par strands also has some other
cool stuff some of these things I'm not
going to mention but it has two parts
transforms of its own one which lets you
do compile-time evaluation and omit the
the thing in your into your code
immediately and experts which generates
record assessor functions okay so parse
transforms they're very powerful they
use Erlang syntax you can you just
change the semantics you can do compound
compile time computation with them but
it sort of hides the magic so if you if
your semantics are not clear that could
be a problem for your users they can be
difficult to write in debug so use that
Dash P thing on your compiler it the
other limitation is that only modifies
the current module so if you wanted to
generate a new module you might have to
kind of do some like non pure stuff
inside your parse transform it's really
good for injecting optimizations or new
semantics like log or does you can do
embedded dsl's really well and you know
if you want to generate code in the same
module is perfect it's a great way to do
it so beyond parse transforms the next
technique is just syntax trees in
general
so we could use the technique of syntax
trees and parse transforms but if you
wanted to generate a new module out of
the blue or set of modules out of the
blue you want to know this this
technique so basically you just
construct syntax trees out of nothing or
out of data that's not already nasd and
of course it operates over abstract
forms there's this great module called
oral syntax it's in OTP it's a data type
and a bunch of accessories for creating
syntax trees so basically any syntactic
construct you want underlying with the
exception of type and spec annotations
which is the thing I've been meaning to
fix for quite a while you can generate
that but you can also generate plain
text so you know if you can generate the
text value of a type or a spec into your
module you know it's fine where but so
you can create nodes all the basic types
the compound types you can create
expressions clauses functions you can
create guards with conjunction
disjunction and then you can create
forms like functions attributes lists of
forms until you build up your module and
then once you have a tree you can
inspect it so like if you're pulling it
from somewhere else you can look at what
the type of an individual node is or
what's the value of this float node or
what's the name of this attribute so
they're all sorts of accessory around
its abstract data type and you can
convert things so like if you have an
erlang turn you can call abstract and
get the syntactical representation of
that term which is see in a minute you
can also take an abstract version and
revert it to the actual or Lang term and
then you can call sub trees to traverse
so like if you don't want to do this
sort of thing like we did manually and
lager you can call sub trees and get
down into deep parts of your syntax tree
okay so way back in 2009 i created this
thing called nigga toma and it's time I
got out my shine box so here I am
holding you shine box Newton was pretty
stupid so it generates a parser for you
right and it does it out of strings
so this is what I have to get my shine
box basically it's a single pass
generator it generates part of the
syntax tree in strings inside the parser
so you're generating the output as you
parse at least part of it and then it
wraps it all up with a little bit of a
boilerplate by a figuring out what the
module name is and all this stuff and
generate J during the boilerplate the
Erlang needs this is a really stupid way
to do it so last year I started
converting it to actually being a
well-designed parser generator and one
of the things I discovered in this
process was that actually didn't
implement a whole bunch of the things
that the thesis about parser about
packet parsers talks about all the
optimizations all the things that you
should be doing so this is a intention
to redo that so instead of you know if
you look back here we generated a string
we did like we even flattened like
what's that about so we generated a
string there instead we should generate
a syntactic element it's a string that
you're trying to match in your parser ok
so I use a record instead what much
better and then instead of now let me
look back at here you see this it has
this called a p string this is actually
a monadic parser Combinator oops I said
the N word but it builds up a parser by
taking anonymous functions and gluing
them together well that's not actually
that great in performance for Erlang and
it's also not really principled if you
want to be good about memoization which
like the whole point of pak-rat parsers
is linear part time so instead we should
generate something looks like this we
want to match a string will take the
input and we'll try to match a binary
string off the front and return the the
rest of whatever is in in the source and
then if that works we follow the success
path for generation and if it doesn't
then we follow the failure paths so this
uses continuation passing style of
course as one should so if we want to
generate this fragment this code
fragment that recognizes a string we
pass it the syntax
element of the meadow grammar which is
this string record and you pass it the
name of the input from the current you
know tail of this computation and you
pass it the success path which is
anonymous function the fail path so we
create an abstract version of that
string so this is basically converting
that term into a syntax tree then we
create a new variable for the input so
what's the next input variable these
have to be you know hygienic and then we
do we create a crazy expression across
that input that input variable so what
is the input so we see case input
becomes case expression input name input
name is a variable in the abstracts
interests riso we're starting the case
expression and then we do the binary
matching this one's a little bit
proposed and in this example I imported
all the urls syntax functions i'm using
so that you there's not so much noise
well we have a clause which matches a
binary and has binary field and the
literal value of that string and then
the variable for the next remainder of
the input it has no guards and then to
determine what to do with that it calls
the success callback and then the other
one is we underscore we don't care what
it is we call the the fail call back and
we given an error reason hey this we
were expecting this string ok so this is
this is sort of a general technique for
generating syntax trees another cool use
of syntax trees is mochi global who's
used mochi global I know I have yeah if
you use mochi web you've used it
probably unknowingly but it's a key
value store essentially that uses the
code server so it's a pretty cool hack
the idea is that you know code server is
faster in a lot of cases than ettes
because it's in process to read that
value so if you have a really high read
low right scenario like hi Reid
contention you could use mochi global
and just compile that term that you're
trying to cash into the code server so
this put function it creates a module
name out of the key it calls into the
three arity version and it compiles a
module given that that value so uses the
module name there and then it purges the
old version of it and then it loads
the binary that it just compiled into
the code server okay that's pretty cool
so dynamic code generation and loading
so what is that that compile actually do
you give it the module name you give it
the term it calls forms module t and
then it compiles them using the Erlang
compiler and of course it uses verbose
and report errors so you know if it
fails like you gave it something bad
it'll it'll blow up and then returns the
binary so this is what we were calling
from the previous slide so what do those
forms look like well forms just says
give me the abstract version of this
term if it can if it converts properly
then will revert all those forms that we
created ok so the term to abstract
function takes the model name the getter
which is the name of the function to
call I think is just get or term or
something and then the abstract form of
the term or no it just takes the the
literal form of the term so we generate
the module attribute and we generate the
export attribute with the getter name
I'm not going to go through all this and
then we actually generate the gutter
function so we create a module on the
fly we create the in straps track form
injected into the syntax tree single
Clause of this function and now you have
a module that caches this term pretty
cool so all that's kind of crazy but
Ricard who have to spin the back of the
room don't worry he's got your back he
created this thing called moral of which
is really cool and what does it do it
combines all these strategies we've been
talking about uses macros as a parse
transform and it generates syntax trees
and why do you want to use it aside from
the fact that it's included in OTP 18 it
makes a lot of these things way easier
so as an example how to use Merle I've
looked at early dtl and early detail if
you haven't seen it it implements Django
style templates so if you're doing a web
app you might want to look at early dto
and sometime last year they moved from
using the Earl syntax library directly
which incidentally I think Ricard also
wrote into using Merle and if you look
at this like ugly function we've seen a
lot of these already right this is
creating a function it's taking the
function name turning an atom it was one
clause and
ignores the variable variables no guards
it applies a function there's no module
named it's a local function named with
that Adam it passes the variable on a
list so it's like turning the
singularity version into a 2 r.d version
with the trailing list so this is
actually so short in Merle it fits on
one line at the bottom of the slide so
you use this Q macro to quote the Erlang
code and then at at compile time it uses
a parse transform to inject the values
of these things into a syntax tree
really cool so that like turn from like
six lines eight lines under lots of
lines into one that's really awesome so
syntax trees in general are the most
versatile way to meta program Erlang
there are really powerful tools you can
output to the code server you can output
to files with pretty printing you can do
whatever you want you can evaluate the
forms directly the cons of it obviously
if you're not using moral it's pretty
verbose and you have to go through lots
of manual steps so use moral the other
thing is you may need to understand the
ast if you're going to work with the AST
you directly so you know knowing what
forms what what abstract forms are there
inter lying is valuable so using syntax
trees is really good for implementing lu
languages so if you're doing an external
language you're like I don't know maybe
you're implementing a new lisp or a
haskell on top of Erlang that sounds
kind of cool you might want to look into
this and of course external dsl's things
things like you know if likely neotoma
itself is an external dsl and of course
runtime code generation you know you
build up the syntax tree and you load it
that's pretty cool so meta programming
knurling is great you should do it use
these things use Earl syntax par strands
and Merle they will make your life lots
easier and go build cool tools that's it
thank you
we have the time for one or two very
short question 7 short answers I'm quite
impressed but I do have a question about
how quick what's the performance of you
know compiling these syntax trees let's
say you have to compile a lot of them
hmm well I mean it's going to be so you
mean building the syntax trees are like
taking ones you've already built in
compiling because this one's already
built it's going to be the same as
running the airline compiler which is
actually pretty fast you know obviously
like for that mochi global case you
don't want to be changing that thing a
lot because you're creating those forums
compiling them loading them that's a lot
of turn on the code server so that's
actually case we ran into your react we
had to stop using it in certain cases so
but but if it's something that you're
doing once in a while you know it's not
a big deal so I think it's all about the
scale of the problem you're trying to
solve whether you'd want to do that or
not so if i had to do like a thousand of
them that would take that might not be
so nice to your user yeah
if you combine several of these parts
transforms are getting into risky
territory I mean if you say okay
metaprogramming is great all your api's
should use macros and these kind of
stuff like lager does is there in a risk
that we get into two combinations or
transforms yeah there there's definitely
a risk there I mean I think you have
that risk in any language that has like
hygienic macros in homogeneous in t2 you
could create something that doesn't make
any sense so it's very important for the
person writing that parse transform or
the syntax generation to be you know
responsible and the one of the nice
things about log or is it actually
touches very little of your code I think
that's why it works as the parts
transform as opposed to something else
is that it only focuses on those single
expressions that call the logger module
with a syslog severity so again that's
an issue a magic right like how much are
you exposing how much of you are you
hiding and I think you want to hide very
little magic the semantics should be
really clear so a to your question yes
you must be very careful yes it can end
in disaster I've done it myself actually
so so it seemed like you didn't check if
you go to variable name collision when
you you create those underscore
underscore variables hmm and you don't
check if they exist in which example
again in which example I'll remember
like the logger example yeah so that's
that's another thing you could if you're
doing a parts transformation you might
want to collect the variable names
you've seen in the current scope but
logger just assumes if it mates makes an
esoteric enough name that it won't
collide so I don't know you'd have to
ask Andrew you also need to check all
the variable names behind your transform
yes yeah so so there's some element of
needing to collect state as you traverse
town which it does with some Erlang
process dictionary junk in the parse
transform not the most advisable way but
that that is that is possibility is ah
thank you joe joe says 0 x / x watch the
tree twice to make sure there's no
collisions is that correct to inspect
the module yeah yeah just to comment
another way is just putting the things
inside of fun doing your early example
yeah then you get past the problem with
the variable scoping it slightly slower
but then you get past the variable
scoping yes thank you Robert would you
more questions okay thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
