weird stuff non web stuff in my career
and I had recently to make a control
system that talks to a few weird hard
word like projectors and IP paste barber
bars and like weird things that don't
have you cannot download the client at
least not yet in their languor elixir so
I had to read some TCP specifications
and implement my own stuff and in that
process I realized that there's not a
lot of material out there if you want to
do this kind of thing and I thought okay
perhaps I could condense a little bit of
what I found and some pain points and
some things that might trip you up if
you especially if you don't have if you
haven't read the 600 page tcp/ip
illustrated book because the official
documentation is complete I would say
but it's really all over the place it's
really hard to you know there's no
QuickStart you just on your own so
before we actually go into code I'd like
to just spend one minutes talking about
the underlying protocol of TCP IP so IP
when we know about IP it's the IP
address or that IP stands for Internet
Protocol and basically it works like we
did in school where you just write a
small message on the piece of paper fold
it up write a name and hand it over to
your classmate and then you hope you
just really just hope that they will
pass it on touch the correct direction
right and it's the same thing with IP
packets in that they are small they
might be one or two kilobytes depending
on you know a lot of things and they
just have an IP address on top and then
you hand it over to your router and then
the Reuter hands it over to your ISP and
you just hope and that's it you really
hope that it will get eventually there
and you have no way of knowing that it
got there until the other side replies
and then you have no guarantee that the
reply will actually even arrive at your
destination because
Rooter might just drop it so there are a
lot of problems in this and not I
shouldn't say problems because it's the
design of the system and like what
happens if your data doesn't fit in one
packet then you have to split it up send
two packets and then there's no
guarantee that the first packet will
arrive first so a very remote side has
to have some way of saying okay this is
packet number one and this is packet
number two and I'll just join them
together and when you actually you know
go and read how old it works you'll be
amazed that everything still works and
we can just you know read our mail every
day and really makes you appreciate all
the engineering thought that has gone
into it back from you know the 70s so
TCP / IP stands for transport control
protocol over Internet Protocol
something like that and the whole idea
is that you take this chaotic packets
flying around with no guarantees and you
provide a stream abstraction over that
so the same way that the telephone works
and that you pick up the telephone you
dial a number or you know used to dial a
number and once that connection happens
you can just speak you don't care how
things work you speak into one side you
listen from the other side then it's the
same way with a TCP connection in that
you have you have something that is a
stream and you can read to it so and so
you can write to it and data arrives at
the other end and vice versa you can
read and write to the stream so to
actually use that in our day to day code
there is one prevailing API that was
designed back in 1983 I think it's
called the Berkeley sockets and it was
originated in the BSD UNIX distribution
so the Berkeley distribution of Unix
and it turns it what it does is it makes
that a TCP connection behave like a file
so once you use those weird functions to
create a socket
you can then use your usual io functions
to read and write from into the socket
and it behaves kind of like a file so
you write bytes to that handle and
magically sometime later those bytes
will arrive at the other end and the
other way around and this is a now a
POSIX standard for a long time it's most
most probably implemented by the
operating systems we use every day
and the thing is because it's real life
code that not some you know abstraction
it breaks the illusion so it's not like
the telephone where you just speak
continuously because we are working with
bites and bites have sizes and you have
to fit them in memory somehow somewhere
so there's a few already we start to see
that why tcp/ip is a bit complicated to
use daily so Jen TCP is actually an
Erlang module it's writing the
distribution of Erlang and it exposes
the bsd socket API to the beam and it
does that in a way that feels slightly
more being native than what you would
have with the plain C functions and so
the issue with Jen TCP is that it's both
intricate to using configure and when
you read the documentation you see a lot
of arcane looking options and all that
so this is actually the entire API for
Jen T CP there's no other functions in
there but when you actually go to use it
you'll see that you have to also learn
about the eye net API which only has no
this is two functions that are the most
common to use there's like other other
fiber ten functions that are a bit
peripheral but that set opts function
has a list of options that you can pass
through it and that list of option is
huge and it's like 40 different things
that all come together and then you can
of course drop down to the Rho BSD API
then you can start you know creating a
binary struct that gets passed roll to
the operating system we won't see any of
that today but if you want to actually
go and have a look at how this is
documented you should because it gives a
lot of options that you could use and
you might find useful so let's go and
have a very quick look now at some code
and we will write a very simple server
that accepts connection on port 4001 and
when a client connects to it it will
just send the current date as a string
and then close the connection so let's
see how that could work and this is now
blind so we are this so oops
I should have done it the other way
round so the server is running on one
side and I just connect to it through my
client and I could use the same way with
netcat if you don't know that cut is a
thing like cut but over the network so
it will just print out to the standard
Thunder out everything that arrives to
it so you can use the same thing if you
get that string so you see that the date
is current and we can even use tablet
and telnet prints out a lot some like
noise there but the main the last two
lines are what the server returned and
then tell that prints out that server
close the connection so that's the demo
and let's go and have a look what the
server looks like so this is you know
you have to wrap a module around that to
actually make it work but those two
functions are the server and the first
part is that you call gen DCP listen and
you pass it the port and then that
options we've been talking about so
options is a list and it could be it has
both atom pairs like you know a couple
of keywords and value or it has just
plain items in there and it's really
convoluted but most of the time you'll
use binary which means treat the data
that I'm giving you and the data that
you're giving me as binaries because the
default is char lists which is the
Erlang strings which is just lists of
integers and in elixir land they're not
as useful we use other is some arcane
thing that's nice for the demos because
otherwise we'd have to wait one minute
or so until we could rebind to that port
don't worry about it
so we call gen PCP listen and we get
back a listen socket and we just pass it
over to our server handler and what that
does is that it calls except on that
listen socket so so far the listen call
is just returns almost immediately but
the accept call here is actually
blocking so the code will stop here
until a client connects and when a
client connects now we have our socket
right and this socket in our line is
actually a port let's not get into that
level of detail but if the socket is
something that's stateful so you can
right through it you can read from it
and all that once we have that we
calculate the time and we convert into a
string and we call gentie CP send with
to using the socket and our binary and
we just pack a new line at the end to
make it a bit nicer for the demos and
then we call shut down and what that
will do is that once send returns it
means that the data is no longer at our
control it's gone over to Erlang and
eventually al angle passed the data to
the operating system and eventually the
operating system will actually send the
data over to the destination and shut
down it just ensures that the packet
participe packet that actually signifies
the closing of the connection will get
delivered after everything else so
usually you don't usually have to close
a TCP socket because when your process
that open the socket dies it will close
it with it but for the demos we use shut
down so we are just make sure that
everything arrives and then once that
happens we can just call except again on
the socket and now we are ready to serve
the next client
so the listen socket is long-lived but
we accept socket the accepted socket is
represent one connection from the
outside I showed in the demo that we can
also write a client for this kind of
thing so it looks really similar in the
sense that it's two functions and we'll
see why in a bit but what we do is we
connect we pass in the address we want
to connect to the port the same list of
options or a similar looking list of
options and we get a socket and this is
again blocking so once we have
the socket it means that we are
connected to the server and we can start
doing things with it
the major problem here that you will
probably run into is that you have to
pass in the address as a char list so
notice single quotes around the host if
you pass in a string you will get an
error bad arg figure it out
no use that use single quotes and you
can use IP addresses or other weird
stuff in there the documentation shows
no the types that you can pass in there
and we also see that we use binary again
because we want to stay in binary land
and not use char lists for the data but
there's also active true which is
actually their default but it's a good
opportunity to talk about it and we'll
see why in a second now we have the
socket and then we call this client
function client handler function passing
that socket and we immediately go into a
receive block and the reason we do that
is because the active mode means that
airline will deviate from the VHD API
and it will convert the incoming data
into our link messages so there is two
kinds letters three or four kinds of
messages you can receive the basic ones
are three element apple that has a tcp
atom the socket that actually used that
actually send the data so you can handle
many sockets in the same connection in
my case i just matched on the socket
that we used for to be clear about that
and the last element is the data and
because we passed in binary this is now
a binary when that happens we just write
out to the standard i/o and we wait for
the next message to arrive so the client
in this case has no idea what's coming
so it will just wait many messages will
arrive and then eventually the socket
will be closed because from the other
side we called shut down so eventually
the socket will be closed and then we
agree we will receive the TCP closed
message and
we just print out that it's closed and
we die so everything's clear so far
yep so if you remember the server code
I'll just jump here a bit the server
code as it is right now as it is shown
on the screen can only handle one client
at a time and why is that because we
have a single Erlang process we called
accept and accept this blocking so while
we are blocked there no other clients
can come in so there you go they will
they will not get refused at a
connection because there's some pooling
going on behind the scenes for the
listen socket read the documentation
about that but they will not be
connected until the first client exits
so of course this is very common in many
programming languages like Python Ruby
you have to spawn multiple multiple
process processes to handle this but in
a lecture world or the beam world
it's just trivial to do to accept
multiple clients at the same time we
just spawn processes so what I've done
here is instead of just calling the
server handler directly as we did before
we spawn it that we spawn 10 processes
running that function at the same time
so now we have we can accept 10 clients
at a time and we have to sleep the main
process because otherwise our program
will exit of course you wouldn't do it
this way if you have to do it in
production you would use something like
ranch which is the library that Phoenix
and because it's used in sorry Ranch is
a TCP acceptor pooling library so if you
have if you want to accept multiple
clients you do it essentially this kind
of thing and if you're using Phoenix
Phoenix uses cowboy and cowboy uses
ranch and if you ever went into your
process diagram you will see that there
is a ranch supervisor with a hundred
workers by default doing essentially
this
for you so just like that we've
eliminated all the complexity that for
example Python used to have it either
have to spawn new processes like
operating system processes and then try
to coordinate between them or you would
have to go the async way where there is
some cutter API that you can listen on
multiple sockets and all that
it's complicated this is way way simpler
so the code we've seen so far is very
simple hello world style let's go and
have a look at some code that does a
little bit of more complicated back and
forth and we'll have a server that
accepts connections and when the client
connects the server will send that
greeting and this is mostly like the I
think SMTP works where you connect and
the server might easily sense hello then
the client when it receives that hello
think it will serve let's talk about the
server first the server will send hello
and then we'll wait until the client
send some data back and then the server
will take the data and send it back
using that hello name and then this will
close the connection the client on the
other hand it will connect to the server
wait until it sees that hello binary
then send some data over and then just
read all the data and wait until the
connection is closed so we have a demo
for this as well and we have here
ah sorry
this is our server whoops ah ah of
course
so this is no video
so the server now is waiting for
connections and I will launch the client
and some something has happened because
I'll just write my name here
elixir oops oh yeah time out we'll talk
a little bit about that later
let's be a little bit faster okay so the
server is now doing that and the client
has shows us how all this worked
this never happened when I did at home
so the server the listen part is the
same so I'm just showing the handler
part and you can spawn this in one
process or how many processes you want
so we again call accept waiting for a
connection and then the moment we are
after accept it means we have a
connection so we send that hello thing
and then the server goes into the
receive block so it blocks and then when
that message arrives means the client
has sent us something
so we then calls and again and shut down
the circuit the idea here is mostly to
illustrate that we can have the server
both read and write data right it's a
two-way stream you don't there's no
client the server once the connection
happens you don't know who started it
you either side can closed can read can
write can do whatever the client is also
the same just here we patent much a bit
better because we are waiting a specific
thing to arrive so we can pattern much
on that message and say ok when that
happens do this in our case we just know
read from standard in and whatever trim
it send it back and the other cases are
exactly the same so this is the active
mode where incoming data gets turned
into
messages and you use a receive block to
handle them the most traditional way
which is the BST way is to have a
passive mode which is a no Erlang magic
going on you have your file and at some
point in your program you read some data
from the file and this of course means
that if you want to read more data than
is available your code will block you
have to use a timeout the most important
thing here is that the way tcp it was
designed it was designed to make sure
that one side that is producing a lot of
data will not overwhelm the other side
that processes the data or reach the
data so TCP has built in a back pressure
mechanism so if one side is just not
reading the data at the same rate as the
other side is writing TCP has a way to
throttle the 10-digit ID so it will send
back messages saying stop or other
anyway it will do something some magic
to ensure that your this doesn't happen
when you use active mode though airline
will consume all the data as it becomes
available
so you don't get to use that back
pressure mechanism because the operating
system doesn't know that your process
hasn't processed the data yet it knows
that Erlang read the message from the
buffer read the data from the buffer and
it will just send you more so instead of
using the back rest or mechanism of TCP
you have to design your own but press
your mechanism otherwise your process
message inbox will flood and you will
kill your VM so most of the time we use
passive mode and of course this is only
relating to the receiving of data
sending is the same because sending is
this weird thing that is both blocking
and unlocking but there is no Erlang
magic for the send so the server is
really quite the same instead of using
active is true we use active is false
and instead of having a receive below
we call Jen TCP receive and we have a
five thousand milliseconds timeout and
we say that we want to read zero bytes
and we'll talk a little bit about that
later the client it gets a little bit
bigger so when you connect you pass in
active false and when you actually want
to read instead of having a received
block you again call receive passing the
number of the number of the number of
bytes you want to read which is zero and
we'll see 5,000 is the timeout and
you'll get just either okay and your
data or error and some error which in
our case it means that the circuit is
closed and the demo is exactly the same
we won't do it again so the major thing
that passive mode introduces is the
receive function and it has two flavors
one without a timeout and the other with
a timeout and when you pass in length
that is a number that's not zero it
means I want to read this number of
bytes a hundred bytes something like
that and your code will block until the
operating system has received those 100
bytes when it does you know that you get
a hundred bytes back no more nor less
when the length is zero it means read
give me any bytes that you might have
and this is problematic and we'll see in
a bit
why so here is naive extremely naive
HTTP client it tries to download Mary
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein from Project
Gutenberg and it's essentially the same
you connect to that host at port 80
which is the default HTTP port we use
passive mode and we send that the HTTP
header right so this is this works but I
won't go into the demo because we're
running a bit late so if you say this
actually works but the problem here is
that
the response that we get is 115 thousand
bytes which is not enough to contain
Mary Shelley's book so why is that well
the problem is that you don't really
know at this level of code you have no
idea how large the response of the other
end will be right
so in passive mode this is very explicit
because you have to pass in a number and
it forces you to think about that number
in active mode you have the opposite
thing in that or a similar thing in that
if you we try to partner much before at
that
hello string right and of course it
worked because we are doing very little
data back and forth and we're talking
over the local hold so things pretty
much work out but in actual real-world
case you might first receive three bytes
of Hello so HCl and then after you know
a couple of milliseconds you might
receive the other part so your pattern
matching logic is now broken because
there is no guarantee because it's a
stream right a stream doesn't have a
beginning and an end it's just a stream
of bytes and you need to add your own
level of handling on top of that and we
call these protocols and the protocol is
just try to give a shape of on that on
that stream and some of them are common
like HTTP or memcache D and some of them
are niche like the ones I had to
implement and some of them are going to
be your own when you want to design a
TCP based application and some are even
provided by gen TCP but they're not as
useful as I would hope so a protocol
specification when you read it
essentially it's a distributed state
machine so it tells you okay which party
goes first which party goes next what
shape should the data have who is
responsible for this responsible for
that and all that and some of them can
be really complicated like the sorry I
mean really simple like this is an RFC
867 which we implemented in 10 lines of
code because it's
reveal it just says sent back they very
time as a string and I don't even care
what the string looks like so that's
easy
HTTP on the other hand is to be 1.1 is
176 pages then this is why you don't
write your own drain CTP client memcache
D is 1200 lines of text so I think you
should be able to implement reasonably
complete client in a week or so if you
have if you find a way to test it and
let's go and see a little bit better
HTTP client the code is exactly the same
as before we connect resent that the
first part of the HTTP requests which
are you know just they get then some
headers and we just you end with two two
new lines you can see and then if it's
visible but the last one is rn rn so
that's the signal for HTTP to say this
is the end of my request and then
instead of just calling receive once we
call we have another function that I'll
show and you might guess that the list
is going to be an accumulator of bytes
so this one looks like this and it
essentially calls receive in a loop
until it until the connection is closed
which is a valid HTTP way of knowing
that the response has finished so I
don't know if sure if I should walk over
this we just call receive we don't care
how many we don't know how many data
will arrive so we just say give me
everything you have and we stick that on
a buffer and as long as we read data we
stick it on a buffer so we just use the
functional way of having an accumulator
and we tack it at the beginning of the
list and then eventually I know
eventually we should get closed
I just pattern match another for
simplicity and we will just reverse the
accumulator and now we have an i/o data
list and we just convert that into a
binary and that's it so that is early so
gently CB if you're gonna have a look
has a few built-in protocols and you
would hope that it would help you design
applications but the problem is that you
cannot extend them they're set in stone
they will never change and if they're
useful there they are if they're not
useful don't think about it go and write
your own thing and the main idea of
those protocols is that for example this
is the prefix header length and what it
will do is it anytime you call send it
will say okay you've asked me to send
200 bytes
I will tack one or two or four bytes at
the beginning of your transmission
saying okay the now follows a hundred
bytes and when you use it on the
receiving side it will say okay I will
expect that the first 2 1 or 2 or 4
bytes to be the length and I will read
exactly a hundred bytes and that's it
and it actually does it transparently so
if you have a case where you control
both client and server you can use that
and you don't have to write any other
logic the amount of data you sent is the
amount of data you receive and you don't
have to think about anything else
buffering whatever and the cool thing
also is that if you use active mode you
will also have guarantees that exactly
the correct amount of data will be
passed to your messenger you can go back
to using it's nice pattern matching
style the default is packet to be 0
which means no packet at all of course
it could have a better name but it
doesn't the other protocol that might be
useful with a very big caveat is the
line protocol in that it will read data
until it finds a new line or actually
any line any character that you can
specify and then it will send you that
data as a message so a lot of protocols
use new lines the problem is they use
both carriage return and line feeds so
crlf
if you've seen us last r /n to signify
what the line means or as this protocol
only accepts a single character so again
not so useful the cool thing about
gentie CP though if you get to use this
kind of protocols if they are useful to
your application is that the socket
limbs itself is mutable so you can start
off at line mode like memcache D does
that it except it expects that first
that you will give it a line saying okay
I'm now doing a set operation and then
it expects some raw data so you can
start by sending a line and then you can
call a specific specific function saying
okay stop stop waiting for lines now
we're back to row mode so the next time
you receive or get the message you will
get raw data back
the most common way you do things is the
same way as the prefix header length
does it or HTTP does it with content the
content length header if you've seen
that around in that if you have your
logic and in your logic you say and now
I'm going to send you 500 kilobytes and
then they're receiving code knows okay
this is now what I'm going to expect
from the other side I think we have time
for a demo and this is the client so so
instead of now we don't have a server
instead we unmanned cache D and I have a
very very simple implementation or very
non-compliant client and I will run that
and the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to set a value this is the
reply that memcache descends and then I
will get a value and this is you see
that the first thing the wrong response
is the aligned and then after and it
says 20 so 0 is some flags that it's 0
and 20 is the number of bytes that will
follow this line so if you count there
should be exactly 20 bytes in the hello
from also string and the code for this
looks like this before they get I don't
think it's useful to go through it the
basic idea is that you connect blah blah
you specify that the packet is the line
and this actually works although it
shouldn't work so don't do this but it's
just an example of how you would do this
kind of thing so receive a line and we
know now that response should be aligned
so the memcache the protocol will send
you a line no matter what when you're
doing sorry before that we send a line
say get elixir corn for electing Cerf is
the key that we wrote just before so we
have the response and we use pattern
matching perhaps it's easier to do it
like this we use pattern matching and we
expect that it will start with value
elixir conf this is all the protocol of
memcache T and then we do some mangling
there wrangling to get very length once
we have the length we call I net which
we talked about in the beginning set
options packet is 0 so we're now no
longer in line mode were in row mode and
then we know exactly how much data we
need to read so this is what it looks
like so this is pretty much it from me
there
is a very big pain point and I wish I
had an announcement to make I don't when
you write TCP based applications there
is and the first time you do it your
code tends to be like inter interleaved
you have giant ACP calls here gentle
pickles there your logic all in between
and in most other programming languages
like I come from a Python background and
I use twisted extensively and twisted
has this idea of the abstracting out the
transport so that your transport could
be a serial port your transfer could be
TCP port could be an SSH or TLS port
could be a tunnel of things and you
don't really care as long as the
obstruction of the stream is maintained
I couldn't find any library that would
do this for me in their line or elixir
and if someone wants to do this kind of
work I think there's a very big nice gap
and if you are going to do some TCP
based applications think about how you
would test them because you either have
to mock something out it's messy better
to think about it before and you also
have to think about how to handle
timeouts because there is a timeout for
send there's a timeout for connect
there's a timeout for receive there is a
mode for everything and it's really not
a not a good thing to realize all this
after you've written all your code and
say oh what do I do now and it's a hard
problem and it's it doesn't have a good
solution at the moment so that's it from
me you can find all the slides and all
the codes at github try and read the
book read the documentation and I'm we
have seven minutes for questions so
any questions ends up got a question
okay thank you a quick one what can you
say about UNIX domain sockets for a
related story yes it's not I net I net
module deals with UNIX domain sockets
but you don't use gen TCP for that you
use something else which I'm not really
familiar there's also on that topic
there's gen UDP which is UDP based
communication this is a different model
and but you DB doesn't have the stream
obstruction so it's a completely
unrelated thing but with in theory you
could have you're the same code working
TCP with a disappea socket and with a
UNIX domain socket because it's just a
file to you right so you just read and
write but they haven't done that yet but
I know that it's possible somehow any
other questions okay thank you thank you
