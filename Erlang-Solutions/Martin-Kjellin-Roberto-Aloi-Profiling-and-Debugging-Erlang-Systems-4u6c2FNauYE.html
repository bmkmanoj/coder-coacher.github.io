small presentation novice we have
remarked over here hurling solutions
currently consulting at corner and me
which is who is apparently some
chemistry I've been doing our line since
2005 and I have a background in telecoms
and I'm currently working at corner as a
developer and we're going to tell you a
little bit today about debugging and
profiling hurling distance this is what
we're going to cover today a little bit
about mindset what to look for how to
think a little bit about little more
about which tools to use on how to use
them and then we have a case study of a
sort of well used and well-known open
source to our line system so why did we
choose to do profile and debugging in
the same torch well you are very
unlikely to just do profiling it will
not like create a spreadsheet hand over
to someone and someone else will try to
fix why it's low and that in those cases
so if you find the bottleneck you will
most likely be charged with fixing it
too and you tend to use the same tool
set in many cases at least in the Orlan
world this is what is called you know
you find you fix regarding the in mind
set on how to think it's very important
as everyone else to measure and not
guess and one mistake that we'll be
doing is that we have not always been
trusting our measurement so much we are
sometimes been thinking that were
smarter than our measurements this is a
bad thing you should let your
measurements control what you are
optimizing and you should know what
you're measuring what your measurements
means in case it's not clear my the
message I'm trying to convey with this
slide is that it's important to measure
things so what you want to measure on a
very high level system level on the
operating system level you want to keep
track of memory usage your disk
performance how much CPU usage if
network is performing okay and on the
alongside the most common things to look
for is message queue build-up and
reductions if you are not familiar with
reductions it's a value that they are
lingsha tiller used to determine how
much run time our line closest kept and
in this case you can consider it a
valley or how much CPU time particularly
during process uses so it's like CPU per
process in Erlang so how do we find this
we have a number of tools to use that
are available for free some are included
in OTP the C profit relief of the
observer dbg and the trace bibs unless
you made an effort not to you already
have this in your systems so these are
worth looking at there's a number of
very useful third-party tools like red
bag and recon the top or grind and you
also need to have control about your
operating system so you need to use a
few tools so diagnose your hardware and
your operating system performance it's a
few pointers here's where you can start
if you're new to profiling just start
reading I'm not going to cover these
tools in details all of them one by one
I'm going to tell you how we used to few
of them to diagnose the problem we
encountered the problem manifest itself
like this we were doing an import of
rather large data set into an empty
database cluster and for a long time we
had quite stable performance but at a
certain point we saw the performance
getting much much worse what happened
was that the time per write started to
increase a lot and the number of writes
we could handle in a given time period
decreased a lot and it's happened all
over the cluster on all the five notes
and we there was nothing external that
affected this that we could find other
of course that done that the data that
had increased a bit since the
importing for a while so the first thing
I do when I encountered something like
this is that I fire up something which
is called observer and observer it's
included in OTP it gives you nice random
information about your or language M's
so you get shorts of scheduler
utilizations memory usage our usage in
this particular one I can say that the
system is doing things all the
schedulers are doing quite a lot of work
this seems messy because I had 64
schedulers it seems to be only running
at 30 to 40% but Felice is doing things
actually the most interesting thing
about this is the i/o spikes here that
goes back and forth I will not tell you
about this because I've no idea why all
I could tell from this is I was bike
tire
nobody why but I I'm not suffering from
Chettiar collapse or anything like that
so what you can also do with observer
I'm going to talk a little bit but about
observer because everyone has it and
it's not widely used as far as I know
you stopped it as a remote node usually
you don't have to run it on the system
your profiling so you started as a
remote node and connect it to the target
node which is very handy you can also
get the process overview where you can
sort on reductions or a memory or a
message queue which tells you a little
bit what the different darling processes
in your system are doing which is very
useful to find the Troublesome ones so I
tend to fire up an observer connect
another system that's troublesome and
then look at this process short sort of
message queue or reductions or memory
and see which are the Troublesome ones
in this example I've decided that I have
a lot of processors with a not
insignificant production number stuck in
the same place so then I connect to a
shell on the system that I'm debugging
and I use something that is called the
red buggy which is written by my
colleague mark young with Stu is
somewhere in here
it's open source and very nice it's
basically a shortened syntax around the
trace bits and not run DPG but run the
trace tracing facilities in Erlang and
it's very useful for debugging systems
under load without hopefully without
bringing the system down in this
particular case we spent quite quite a
lot of time on this and found nothing
that looked strange so we followed the
code here looked at the source code see
the calls see if there's anything weird
going on couldn't find anything so
that's how the system is feeling on more
on machine or operating system level for
that I tend to use something else called
H top
it's like Richmond stop which it's much
more detailed than top which all know
and love or at least know it gives you
different firm a ssin particularly you
can see on the cpu user graph you see
some red and some green which is time
spent in kernel which is red and time
spent in user base which is green you
have some memory information here as
well and here we can say that we are not
able to max off the performance remember
the problem is that our write
performance to disk to the database is
failing we're not able to use CPU fully
which might be expected when you're
right in to disk and we are doing almost
only six calls so things we have see
this
we are not maxing out CPU we know that
we are problems writing to disk
you will inspect the disk performance
somehow I tend to use it a tool called
IO stat for that as that gives you quite
detailed information about Tori disks
are performing all these values are
averaged since the last time you run at
the origin system start so I use watch
to run it periodically and in this case
this all from the same system I see that
a to be decent number of writes
and I also say that the latency or the a
weight is in microseconds if I recall
correctly it's very low and I follow
this for a while and see it doesn't
fluctuate anything at all so my disk
seems to be doing well and at this time
life is kind of boring or depressing
your eyes start to tear and you break
your keyboard and leave early that's
okay keyboards are it's cheap but I
couldn't find anything in the system
about math suggests or memory or CPU the
disks are doing okay nothing is
happening
so that let's go back to H 2 p.m. the
picture I had er same picture and let's
see what's happening with the memory and
you see here we have some memory youth's
the green ones
the yellow ones it's free or actually
used by cache page caches so this should
be available for allocation the unique
systems to use any free memory for the
page caches but if we look a little bit
more closely we can also see that we
have some swap news so why would we just
when we have lots of free memory well an
educated guess where I'm not expecting
you to answer as you might yes it's that
we suffer from memory fragmentation the
we can't find a big enough lock in the
memory so we need to swap the swapping
is that effects performance in a non
positive way
you don't want to swap especially not
when you have this much memory and so we
could diagnose that a little bit I'm
rather like systems you can get
information about memory fragmentation
in something which cause body info I
have no idea why it's called body info
but each of these columns represents
different sizes of chunks of memory
that's available for allocations and I
tend to monitor this see how it performs
on the time and if you see lots of zeros
here and there these are slightly edited
figures but if you say low numbers or
things going down to see everything
going up again and problems like that
then you could actually have some
problems with memory fragmentation this
might be a problem it might not be a
problem some systems can perform well
even with the memory fragmentation in
our case it really what's the problem
so I tended to drop the page cache so
that all operations go straight to disk
for a while that means this yellow thing
here will not be visible for a while it
to be black there only the memory news
will be seen and that actually took us
back to the initial performance so this
is how we identify the problem of a
misbehaving Erling system we couldn't
directly see any measurements that we're
building up or any resources anywhere
the solution here is rather to just drop
the basic page cache manually it's
rather clumsy I don't have a better one
right now in this case it works because
the import is one time thing so when we
see it start to behave badly we just do
it and it goes back to the original
speed but I don't have the long-term
solutions we probably have to talk to
Lucas Nelson or someone who knows about
memory allocation and how to address it
and yeah worth more or less it's some
bottlenecks are sort of hard to find at
least when you don't know what you're
looking for
right I have a few last words which I
couldn't fit into this narrative about
this problem properly if you do not know
about the tracing facility snarling do
some reading they are very powerful and
really fun to play with slightly complex
you can fail a lot and bring down
systems especially if you're debugging
life systems you should be very careful
they come with the slowdown red bug is
very useful for debugging systems which
are like what we tended to do when you
used to trace pips you get a lot of
messages spamming your shell or your
process collecting them so we tend to
aggregate them into now intern ETS table
and I create information about how long
time spent in functions and using your
TAS debug size to calculate sizes or
return values and argument sizes but the
point is to aggregate it and to
calculate the average as a moving
average so you don't have tons and tons
of data which is what happens when you
debug assessment alone also it's
important to remember that your system
is not just your Erlang code it's your
entire system with switches and hardware
and disks even if you're an excellent
Ireland programmer if your task with
profiling you will have to learn your
operating system and a bit about your
hardware and which tool you should use
I'm very partial to observer because
it's a very easy way to stop you don't
need to do so much if you cannot use a
graphical thing the top is a viable
alternative definitely so I tend to stop
there and for debugging or like
profiling I tend to use red backing and
you should master and as I showed you in
the beginning it's very useful to
actually visualize your measurements as
well and this has helped us tremendously
and now I'm going to hand over to my
colleague Roberto it's going to tell us
a little bit what were story yeah can
you give me welcome I'm here to tell you
story and this story is about two
developers who are profiling again and
debugging a system that they've seen for
the first time
so they didn't write themselves and what
happened in this kind of cases is that
normally when you perform this kind of
profiling you have a system under test
on one side and you set up some kind of
low generator on the other side and you
start throwing traffic at your system
under test and normally you wait for the
first thing which will break which is
your first bottleneck and you basically
try to face your first bottleneck and
you either write over this so in our
case what happened was that the locking
system actually broke big disclaimer
I'll do the disclaimer later actually so
the way we saw this it was pretty
trivial so even if you start a tool
which is graphical and simple as
observer
you immediately see a process which is
jumping up in the list of processes and
has lot of reductions and he's using a
bunch of memory and he has a big he's
building up a message queue and these
all together are normally the symptoms
of something which is going wrong in
your system so let's try to understand
what happened there and this little
process is called it's registered under
the name of library band and it was in
our system legree event is it's a
process which is part of a very
well-known open source project which is
called lager any of you use lager in
your projects ok so this is a login to
login framework which has been implanted
developed by batch of technologies it's
a nice tool provide some really nice API
to tell the truth this talk is not about
anything bad happening in lager so more
or less you can feel safe and keep using
lager there is nothing wrong with it the
problem was how we were using lager
how the system was actually using the
logging framework also we are not
currently using the latest
version of lager so we are stuck on some
kind of old branch which has been forked
and customized so all these
considerations or I think we are
interesting because they highlight
general earthling issues but they're not
specific to the to the lager framework
so lager is this nice framework which
comes as a knurling application you can
include it in your release and here's
this concept of a overlook manager so
that you can log things log messages so
you have a lot of clients in your code
which will send log request to the log
manager and you can install one or more
handlers into this event manager so that
you can perform different actions every
time you receive a lock request it's
easy to configure so that's our like a
simplified version of our configuration
file for logger where for the logger
application in our sis config we just
specify bunch of angular's for the log
manager so one the first issue that you
have with lager is that has an
interesting architectural choice so it's
basically based on Geneva and you
probably are already aware of this but
in Erlang when you use the airline Jenny
van behavior the actual code which is
run in the event manager and the actual
code which is running in the event
handlers run inside the same context
inside the same process so despite of
what people believe the Jenny event
doesn't work in some in a similar way
where you have a client's and in
requests to managers and you have like
linked handlers which are separate
processes Jenny went in Erlang is more
like this where a client send requests
to a manager and now you execute a bunch
of functions on that event and all these
functions run in the same context so I
mean this should be fairly obvious and
if you read the documentation that
should be pretty clear but the morale
like that should take home is whenever
you use the Jenny vent
aerelon behavior you should try to avoid
blocking or synchronous call in your
handlers big you should try to use your
event manager in a very lightweight
fashion so the event manager the guy who
is coordinating these entire things
should be more considered like a
dispatcher than anything else should
spawn processes whenever you think this
is a meaningful thing to do you should
try to avoid doing things like sending
an SMS synchronously in one of the
handlers because that's going to affect
the performance of your system seriously
and you also should try to avoid having
too many handlers installed in the same
Jan even or in the Event Manager or you
might end up with this which is a
screenshot from observer which can also
show the layout for your applications so
this is actually the system we were
profiling and that little guy there is
actually our lager event yeah our event
manager in in lager so I think we can
definitely say we overuse the login
system in this configuration and maybe
we could refactor this to something
better
okay so there was a long introduction on
like gen event an event manager and we
are all aware that there is this event
manager with a bunch of vendors and we
cannot keep up with the job and we are
building up a queue in the event manager
so the first question we should ask
ourselves is why is having such a big
queue a big problem
aside from obvious reason like of course
I have a big queue so I'm consuming
memory and have a process which cannot
keep up with a with a load but there is
a another tiny reason chip some people
are not aware of and in Ireland every
time you send a message to a process
which has a huge mailbox you get
punished
how many of you knew about this that's
let's start so when I say you get
punished and literally mean punished the
the flag which is using the in beef dot
C code for punishing your process is
actually called the Earth's use sender
punished what it does is if you have a
process which send a message to a
process which has a huge mailbox your
reductions are bumped by four for each
message which is in the queue of the
receiving process and we ended up with a
MN manager with a log logger event with
four hundred thousand messages this
means basically that every time a client
process is trying to log things or to
use like an event manager will
immediately bump reductions and will be
scheduled out immediately so if you have
a like a large mailbox like we had you
really really slow down the rest of the
application in reality is a bit more
complicated than this because each
airline process has to to mailbox like
an internal one an external one and
processes send messages to the external
mailbox and there is an internal logic
so that you pass messages from the
external mailbox to the internal one and
then the local process will consume
messages from the local and internal
mailbox but the idea is if you have a
big process with a huge mailbox that's a
bad thing
so try to avoid that as much as possible
and all you end up with something like
this where the white thing there is your
lager event which doesn't really know
what to do and all these black things
are like processes which are trying to
send messages in there
slow down of course like in the case of
lager the bash oh guys knew about this
no big surprise there clever guys so the
intraday had some kind of overload
protection in lager and in the first
version of lager
they had a most simplistic form of
protection they used synchronous logging
so every time you were sending like a
lock request it was it was using like a
Jenny van
sink notify so that you couldn't ever
build up a queue in the event manager of
course people complained about this and
this is like this is seriously like this
is a airline this is a login framework
should have some a synchronous login
support for sure so in the second
version of lager they introduced this a
synchronous threshold where basically
the way it works is by default all
logging is asynchronous as you would
expect but then they monitor the length
of the queue for the event manager so
every time you pass a certain threshold
which is configurable these loggers
switch to synchronous mode for like self
protection and then you can configure
like the way to go back so that one
situation go back to normality then you
switch back to asynchronous mode of
course you can have different views
about this and I think they are best
summarized by the unicorn versus the
birch this is an actual discussion in
oops in the lager pool request when they
introduced this a synchronous threshold
so the unicorn the unicorn basically in
saying yes I understand
you have problems with building up a
queue but having synchronous logging
means pushing pushing back the load to
the rest of application so if your
locking system cannot keep up with the
work you're slowing down the entire
application and then the blurred replies
well you don't have so many alternatives
the login framework is a crucial part of
your system and if the login framework
is not working correctly there is no
much that you can do so this is some
kind of form of like back pressure that
you want to do and and if you still want
you can still disabled because you can
configure you can disable this behavior
you can still configure the asynchronous
threshold to a very high value and have
a synchronous logging anyway
so we were not sure about how things
worked so we did a couple of attempts
and we try to play with synchronous
logging and it was not good enough it
was it was not fast enough and then we
tried to switch to a synchronous logging
we had some kind of in between
implementations where you could set like
a synchronous severity for difference
like a synchronous levels for severity
of the messages so that for example
error and critical errors are always
synchronous and warnings and in for
debug messages are asynchronous these
kind of things so I will save you the
details on all the analysis we did but
while doing this analysis while doing
this profiling and debugging and trying
these things we noticed a couple of
interesting behaviors and one of this is
we were throwing traffic at a system we
were profiling we have a smart inside we
had our own custom profiler
which was collecting information about
what was going on in the system but also
at an high level we realized that after
we stopped so we were throwing traffic
and the cue for this event manager was
building up and then we were stopping
the load generator and we noticed that
lot of activity was still visible in for
example h stop and all the activity was
restricted to one single core so we
started using d top in this case you use
observer or whatever and then we
realized that was still the lugger event
process was still choking up he had a
very big queue and he couldn't keep up
with a with a load but there was no load
at that time so of course there was some
backlog for the event manager we had
many requests in the queue which we
needed to log and we need to write these
things to to file for example but there
was no idea wait visible in the system
at all so we started monitoring things
and it's like logger event has a bunch
of messages is trying to write into disk
we are no io bound
we have one single scheduler which is
doing a lot of stuff what's going on so
we started with observer and we noticed
that a function in the table where you
have a list of processes the lugger
event was constantly spending time in
the file write function and then we
started digging into that and we started
again with red bug and I don't know if
you're familiar with red bug but
extremely nice so this is basically
starting a tracer for the file module
write function and if you specify this
in this kind of a long style syntax
format return you basically get two
messages you get a message every time
you call the file write function and you
get a message every time you you get the
return value if you specify this option
already true every time you receive this
kind of messages instead of receiving
the lock message itself that you are
logging so the argument for the file
right you just get the era T which is
quite useful for us and also you have
this other option print milliseconds
which will basically display the exact
milliseconds where you call the function
where you return so it's really simple
to make the difference and try to
understand like how much time you spend
in a function so we are talking about
like one-liner which you can write
without any like complicated F probe
analysis or whatever this is like
one-liner you can do it it's easy so
what we realized was every single filed
right operation in our case was taking
like up to 12 milliseconds which was an
enormous amount of time we had four
hundred thousand messages in the queue
and that's basically like one hour to
catch up without any load and then we
started digging into the code of file
right and we are realize our less than
number two which is the the cost of al
right is directly proportional to the
length of the message queue of the
writing process at least in our 15 I
think I saw some changes in the latest
version of air link so in 17 should be
different
so okay try to explain me why this is
true and the reason is this is a
simplified code snippet from the i/o
total module every time you perform an
i/o request what happened there is that
well you do some stuff but the idea is
that you send an i/o request to a
process and then you receive a reply if
you have a long message box like a huge
queue a message cube this is a
selectively receive so it has to go
through the entire mailbox which
explained why we were spending 12
milliseconds for doing for writing a
single line of text into disk there are
a couple of workarounds to this and most
of you are probably familiar with this
they is well known in the community as
the my craft trick so this is a
workaround the workaround is basically
exploiting an optimization which was
introduced in R 14 where the idea is if
I create a reference with make ref and I
send that in a message and I immediately
receive there is an internal
optimization and this is not our job
this was mainly guys like Tobias
pointing us in the right direction if
you do like this kind of trick basically
the VM is clever enough that if you use
them if you specify this reference and
you send it and you immediately match on
the same reference internally will
optimize things so that it doesn't have
to go through the entire mailbox
so you basically solve the problem but
in our case if we want to solve this for
the file right it means that we have to
fork what it be and we need to modify
that bit of code and we need a patch and
this seems like bit complicated so we
went for a simpler alternative the
problem was that all the clients were
sending this log request to the event
manager which was our like an event and
one of the handlers which was one of the
like the file back and in an lager
basically well
performing the filed right but since as
I said that function the handler is
executed in the same process as the
event manager that was basically lager
event the process which had a huge
mailbox which was executing the file
right so we just did a simplest possible
thing we spawn a new process middleman
process so that client send a message to
a manager and we have another process
which is executing the file bride the
request between the manager and the the
middleman process is synchronous so we
actually add more stuff in here but
since this process has never like a
queue the file write was much faster so
in situation like when you have 400,000
messages we saw this decreasing like the
the queue decreasing much faster and we
measure this and we noticed that instead
of 12 milliseconds we were spending less
than a millisecond purbright which was
kind of nice for you that good news is
that this is a very trivial piece of
code but we release it as open source so
under the clarin account there is this
logger middleman back-end which is again
20 30 lines of code and it's pretty
simple you take your logger
configuration wherever you have your
file back-end you drop it into this
middleman and this will do the spawning
for you so you you have this working of
course this is a profiling talk so we
want numbers and you should never
believe me if I give you tell you
stories so we actually try this and we
perform some stress testing and so we
had our own system this was done on this
local machine just for this talk so
numbers are not impressive but we have
our logger system which has 3 file
handlers installed this means that every
time I log something this gets written
into three different files 6 concurrent
workers are sending
requests each of them is producing 100
log requests a second each message is
one kilobyte and we try this simulation
for like 10 minutes if you do the math
you should come up with 1800 file write
operations a second so what we notice
was this graph this is representing the
growth of the message queue in the lager
event so the blue the blue line is
without the middleman you can see like
we are immediately building up a queue
at this point we stop the simulation
because the system is getting
unresponsive so we have this rule of
thumb when the system was that 80% of
memory I stopped otherwise I lose
control of my machine so it was it's
really steep and then the decreasing is
really slow so all these parts of the
graph we basically don't have any load
so this is just to catch up with the
backlog if you apply the middleman it's
slightly better we can continue a bit
longer and then the decrease is a
slightly faster as well and the
interesting one is if you look at times
for file bright it's really nice because
in the case of the middle of the
original file back end in lager which is
the blue line you basically have like at
the beginning you have a like it
constant behavior and at some point you
start building up a queue and then you
get this nice behavior so this is that
time for executing a single file right
but if you use a middleman which has an
empty mailbox all the time is really
constant so the middleman we can say
basically in our case helped is not like
a definite solution but it's useful for
example for bursts of traffic if you
have a parcel traffic and then maybe if
you don't use the middleman is bit bad a
situation but if you use the middleman
you can keep up with a load and it's
easy to recover
and I think I'm done and they asked me
to put this so I I represent Ellen
solutions martin is representing clara
they are both hiring so very interesting
any questions yes we have Sarah I don't
know maybe you tried him a lot I don't
know how you pronounce that it's a term
I loved him a lot and I know if you had
a chance to try this one maybe many
people like I didn't know if the people
audience has experience but sounds like
very many times it brings up people
systems up by switching to this one that
is definitely on the list to do but we
have not tested it yet so I saw somebody
down here so what's the final place for
the parts is it the OTP distribution
with the chains and i/o protocol or is
it like here with these spots included
in there so you mean what solution we
use for the blow I mean now you have
this extra brands but it should be
either integrated you know the P I guess
or in like yeah what do you think
no okay so we have we implemented this
lager middleman back end which sorry
this one and this is an external
application so if you're using lager you
can just include this as an external
application and every time you specify
the back end instead of specifying
filed back and you just put lager
middleman back end and you drop so it
takes the original tuple as a as an
argument so is it not compatible with
the IO protocol itself - you know we
can't can you include this in OTP for
example to happen for every time that
you do a fuck you mean for the Jenna
vent in general or the final write
itself since its using the IO profile
right so the file bright when I looked
at the
the latest master it seems not to have
this problem so it's been fixed so I
don't think that's a problem but in
general this is a problem like if you
even make ref trick I think that's I
mean I know there are some evil things
which have been implemented and internal
checks to verify that they like
generated called it actually contains
the internal optimization these kind of
things but I wouldn't use it I would
solve it in other ways so this was a
simpler way in our case
like my my point of view on this is that
we just overuse lagger and we use it not
in the correct way we had this problem
only because we are we have like I don't
know nine different files be backends
and lot of other stuff installed so Jan
event is not the right choice for that
but something to keep in mind it's not
just related to the i/o system even the
disk lock suffers the same issue so
every time you have a process which is
doing something and if this process has
a huge mailbox and you do a request and
you a do a selectively receive you're in
trouble
anybody know then thank you for the
