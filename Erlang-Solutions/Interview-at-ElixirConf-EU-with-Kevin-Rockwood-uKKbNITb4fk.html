2 or 3 years ago is when I started
getting interested in it I was having
the problem that most Ruby developers
have been scaling our applications and
was just very frustrated with things and
so I decided to look at a few things
that started with closure and then that
had some challenges at the time that
kind of yeah and then I found elixir and
haven't looked back Jana Jana
regarding here talked on protocols what
what would lead you to pick specifically
that subject so I saw protocols is like
a really powerful thing but not a lot of
not a lot of material out there about it
is you know those chapters in the books
but there's not a lot of like practical
examples or like what problem is
actually solved so I kind of wanted to
start at the beginning and be like this
is the reason why this feature exists
and kind of build it up from there all
right have you been to any hassle it's
accomplices no this is my more your
opinion by the cloud and what do you I
would use about the conference yeah
that's so far yeah I mean certainly
Barcelona is awesome and I think you
know this was like a huge part of the
community is in this room so it's really
cool to be able to talk to people that
had converse one on github and yeah like
I actually put faces
so yes burning the your experience of
elixir if you were to trying to
extrapolate what you've seen next five
years what are you expecting to happen
well I I honestly am looking forward to
just having a very solid platform you
know I don't I don't have a I don't see
a need for like somewhat revolutionary
new feature who's not in a short term
but just kind of to solidify this the
you know the tool aiming to get things
just kind of like built to a point where
like there's lots and lots of production
applications that we can all look at and
learn from it and get to the next level
of understanding of the community about
this platform so so kingag is walled it
when you are coding what do we do to
stay productive I try to turn off all
social network apps and I want to either
yeah yeah yeah I mean so many things I
do I really believe in tester them and
so I use tests to as much as I can to
keep kind of like progressing forward
and I I try really hard to collaborate
with my team so keeping people talking
and kind of getting somebody's kind of
working together is I think really
important for keeping keeping like the
all moving forward know you uh where to
tell someone who's trying to get to
elixir or interest in the lexer and one
thing that you wish you knew when you
started all about it hmm I probably I
could go back I probably would have
studied just like functional
fundamentals
I don't know if there's any good books
out there about just like maybe every
level this book or something like
because I came from a very lol
background so the making that transition
was definitely challenging
I mean it just it just like you have to
rewire your brain and think and so that
was once you get over that it's like
everything's very obvious but that was
different challenge so definitely know
what's going on Kayla yeah yeah all the
gamer below background yeah well thank
you so much retired yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
