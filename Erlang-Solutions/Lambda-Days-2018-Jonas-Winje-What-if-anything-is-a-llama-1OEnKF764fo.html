says recursion
sites linked to themselves so the slides
are online if lines lines of text are
underlined they're linked so if we check
all the slides you can click links and
stuff like that that's my Twitter and
that's my github so kind of a disclaimer
I I'm usually doing talks together with
an IDE and usually he does most of the
talking
and we don't have proper sides so I'm
trying to do like a proper talk it'll
probably be like we're done full of
mistakes but you're hoping for no one
so hi I hope like objects this isn't a
very good joke but I'm going to open a
small talk image and it has objects in
it and you know everything's an object
so that's good and then so the first
part is like some background on why this
is a talk and some intro and sort of
what it's going to be about I'm going to
show a little bit your script code and
it will touch some some general
functional programming things I hope and
this will be some kind of web developer
writing stuff together from the
perspective of someone who doesn't know
how to develop development and this is
sort of mildly related but it's a quote
I liked a lot so I put it on the slides
because it's an opportunity to link to
that interface so this thing with having
like one good idea I think I decided
that as far as conference cisco my good
idea has been to put evaluators inside
text editors so i'm we have been doing
that for some years and for some reason
I get invited to conferences and the
reason I did that was that because when
I started looking in to lambda calculus
I looked at the Wikipedia page for
lambda calculus and I
started writing things like this this
note sir so I wanted something like this
but where I've made less mistakes and
not which is kind of like an texted text
editor and so I tried to put those
mechanisms into a text editor and this
is kind of the reason why booted up a
small talk image because by day I just
fair amount of Smalltalk programming and
so the the idea of like putting
evaluation into a text editor is like
surely not my idea because in small talk
when I really like working on a method
so this is the method definition and
you're writing a useful method and if
you suddenly like one thing like what is
two plus four it can press some shortcut
and have it evaluated and it means to
result in the editor so that's kind of
how smooth doc does the kind of ripple
they read about printing so pretty much
whenever you get to write code you can
also evaluate code so that was kind of
natural for me to decide that yeah I
want to output of the things I'm writing
sort of paste it into there they told
that I'm working in this is kind of neat
but it's really surprising to people who
are new to small talk because sometimes
you expect that you are the one who is
writing code in your editor but on the
small talk system kicks in under stuff
if you're lucky it will like paste every
messages into your code because we tried
to save something that won't compile
instead like that so it's full of
surprises
and that led to talks that tend to look
like this
they're full of lambdas so because I put
like a lambda call facility in the text
editor and I showed it to some friends
and colleagues we made a talk of to it
and some years later we got to do a talk
here I copied this from the five branded
of it last year
you're here I think it's part of the
computation that in the US the
multiplication of ten times ten or
something so yeah
we ended up being here last year and
after we talk someone actually asked
this like well if if we want to do this
I reduce this in the course or something
where can i download this tooling or can
I use it easily and that's not the
question you usually get we didn't have
like a good answer for it we had I had
answers like there's a sublime plug-in
that was the first version that I made
that has the kind of awkward install
procedures because I never looked into
how to do like proper super amphibians
and also know by now that parts of it
are incorrect and then there's a kind of
MX setup using standard ml which is what
we used last time you sir
he stays I use a max with a racket
program running in the background and
the two last ones are like nice answers
to give if someone likes Emacs
particularly if they happen to have left
standard ml or racket installed if they
don't it's not like the existing to link
someone to having said that so Alice oh
good answer would be to have like a link
and we said go to this link and then you
can play with stuff in your browser so
me and I and I talked about this and it
sounded like a nice thing to have and I
basically don't know anything about web
development but I started looking
looking into it mmm so it's kind of give
somebody
conclusion I guess okay yeah I'm like so
we ended up with this thing that runs in
the browser and you can do most of the
things that we did in last year's talk
and define a bunch of stuff the
computation and get a tonal Amba's
that's kind of where it answered and
yeah there were basically two things I
wanted to I wanted to have this editor
that people could pair on with and I
also wanted to be able to write like
blog post with lambda syndrome so I
wanted to be able to embed this editor
multiple places in the page and have
text surrounding it and instead of just
having a few examples and insisting that
this is going to work if someone were to
read it they could you know run the
stuff in the browser inside the blog
post so those are kind of my goals and
the challenge then was that I didn't
know how to do web stuff but like I
mentioned I've done some standard ml I
played the Haskell I've used all my
little I haven't earlier version of the
editor running in Elm
except it's not actually another editor
but at least it's another page and I
knew that pure script is attained and
pure shipped is very similar similar to
Haskell and husky is kind of similar to
a standard now so I figured it per
script I fit beams to write some code in
JavaScript I might not and I know like
very basic HTML and I picked up the CSS
I needed in order to make you know pages
that look this fancy and roughly the
same time someone mentioned Minako
Minako is code editor that runs in the
browser it's used by a Visual Studio
code
and there are multiple editors running
in browser but someone said the bird
Minako and I had heard about Visual
Studio code and so I try to use that I'm
sure any editor would be a good choice
for me I don't have like very high
demands and don't want syntax
highlighting I well if an expression
like doesn't parse it's usually just to
add parentheses until it does so it's a
it's a simple language I don't I'm that
difficult needs so yeah the first second
part of the presentation will be the
pure script bits and yeah first give
this language that has like a bunch of
sensible things like in standard them
all lissa it has a bunch of weird
Haskell stuff and mostly avoid the very
high school stuff but I kind of
encounter it in the libraries libraries
I use so I haven't made my own type
chests and stuff like that but sometimes
you have to like implement a type dress
or make an instance of a type yes in
order to do stuff like print a value in
in your Apple mmm so the parsnip code is
going to be sort of the same kind of
code I would write in standard ml or F
sharp for the most part and it's getting
started page four for pure script it
looks like this and basically what I did
was I found this page I did all the
things it said I should do so I install
NPM I installed pure script using and
then install Pro and Babur so perp is
sort of build tools that helps you set
up a public project for your script I've
no idea what sleeve and payment over and
stuff like that but I like dealt with
some made and stuff so I'm used to the
idea of installing a package manager
with the package manager and then I
I grabbed the first thing I found for
reducing as an editor which was I so
some people were using Adam I'm not sure
if I had used that them before but it
seemed to have like easy info procedures
so I don't know that Adam and with a
couple of plugins you can make it raw
like dotted lines under stuff that is
wrong and it will do like syntax
coloring in stuff like that so I don't
know that Adam I found the settings and
I search for pure script and I clicked
the to first install things I did not
take the following things because they
were for you know type script or just
script so they were other stuff I'm not
entirely sure you need both of them but
I think so and then you get like these
intellisense things you you get like the
documentation that's taken from the
source code from comments there for the
fingers lifting and a nice idea thinks
you might want and you get stuff like
excellent exclamation point on the side
there and these underlined thing there's
a red dotted line under girl if you look
so so you can see that I written tour
where I should have written turn and
then we can get the error message that
the pure skipped compiler would give you
and I discovered that if I mouse over
the XML part and then move over to the
bit Oh underlined code I get like two
other messages of on top of each other
which I thought was nice and yes so part
one is also about lambda calculus kind
of unfortunately because that's the like
core domain of my application so it's a
formal system for computation it's to
remove it it has functions and that's
about it
so what I want to do is I want to be
able to read stuff like this parse it
into a nice data structure structure and
do like computational navigation and
print the results turn back into strings
or something and it consists of three
things
there's lamb likes abstractions those
are functions it has function
application which are like function
calls and you have variable references
this means you can like this is the
syntax tree I guess so an expression
like this u is map ocation where the
left-hand side is a function and the
right-hand side is this reference to the
variable bar and you see inside there is
an application and the reference and so
on mmm so I need like a data structure
to represent this stuff this is how
people like to write like the syntax if
they're doing like textbooks and stuff
so you have an expression u it can be a
variable it can be an abstraction that's
lambda X dot u or it can be an
application and if I translate that to
like pure script old you get data
structure and it's supposed to be like
roughly the same thing you have
variables so we have our string it has a
string which is the variable name
you have lambdas and you have
applications and it's a recursive type
so you see that term shows up in like
right hand side which refers to the data
type that is being defined so we want
something to this to like parse to
something like this
so parsing research for pure script and
parsing and I get a library called pure
scape parsing it
kind of okay for parsing and well it's
what does it say it's based on hospitals
parsecs so it's a partially Community
Library and I get like some kind of nice
code it's a theme going on where you
have to pass in a partially that's
supposed to be the Parsee for the whole
expression into the and a parsing of a
lambda that needs to parse an expression
that can contain you and there's some
recursive stuff that complicates things
so it's like a pheromone the stuff ends
up being like a puncture function from a
partial to a partial there might be like
it better if it was just a parser it's a
partial monad I think so you get used
like the Haskell do notation if you do
several things and some of it it's
readable nice so we get stuff like well
it should start with a string that they
see the lambda character you can use a
backspacing if you don't like to use
lambdas and then identifier comes next
and we this is the name of party that
parses like variable names and we keep
that in the in a variable name P and we
want a dot we're not interested in this
return value or this return oh yeah
and we parse an expression and then we
can the return with this pure thing
which is one of those melodic operations
a lambda with the parameter and the body
we parsed so those are kind of list the
code reads nicely I think and you can
see sort of by knowing what the syntax
is like you can find the same token
stare and you have stuff like this which
runs off the screen so in order to
person identifier I have a set of
dessert
characters that should not appear in
identifiers and I use some stuff like
Manny Wong which should only succeed if
there is more than one character that
should satisfy that the character is not
a member of the set they served and then
it's like stuff going on which we won't
get into and then there are some
functions that I kinda like template
implementational because it's like
between these two things
there should be an X so between two
parentheses there can be an expression
and you high status as you would so it
will result in the same as just parsing
the expression and you get like this
type and I have no idea what is going on
there's there are parts of T T's which I
think might mean like the moment
transform is for parsers so like Haskell
people like to tell you that you get a
lot of information from the types and
it's kind of you better get a lot of
information from types because there's a
lot more type than the implementation
here really sad if you didn't so that's
like a couple of person functions yeah
all the links are to like get them bits
where those lines show up and on parsing
that's all my all of my own parsing code
you won't get into the details but it
turns terms into strings so if it's a
variable than the name of the variable
is the strings it does like pattern
matching on the type we defined earlier
and it calls some parse recursively on
like some terms and this bit extreme
compassion hmm so that's one thing they
want to do we want to turn these things
back and forward between strings and
these terms and then there's the
computation bit so side note is that we
don't look at variables in the scope
like if you implemented say a lisp
within a lisp
you might have done this thing where
a function is defined to be you know f
of X is X plus X and the implementation
technique is often like well if you find
f applied to the number two you kind of
keep in mind that X no means two and you
evaluate this expression and whenever
you come to an X you look up in your
environment what the value of x is but
the way we like to think about this is
that f of 2 is 2 plus 2 so when you get
to something like this we take this
thing here and we replace all the XS
with twos again this is kind of the
thing I was I've written like this
terrible slide we'll probably can't make
up those going on but this is what
you're doing by hand if you're doing
like lambda calculus by hand and I want
to mention this book because I really
like that when I read this book it in
the first chapter they introduced like
the substitution model for procedure
application which does this thing and
it's kind of how they suggest that you
should think about application
procedures or functions and then in
chapter 3 they're introduced like these
set by operators of the assignment thing
and the substitution model falls apart
and they have to like think about these
environments being carried around don't
they look through or something we call
the reducible expressions or read X
which is an application and there's a
lambda abstraction as the function bit
and some expression as the argument so
we look at something like this and we
should be able to like find this
application and pick out these parts and
when we have done that we do the thing
we call better reduction which is we
keep the body of the lambda but we
replace all the references to its
parameter by the argument so we really
want to like find this argument and the
body of lambda in addition to the
argument being passed then so we want to
like look at something like this and
find these bits and pieces of it so we
want to find that the argument is barred
the parameter is age the body is this
stuff and then we have like this stuff
and we want to do like swoosh and get
this stuff back
so given this thing we want to find this
and replace all the a speed bar so this
is like the beta dose computation so
finding a reducible expression that's
you know finding these things with
keeping this bit but we just I'm just
showing you the bit that checks if an
expression is reducible I'm not showing
you the code that kind of searches
through the syntax string so we have
some stuff for looking through a tree
and looking for something we have this
verdict function which checks if a
function is a reducible expression and
this is kind of a kind of function code
with pattern matching that I like a lot
so we make the data type which holds
something like where we want this stuff
like these three things the argument the
parameter and the function body so we
have a radix data type which has a term
that is the argument and a string that
is the parameter and the term that is
the function body we are going to do
substitution and then if it is an
application and it has a lambda then we
pick out these bits which is the
argument the function body and the
parameters the function body and the
argument that is passed as function and
return this relics and if it's something
else we return nothing
so using that maybe types same as we
would in haskell and like
given this thing we started with this
much we're doing here
should much like the app should match
this and the landfill much this and so
on and we were able to pick out the bits
we are interested in so for the code we
were writing here if we get to that part
then the variable P is bound to the
string and the B is bound to the
function body and so on and then it's
the substitution bit so we want to do
like this thing and the substitution
function well it does this thing so it
takes somebody that is it's going to do
substitution on and it takes the
parameter that is going to be replaced
and takes the argument that that is
going to replace the parameter and I'm
gonna get this kind of nice pattern
matching function and say if it's an
application we call this helper function
on the function bit and the argument bit
and we sort of reassemble it so we get
an application back and if it's a lambda
we do the same thing and then in some
shenanigans in case the parameter we are
replacing are being reused for them and
I tend the important bit is that if we
get too variable and it is equal to the
parameter we are replacing we just
return the argument or else we return
the variable we start of it and then you
know the code contains like additional
stuff for we want like top-level
definitions and we need to like this
isn't enough the computation needs a bit
of additional stuff to deal with
what if variables are like shadowing
each other and you're substituting
something into the wrong place but this
is kind of the essence and it's a
function that I think kind of nicely
follows the data type definition it's
recursive in the way the data type is
recursive it matches all the cases all
that stuff
me and I have done a talked as it is
about this kind of code where we
implement an evaluator so I stole a
couple of slides from that so the idea
is that we want to end up with some
program like this where we get into the
strings we parse them we do these beta
reductions and the output should be this
intermediate steps of computation and I
wanted to mention this thing called
boolean blindness which is a blog post
by Robert Harper and it's often a good
idea to return the stuff you need for
the next bit of computation instead of
like returning a boolean which is seldom
the thing you need in order to do the
next thing so a thing you might do if
you're writing this function is to do
say that the red X function that checks
if an expression is reducible should
return a boolean but what I'm doing here
is I return value of this type that
contains all the stuff that disappear
substitution function happens to lead so
it's kind of nice when these things fit
together so you see the term might give
me a red expect substitution requires a
red X to move on so the data types are
kind of important I guess is my point
and kind of unsurprisingly if you have
like better data types to begin with the
functions you end up with are also
better if you introduce lambdas to
JavaScript and I know to Java and you
don't introduce like some types and
stuff you get like more functions but
you might not get like more interesting
types for them so it gets a bunch of
mapping stuff but it might not be that
much easier to write in a good
functional style
also it totally did like the thing I
think is really dumb
the first time around so in the Python
code for this blind Fabian I did this
thing where I returned a boolean and I
ported it to Elm and I did the same
thing and I ended up with this pattern
much that only matches this thing
because I know that since this thing we
turned true then this thing will always
match and I get like non-exhaustive
matches warnings and in later versions
of Elm it won't compile so I switched a
new language so this is the last part so
since pew skipped us kind of mostly
straightforward functional code if you
like used to that kind of functional
language bit where I didn't know what I
was doing was when I needed to like put
it inside web based so there's a thing
about like functional architecture or
sometimes called like only an
architecture and stuff like that but you
want to have like fewer functions nice
values in your kind of core domain bit
and outside of that you can have like
layer with States and effects and stuff
like that in high school this is often
done with using like the IO thing so the
main function is of type I or something
and you can do all the effects and stuff
and we call into these pure functions
inside in fear scape they have the F
monad which i think is roughly like IO
but more specific so you have stuff like
a console type which only does console
effects and in this book that I like to
mention I think called modernized algal
which is kind of the same idea but they
use an auto language which has commands
and stuff and then in the language with
it which is purely functional so I
thought well I could if I don't want to
look into F I can you know use this book
as an excuse to say that well my auto
language is
script and it will do effects and stuff
and I'll have like a nice functional
core written in pure script so I made
like a couple of new script libraries
and then I did sort of wiring in
JavaScript where I connected it to the
web page and to the Minako editors and
well this is kind of the idealized then
dependency diagram for the application
in reality the HTML file refers to the
JavaScript being included because that's
how browsers do things but that's my
ideality I have this stuff and I inside
and it should know about Menaka should
know what you know what my web page is
like and it should know about my nice
functional core the core domain bit I
think I've done like reasonable properly
I call it pure script lamps it's the
implementation of the lambda calculus
evaluator that they looked at earlier
and right I don't
so probably that I have uploaded it to
power and to pursuit with which is like
the documentation thing so you can look
at stuff like well what does and parse
does it owns the parse and get like nice
nice documentation comments from the
source code the other bits I have not
done as properly so few script lambdas
which is my sort of anti-corruption
layer I think it exposes functions that
I'm you can easily call from JavaScript
and it depends on my lambda code but
that's just a gator project I have lying
around and what I what I ended up doing
was I found this command which is called
glorify it comprises and builds your
project and everything you put in your
main dot purse file it exposes as some
JavaScript file which you can require
with
requires thing so what I decided was how
it turns out that pure script from since
I've done exposed like regular
JavaScript functions and if you use
types like string and bool then those
are equal to the JavaScript values that
have so you can call them with the
regular JavaScript strings regular
JavaScript boolean and so on so I made
some like helper functions that make it
easier to like start with a JavaScript
string and get this top-level thing and
not have to deal with like what is
inside my top-level thing
in JavaScript code but instead have like
functions that gave me strings back so
in order to let make a step of
computation I can from the JavaScript
code call parse and then call step and
I'll have the string that is the next
bit so I won't have to like look into
the data structures from JavaScript and
mostly deal with sort of simpler types
mmm we could test some of this in the
JavaScript console but I don't think we
really have time but once I have like
required it I do this require thing and
I hold on to lamps done from JavaScript
I can write stuff like this and I'll get
stuff back so if I do lamp step Oh this
stuff I will get the string back if I
get do it's just I will get to move in
back and I can do regular JavaScript
code for that so yeah I
this bit of the talk is also kind of
showing off how little JavaScript I know
so later discover that there are things
called a constant things in JavaScript
and we don't have to write function but
in this code it's done like this so yeah
I figured like the way to write
JavaScript this problem by copying and
pasting from Stack Overflow so I mostly
done that any other then there's the
Minako bit
NACO exists a nicer thing so I didn't
have to build it and I don't know that
that thing that contained like minified
javascript sources and I put it
somewhere where I could reach it and
then there was this I don't know if it's
a Microsoft thing or just a require
thing but I got bitten by this bit where
Minako uses some other require thing
that isn't the same thing as the thing I
used for the first thing and I had no
idea what to do i hack the rounded stuff
and I put things in different files and
somehow it ended up working so I think
the reason this rect main exists and
it's not just part of stuff don't know
this which is a much better name is that
I had to like go around this record it
require nonsense in some way and the
Minako thing is kinda nice I do
JavaScript surface I take all the
elements that I have called lamps I'm
not sure why I'm using a name instead of
a cluster but given some some HTML page
my JavaScript code will run through it
and sort of push in Monaco editor
whenever it finds one of these lamps
elements and it will call like start
editor with the element as an argument
if we look at as of this bit given an
element we do macro editor Trey
I emptied the contents of it first and
put it as the contents in the editor so
if you don't have JavaScript running you
will get like the text I vote if you
have JavaScript running I will remove it
from the HTML but I will put it in the
editor editor instead so I can write
like an HTML page with sections that are
lambda calculus and if the JavaScript
stuff works out it will pick out all
sections and put the contents into
little editors and then this is a couple
examples of doing stuff with Minako you
do like add command you can do this this
pace that I want to be able to press
ctrl L in order to encircle lambda
character so it does this stuff and
again this is me writing JavaScript but
I wanted to feel like one of them one of
the commands that like uses my peer
script Odin uses some of the fancier
Monaco bit so we have stuff like you
pick out the line that your that your
cursor is on in Monaco and there's stuff
happening and you hear you parse that
line with my pure script function and it
is some top-level definition stuff that
we want to get into and later on you
insert and put a new line beginning and
I make some Monaco operation where I
insert this post stuff that's Minako bit
and the remaining bit is doing the HTML
page and I use racket for writing HTML
because racket is a programming language
and it has parentheses that I like
better than this since it's a variant of
scheme but it's basically just some web
page as a regular texture net and here
and there I can put dibs and I'm maybe I
should've written name
classic well then we sort of saw the
appropriate attribute on the devs that I
want to be editors and then I hope for
the JavaScript stuff to pick out this
stuff and replace it with an editor that
contains the same text and yeah so the
conclusion is like okay yes that worked
out nicely I managed to do the thing I
wanted to do and I it wasn't as painful
as I was anticipating I guess we kind of
forget that I have like it I want to tie
like parts in an appendix
so the appendix is the beta to skip it
so one time I was not pure skipped broke
might some of my stuff but it only
happened one time so I'm pretty happy
with it it's inversion point now zero
point eleven or something so it's
probably should be like expected only
broke all my stuff so I'm happy with
this this type justice stuff I don't
like that if you this can be kind of
intimidating so you make like a rally or
a wreck you type and it just such
sorting at you this bit of escape if I
could polling I thought was weird you
can write this instead of this if the
expression and the label you give a
thing it's the same which is maybe nice
it doesn't have to poles it was covering
instead I don't know if you notice but I
try to make all the slides that are like
this hikers but at this point I didn't
[Laughter]
then frantic well I had come up with a
lot of seven syllable things so this
will do so since it uses currying so the
thing I was sorry about carrying is that
it doesn't always do wonders for error
messages and if you so the typical
example is when you forget to apply so
passing the last argument to a function
you don't get like this is missing an
argument because you applied three
arguments and I got the function back
instead of applying for arguments I'm
getting something else back so you might
get every messages like this could not
match type ran to exactly the X X which
is nice enough because I can tell that
this type is a value of this type is
just missing
I ran whatever that is in order to give
me an X X but once you get so the parent
function with the fancy types gives you
fancier type errors so if I remove this
X I get this type error so it has a
bunch of type variables and I mentioned
that I did not introduce some of them
are similar to the ones that are in the
type so like a B and M there's n woman B
2 and a 0 so when I get to this
I either stare at the code until I know
how to fix it or I erase all the code
and write it again and hope I don't end
up here so yeah that's it
