companies people asking the female
developers to all just organize this
thing can you just oversee the new
person and can you just like train this
person and slowly slowly that kind of
diverted away from a technical work and
obviously I'm generalizing but women are
very accommodating and often they're
like oh yeah you know that's easy for me
I'll do that but I have seen like even
myself i fat about time to take a step
back and like say look this is really
die bad to me and I'm doing this
full-time now and I want to be on this
technical track so I think you would
have be really aware like you're only
rowing career and it's up to you to keep
making choices as best as you think will
suit you but on the other side like I
think it's like programming is hard and
you've got to like keep persisting with
it and it's easy to think you come
somewhere like this and everybody knows
more than you or like you know everybody
knows what I'm going to talk about and
that kind of thing where you just have
to fight it and put yourself out there
and like be brave I remember the first
time I went to like a meet-up I was not
looking forward to it at all but the
more you go like the easier it gets and
then you meet a few people and I've
definitely seen more women at things I
go to nowadays it's still not like no
Enya even half sometimes but there's
definitely more around in the community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
