from index introduction reaching for
passport them before that war this is
confirm earlier to value of property
based testing picture all the tests
fought a lot so for those were not i
will show you some conifer that's a
minus half live demo almost bit scary
but rules final so most developers agree
the 20 test is very used you aren't sure
using to my chest now yesterday so it
will also it gets very very boring very
quickly on so that's why a lot of
developers they they write a test or get
to and there's no resolution fun spirit
and our sure you avoid testing is so
boring if you don't already know it but
let's assume that we want to test that
the lists sequence function in airline
because an error version does exactly
the same thing as the email data list
function in your lips are so i hope you
know most efficient and then you should
know it either to this and pull em from
elixir but you might know that there's
also in this secret functionality you
need to care about if you develop from
something in your new to the language
which you know they outline you probably
think all those things will do say so
let's guess that they actually do the
same so how would you go about that well
of course you move on soon you're in
texas right initial elixir program you
would you let using a mix project so you
write your module simple you only use
actually case in watching your new test
cases of you get good name I the things
you were saying and you have some
assertions and you say if I you list
sequence 125 an airline it should better
be the same as this either to this one
below find elixir this is what did she
do and the same negative number 11
posted on the right hand side let's try
a lower order case private roll a bigger
button below 0 vector B holy should be
morality and then you can run those
tests and they will pause okay move you
is happy now about this test none of you
exactly because all of you have a
combined one test case that I haven't
written it out the end so I often ask
students to say okay now big bad paper
and write the model test is that you
move an added to the system and if there
are about 80 people in the room here
then at least 80 of them will come with
the test page which is different from
auntie I
at 60 different assets that I have to
look at to this sweet and the big big
breasteses why do I use those values on
people who take all the values and how
many tests shall we actually writing now
for development this is all far too much
but as a developer you don't want to sit
there and think about another 60 test
case for this cubic function after those
three networks or you probably come up
with for four because you're what I want
extra that's a month so it's boring to
come up with more you have already
tested something so violent with you I
go from property rights testing so it's
step right in test cases as they work
the values that are used to those texts
they aren't also reported there are more
or less presently children and chocolate
values will go off though they make our
test cases they have some water cases
polity I chose them with care but it was
not absolutely important as one step 10
I could have chosen the test case minus
a take a shot that's a random choice a
traitorous head at the time so why not
use that as kind of a property of the
sort to know at least for me
stage 2 properties we say something for
more general than those things often to
the left values we basically say no
matter which values you get it should
always be the same in an extra you might
like this you use if you see X unit as a
package that console creature and the
property would be like a test consult a
Spencer property property LLC do full mm
which you take from the domain integers
an integer so this is mathematics this
is back to to university right if this ?
able upside down for all those things a
man n which are taken from those domains
it should better beauty case that list
sequence MN is equal to list of a mobile
app now this is equally rich variety as
this all right actually to the test but
here it has all the cases and they
attest to educators so I prefer this
because access work in the moment and IQ
test no this is simple example with this
in general holes that you might last a
intestinal so let's see what happens if
i run those tests with mix test and
reach out and i hope things will work
out fine recently formed is you in
bolton so here i have my my property
let's go example both in kc exs this
program of wrinkles my happiness is my
example it's exactly as I shoulders like
just before this
I got the name for this this book i Goti
elixir expert advice on how to write
equals function so not actually display
snarling screams no so this is a
last-minute thing Thank You Martin from
other yarder and let's do it mix test of
this example so it makes tests you can
run the whole test set or just one and I
have some more testing that directors
are the only ones a relative test
example you see X this one so what
happens now it's a subscript check and
it starts it will say failing filth like
slightly larger between completely
finished now it tells me that the dust
gets filled yeah the reason was that
they go to exit message folks across in
this series 1-1 there's a last and it
says of the six test I found a test case
for you which did it match your property
your property is not true there is the
failing test case demonstrating that
your property is not true the failing
test case is then symbolized by one
minus one so that's the test case the
demonstrated but this car comes random
random thought that critic traverses so
they might not be the minimum values at
you apart so actually they're pretty
chick is looking for smaller villages
but which we call straightening and says
0-1 that's the minimum value you can
find for which your test case to your
goatee face and the reason why it feels
is that if I do 0-1 an error as a list I
get the empty list whereas the elixir
catalyst
zero comma minus all and that was the
equals thing that was in my property
showing this on the screen then I get so
this is a differential output and then
here we have kind of integration with
makes test which i am sure i can improve
but it will trade you the property you
have been testing and it will print the
values for which it has failed and this
time and that makes you 0-1 says if i do
this property for that value that is the
law but that's preacher in a nutshell
instead of writing test cases of
thinking or what Sal you should i use
here you will just generate
automatically your values and you'll see
what happens cool so that's one now we
want to go back to my presentation of
the earthworks so we do this we have no
more demo and a little bit terminology
these days the domain for which I take
my my data set is called the generator
because it to randomly generates data
there this whole thing is called the
property so I should see it will fill it
fill in a different case on the top
there after second test I had a fail a
test case minus one minus two which
didn't give this exit message because I
actually didn't crash here huh / to get
a normal message and with the list were
not not equal and that's
I'm actually testing and here I had a
slightly older version of my parental
soy say the counter example which is
this one about this event so you will
find different test case is fading your
system all the time simple example let's
do another simple example just always
nice to learn by example this in
Malaysia an elliptical string and
there's a Down case in the case all
right you will know any signals who's
using down case a nut case if you'll be
a few answer good then you will know the
answer later on but what unit test do
you think that people run in perkasie
blankets everything what kind of typical
cars things that you want small way the
case is big name right that's a lot of
our 10 case is one that's your thing and
then you come up with one more that's
guess but that's boring this is one more
before more desert we have a team or
destination that's good we get lots of
test cases and lots of guests probably
related to test your system but what is
the proper Kaiba take a moment that's
much more ethical thing I mean I fooled
you before because I was a very simple
tee everyone can come up with that one
which corner the Proteas will
you will do it up case and dumb case and
then it would be the same as original
not always not if you start with an
uppercase so you're almost there almost
there so what you could do is I'd
important see you do the down case and
it would be really really really really
surprised if you do damned case twice
you get a different clip with you that
would be very surprised if you could so
let's go unimportance in computer
science it says if you apply the
function twice you should get the same
amount is the first time you could do
that and of course we have all have a
generator huge utf-8 straight and of
course quickly comes with the generator
food ugh straightforward you could not
justice so this is property you take any
utf-8 string you dumb case it and you
don't listen to twice and the result
should be the same that's what we
actually want to show and then this is
my demo button here that I can transfer
it to my bottom okay so there we are my
life demo and all the windows of course
in different places because that's how
that works so here we have two cupcakes
our case see bigger tip this is the
function now we were a number of tests
here now okay Douglas in DC there we are
slightly better so it is readable from
the back so i'm not going to do mix test
with that property i have there i will
run it and i will pause a hundred test
beautiful this function really works I
don't know no one absolutely fantastic
another one I know hundreds
and it's good because this is what you
expect actually we could do what you
proposed to do something with up case
yes well so let's think about this you
take an arbitrary character it can be
uppercase character but then okay should
look at any effect so you take an option
captain you make it up a case out of
that you make a lowercase out of that it
should be the same as taking the
arbitrary string or character maybe it
into that locus but if I have something
which might or might not be the lower
case and make an application out of it
and then I may be lower case out of it
it's the same as just make an old case
out of it straight away isn't it you
will use this function is this true no I
don't know there are unicode characters
that are right one character lowercase
and three characters are more okay so
would it be better than to say uppercase
in a dumb kid would that work better
it's all the same rubbish so formative
didn't really notice that suit the
difference like me I would immediately
get third apart so I wrote number of
tests I have to learn 60 actually that's
good shape the shape but I get this
these two characters I actually know the
same as those two well I can make it
bigger as much as I what you will not
see the difference here on the screen I
think the screen doesn't really know to
print it the different cat but then it
shrinks a little bit do you find the
minimum character for which they are
different and this is the minimum
stratum which if I make this into
upper case and I'm back into it locates
actually adds up here which is creating
the same I mean semantically so that's
what we check the screen don't care
about your random values don't care
about finding tricky test cases just
give it the property you think it should
hold room it can find out that lizard on
any you have to adapt your devoted to
make it actually hold and in this case
we don't feel you know what that
property should be firm you sure to put
in all of the case rounded and then say
this is father this isn't written with
your campus okay so that's property
based testing you write something you
think this should definitely be true you
earn it and you find an island edges of
the direct or they get misunderstood the
software this is all very nice but in
your software assignment you're hardly
ever write this kind of simple code this
is stainless code just doing something
with data and if you do the same time
exactly the same stuff easy to my
properties about probably not that easy
but at least you get my properties but
what if you have state oh by the way i
did also print a few other examples if
in case i wouldn't find it right so this
is what i found yesterday company come
by i'm not actually the same fire fire
of the same these things are these are
the literature you've put in apps
together until you get nice strange
results there but this is simple
software this is a stateless absorber so
how do we lose the Pretty better
practices will be generated data then we
run are no tests or bored that's just
how many you want to learn and then you
check that the property horse and I love
property holds and then you really have
to check that you did that's right thing
we approve does not halt and then you
have to go into devoting more to make
sure that you actually find out why your
software dissing holding sometimes you
write you run more tests like that a
beautiful hotel we are writing you can
add those difference all you try another
property like we did as well by changing
their application the double case or you
trace the code they say this is why
things don't work so software has
certain properties and the things that
are should pause all through the
software is little bit like requirements
and a test case is one verification that
the certain property off and a property
is basic saying your requirement walls
because I tested all the possible cases
so that's what you want to do but in
real software properties of course
organized real software estate
properties need to be stateful right
because otherwise it doesn't make sense
so how do you make a stateful property
how do you transfer this idea of
generating data to the stateful world in
which we live software which I take you
want a test the thing is is Stanford
generating the data part you generate a
complete test test so picture will
generate complete testing for your
sequences of operations that's what the
thing is showing your test cases are
normally seekers of aggression start the
system do this do that do that do that
do that service you have sure that
that's your normal sequence a check can
make those sequences for you and I'll
show you how to unit and the thing you
get for free is the magnet just has
fails the tricks these random sequence
shrinking to a minimum faith
test case which shows you very clearly
what the reason for failure is and that
that's a nice thing to have because it
makes emerging easier to analyze why
something is broken a small test case
session days of debugging if you if
you're given under the command to take
all the doesn't work when you get three
demands and it doesn't work makes a lot
of different so I'm going to demonstrate
that by a very very simple example I'm
not sure people have this thing thing in
component or wherever you come from but
this is the thing that I'm going to
implement my sofa this is what the
dispatcher in English the fact that they
have a word for it means they are today
as well Sweden is full of those things
funny every shop as a ticket dispenser
and people have them to take a number
estate they don't have them to stay in a
line what you can disorganize stay in
the shop doing this if peoples are not
there that's very important as we in so
you just take that number you stay again
at the moment that the counter says you
it's your number you jump in and that's
your time so without that Sri society we
completely collapse very bored with him
you really need it and this is why you
have to implement the software because
we have to go with our time right you
can't have that in paper anymore so we
make in the toilet brush it has two
operations to take operation and the
reset operation sometimes you actually
happen to get too many customers that's
boring enough but then you have to
replace drop but you open it you put in
your own and is thoughtful who's your
okay that's a recent approach simple any
one of us avoid some laser
implementation to do that but I wrote
actually an elegant presentation
years ago so probably I should text The
Ellen implementation first and then
compare the violates implementations
actually doing the same thing as 1 by
Ellen so that is a bit where I want to
go so in licks the test case you want to
find something like this right this is
your unit test case for those of you
that grind those things daily you
intimately recognize this this is a mix
excellent judit s case you start with
the module name and then this is this is
really cool in your laser and you could
you didn't Alan tell us what you can
actually say which module you are
testing by aliasing and the top one is
my our implementation tape dispenser
your bubble one is a ticket agent I was
in San Francisco while ago and now i am
here to go say give your presentation
and as oh i should actually implement
this in election as an agent of us
against earth because it make more sense
so everyone is it as an agent and i
tested by starting this system yep and
should get an okay back and the process
identifier of my distraction i take a
ticket and shoot you gentlemen right or
was it would be surprised and on what we
do another one would be tree i reset the
system yes i take another one and I've
got the system because now have verified
everything I tested the research
operation that works and i tested my
associate it works okay this software is
rock solid i tested it and it doesn't
only you guys and a group of the santa
code coverage of my system there is no
way it's of a crippled work t does not
investable so what are we going to do i
can show you that a death sex impulse
but that you will be fun
definitely later when you come to that
so now I have to make it be kind of
discount of skirts automatically I
wanted automatically make such sequences
and so I Samba about the secrets I have
two resets after each other does that
break the software probably not 310
probably not I won't have moistures
industry before deal reason you can
imagine there are lots of variations
that you can think of so you want to
automatically make those tough sequences
with Richie in order to do that you
write a quick extinction you make steak
G which puts out those kind of sequences
that's the whole body and then the
property that your world is that the
sequences will actually be tested as the
system so you will each sequence you
will run it as a tasket and that's it so
this is how that looks like it's a bit
more encoding now while it's actually
more than this dis one test page but it
has much water keep that one as well so
we included a few more thousand from
home which is e stata and this is my
property that you don't see the
commodity will generally but like
generate advanced by using the present
module and I store the remarkable
achievements I start the search like in
normal testicle I'll remind your mods
which will be taken and reset and since
c'mon see this depends on the bids for
the start of process handful of they've
started clicking Spencer I guess that as
an argument to the test fit so the test
case is then while running or console
generation so firstly generated in after
generation
they all over bits in my test case are
distant on since there's no confusion
about what I'm actually tested under
stop it and then this practicum outs for
15 months when when you fail your test
that's all basically this is my property
my command generator goes like this is
one slight supporting text but initial
effect is zero I start an initializer if
I do a reset then I well I use my
argument for the reset is the procedure
identify so I have to take that from the
state actor who didn't bit and I
switched to zero in my mold when I don't
mind reset reset reset stay 20 and the
post condition is that are actually out
in 20 when I hope you said I get a civil
back okay my arguments for the take
again only the bit because take really
doesn't do anything else than just
running through the process I take
something from the bit and when I do
there is on increase this incremental
step on one state personal that's the
only thing I do I think about my state
and the post condition is that i should
actually the reserve of the take is the
breezy state respond so this is my model
and this will generate its customers and
that's the bit about download them again
so come to me that so let me see
you're here slightly larger let me first
run the test called dispenser test you
see and that will run that is one test
case that you see before let's pour
salsa now I run the property and I've
also passed the probe on another tests
there's one test very hundreds of
different sequences and 0 Phillies so
that's fine this works what is actually
test let's go to the dispenser you can
see this is the coach right this is what
I've shown on the slide before it's
actually the same but as you can see
here i use my amex pancetta testing I
have invested my dick agent I just the
elevator let's test the agent and I
influent I put a bird in there just as
you would see what happens what makes me
moist so now we want to test this one
who my agent test fails this is not a
very interesting test cash that's ruin
where I can show something yes so it
sales and it has room a reset that they
can take in a recent as a test it that's
not a text as you would come up with
right but this is a right not a sketch a
reset take a recent than a reason now
the sales because whether the reset it
gets a long back and what is not equal
to 0 because we expected the zero vector
the molar sighs and then I shrink it to
the minimum
case where they find pull this reset and
get a one back without expected as you
so my agent is not going to say it's my
oh my god try to go into my agent khoder
fixed and go to my agent out this one
agent are looking at someone introduced
that one there instead of 0 reset should
put in 20 and so we save it you run our
tests and look at that one little spot I
don't know a hundred test pots n you can
get some output statistics about how
many takes I'm gonna put research into
who will go for most of them so that
this fantastic we can do not under test
you test any kind of three sets and and
takes at the same time this is how we
test papers over in a very simple
example ok so we jump to this situation
when we have tested on aging very very
horny and we have invested in making
this more and this mobile awesome fifth
kind of I mean I showed you a complete
solid code and that most of you will not
have understood the whole code
immediately because a whole page of code
is hard to understand but you can
imagine there was almost the same work
as marking the actual agent or probably
more so you have an investment made
prior to that station normally you don't
have to worry the complete more a little
bit come save implementation because
normally you take an abstraction level
is it in this abstraction level things
should work and you know all about the
details but still you have to write that
state that's an investor
you move have to do in order to get your
automatic test cases after that you can
bring abilities or Testament press your
manager but before that you still have
to our data as it stable sheet with my
ticket inspector was very very simple
but now is we have electronic ticket
dispenser we can actually use for
emergency money so we can have this on
the map you can with your phone get your
date at screen so you have concurrent
model you could get this situation where
you do a reset and then two people at
the same time trying to take your dip it
take a click and this one actually teach
two tickets you know how people that do
that this one's just taking one take so
yes a different situation you have all
made a fancy program which one state
take it in parallel and people can take
tickets concurrently how are you want to
test it okay that's why a unit test for
this what about think of this as a tool
false merging cause things that can
happen is that either this one says Oh
simpleton okay to 20 this is an old
version but you're going to say roll
back then this one gets one then forgets
to never gets a tree that is like this
is the main motorway people just drive
through and don't let that poor car that
turns for happened here you can tell so
they become a more polite situation
where this one takes the mod icon takes
it to the extreme it's okay that would
happen it could also happen that that
forms actually pushing the girls get the
photo all the other never work there's a
lot of possible scenario but if you
wrote this tests in parallel you would
be really really surprised if you see
this one and then on both get one
moreover as I said before this will
collapse to society
right because they both at the same
number this is not going to work so what
should we do but we have to just run
this spoon to elixir processes bring
them right collect the results compare
them and if results of one two three
that's okay it's Pearson's 132 that's
okay it results anything else than to
those three possibilities it's wrong
something has gone wrong you heard them
test it that's fine you can do that and
you manage that why do we only test this
with two users and three takes on this
one and you go ah alright how many
possibilities are just 213 what she did
really search possibilities so there's
still be possible good outcome I quite a
few better ones so you have to find out
what the guitar and then comes up and
then your promotion test gets spawning
tree and it's a process is but one of
them is really just to reset the middle
of exiting so you have to really think
about what I'm going about this test kit
and since there's 30 possibilities and
since this is still considered a small
task if you do not want to write a
vintage finish writing unit tests for
computer chip as if your headache and
people are naturally averse against
headaches so they avoided by and they
fall apart in your test for concurrency
if you retake any book about software
engineering some of your wife SI no no
the intestinal guernsey legs wrong you
don't do that in the unit testing you
don't do it so possible oh let's play
can't do it for you okay how do we do
that we have a more positive response
right it doesn't reset a few texts and
you had a model which then
if you did the research in any state you
will never to the state 0 if you would
in that state days take one do that the
state which has a one there etc so you
have your multiple learning and you can
check the real implication against the
model so what happens if you know get
parallelism but the only thing you have
to do is to compare the parallel series
against two more and only thing that
richard has to do is to say is there a
possible both through the events should
check if you order the bottom the
defense in that way it's explainable by
my model i have already one more so you
could use that model in a different way
now to actually find out that you can
reorder the things she said that make
sense and it makes sense make an
application to superhuman help ok that's
the whole body so you compare that
against your orientation so what do we
have to do in order to make this work
for quick check is this a normal lot of
working are we going to spend them all
day mostly only thing we do is we were
parallel here and parallel there i think
will work because cricket machinery will
then know oh you will increase the
marrow tested we can generate better
test page for you we can compare that
that's no problem and it's the live demo
button shall go to do so para right the
most difficult thing here particularly
in my lifetime is to write parallel with
the right amount of ss-sorry else i
think it's like this no this parabola
there you go thank you so i generate
parent bonds and repair robots aren't I
saved it and there we go oh I find an
arrow in my elixir code this is not nice
is it I have a voter suppression prefix
doing open strange things
takes and reset and then have two
processes in parallel one doing taking a
tube and the other one also taking it
and then we'll go the other two and the
users they both got the number to nail
and criticize there are no possible into
leaving our don't understand how this
can happen that both of them get it to
natural we don't intend on that none of
the spirituality of course this is not
very nice shrinking is it I mean we
started with a slotted ecology test yes
but the shrink it wasn't really nice the
reason is parallelism is country
relatively non deterministic to you if
you remove the test is shrinking your
mind well end up choosing the right
shrinking off so sometimes you really
have to ruin a few times there's always
macro for that where you can bring the
same test case several times if you get
much better slinky I see if it who are
better now yes it work better I get
another test case here after shrinking
saying if I do take a parallel to takes
both get above lacking good that is
impossible what is happen so now we go
into your coat and say why is that all
right for you go to your agent my
eighties you actually work but then
someone not knowing elixir very well not
having fun
me kind of congruence course does it get
and then I go to it and then returns
your town and of course there is a race
condition between the two right so if
you do this in one process and then the
other ones also they're both using
update this is going to pray completely
that is why that is it get an update
right that's the only purpose for that
function and of course it will then have
to return to values and and plus one and
this one can go home and that when we go
home this one can go home and it's
almost like green book over here look at
that getting updates give me them
Richard M for the captor and Empress one
for your debt so there we go again save
it and let's see if this is part time oh
we solved people in our culture this is
how you find courteous of the tooth
mobility accessible to running a mole
there's very little investment in
actually testing you conceived but that
was the most part they're more now I go
to some concluding slides we can use a
check for fun in terms of show uncle tom
but this is a very simple example we do
this for lunch at sams as well one of
the largest examples we have done so for
with a laser grip check not to speak
about the energy because there if don't
4g base stations 40 basis and console
but for the next up we have used each
other d from process one and first one
was interested in testing each other
ebooks so we made a mobile of that one
you can add hoops 3d charity it's a
distributed
after work you have all just running you
can add books you can take them down you
can change them you can move them just
distributed setting how are we sure that
this works so make a quick shake model
that actually test all the combinations
of updating and deleting and removing it
and make sure things work so he started
a number of eternity notes and then the
nice things you shrink to the minimum
number of nodes that are necessary to
provoke a certain era that's a nice
feature there and we tested at the lead
to remove all over to remove one node
and some running and get have also
written so we run all the books as well
to make sure that we have collected
varietal and you promote the actual
loops with rigid framework so we found a
few issues such as promised when animals
at the same name the disk guarantee
things like that you know you always
find something and talk to make our
motor process one if you want to have
the gory details so in the summary quick
check then if you have requirements the
regards to provide us the properties of
the software and critic is a tool going
from those properties to generate test
cases automatically generate as get to
test the system against that and it
starts on the model the generate test
cases is defined failing test case that
automatically takes a test case shrinks
into the minimum test case and present
that menu intestine and this is
necessary because normally you have a
lot of noise in your test case which is
not important for the actual test case
but it's important to efficiently go to
the statement that's what we do there
less time spent right on tesco you have
to write a model which you have enormous
market test if you can
31 moral orel replaces many many tests
and you'd get better testing because we
doooo call real combinations you would
never think about and because of the
shrinking you spend much less time
diagnosing of the arrow and we actually
find that was opportunistic questions so
about the writing the model when doing
this test cases you're actually somehow
re-implementing your requirements like
you said I remember from times
University we did like these simulations
of the systems and to validate that our
calculations were correct we write the
same simulation twice with a different
approach so a different mechanical
approach so it was very important that
you didn't do the same calculation to
get the same result is it is this ear
also important that your model follows
this different strategy to do the same
as otherwise yes so this is very good
cuz interesting is basically about
similarity of the mole and
implementation if you read implement
your implementation you don't know the
word parts and don't think that smart so
the first thing is lose lift obstruction
either and put formed ethic obstruction
the other thing which is important is to
and need to have a slightly different
approach to it multi-color operational
approachable more comes to project if
this is really what has happened what
can I observe and happening so your
models are not really the same as the
state machine that you're in print or
your agent code is it's fairly difficult
from the bowl that you're right and its
suburbs like that you need a bit of that
but it's not equally important here
because it depends a little bit on your
application
domain but normally you have already did
one of the things is running began to be
over so you will find differences very
quickly but if you if you have the same
kind of mindset for the one and for the
older you will probably make the same
mistake it will never find your hair
that's completely true so you have to
miss abstraction as things slightly
differently that's all right we're out
of time as types of questions for
cleaning great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
