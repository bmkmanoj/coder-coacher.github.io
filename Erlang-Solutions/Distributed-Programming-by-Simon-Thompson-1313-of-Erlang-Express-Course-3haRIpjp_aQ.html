going
you know we'll talk about
in general and I talked about how
distribution is handled in Erlang each
instance of a running running Erlang
runtime system is called a node and
we'll talk about how nodes are created
how they're connected and so on and then
we'll conclude by talking about how we
manage these things using a number of
Biff's
to do with distribution the net kernel
which handles infrastructure and also
how nodes can be hidden for instance for
doing operations and maintenance okay by
way of definition a distributed system
is a program running on a collection of
loosely coupled heterogeneous usually
processes across a small world or a wide
area network and there are all sorts of
reasons for distributing a system you
may want performance you may want
reliability fault tolerance failover and
so on you may want to access resources
remotely maybe not an application that
is inherently distributed we may want to
achieve extendibility scalability and
robustness of a large scale system but
for all those reasons it's useful to be
able to run Erlang on more than one
system so let's look at an example what
we have here you can see on the same
machine we are running two Erlang
runtime systems we're running l with the
s name flag s is short name and the
uppercase we're running it with short
name foo in a lower case we're running
it with short name bar let's see that so
we've got one one node called foo foo at
nice-nice is the name of the machine and
we've got another node bar that's nice
and we've got a module
t-there which exports the function T and
what T does is it receives a PID and
then it sends back to that PID the
message of what node
is so it calls the node Biff and that
tells you if you execute that you get
the name of the node you're running up
so let's have a look at what's happening
here well we're calling here now we're
calling spawn with four arguments the
second third and fourth are familiar the
module the function name and the list of
arguments but the first argument here is
an atom describing a node so what we're
doing here is remotely spawning the
function T from module t not only node
we're on but on the node bar and you can
see that what we're getting is a result
from that is a is a PID you can see that
that has been spawned and what will be
the effect of that we spawned it with
the PID of the process running on foo
what do we get back we'll see that a
message is sent to foo and if we flush
the buffer we can see that we've got the
message bar out nice which is the node
we run the function node on the bar node
and what we get back is the result bar
at nice now a few things to note here
look at what's inside the the T function
T receives a PID and it sends to a PID
since the result of node two that PID
the PID was got by evaluating self on
the node foo so we normally think of
using that in that same runtime system
but in fact we can use exactly the same
PID to send a message to that process on
any node you can see that that's what
we've done here so we've sent on bar we
sent to that PID the node and you can
see in the upper in the foo window we've
got that message bar at noise so PIDs
transparently could be on the same node
or on a different node we can see how we
can spawn on remote nodes so we've got
this network of
the network of nodes we can from one
node we can perform operations on the
other or send messages to processes on
the other so a node is a terminology for
an executing Erlang system it's said to
be alive if it can communicate with
other nodes if nodes are allies they
have a unique name on that host and the
identifier of a node is the name at host
that might be short to name or a long
name we'll talk about that in a second
you start a node using the name or the s
name flag and by way of minimal security
a shared secret two nodes can
communicate only if they share the same
cookie or they know each other's cookies
so there's a cookie mechanism is used a
shared secret is used to perform some
sort of authentication so we can see an
example here starting a node with short
name fool and if it's if it's created
with a short name for we'll its name
will be something like foo at corn if
you create it with the name foo it will
have a long name foo at and then some
corn at Erickson se and in order to
resolve the symbolic name like that
we'll need a DNS server and it's just a
result of the design of Erlang that no
node started with long names may not
communicate with names with nodes using
short names and also by default we
talked about a shared secret the dotted
line cookie file will be created a
cookie will be created and stored there
if there is no cookie already defined so
so your nodes will be able to share by
default let's just look at sending
messages we saw that what we're doing
here is we're spawning the function S in
the module s and that risk registers
itself
as a name server under the name server
and then calls the function l and what
that does is it receives a message with
a tuple with a message and a PID and it
sends that message back to the PID so
it's a simple echoing process so we're
on foo we've spawned the process S on
bar and that has got the name server we
can communicate with that by sending a
message to the tuple server and bar at
nice the Athen bar at nice so in order
to use a name we have to combine that
name with the node on which it resides
so as an address we can either use a PID
without a node name or we use a name
plus a node name so there you can see
that what we've done is we've sent to
Barra now it's a server on Bharat nice
hide the message hi paired with self our
PID on Don foo and then what will happen
is that that will get echoed back to us
and you can see indeed when we flush the
input input buffer we get we've got the
message high so again you can see that I
used our PID to communicate directly
with us we used a name comma node pair
as the destination of the message that
we sent and this slide summarizes
summarizes that between any pair of
nodes week and we can be assured that
messages will be delivered in the same
order that they're sent they're not lost
and that they won't get corrupted so
this distribution lies on top of a
transport layer which ensures that
messages are lost and
we can't of course we don't preserve the
order in which messages are sent between
two distributed nodes and of course the
other issue with with distribution is
that a node may go down so that node may
whatever for a network problem or for
because a machine on which it's running
has has crashed so it is possible that a
node will go down now how do how do
nodes know about each other how do our
connections established between nodes
though it's a loosely connected and are
not handled by the designer by the
programmer it's the wrong time that
system that handles connections when a
node is first referred to a connection
is set up and information when a new
node becomes available information about
that is shared among the nodes that are
connected and then nodes monitor each
other checking to see whether the nodes
that they're aware of are alive or not
and nodes can come and go just as in the
same way that processes can come and go
here's a picture of what what might
happen we know that dog at home is
connected to cats at work and mouse at
work is connected to flea at home if the
process in dog sends a message to mouse
wheel that message is sent a connection
is established between dog and mouse but
then those connections are shared so
that each process in the system becomes
aware of all the others each node in the
system Ari becomes aware of all the
others so it's a recursive process by
which they all get connected now if you
remember we looked at we looked at the
frequency server when we talked about
process design patterns and what we're
doing here is running a server on a
different node we are running the
frequency server on the the server node
which is in this case is hard-coded so
what we do here is we can run that on a
separate node and so the process the
client process is run on
their own notes but they can each
communicate with that server node
through the named process frequency on
that on that server now of course it's
possible that just as we we had in the
in the non distributed case it's
possible that a node may go down before
we receive a reply so it's possible just
as we can monitor processes it's
possible to monitor a node and if we're
waiting to receive a reply to a message
we've sent to a remote node we can
before we send the message monitor the
node and then when we wait to receive
the reply we can either process a reply
or we can process a node down message
which tells us that that in the meantime
the node has gone down so we're able to
deal robustly with nodes coming and
going in this in this case and you can
see when we've received the reply there
in the highlighted code in the bold code
we unleash off monitoring the server
node so we only do that when we have a
the monitoring is switched on
now we've got here's a collection of the
bits that apply to distributed
programming it's possible to spawn a
function with four argument version of
spawn a node is the first argument and
then module function arguments as we've
seen before there's also a four argument
version of spawn link which in an atomic
way spawns the process and then links to
it but again spawning a process on a
remote node it's possible to monitor
whether a node is up or down with a flag
true turns on monitoring flag false
turns it off the node functioned with no
arguments returns the atom representing
the node which will be a name at host
and the nodes function returns a list of
all the nodes that this particular node
is aware of and it's possible to look up
where a particular item resides so it
could be a PID a reference a report we
can say which node does that add item
lie on and then we can explicitly
disconnect from a node if we wish and we
can in the airline module there is a set
cookie operation which sets a cookie for
a at a particular value but it sets a
cookie for any node in fact not just for
for our own now the net kernel is the
process that coordinates operations in a
distributed airline node so each each
host will have a net kernel and that
will handle spawn requests and so on so
if you spawn something on a remote node
then that the spawn request will get
sent to the net kernel on that node and
that deals with authentication through
through cookies it's possible to replace
that with your own process if you wish
which can change your authentication you
can for instance not allow processes
from other nodes to spawn processes on
your node it's only one registered
process
you might only allow one register
process to receive messages and so on
finally it's possible to hide a node so
that the node can be created but it's
created in a way that other nodes are
not made aware of its existence so here
what we're we've created three nodes one
with a short name a one would be one
would see but we've hidden see now in
node a where we're using a net kernel
function we connect explicitly to be in
C and we've been able to do both of
those so a is connected to C now but if
we ask which nodes we're connected to we
only get be listed there because C is
hidden but we can ask which nodes which
hidden nodes are we're connected to and
that tells us we're connected to C and
we can ask which nodes were connected to
my passing the connected argument and we
get the list of all of them but by
default it's hidden when we ask which
nodes do we know about we don't we only
get the result B and you can see in a
similar way a B knows about a and also
interesting here you can see that we've
asked which nodes B is connected to and
it is only connected to a despite the
fact that a knows about C and is
connected to it it isn't transitive in
the case that a node is hidden so we
don't we would have explicitly to
connect from B to C in order for B and C
to be connected and if we ask which node
C is connected to it says no and as far
as C is concerned
so they're here we see a summary of
what's going on typically used for oh &amp;amp;
M it's something in the background which
is not it's not part of the major
functionality of the principal gene
allottee of the core functionality of
the system but is there to just
supervise what's going on and of course
you could have a hierarchy of hiding
where there are different levels which
are aware of say the levels below but
not the levels above but just to be just
to remind you all that has to be done
through explicit calls to the D Connect
functions in an eternal once you start
hiding node then connections aren't
aren't established automatically and
finally a long distribution is typically
works on a system where machines are
open if machines have firewalls that can
cause problems for a long distribution
it's possible to use tunneling or poking
using particular port number instance
there are some undocumented kernel
variables which allow you to do this
but in general it's perhaps better to
think about rolling your own
distribution may be using a different
transport layer running it over tcp/ip
or SSH or whatever so I think there are
different different mechanisms you might
use but out of the box
Erlang distribution does have some some
problems interacting with firewalls now
let me conclude we've talked about
distributed systems we've talked about
how airline distribution works how there
are nodes which may which may
communicate between each other processes
live on nodes a node we may have a
number of nodes on a single host but
nodes can be on remote hosts and
processes communicate by P IDs which are
transparent to the node that they're
based on it's also possible with name
processes to communicate to a named
process on a remote host but there you
use a tuple to name the
the process both the name is registered
name and the host on which it resides
we've talked about spawning remotely
message-passing and there's a whole
number of infrastructure beefs that
allow us to monitor and to establish
connections and so on through using the
net kernel and finally we talked about
hidden nodes that's nodes which are not
part of the automatic connection
mechanism so I think that concludes the
summary I wanted to make about
distributed programming in Erlang thank
