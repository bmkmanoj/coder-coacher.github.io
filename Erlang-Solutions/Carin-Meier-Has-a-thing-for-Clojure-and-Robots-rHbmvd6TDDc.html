keynote yesterday evening and I was
amazing can you give us an idea of what
was in the keynote for people didn't see
it it was a lot of fun and actually it
was a little bit terrifying because it
had to hard work and I was in
explaining the beginnings of story about
how I
very inspired by Sesame Street episode
where I had seen this room box and
totally forgotten all about it
then later life I had discovered I could
love robots with a Roomba
and I started packing in programming and
closure of
she was really exciting to control a
Roomba when the rebels
then later on I went to friends
the air drafts huge like
little quadcopter wedding soon
so the talk was about how to control
them with closure
was it wasn't the talk you were actually
writing that I mean you're running that
code it wasn't just talking or slide
yeah that was a terrifying but most of
the demos worked yeah I I was I can
witness that but in bed except for the
very last one had trouble talking to the
remote you even got a demo where they
talk to each other without you yeah so
that's really exciting thing using
closure and concurrent processes and
talking of them that you can get them to
talk to each other and it's exciting for
me it's kind of music so AI philosophy
lift goals and trying to describe the
roomba beliefs and driven beliefs and
things together and sun li de rumba of
Vienna will do well so the drone will
believe that he should fly forever and
then you go touching the ceiling right
inspector swear I was just writing the
right there original when it's going to
believe under a certain circumstances
and its goals and obviously I had a bug
in my program because I had him fly up
and he kept believing that he wasn't
high enough and he was at the ceiling so
obviously he had a faulty belief that he
was high enough it was awesome a little
thank you very much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
