back end segment electric in where we
provide the platform as a service for
that manufacturers and hobbyists to
connect things internet about a year ago
we migrated a large part of our back-end
systems from luggage is too early
we're a couple of weeks maybe a month
and a developer after all from
completing a migration another chunk
about I want to talk to you about what
it's know things is what that means to
us at electric in what our platform is
like to our users I'll talk about I'll
talk about why we decided to migrate
back into our line some of the problems
that we face during a migration and why
in the end we think this is the right
choice and points out the wall I'm here
in an official capacity where's the
t-shirt I do spend all my time at the
coalface
so anything I say in this presentation
should be like the grain of salt and
should not must replace investment
decisions like that so what is the
Internet of Things or I am say simply
it's connecting the things Internet what
kind of things everything talk about
vehicles appliances buildings animals
plants either soil everything in fact
the Cisco an Intel my mother's have
started referring to as the internet of
everything probably is a different shape
the Internet of Things has probably
generated more hype recently than most
other things and I feel duty-bound to
point out but there have been a lot of
stupid things
such as the toilet that you can floss
using a smartphone an egg truck which
tells you how many eggs you have left
and four checks you to the food problem
but it's only Internet's at school I
should confess we are responsible he's
one of our customers is from Warner bugs
check out some fun at much more but what
might seem frivolous to one person might
be essential to another and there are a
lot of potential efficiencies and
savings to be found by connecting things
to the Internet for example how about a
clothes dryer that negotiates with our
electricity supplier for the lowest
rates and runs when power is cheap
that's going to come in quite useful
when we turn off the last nuclear
reactor and we'll run your we power
which is unforgettable
similarly this is one of our customer
products or of our sprinkler system it
checks the web app it doesn't bother
watering your lawn if it's gonna rain
anyway I wasn't so Unabomber yeah I read
about another good example yesterday
while I was preparing this talk
Dustin's tradition that you sent been
been around once a week but only giving
around public class means that bins are
empty someone are overflowing so what it
by connecting it to the Internet you can
monitor the level of waste in mapping
and just a knife round when they need it
pretty similarly there are efficiency
savings we found in other areas such as
buildings management it's just a
vertical web community you can to my to
lift maintenance schedules your air
conditioning and heating instructions
you can make sure the engineered has the
right stuff with it when it turns up
saves a lot of money so there's a
massive potential upside to the internet
of things but it's follow when we come
in how do you middle thing connected to
the internet and there that's actually
musical problem thinking no it's not
Wi-Fi not but even if you restrict
yourself to connecting via Wi-Fi there's
a whole people problems the deal with
four stop how do you feed the Wi-Fi
credentials to the device
chromecast Erdem is got chromecast deals
of that particular slate white it
basically sets up an ad-hoc Network
really fun
this is that ventures over to the device
really what we did is we've got a single
blinged up which flashes your phone
screen transmits the details to an oxide
sensor on the device that's pretty cool
too so great I've got the producers on
what they've I didn't connect to the
Wi-Fi the next one we've got is
standards not every device interfaces
facts in the same way there are hundreds
of different white Lance's points out
there all running different software
stacks all got their own bugs miss
features idiosyncrasies
incompatibilities we've got like a stack
of about twenty of them in our carriage
office just sitting there the
compatibility testing
and the story just hit worse if you need
cellular there's no you look to the
money to the fun house
okay so there's a senior dealt with that
and you've got universe connected how do
you keep suffering today how do you keep
the OS up today I'm not going to touch
too much on security because that's what
my CEO doesn't know fish-filled
something a translation that but if
you're making expected devices or
air-conditioning units one of our
husbands does that it's something we
don't know the resources to climb the
inflation orbital or the expertise
attack you just way to work so it's a
manufacturing different thing this ought
to be a solid problem why doesn't
somebody else solve the solid for me
this is where we can let your pain so
this point because it's relevant to why
we use you know like I need to give you
a little bit of background about what
the Orion platform looks like it's
someone using it if it were so it's
gonna sound about anyway son
and you build back to device now do you
have another line fantastic that wasn't
none other like I think as it stands the
smallest amount you can get is about 20
May that's got a humming between okay it
ain't gonna fit so instead what we do is
that hosts a squirrel virtual machine
don't miss her the sterile but it's
kinda like a little bit although
designed to be embedded and recently
that is makes a nice program for
starters but it also allows us to
isolate the OS passes their spirits and
uprising residents and application parts
which our customers right or the
hobbyists Zeiss
then use bleep up on your phone to play
actual imp to you what if I do the
internet this is this connection to talk
to an agent just kinda like Kiko here
also running squirrel Isis posted an
opt-out service one designed decision we
made way back when is that the you
itself can't lead to anything other than
its agent the agent takes care of
everything sodium has no local
public-access as their internal or
inbound or outbound places they the
agent takes care about mental health we
did this to keep the attack surface on
you as small as possible is just one
connection kids yes it's silent bug
vents so if your agent does need to talk
to an external service it cancel recipe
and mobile app new supportive device
agent was a mess it will be at the
device agent for each other using extra
paper we have a stack of agent
integrations to third parties such as
idly to collecting the data samples not
prevent us type things and a whole bunch
more it turns out that for a lot about
the captures this is a perfect you can
take advantage of deployment running
agent up getting the cloud and actors do
what comes consular size of that video
you can get that to it to do a bunch of
work and the omits if you wake up and
check you every now and then take the
samples or so well that's important is
because for trying for partner they're
not always connected so there's not
always connected baby is great for
battery life I think our website
systems when he is in deep sleep so it's
got pretty much everything turned off it
will run for over two years on the two
double-a batteries
obviously we won't wakes up to take
samples and wakes up to connect to the
internet about love those syllables but
it's the battery life impressive so
that's how powerful and I think because
of the fact that our device is important
to our servers Rawdon doing they're
having problems because so why did we
look at her look so to recap we've got a
bunch of always connected devices such
as thermal I mentioned earlier and we've
got a bunch of intimately connected
devices and they connected to a service
welcome directive to each other and they
need to talk to their owners and their
agents respond to sleep etc etc in this
quote from a mobile gives us a flavor of
what we initially started in failure
Erlang as a solution for reinventing our
banking system which used to be much yes
so the quote is actually saying this
programming language used to build
massively scalable soft real-time
systems with reconnaissance high
availability balance runtime system has
built in support for concurrency
distribution and folklores fantastic
they can be used to build massive leap
up scalable systems cisco amongst other
people including Gartner talking about
25 billion devices connected to the
Internet
or in this year they reckon fifty
billion by the end of 2020 if even a
small percent of us deposits on our
system you know but they must be
scalable so prototype that's a big build
for the Internet of Things because the
internet gets in a way but
responsiveness and fairly good legacies
and have quite a lot of our customers so
that's important to high availability
you've done with the go wrong you know
we're nowhere near nine nines at this
point but it's a good plan for getting
back to Britain with me little bit
concurrency we're dealing with hundreds
of thousands of connected and
intermittently connected to the process
of any one fine so support for
concurrency is they're all doing the
only thing seems like a good thing to
have distribution for Florence they
sound good dope having a self-healing
system way better than the one up there
in the morning was finishing a
production phosphorus so shortly after I
joined American I was given the task of
putting together a prototype Sifl work
some stuff to rebuilding our back-end
orbits most important part
but
what does our back-end architectures of
life what do you use our I'm showing
this slide because I think a lot of
people got questions about how other one
fits into a larger system and so in our
back-end not any of this is rocket
science or we know the third party
software some of which isn't so this
like what you see mr. om fits into that
water system something have a bunch of
it's significant for point we're now
able to connect to the observer that
access the connection figure cell if
they'd self rock right both OS and
application that we'll stuff it might
send it to a different software for load
balancing purposes so it's a different
server for load balancing that system
and then otherwise it's a space the
system mediates that commerce between
the engine and the device vice versa so
the agents folks to do age of the motor
still running as pay on the sandbox
which we have several now the agent
server is the other pieces of the
migration that they're Langille about
earlier the pallium server model just
don't really you know I think about this
bit is still as of today running on node
s kind of hoping it in this will you all
get back onto stage you know
that's sitting I thought just not master
that 60 minutes to go so that's a new
hope that you see now this agents are
over here that posts the scrubber
virtual machine from you to another
device it's the single agent that
channel and the agent can do STP or
whatever the worthies to do that school
runs on is implemented in C++ and we had
to face it to urban using miss native
implemented functions which is wait
supposed to play to go into that I know
we looked at other options that support
drivers with the ports we looked at see
notes and we decided this was probably
the quickest and easiest probably most
performant right there and we've run
tens of thousands of those not these
over the VMS sorry amps per server the
two demons are current separate between
notes from separate that's partly for
historical reasons part because at some
point we might think about distribute
the agents to do some boat balancing
but at the moment they were on the same
box because it keeps the latency now
that's nice
as I mentioned so these bits are soon
will be you know like pretty much in the
rest of it isn't as I mentioned to the
agent can talk recently to the clout to
explicitly cervical cancer based in fear
itself we use engineers about with a
little bit of information computer
so basically P comes into Internet's but
on the load balancer that then looks up
in the registry where the ancient the
actual agent for that request is running
and then sends it to agents over Jesus
cowboy that was a cowboy to actually get
that into the let's go via we use
Postgres for our relational data we'll
use Redis as a key value store we've got
rabbitmq in that that he's written are
for administration messages and events
and they are all configured for I want
they were all configured for clustering
warm assets like file over H a places
for example I'll slight post-crisis and
completely different all known as a
bottle of slow posters in a completely
different region we have a web-based
development environment and customer
walks consulted API and that bit it's
still no Jess
samite because it currently works fine
mo Jace is ideal for building websites
and stuff so the only real benefit to
you guys you know I think that we can
share more point between the different
bits which is as a Worth or benefit but
it's just that right now
the monitoring which is my guess and
graphite and reform and for logging my
current just using system where we are
evaluating logstash
so why might you not choose other like
there's a really good salt on YouTube by
Garrett Smith called
white cool kids don't use over which he
presents the results of an informal
survey he did mostly about users my
nervously concerns out the respondent
mostly love you presented this has a bit
work like lovers were themself and we're
doing but there's a great quote from
that is code mesh where every six five
who've moved their systems to its active
it so they talked about that and they
saved the great most - the speed that
the burglars go from hating the bank to
falling in love with it is very very
surprising of course I could just mean
the Stockholm Syndrome is strong with
this one
or garrets results could just mean that
survive a land uses - there's a little
bit self-selecting I do have to admit
that choosing a line was a risk for us
its nature Rommel but was out there I
mean who is actually developing you know
my office is just pulling women okay
it's a self-selecting group
so when we started the migration the
only experience we have in team was I've
answered a training course in this work
and I hadn't understood tape so that was
but they're also a bunch of other things
which form a barrier to entry penalties
you know and that could and should be
approached the one I have to get out the
way first is is the syntax everybody
says the syntax is weird and I've got a
point help nowadays with the thing needs
to a state programmer VB syntax is weird
so Python program C syntax is weird it's
not we get used to it or give it
something like that again I don't know
if you can see something we've already
be like okay likes it the other one
which says that album came out and my
person experience the same is that
there's a little bit of a learning curve
when it comes to bringing up your first
donut application you can fart shell you
plug things into it that's great
once you get over you know the lists and
the proper lists and the patterns and
the values and the fact that you can't
single assignment that people time but
bringing up your first application for
example when we ran our us office
January for our house this year
I did another like training course with
Padre Jays just you know I understand
that it turns out to forever have a
simple hello world web application this
is after I got them over the different
types the basis and atoms of the thing
for principle award to the console great
yeah that's easy you want to do a web
app and finally got the used cowboy
little monkey or the built in one mrs.
Robin gee there's a bunch of oil pipe
it's annoying and got understand that
before you just go it's just incantation
of I don't know what that is yet and
it's a bit scary to people we're just
fine it's about a boiler plate but when
you can simply do something five or six
lines of mode that in fact their website
has six months ago this is the web
server right fantastic it turns people
off of this pillar home
so that's a challenge
as an interesting point we want to use
for their sure it's the big lobby
they're building stuff yeah like so I
watch that step of HD piece that every
lovers but you know there is a punches
you know Saudi papers you wanted to be
reliable because you could have been but
the nodejs what doesn't do that doesn't
do that there's a lot of about that but
I think you know if we're introducing or
like to think in terms of you know who
in this is real easy than something
there's another clip for us about
something they learn how to pick the
tulip in particular is 92 I transform
back the fact that builds on weibo sucks
quite hard there are a couple of
alternatives including the new personal
remark looks quite good but there's no
real strong consensus out there right
yeah package management consists mostly
of using google named philosophy
so we do that sometimes is a pretty good
some less so something someone actively
maintained some haven't been touched in
years
itself that's that's not managing
although it's a package curation problem
but discussing like my own is that's not
going anywhere either because I think
though it's not a problem just use
pickup or they overthink it and
structure I suggest it's different
the other way of doing things is
different from the UNIX way of doing
things or from the windows way of doing
things and that's usually for sensible
reasons because you want to do zero down
some operate you will do releasing in a
particular way but we conflict falsely
Figment it's a good way and it in almost
perfect sense once you drop MTP but it's
another hurdle that's it from a DevOps
point of view my deployment process is
completely different from anything I'm
used to doing on our own it's don't miss
them using chef will you come
the the document section these Patchett
or at least that's been an accusation
level yet against it garrets so some of
the documentation is very very good some
of its mediocre and some of it is
downright terrible
personally I'm actually okay with that
but some people in good thing but
somewhat bad thing testing the line it's
first-class citizen it's got stuff built
in for testing skirts but we unit for
unit testing it's got a common test
integration assistant testing but common
test in particular he's a bit Baroque
documented part understand any of us
this is just plain weird the life is
inconsistent if the bottom for having
lists in Iceland lists why is the motor
panel cubes not called cubes
it's called cube if there's no real
agreement about whether the most
important transcripts first or last in
the function would more like I don't
really have to fit back into me in
patchy documentation to the whole check
it's all my life is the library
functionality including on TV is a
little bit of plactic there's no json
library but there was an h2 for a Bible
it's makes perfect sense when you
consider the telecoms background but
it's a bit weird if you come into one
set of eyes so all these negative things
but my point is it's actually fun to
work get over to Caesar
so what would I choose that I'm a to
sell right because it is the original
hipster language in retro style it's
functional its actor based is concurrent
all the functional actor based for
current members in France it's just
about stopping at the mainstream
I've got Starla you got F sharp got go
if you have stuff you've got a cup what
you learn about product organs which is
Microsoft's active thing they didn't use
it but hallo otherwise handle was
features since way before they were cool
it's a hitch the manager took away it's
solid it's mature the community what is
small which has its upsides and
downsides but on the mailing list in the
IRC channel
it's feeling very very small people you
all need to share their time and
expertise with you even if you're
completely sometimes it can be like this
Sagan that's been consistent
and if but I'm really including all the
libraries it's got a whole heap of
features which are fantastic that allow
you to inspect diagnose debug fix a
patch your running system in production
without notice
fantastic I think the weeks back pretty
grata to us all we're gonna need to
bounce a server to do that though nobody
not just it's done it's all sorted
fantastic great the inspection you to
these fantastic I can just rather than a
mono J's folks it goes a little bit
wrong I know it adds up
I'm given room I'm sure the only mode
stop asking questions what processes are
smoking where how many things have
connected what do they think they're
doing
oh okay and then I could just fix it and
obviously go back and patch the source
code
so it's so good in fact that in a moment
of Epiphany
a while back I'd sort of commented to my
colleagues it's almost like they
designed something that was actually
intended to be used in production so I
think that after the run some inspection
the ability to inspector on top running
system and patch it asking questions
my next my favorite feature is the is
the for tolerance it turns out that let
it crash normally really is the right
way to learn about systems you might the
happy path and you just let your
supervision tree build it this crashes
map gets me started this practice you
know it's yourself so for us at least
our line is absolutely the right
solution to our particular problem and
it doesn't mean it's a good thing that I
no longer been working on a three woman
with a production issue which is superb
sleep good question ten minutes
let me take some of this is historical
did you look at gums it's always a work
so what was the thinking um so the deal
is that this nginx is this three of us
aground load balancer but there are
point one three of these and the load
balance the affinities in point one two
one
so what we do is we take a look at the
inbound URL figure out which agent
that's destined for okay and now we
could have done that you know like yeah
and spawn up in probably new like node
over here
yeah but the same engineers cluster
actually wraps all this stuff over here
as well yeah so with a little bit of
Lilla in radius if you've got yeah well
what's pretty much a genetics course the
cowboy here's
yeah I mean our Swedes all got your
cowboy we could have put that in yours
you better than code into it you can
call the local arduous directly yeah
we'd still have to go to another box
where the agents actually running yes
yes right we could've we could've done
that
but as I say at the moment this is
actually mimic Jersey yes yes we might
be doing about that
I welcome Joe concern earlier about
standards which highlighted track your
standards and then tries to build there
are other ones of their own what my
options - aw how muddy removes our
back-end is no no I back in this is
advancing on AWS it's to my desktop or
home is it's an inbox
it will be just crashing at the stuff
the very last one that starts together
was just like just over but yeah it's a
very shiny aluminium UNIX box I open a
month as unit it used to be a Mac fat
the one thing if Berman is that some of
our emergency came from Apple my
username would fund they treatment for
obviously things 50 billion devices
you're talking about tens of thousands
on a server that kind of starts a lot of
servers today that's current that's a
suspect right now we could probably pack
more density than that what do you have
to be doing anything no Ivan we
announced hasn't hadn't reached any
limits of our scalability because a lot
of US military handed off the news
you're assuming that they trust oh yeah
yeah if you start to do know those kind
of things then probably for people yes
we don't currently have impossible yeah
the does the load balancing with the
internet one sir we so how you should be
over there he disseminated weekend's
over there to news the only thing that's
in a class though is the information 70s
box we then have an admin console which
is any mode talking to all the rest of
it so there's no actual 40 bone cluster
I'm sure at some point we might get to
that we want to get to that that's right
once you've got your agent migrated okay
yeah even then we might just decide to
have smaller clusters well well the way
yeah we might before me so in that this
ignores oh and then look at theirs
pay down for the release project which
was the scheduling project
yes I think so Glasgow University first
about focus groups yes my Sigma sort of
presentation parties are sure that they
bench library before hundred Birds yeah
that's very interesting stuff for us
basically when we start doing more
regional stuff we definitely don't want
those and faster positions she's not
going as a wife that's our kid I'm
working with some of those guys there's
another interested parties in trying to
take it to the next level
it's interest to do interest yes
the problems being that Eric's isn't
motivated to do that for their 40
notices father yeah I mean the to me is
the guys are our solutions but they're
almost much better mascara 2002 about to
my channel was persecuted yeah yeah so
so this is a big and I understand that
you know days for a lot beforehand and
was wondering means blog like the faults
over and options in no Jade s before
websites move on to their there
what were the key things that make a lot
of people on the internet will say
there's a fair amount of overlap and
what I think the bunch of different
reasons they're no Jer stuff that we
have at the time the fundamental problem
that I have with my guess is that it's
single throat users continuation passing
style
which is bicycle options like
also work around Amina for example you
could smell vodka reminisce about the
promises I can't do generators in es6
know your multiple processes one like
event but basically for most processes
of real processes or as my own processes
of placing it for you that's true yeah I
mean you're right at the time we were
looking at doing this move we're talking
about no more points sevenish so what
this son wasn't very mature the process
library I think the biggest mr. Logan is
- mom we're not going to bless a promise
library and now I've got a whole bunch
of I visit these one promise five
another drugs use a different one
they've all told me the continuation
thought that's just inside so I'm kind
of looking to Sonny fixes that time this
is what rhinoceros
now have you mamas their deployment
process I guess so I didn't magical work
deployment process the way we do our
deployment process here's a little bit
old-school it's slowly basic didn't know
anyway we haven't taken advantage of any
of the Red Lobster I've got stuff in I
don't use the i-10 to have my stuff
except for hot patties what we do is we
we spin up an entire new server that
works pretty well though I do love about
having a pencil case of pasta so just as
new everything
one of the things on my list for this
year is to properly look at
San Francisco be finished after
I see you have more smaller boxes in
under the same boat yeah what was the
thing is that when we do the whole a to
b or b to a migration where you can have
different sizes in the sets so we went
from you know in boxes and squish that
down so the fewer boxes into ones that
we've gone to even fewer so it turns out
not having a particular problem we are
on the few of the boxes in the night
boxes they're handling more load they're
more reliable for stampedes so one of
the particular things about the input is
if you kids network connection it comes
straight back atcha the demons like that
something planned you've got tens of
thousands into foster baby new lipo so
previously for Nijs credit we had way
more boxes to do without mission in rush
all right it just comes it doesn't snow
up inside so yes it's a good question so
yeah so are monitoring and logging she
didn't the iron pieces we use longer for
logging we've got resources lot back in
which this winter Sicily loss - we've
got a wrap it back in which just sends
errors we get emailed trails and every
morning we're careful in actually needs
fixing dynamite for for the the stats we
use a faucet exactly to the defaults
might we had a quick look at Exxon it up
missiles that was and that's other
pretty cool but we've already plant on
the bottom at the time so yeah we might
look at Fulton again sorry that
excellent at some point
no interest as a classified for drinks

there's so many thing or you've got your
you know you've got your home part from
somebody that won't talk to anybody
else's stuff so instead of having a home
up your vegetable fiber wire so you want
your Sam someone you dislike must kill
but it's shinier so that's a problem
that we go necessary selfi but all all

house or get everything talking a sit
down somewhere and then we can just
it's much more complicated they know
