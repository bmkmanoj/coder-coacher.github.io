observation but there is a number of
events dedicated to different functional
programming languages all happening in
Krakow Poland and it will be beneficial
for those different communities to meet
together and talk to each other now
after five years we had two weeks of
conference days people from over 20
countries visited us nearly 200 talks
were delivered and almost 2,000 people
attended the conference was opened by
Philip Warner who did his amazing
performances London and on the stage and
we are also joined by three amazing
London ladies people stood at any lambda
days because it's a nice big functional
programming conference with a lot of
attendees and a lot of different then we
discovered and it's also in Central
Europe and for a lot of people probably
this is one of the biggest functional
programming conferences that they can
get conveniently to
first time I was some lambda dice I I
didn't know any functional programming I
didn't know anything about types or
category theory or anything like that I
was a ruby developer I was starting my
company and then because of them that is
basically I we started doing functional
programming
what's really good about lambda J's is
the mix of research and industry
participation so it's great from an
academic perspective going to see how
functional programming is being put into
practice throughout the community and as
a Haskell developer one of the Haskell
designers I had a lot of fun asking
people about what they're doing with
Casco I'm working with web applications
and web application backends mainly then
elixir is a natural choice for me
functional languages are very diverse so
even though I'm pretty versed with one
of them it's good to see what are people
doing with other languages in the end we
can learn from each other a lot yeah
it's a chance to meet the people who
create the item yes like don't use like
a field welder so it's a best source of
the knowledge
I was here to speak about sort of a
weird trend in open-source that I think
people aren't aware of and it was one of
the keynote talks on the first thing I
see it as a really cutting edge
conference that's very deeply technical
and the people here are all very very
interesting very involved like hardcore
engineering folks and they're really fun
to talk to the community is great you
can meet a lot of interesting people
talk with them talk to the speakers so I
think it's for everyone even for
experienced programming and for the
beginners
