type and what the present situation is
and what the plans are for a future with
this maps so this is the agenda for my
speech short about the background about
maps then we have that it what we have
in OTP 17 dot 0 and the current
implementation there and the limitations
and then we call it experimental I will
explain why and then the plans for 18 in
first quarter next year or so so we
introduce maps because we want to
provide an efficient and easy to use
alternative to Records dates DB trees
yet stables prop lists of course it's
not always good to replace this with the
maps but in many cases it could be we
want to introduce and complement the
record data types with something that
can supersede them were suitable and we
want to get rid of the include file
dependencies which you get into when you
use records / module boundaries we have
an approach for maps from two directions
you have one map which is here when you
can have any term as a key you can have
many keys hundreds thousands typically
few instances with identical keys can
compare that what you have a dict and gb
trees and pro place this make maybe some
somewhere in between the other approach
is direction here is like what we
use records for today few instances now
many instances and possibly many
instances with exactly the same set of
keys usually have Afton's as keys the
number of keys is usually small and we
try to combine this into this same
syntax but we have a different
representation for these two so now we
have introduced maps in OTP 17 and by
doing that introducing a new data type
in our line it quite some work more than
you expect of course you have the
dialing vm and the compiler they are
impacted of this dialing shell the
debugger dialyzer then we have the
distribution protocol and we have the
beefs converting to the external
representation to and from and we have
the C library for acting in the
distribution protocol the Java library
for the same they must know about month
we have more we have ETS and tracing
where we have match specifications must
know about maps nifs you need an API to
manipulate maps you must be able to do
hashing and comparison with maps maps
must fit into the term ordering in a
line and we also have other applications
which handle internal types and syntax
like hype the native code generation ii
doc syntax tools and doc here for me
lingual documentation and I suppose
there are even more things but this is
something to mention so now the current
implementation in OTP are not our only
17 dot zero we have maps supporting only
literal keys healed the small maps
implementation with keys less than 64 I
mean it supports more but it's a linear
search for the key so it's when it goes
up to hundreds and so on it will have
bad performance and when you have
literals it's not so easy to create big
maps anyway you can say that this is the
record part or of maps so what we
supported a syntax creation this is the
syntax time for creation hash curly
brackets and the inside you have the key
you have this operator and the value and
with this operate you introduce the new
and Yuki then we have something you can
also create the map with many keys at
the same time and you can have various
type you can have any term as a key here
is at Apple as a key
you can update here you are updating a
new or existing key with a value you
already have you already have a map in
in the variable M here in the next case
here you use another operator and that
is updating an existing key so you will
get an exception here if the key doesn't
exist and note that in a current
implementation you you have to have
literals here you cannot have variables
here in the syntax
so this is also an example of updating
an existing key and the reason for this
is that you when you're using them like
record you don't want to introduce new
keys by mistake so if you use this
operator on purpose you have to to
choose an existing key you can do
pattern matching here you match for any
map and bind it to variable s then you
use s and update the state key with a
start value here you match a map with
the key state which must have the value
start this map can have any other keys
as well then another example of pattern
matching is here suppose that we this
this file read file info it's already
exists today but it returns the record
today suppose we change what it returns
to a map which would be convenient
because you would then not need the
include file anymore for the record
definition now you can match them the
type of file and the modification time
for example like this then we will of
course not change this function in an
income incompatible way but we have to
invent the new function then
so in summary then we have the syntax
and some of them correspond to functions
we also have in the maps module so we
have this create a new map and empty map
this one puts a new value for a key and
this one updates an existing key with a
new value you have functions update put
and this is not exactly the matching
here is you can mash out the key and
value and you can do the same with a
fine function but it returns oh ok
tappable ok comma result here or error
then we have a single value yet which is
not implemented yet because we are not
really sure how it should look like or
if you should have it at the wall and we
have the guard functions is map and map
size and these you can of course use
them without the a-line module in front
they are so called out to it out to
imported functions
so then we have more functions in the
maps module and I can tell you more
about them here we have the guard beefs
test if it is a map any kind of map
first one is map in the same manner as
other data types then we have the map
size is the number of key value pairs
can use it in God as well conversions
from to and from a list I think it's
obvious what it does it converts list of
key value tuples into a map this one and
this one it goes the other way from a
map to a key value top list and absurd
is sorted order is the term turn order
of the keys
you have more functions here you can
create the map you can test if a certain
key exists in a map you can get the key
and you can put the key if I go back
here of course today we only support
literals in the syntax for keys but by
using this from list you can create
today you can create a very big map with
variables as keys if you want to but it
will not get good characteristics if
it's bigger than say 100 200 keys some
more functions here find you can delete
keys you cannot do that with the syntax
can delete one key would remove and you
can delete many keys with without then
you can get a list of all the keys in
sorted order or you can get a list of
all the values in arbitrary order I
don't know why we say like this I think
it's because we don't want to promise
anything I assume it will be the same
order us for the keys here by default
but we don't want to promise it and you
can fold over a map with a function
creating a new map
and then you have a map / map and you
can merge two maps and this is for
example useful if you want to create
maps with default values for some keys
the internal representation is like this
you have come in here from the pointer
from the heat and you get the header and
you have the size of the whole map then
you have a pointer again to all the keys
they are stored like you store at Apple
and the values comes here this is done a
small representation for small and we
are discussing now if the break point
for changing representations will go
with 64 or 32 I think you will choose 64
keys for the break
and this size then when wen we implement
the the big maps as well we we can
optimize and high this size in inside
the header it it goes together with
allocating some new tags which we will
use for this so this the key stairs to
audios like it doubled and they are
ordered in the interim order so then if
you update the structure like that for
example if you already have a map with a
equals 1 B equals to C equals equals
three and then you want to update the
existing key B to the atom new as a
value then it goes like this you make
copy of the value structure point to the
same key description as before this
operator here where we know that no keys
will be changed no new keys will be
introduced it allows us to do like this
so you can share the key description
like this
Oh practice I mean this is the wrong
picture this is the right pitch big maps
they will be stored in something called
ham structure hash array map three years
I think they are invented by Phil bag
well it's not exactly sorted out the
exact struction how they get to read but
this is then a combination of hash and
tree you can say and it's very efficient
for updating that's what I can say now
if you want to know more details about
this one you can discuss it with yoni a
girl who is the implementer of this and
he's in another session right now the
details will be may not exactly like
this but similar and you can read about
HAMP on the internet if you want
in the compiler when you load when you
work with maps in the assembly
instructions you can see an example here
that if we have a function which matches
on one two three four four keys in a map
and then change the values of these four
keys you can see the first part of this
here what a match of course there is an
extract instruction then get map
elements which takes this list of of
keys and makes an efficient match of all
of them at the same time previously we
had separate instructions for each key
and this is done an optimization which
we did just before the release of 17 and
it goes the same down for for them then
we have a boot map elements when we have
this one and this is done just because
it's very useful that you match more
than one key in the same
the external representation when you
send the map over the island
distribution for example it goes like
this there's a new tag down for map of a
for bite size field size meaning number
of key value pairs and then you get the
key value pairs key and the value with
the respective representation as you can
see here we have an example x equals 2y
equals 4 and you get size of two you get
the tag for at them we have to bite
length field for at them and then we
have the X is 120 then we have the tag
for in small integer and the value for
small integer and so so how here you
have the first pair and then you have
the second pair ok what darlin you use
cases for maps here are some examples
for example you can represent things out
from a parser with maps for example next
mail parser we don't have it yet but
might happen sometime jason is a very
common thing that you could map with
matt ASM dot one seemed similar today
the mapping is towards records there you
can replace uses of property list
somewhere force in some places you can
use
in AP ice returning structured data
instead of records then you get rid of
the dependencies to include files and
you can use it in holding the process
state then you might get an easier
upgrade if you want to do runtime
upgrader of the process here's an
example of the JSON mapping it's quite
straightforward you have here's the JSON
string or here is the owned a lie
representation in the library monkey
Jason and it goes along the same lines
for our other Jason libraries as well
here it could be like this that the JSON
that key value represents of course by
ova maps with key value and here is a
bigger example of JSON structure and
here is the map looks almost equivalent
to this or it is it looks the same and
here is something about matching out the
value ID which was deeply nested inside
here this is the way you have to do it
right now if we had seeing a value
access it could go like this or we can
hope to find something even nicer than
this
another use case is of course done what
I already mention the file read filing
for similar when you return a structured
data you could use a map as a return
value and prove to the info is also that
one is actually returning quick call it
property list today with key value pairs
in a list would it would be perfect for
for a map instead okay now about why do
we call it experimental in OTP 17 the
green hair this is from the
documentation here is one thing then why
we call it experimental because it's not
completely finished in all aspects the
return arrow returns here will be
something else today we have bad i but
this should not be matched by you anyway
think it's information but sometimes it
might be reason to magic the reason that
experimental is that as always we if we
introduce something new and then we
regret that oh we should have done like
this instead usually goes that many
customers jump on the board and they
start using it and then they will not
like us to change anything because they
don't want to change a single piece of
their own code at least not when they
have come out to production and not even
before so then we have to have this
disclaimer for for new things to to
protect ourselves
that we are not hundred percent sure
that we don't want to change something
in an incompatible way but of course we
always try to avoid that and if we need
to do it we will do minimal changes and
we have to plant them to remove this
experimental disclaimer in in next major
release and what will happen done of
course you will be able to have
variables as keys and that's not a big
deal to implement actually but it goes
together with having big maps because it
will be easy to create big maps when you
have this and I think as I said the
breakpoint will go up 64 not for sure
but around that figure and we'll call it
a hand structure not the tree structure
that is this is wrong and also what we
have in the pipe here is extending the
matching so that you can match an
unbound variable which gets bound in the
math expression and this is similar what
you need for binaries as well suppose
you have this variable I which is
unbound but it gets bound here then it
is bound here so then you're using the
value have for a key look look up in the
map
but implementing this goes into how how
the order of the matching is defined in
a clause like this and we also have some
tentative things that we don't not at
all promise that we have in the next
major release to look more about the
update and I think that goes maybe
together with the single key yet that's
just one example with a JSON mapping it
could be very useful there so this is
the summary then the record part is
already there can have lit turkeys you
can have small maps you know to be of 18
you will get variables as keys and you
can have big maps and we will remove the
experimental disclaimer so we want you
to use maps so we can get feedback
because now is the time to change
anything if if any time it's hard to get
rid of things that you get into releases
so that was all my slides have any
questions
yes it has i think i have a picture on
it as well here I'm not 100% sure that
this is you can specify a map I mean the
lead is limited support in dialyzer
today it accepts map and you can specify
maps but I don't think it will take care
of all information it gets it will not
check I think maybe you can have types
if all types of the keys are the same I
think you can have that an all values
but I mean the details here is not yet
implement implemented but you can
specify them dialyzer will accept it
will not give you all warnings it could
do later okay
some Jack more questions yes at examples
on pattern matching and that was in
function close but I presume you will
have the same in the received statements
as well the pattern matching I mean you
can you can pattern match in in a
receive statements with a map too yes
yes yeah all places were pattern
matching can occur you can have maps
already today with literals occur just a
one cute question curious why is no
syntax for the get what why is the no
syntax forget why Ethan y if Y is then
why isn't there any syntax forget I mean
you can call maps call and get but just
curious I mean this doesn't make it mean
anything but I mean we have proposed to
st. I forget yeah but we didn't
implement it because we were unsure if
it was a good idea okay the particular
syntax or if it sure is some possibility
to combine it with this deep update and
things like that so we are still
thinking about that and we are open for
suggestions
was there a way to match on empty map no
not in the syntax you have to to use the
guard beef map size length zero today
I mean today that the curly brackets
only that they match any map
we are done then no more questions
after watching numerous record is being
formatted in log printouts and so on i'm
curious how would a map look till des
well or till the p of course s is the
string I don't remember it if we have an
especial new formatter for maps I don't
think so we can try oh that's the wrong
one I knew I had to eiling's here that's
the wrong one again this is the right
one it would suffice if you tell them
that I'll I see the key names what if I
see the key names along with the values
then I'm satisfy anything yes I think
you do
tilde P
two
marvelous
okay I mean that that's the same as if
you just just create the map in the
shell default print out of it like that
oh but you cannot choose the difference
between maps and records in this respect
is that in record you can declare the
field names and you get the mouth in the
same order button records you of course
you don't get the key names if you don't
know them by yourself so here it will be
in oK we've got order is idle you do you
have a quick way to define our map with
a certain amount of keys and you get the
default value for key for example
undefined if you want to have a map with
to replace a record with a map then you
maybe want to create with five keys and
beginning and then you cannot use the
same text updates the case no you can
because here you give them the value a
equals one could you just say Matt a B
and then you have a equals undefined for
example no no default values you have to
give the default you can use the merge
functions than u q8 one with some kind
of default values and then you merge
them together yeah that's the way it
goes right now anyway okay and another
question so could you have a function as
a key yes I think you can have any tar
musky we had one more question over here
hey I'm just curious about the pattern
matching on the empty map there like I
mean it seems inconsistent like if you
have an empty list in a in a function it
only matches an empty list if you want
to know you know whether it matches any
list you use his list I don't it seems
like this is the exact opposite of that
the way legacy airline behaves I think
you are right in that is it different
from the empty list but it's similar and
consistent with the matching or records
okay there they are you much of course
you have the record name in the same
texture but you don't care about how
many keys okay I can also give one
comment to that an empty list is
actually different different data type
from a list right there actually
internally they are actually different
data types the empty the fact that you
have to end with least just a hack
which became long before Kenneth that's
not Kenneth fault that's our fault okay
any more questions no right well thank
you get it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
