for computer science lab one of the
early adopters of early i think i got my
first line release on the on the tar
tape 1992 so the first pilot is that in
my in my directory SAR from that period
of time so it's I've been around for a
while I Shane told us this morning we
started a lot of companies and I also
started some companies and I worked for
a couple of years in device management
so this is what I want to talk a bit
about today about device management as a
technology and also as you can see icon
representing a company called for labs
today and we are working in that area to
do device management so surprised
talking about the ones management again
so this is the outline is going to be
technical presentation and well not too
happy I will ask you to see you
approximately what you know what you
have not been doing in this area so I
will go through the week of device
management protocols mainly for in the
mobile device management because they
are very why I have my background I'll
show you the protocols involved I'll
talk a bit about our exercise server
that's the device management server 24
laps and show a principle sketch of what
you see on the table out to work outside
the door a small demonstrating the
problem
from four loves showing how to do device
management
so we can start with some questions I
would like to know how many in this room
knows anything about device management
will be involved in device management
related project that's about probably
half I would say so and how many of you
have been involved in network management
like things SNMP for example and even
implemented something in SNMP interface
something okay and when it comes to
mobile device management how many have
done anything in that area a bit fewer
all right so you're probably already
qualified for this speech anyway so
let's we'll see when we only enough all
right so my background or the background
to one here is I'm used to work with
Vice mobile device management or couple
of years implemented different kind of
device management servers and the
company I work for we set out to solve
what we call the mms problem so back in
2002 2003 they discovered that it was
possible to send SMS or mms but it was
very hard to receive as mms and the
reason wat were because the recept the
recipient of the mms or not configured
in network so they couldn't read data
from the from the network and since mms
is based on data reception no one could
in principle receive mms em but you know
they tried and it was so funny at that
time when you could hear people on the
street actually talking about it and he
was such a disaster they would like use
it but no one could so
in 2002 we had an idea for how to solve
this and it was involved automatic
detection and device management so we
start off working with that and we
launched a couple of customer operators
and it turned out to be perfect it is
sold problem we connected all the
devices in the network they can stand
receive at any meds everyone was happy
at least in some areas in the world so
and from that point we focus on on
device management and how to connect
devices and we also implemented a device
management server that based on some
technology called home by device
management I will talk a bit about about
that and the reason why I bring up right
now is because it's something we work a
lot on but that's something that it's
not really taking off and we realize
that but we had to implement it because
our competitors said that it was the
best thing on earth and some other
customers of course wanted us to deliver
such a thing and also in this area when
Apple and specifically iPhone came
around all the managers and all levels
were terrified in this area device
management will they realize that
something would happen because Apple
they didn't know about device management
this is is it American people they don't
care they do it they're in their own way
they don't they don't they live there
give a crap about mms it's too
complicated so they didn't do that way
unless a lot later of course so in this
field today you do synchronize basically
with a USB cable and there's no over
their device
too well the starting to come right now
but it's taking a lot of years so since
many of people here knows about the bus
management I will just say that the
device management is aware of managing
devices really and what the device is it
could be anything could be i will just
to say it wave network element could be
a mobile phone or it could be a very
device that you connect through wire
wireless something so what the vice
imagine assisted typically consists of
course its device management server
something that keep track on all the
devices and then you can have wired or
wireless and basically the things i said
already and these are the shortcuts to
MDM and mmm and m2m that's that's the
that's the three electric combination to
use in the field so let's move to the
device management when it comes to
mobile device management these are
basically stopped selling all the device
management and when you solve the mms
problem we have to detect the devices in
the network so i added this detection
face in the device management it could
be a dial-up dialing could be calling
home operation but it can also include
the actual detection of the device in
the network and what is it detective
could be the MC for example one when you
do attach a phone for the first time too
work this is an event that you can pick
up and you can take action on that so
and then we typically do a bootstrap and
bootstrap contains the initial
configuration that you can send over
there if you're doing it with the mobile
device management so if you if you're
not using mobile device management this
could typically be down in the factory
the bootstrapping face and the call home
addresses and stuff so its advanced a
bit and the provisioning face this
includes everything from defining the
device into the network enable services
in the network could be turning on GPRS
access could be turning on configuring
to them and math centers and so on so it
could be quite a tricky process and
doing this provision for the device to
from nothing go into the the network and
be fully capable of sending receiving
all kinds of things also after the
provisioning face you are basically
ready to to start using the device in
the network from that point you can do
for example firmware upgrades
configuration management change adding
new configurations we'll talk about that
as well you can also add monitoring and
when it comes to network management the
monitoring can include things like
health checks reading data data
acquisition checking the interfaces on
the mobile side you read signal strength
in different areas and there are plenty
of crazy ideas what you can do with
monitoring program with mobile phones
and also the thing people most of the
time forget
but it's what you do with a waste so
when you have a mobile phone what you do
with it when you've done will you throw
it in the garbage so let's say you just
take out the same card or throw it away
that requires some some effort on the
bright side to directly understand that
this phone is not going to be used
anymore with that same currently that
would lead to a lot of interesting stuff
like configurations being put still put
in phone for the next subscriber to be a
bit surprised with about four data files
that are still remains on the complete
on the device and fall so the
provisioning is something that we'd
normally don't do but it's very
interesting thing to be able to to think
about it so when you have broken phone
you sell your phone to someone else or
it's just going to to waste you can you
can ease up some of the burners by D
provisioning the phone and release some
resources in the network and and also
take care of that process of delivering
that phone to someone else so there is
but it's up measurements of how how many
phones were moved within an operator and
not be thrown away so the idea was to
see of do the phone stick to the
operator this deal are they reused in
operator and with the device management
system we could see that a ground twenty
twenty-five percent stay at the same
writer so they were inheriting somehow
and I guess if you could measure over a
lot of operators you can probably see
that both phones they do stay somewhere
in enough
or they move to some other countries or
something so they normally not go
totally to waste so this is some a small
animation I hope so this is showing
process of a phone being entering that
the network for the first time so it's
automatically detected some magic third
for example coral optus a company that
is from the airline based I don't know
how coilovers and one call logs here no
it's not Tuesday so they're not work
there and so you could use a probe press
a network probe to be able to do this
detection process you can also have
integrated in hlr home location register
in the network so from that point you
need to go and do the provision the
enter to the to the device management
system that will help you register this
device and in the different in the
different network elements that's needed
and then an SMS is sent and this SMS is
formatted in a way that it contains
settings there's a different different
things you can do over here but this is
this is the very basic steps that you do
with with the device management for with
automatic detection so from from from
that point the devices is ready to to be
used this is how this SMS looks in
textual form
can you see it it's kind of a a very old
old version where you actually use gsm
date that circular cold so cold pack is
analog modem and i would not want to
surf the web with that kind of settings
so this is an XML document it's pretty
readable I would say not extremely nice
not extremely gory either and see there
is a lot of worse stuff I we can see
that later but this is a bit too much
generally to send or SMS so then you
have to invent something called vb XML
then you binary encode the SMS or the
XML document this is a general approach
you can actually use this for any camera
XML document but the result is a lot
better if you know exactly the domain
you're in if it's you know that the tag
is you know everything so with binary
XML you use a tax scheme so you encode
the tags in the strings we principally
one bite and then you can also switch
between different pages code pages this
works pretty good i would say it reduces
the size lot but the down the backside
is that you have to know the encoding
scheme you have to know the pages that
you use for anything coding so there are
a lot of problems involved there for
example if you you don't really have
that right if there's something wrong
with the pages there's someone out of
saying thing a lot of bugs in this area
so the local water runs to be able to do
this in a proper way and there are
people visual knows everything
to be able to send an SMS you also need
in the device management system you need
to do have some connectivity to the SMS
center or you need to write your own but
that's kind of hard if you're not inside
a telephone network or you're gonna
operate yourself but these are the
alternatives we have more or less to
connect to send SMS today and the first
alternative is to get help to send these
notifications and settings so it will do
the work for you formatting do in the
remix ml selecting all the parameters it
works very well if it's well supported
and know all the bugs and fixes so
that's lazy way in a nice way if you
have a provider that can actually help
you with it there's a PP they use the P
and seem dr different protocols from
various manufacturers that you basically
format there's a mess and send it off to
the network and if you're lucky you can
get feed-back notification secret find
out or fail or something if you're
unlucky you have just hope that it work
so what can you do over these kind of
simple protocols so you can you can set
set up the phone with different settings
that's it that's about what you can do
but there are several standards it that
you need to know about so there's an old
one corner to nokia oppa settings this
company called open way they also had
some very special that we find in some
early with mobile phones that you need
to know about and in the early documents
that showed you an example of just the
other side was what client producing 1.0
that i was an early specification from
back 40 later on backward became turned
into a home a diploma Open Mobile
Alliance and they released a document
called client provision expect so you
can imagine if you have other phones
with with all these kind of versions of
protocols and there you're actually more
but these are the main ones you have to
be pretty smart with the detection you
know you're only thing you know is that
the serial number basically on the phone
so from from the serial number of the
phone you need to figure out the way it
to end up with the correct settings
protocol and all the bugs that needs to
be fixed to be able to format that in a
really bad way so it works so and
everything everything I say the worst
thing I ever saw was the formatting that
were two different encoders in the same
document buggy encoding it in different
ways that was quite hard exactly so the
services you can configure over there
with an SMS are these kind of sore
the GPRS lab and a mess like talk about
push to talk about very popular service
in us for construction workers i think
everyone talked about in its we that's
the next big thing but it actually
stayed in us come from so wireless
village or something I guess people
heard about a bit I did science the
messaging thing and then we have sent a
man and seek him out his way of syncing
contacts bookmarks calendars local stuff
it's real mess but you can use it for
for interesting things like back at
Bristol work but you don't want to sync
with those protocols if you end up with
thousand copies or something and then
you have a sink email DM and that's
that's a two-way communication protocol
device management so i will go into that
in a second and then you can also
nowadays you can also set for you lad
but they were a bit secret in the
beginning you can set email settings and
also wireless access point settings that
could be interesting to to build some
some cool stuff on way when you know
it's possible to do for example 3d
offloading and think like that
right so enter mobile device management
starts off pretty much the same with a
bootstrap process but this one the first
but previous slide we have been able to
set up a device singam lvm settings so
same game ldm settings is something that
can bootstrap so the next SMS that you
send can trigger the device to connect
to the network and then you do device
management from that point and it looks
like this with a tweet here is an
example we have an operator at a
customer support agent that of breaker
that want to solve some problem with the
phone they need go into the phone line
do something with it to help the
customer and the classical example in
this area is that song someone had fun
in the bar with good friends phone and
to change language to Chinese in the
film language and you cannot do anything
to to switch it back because you can
treat the menus anyway so it's kind of
nice little prank that include and then
because important for help of course and
then everyone has this nice device
management set up so they can actually
call the device and yes go into the
device tree change some values and then
you have your your native speaking
language back so I was assuming that you
know
Chinese of course so you do an HP query
to the device management system the the
device management system sends and
something called the bootstrap troikans
you can read the title to it that way
it's sdn trigger and so that's that's
something that is well it says the
inferior I policy so the DM trick is
there just because of true your reasons
so it sends to the phone and it
instructs the phone to please contact
the device management center with
settings you have a foreign device
management subject so there's no
information about that in there in the
SMS so the phone if it behaves well it
will do 3g dvr'd connection and starts
on the distinct email a panic Singham
ldm session with a Dean server the teams
are really could be integrated with it
with the West management and ADC
bioessays stands for automatic device
population or sample
yeah okay so sorry when we come to this
point that the phone is trying to
connect or is connecting as some kind of
connection to the device management
subject there is already or will be a
connection like this doing some kind of
device management protocol between to
the observer and the configuration
center this will ultimately lead the
above closed loop so now through the
HTTP interface you can talk to the
device over 3d and work and you can fix
the language setting I would show you
how to do that because I don't think you
can actually do that but it was a nice
example and way for the people use as a
key feature in the device management so
here are the some of the protocols I be
either involved with or heard about or
going to do something in this area very
soon and I think its protocols are
relevant for device management so I
snappy you of course it's the old
network management protocol that is a
practically in every device in every
network elements like switches routers
phones are rivers well I guess you can
imagine a lot morning and then and so
i'm doing here is always trying to make
a mix of things both wired and wireless
to see that they're pretty much solving
similar problems but you know different
ways but the same same kind of things
that you want to do with it so in a
stampede in those days swindon SNP were
invented you have connectivity going in
a knack for most of time or that you
know that thing was not I don't think it
was even invented at that time so it was
kind of you you can connect straight and
ftp you could flow backwards and all
that no problem so then it was a kind of
a world of it before users and world
wide web and there was something after
where everything gets complicated with
IP address system and knocking yourself
so tres NLP is a UDP based thing where
it can you do I think there's plenty of
firm I'm listing here are the default
kind of wait for transport then there's
a protocol TR 69 and it's something
intervention from from I brought back
the forum at do song specification for
44 devices that you typically have at
home like satellite TV things sort of
boxes could be Rob there could be a lot
of things actually I even voice
telephony those servers are equipped
with that then I think ray corals is a
song it's great for here no Don is here
so he knows everything about here at
six-thirty 69 right now so that and
that's the fiber-optic ftth products and
you want to do basically the same thing
with those who managed those devices
I'll show you a picture of that well
over the West management we talked about
and then there is a newer newer player
on the block basically the same kind of
principle as an MP it's solving the same
things that SNMP is solving but a bit
more a bit more modern and also based on
that one
slightly different kind of way of
modeling and communicated how much work
we have teh left here so they can
probably scream or shout if everything
is totally bizarre but I just listed SSH
as one of the transport of course I know
they're plenty of those but that's the
main one at least that's the requirement
so we doesn't happy you have set and
gets you can set configuration they get
coverage data it can also send something
called traps it's basically a package
sent to inform of some high lon
situation or something it's something
that operators normally want you to
implement and so as an SNMP when you
when you define your configuration data
our what which should be configurable in
your device you use something called
amoeba data model or meet for defining
that for the data that you have between
the configuration and so this is how it
could look like for I copy that the I
pantry for faith tables so just you know
showing the syntax basically this is how
our clerks aren't going to details here
and then we do the same for 39 it's 36 9
it goes I mean then you use XML soap XML
I believe and life looks a bit or not so
easy anymore but basically the same
parameters you have get parameter values
set parameters and a couple of other
operations and also built into these
count protocols is uploaded
so I snappy also got something but that
think you need it correctly set the
addresses you want to download from I
guess there is some years covering
exactly how to do that but I think here
69 is a bit more explicit with download
and upload as i said the device is tier
69 is addressing our activity customer
premises devices that is at home at
people wireless net p for example is
stuff that is in the backbone networks
like that and here you have the very
simple model a picture down here showing
the automatic configuration center and
the device is basically is called home
now and then and see if there's
something needs to be done and like you
saw how oma deem connected back to the
network that's also a very key feature
mobile networking because there's this
most of the time no way of connecting
backwards at least if you're not in the
network itself if you don't know the IP
address of the device you don't know
anything basically to access it if
you're outside cooperated lane it
operate and a little bit more about but
that's the work that's the reason why
you connect from the client to the
server sort of vice versa one of them at
least they are tears in eyes using our
xml schema and the PDF they come on over
so xml schemas describing the data all
the configuration parameters but since
it's looking like this it's not so easy
to read and understand once s so you
have a PDF document accompanied the
specification so you can actually read
what's what's in here
we can contrast that with neck off so
that call is protocol it takes an al
based it's using a language called yang
to describe the data models on the
transport socket sense xml so pick some
out I guess no no say it out loud okay
and pork encoded in this xml is clip or
pc so it's a very simple model with your
pc calls and replies and you can encode
practically all operation won't on top
of that except possibly you have some
notification concept up probably the
thing you subtract it sometimes and here
is how yang the interface leave looked
for yang so as you can see it's you
don't have to you don't need to use the
PDF document the most i guess you
describe it in that a more natural way
different areas it looks like a little
just see your something c-format the
door it's not a big difference but
slight difference when you work with it
especially when you don't comment as
much as in this song but we can actually
read it alright so so there you have a
couple of different flavors for device
management protocol i call them the data
models the transport out what you
actually do with a new set configuration
you get configuration data you upload
former images or you can download data
from from home the devices that that's
basically what you do
so it for lab said we set out to solve a
couple of problems one of the problems
was to help smaller companies to get
some kind of platform that was easy use
that solve the device management problem
for them basically saving them years of
manuals of work just to be able to do
something over there over there and get
the connectivity managing all these
devices so we met several companies in
us that has exactly this problem they
they I don't have time they don't have
time or money back to solve this problem
and to realize that so they caught two
what kind of mine and he were involved a
lot of these kind of projects and they
all kind of really converge together to
one decision point saying that okay we
should try to solve this problem because
everyone wants to have the same thing
and we instead of doing it over and over
again for all the for the clients we can
do a company doing it for all the
clients that wants it so we launched it
and we have a launch times and we're
solving a very specific problem for them
in this area and they would save a lot
more money and a lot of effort and
probably be in time with the winter
product so XO sense it worked we called
exercise and it's a storm forward RPC so
we have cubes for every device going
back and forth so it's both ways the
device can push our pcs towards that and
wise mention server and vice versa so
going from device to the server could be
like GPS coordinates could be events
could be data readings anything that
application want to push over to the
Vice Management Center for later
delivery at the customer service it's a
bit like that call but we just remove
the old XML and we use birth or PC for
the device communication and we use JSON
RPC for the customer access interfaces
so a typical customer will do some web a
web server thing with where they manage
all their application specific soft and
they use chase RTC to access all the
devices and we take care of the rest we
also use from advice from teyla thank
you for that using Dinah's the data
model language and now we're pretty
happy with it until the nice thing is
we're really pushing for it so this is
how it looks common kind of principle
sketch
I think you're shown this before and the
challenges for exercise are among other
among several things of course is first
how do we handle all these kind of
devices or different flavors I mean if
you think about it we're not we are not
selling the device it's where we're
giving away the platform on all the
libraries and everything for free on the
device ID so we will not be developing
devices that will help customers to
start doing that and we will promote our
length in that field because we think
it's a very good fit for new
applications on the even the launch line
for example they do not use our life
according device because we will be too
late so I think so senses pluggable so
we will we will make sure it works even
for other protocols and Burt or disease
and while thinking about things we need
to have this for example the data body
it is very interesting topic when you
think about it so when people say we'll
have 50 billion devices out there
connected well if you send 50 billion as
a message antalya network at least it
will be quite a lot of money you could
probably send a couple of SMS and
actually save knots ambulance a breeze
so in that exactly in this area that
we're what cost is so it's kind of
interesting to think about I think so we
need to have ways of reducing and
limiting the data budget so they don't
run straight and just you know make that
our customer very poor
go bankrupt soon and also the regular
Mouse in on the server side as
persistent scalability redundancy does
something we're working on finding good
models for and where promote the early
devices and we want to do everything
come online simple so and what I mean
with that is that you should be able to
run practically everything all the all
the RPC calls you should be able to run
from command line from the product when
you do development when you try stuff it
should be a no-brainer and working with
this town system no big infrastructure
or XML documents or something you should
be able to send RPC request to the
device getting also backed remotely or
close close to it so afterwards we have
the small demonstration we're showing a
system partly based on on the for that
stuff so the exit the in server it's the
foil apps and the workstation is
typically sometimes customer site then
we have birth or to see going to the
modem in this picture connected to an
embedded RF sewn call it that we send
and the using RF modulation to light
turn on and turn off lights or work on
for the 53 mega Hertz gender style an
iphone app called season RC that can be
used control over multicast UDP in this
case the application the RF application
so it's actually something we open
sourced recently died reports on this
based on an application in you can
that I thought about before but now it's
open sourced so you can build their own
can open application and in this case
you don't see any can wiring here but
i'm still using like can frames on on
top of UDP is to be able to to use it
for the other projects involved in as
well and in this picture can actually
see that they're a couple of wireless
networks involved so i'm here for
example how the Wi-Fi over here there is
the radio frequency on the 49 50
megahertz band for controlling this and
then you have the 3 g's on on two square
meters you have three different
