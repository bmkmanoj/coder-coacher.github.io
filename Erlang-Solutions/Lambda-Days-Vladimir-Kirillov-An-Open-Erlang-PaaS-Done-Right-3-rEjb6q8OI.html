to speak about an open our own platform
called boxes the main goal of which is
remove state from your DevOps and why is
that so because DevOps is about side
effects you have too many resources
within your web too many files too many
configuration files that disrupt disrupt
your productivity mainly because this is
the things that I handled by some other
people in your team and ops is mainly
the place where stuff goes wrong and
breaks no matter how smart your program
is just because your OS is not
configured properly by someone and we're
trying to get rid of that having a
closed environment in mind why cloud is
because don't always have to pay for
having and exploiting a machine in your
environment or having something in your
rec you might have zero machines tonight
and you have may have a hundred tomorrow
depending your workload any number of
your clients and we are also in early
adopters of along guns n which is a
pretty cool rock star but a statute
which I'm going to dive into later and
we adopting docker which is a hipster
technology which does everything for
containers but why watches there are too
many platforms already there are here oh
poo they're open shift their plot this
cloud foundry and they all try to do
something that does something about
deploying stuff into the cloud and
making it magically work but first of
all we're trying to concentrate in
Erlang as not every pass tries to
concentrate their forces on working with
Erlang hygiene and making Erlang like
operations that look very much like the
way you write programs in our line
there's no need to copy existing one so
luxus is more of like a research that
makes our lives the eyes of me and my
team easier when we go to airlock and
when it comes down to the platform we
have to hack on the code and I think
known platform devotes much time to this
they only care about deploying and
scaling and I care about prototyping as
fast as I can and I care about deploying
as many times as I care during the day
because I want to see other people make
other people see the results of my work
so I want to make like it's the future
like it was in the past in 1980s where
the result of your work was a single
binary that you can give out on a disk
at a floppy disk and they could just run
one binary and that's okay and now you
have pythons rubies and javas where you
have to take care of the virtual machine
of resources images and connections to
databases it's a lot harder now so I try
to call it the first drilling platform
done right because it's right because it
doesn't have much features which I'm
going to explain later and when I speak
about hacking I mean your environment
were you working and you write code and
shouldn't be far different from the your
production environment pretty much
because most of you develop on their
macbooks or linux or windows boxes and
they deploy in the cloud which has
different operating system and when it
comes down to interpret bility of your
system with your application you have
all kinds of integration problems that
you can discover early and you want to
hack reproducibly it means that if you
create an app and it has too many
dependencies because it is a quick
prototype like it uses no GS for CSS
minifying god save us from it and it
uses Python for some scripts just
because python has too many libraries
for different stuff
you can just give it away without
writing a huge written explaining how to
do it on different systems and walking
down two versions of dependencies of
your raps and we actually had a case in
our experiences when this were were not
having such a platform showed us in a
bad light we have an app called skyline
which use end to all the framework for
web socket framework for along and the
skyline is like a website like
application and it has a nice library in
it that allows you to authenticate with
OAuth with Facebook github and some
popular social web site and this app was
in the interest to Joe Armstrong who's
the creator of along and he get got our
application he downloaded it to his
macbook and he couldn't compile it
because they have required no G has to
do javascript processing and we spent
like two days explaining to how to get
no GSR providing his machine instead we
could just give it give him a binary or
link and say that just type this one
command and you will have the separate
up up and running and this would be much
easier when you hack it means you don't
have to make any frictions like you were
doing Pete like you don't do in PHP for
example a PHP is basically a processor
for CGI scripts where some interpreted
reads the file run the script and that's
it and in Erlang you have to take care
about running virtual machine you have
to recompile modules you have to run
tests manually and that's annoying and
people say that this this is the task of
an IDE and an ID is usually separate
from a deployment platform and this is
not a good thing because there are still
discrepancies in your environments which
you have to take care manually and good
hacking means no more excuses that this
particular feature works in your machine
and on your machine only so for example
if you have a Mac and you to fly to
Linux you always get into problems when
you write a port app and it uses cake
you and your Linux doesn't help cake you
and you get to eat all you have to
rewrite your app and then you make
mistakes and your waste time for example
if you write a file system of observing
app you have a problem of having
different interfaces for example Mac OS
has a fesse event and Linux is identify
and you as your hack on Mac OS you have
to have some other guy writing the web
or for example you try to deploy from
weldings to another and you're sending
the West which run into the production
of us are 14 which is like a decade old
and you have to port your Ellen code to
run it on our 13 if your management or
cdo's don't allow you to create or you
compile ports on one linux machine or
another mac and then just transfer it
and doesn't work but everyone who
evangelizes Erlang tells you that the
beam like works everywhere you write
code and then we deploy it and
everything's fine but it's not true
because your Apple almost often depends
on every hour of C code that you can
just copy from one machine to an elect
with run and then once you finish
hacking you have to deploy and if you
hand more than one command to deploy
you're busted if no one will waste time
to figure out how to deploy Europe if
here is not a oops geek or this is
probably the reason why languages like
go is popular when you compile a go app
you have one binary that has old drivers
in it and you can even cross compile on
a Mac a binary that we will work on
linux and this fact is very much
exploited by guys who write poker and
they have 10,000 likes endured github
repo and they have read easily enough
money for that well however for some
reason Haskell is always also delivering
aesthetic
binary but it's not so popular maybe
because it doesn't cross compile or
maybe for sometimes other reason I guess
we got language is hard so probably some
of you know the comics and it says so
how do you acquire is a debate and the
other response is not add a basic you
value store okay so how do i queried
well you've already distributed my
produce function Erlang did you just
tell me to go myself I believe I
did Bob so same story in DevOps
basically how do I run this app well you
have to write get this thing and then to
something with it so when you deploy
don't have to have any moving parts like
an operating system a runtime libraries
and some state that's also bounced your
app which you don't take care of
directly so does a lot of stuff that you
have to do when you redeploy your app
for example you have to deploy distant
files because they don't have the same
configuration format and you always
forget to leave this as no two ops or
you don't correctly fill your deploy
scripts and it'll break how many of you
have seen this ever when you're running
in production yeah the icy hands and
they know what this means and you don't
want to see this anymore I guess so in
Linux as well when you use an operating
system you have a bunch of features that
you'll need to eat but they don't need
to use but they exist despite of you
knowing about them for example selinux
that it forces some policies on you
being not being able to use the Machine
properly and everyone who just sees
linux machine the first thing he does
she goes and deletes see linux or just
disables it and you don't need any users
you just run your app under to users
like fruit and some unfurnished user you
don't need access control lists you
probably don't leave file systems
because you have cloud storage and like
react and react
yes and it doesn't actually need a file
system because it's it is a wrap around
its own fault system called leveldb
basically and it has networking stack
which don't need to care about because
it just slows you down and you have
package managers and I guess no one of
you well little of you probably even
care to deploy their apps using Colin
package matter to just copy the files
and make sure they run and when you use
package managers you have these problems
like health deploys is when the half of
your app has installed and there was an
error in your script and and then you
have to roll back because your deploy
isn't it's not completely full and there
is no rollback procedure because you
haven't taken care of it because no one
takes care of Road bags because the
newer software is always better and it's
always slow and with linds you have
these hacks when you have to implement
zero copy stuff that doesn't interact
with the colonel too much to save
yourself from speed and use features
like nat bap that's my direct blog
device access for virtualization drivers
use hex like Chief and puppet to help
you manage state so basically all you do
is like you're a pert system is a
variable and you do a lot of operations
to change it properly and this doesn't
look pretty compelling to you as a
software developer and you want to scale
so a for some reason when you work on an
application scaling is something that is
done by the people who don't write the
code it's oh pretty often is done by
people who just run stuff and when they
think of scaling it means that you just
pull more instances of this application
more nodes which doesn't always work but
anyway people do that and just pray that
nothing breaks and then tune the load
balancer which isn't a concern of the
developer but of an operation guy and
when scaling you can just rely on
third-party software because you don't
know how it works advanced that when you
work with any other app and use in your
project you transitively make it a
project of your own because you have to
know all its bugs and maintain with your
codebase otherwise it will cause you
down time or bugs or errors while in any
case it's like losing money so it's
pretty cool to use libraries like really
rya'c or that handle a lot of fault
tolerance and scaling problems for you
consensus algorithms like crafts that
are not common in operating system and
they're scaling solutions and you wanted
to have a like library that does Claudia
operations for you in your code which
color color relates with the jobs
manifesto of that the code is your
configuration and locks is the priority
tries to have an OTP like library of
supervision trees for nodes which is
which is a more higher level abstraction
than those processes so and when you
deploy to cloud you want to be aware of
your topology when you just spend up to
boom two instances you don't know if
they run on the same box or in two boxes
and you may not want to have these two
instances right to the same disk because
if that disk fails your application
thinks that there are two copies of the
data but actually there was one and
you're you lose data and you would hot
migration is if you want to spin up a
new instance of your app you want to run
the old version for a while until
everything that settles and clouds are
currently too expensive for that because
you have to spend like 10 minutes spin
it up and you able to know and waiting
for it to provision and then you have to
configure it and this is not cheap at
all and you want to have instant
bursting and that's where a lot of Zen
shines for those who don't know along
and Zen it's a pretty wild technology
it it doesn't need another operating
system it's a bear virtual machine its
entirety it doesn't do any SP at all
because basically as SP takes care of
you taking all over the processors on
your machine but in the cloud the data
centers your machine you don't know how
many machines are you writing on and
it's so cool that it was in 30
milliseconds where the hell out this
time is the overhead of the hypervisor
it's very fast it beats being in some
benchmarks and it's pretty it means it's
pretty elastic that if you can boot a
lot of the machines in this in a second
you can scale pretty damn fast comparing
to operating system based solutions that
require all of overhead and this reminds
of 30 milliseconds is only 30 10 times
slower than spinning up a process on the
Mac so one it takes one millisecond to
want to start in a less process on my
lap machine as seen on this measurement
and Brazil and then you can do cool
stuff like running a thousand notes and
passing seven million well one message
through seven million processes and five
minutes this demo was given the key of
by the guys who work on along and Zen
and a OS let over in system less
instance helps you solve some problems
like too many levels of indirection or
too many levels of abstraction that you
have to care about like when you have a
database like application it usually has
a curry cash and has its own data
structure that manages the disk layout
and then it goes through language vm and
then it jumps into the kernel where
there another cache another file system
like data structure that manages disk
layout and then there's a block cash
that handles the disk subsystem which
accesses blocks on your disk
and when you see resources well
researches in in Twitter on the network
on hacker news wherever you see that
people try to write applications that
try to utilize the resources they work
on to their maximum for example people
try to optimize their hash tables to fit
into SSD pages and this is something
that you handle in your application and
some people work on the OS and when this
disparity you lose performance so this
stuff belongs to an OS kernel in the
bottom and you can just remove it and
that's what basically link or language
and then is its virtual machine is
called link you it's not a closed source
and it has a free build service so you
can get by innovation run on Amazon or
your own Xen hypervisor I personally
don't have direct access to its code but
I live in the same city at its creator
so we often chat and I kind of can
influence sometimes their their future
decisions hope and Link is mostly r16 it
actively developed if you use it and
find a bug just fired their it's pretty
cold as it doesn't have any traditional
traditional like solutions for common
problems that you encounter for example
it has it looks a lot like a colonel and
diplomat a 90 protocol from plan 9 for
external file systems you can access
regular file systems and have file
system like API it has its own
networking stack it uses hell wab
doesn't have a normal file system at all
for persistence ins use google fest
which is pretty like a hack that allows
you to allocate disks and for mega byte
blocks which is more than enough for
your own level to be installation or had
to be or whatever it doesn't have lifts
at all because this is pretty much a
problem for scheduling because you can
just properly count reductions if you
have nifs and it causes
problems of they are not none of them it
means that summerlin features don't work
yet like asn.1 minions and cell doesn't
work right now but um work was working
at yesterday during talks and it doesn't
have that Colonel because net Coronel
basically tries to air long distribution
protocol first to get everything to
everyone and you probably don't want to
help that in cloud because it gives you
too much overhead it doesn't have
earlham tracing well that's bad but it
has its own or linked racing which isn't
as flexible as beams right now it has
some profiler and I have its own
debugging version that you can attach
ggb to in charge of reverse engineer you
need to well it doesn't have much of
documentation like these three features
were explicitly asked by me and they
were implemented and they are not
properly documented but I guess this
will be fixed in the future alexora
works in laying i ported react or and
react pipe to wendell for tooling it
works but it doesn't well it works and
only one note because there's no net
kernel and Ryan instead Colonel each I
purdy works end to all the web framework
works and link is a port of link and
open flow switch is in progress and it's
actually making a little faster we use
we have a lot of stuff that makes wing
basically work as a platform platform
like solution if you missing features
you can always use open me reg have 9p
servers build them on your linux
machines use rub rump kernels which are
basically rewrapped net bsd but it's not
always along in them because you always
have to run all your other applications
you have to prototype and you have to
actually fix someone's problems that you
for people that use linux and i was
trying to do
that in way that's currently popular
that allows you to embrace isolation
lightweight isolation on Linux system
called containers and in Linux there is
Alexei and hipster docker there is next
iOS which is used by Haskell hackers
next is actually pretty cool it allows
you to do functional like deployment on
regular learning systems without
containers and wrestle Arizonans infuse
details well dales are pretty much
broken anyway so containers allow you to
separate code from your data allow you
to have a single image deployment like
you have in their logins and you just
build a single binary or just single
file system image and just transfer it
to a machine and write it if you need 10
you just have an API that allows you to
spawn some more instances that look a
lot like yours and configure them from
your code and you have sep and you can
separate code from your data as you
don't have a regular file system and you
just to store your data in known store
it like really xes and you don't have
any configuration because extra
configuration files because it's all
defined with your application it's very
you need it very much when you have to
deploy like CDN instances or on-demand
streaming video streaming stuff so I try
it's easier to have functional like
deployments where there's immutable code
and you replace it with other immutable
code instances it's a lot easier to
delete everything and then create it
from scratch and it means that you're
prepared for failures I call it lambda
ops basically you have single image
deploys your app defines your resource
it's a lot easier to spawn another
instances of the image and have like a
copy updates which and roll back if
necessary your code is always your
configuration and to do that we have a
lot of tools like around girl a build
machine it's pretty dump some of the
code is already available on our get
help there's no
recommendation yet because it's always
working for ballistic in progress I
think after I finished with some work
with making ssl work in them I'll
publish something on github we've been
working on tools like active like having
it's like sync but it doesn't actually
hold your CPU all the time so you can
safely develop on your macbook's bar
you're traveling bindings for dokur a
proper flat flame graph profiler for
airline because well f prof is ugly you
know it and there are web libraries like
abs like the repertory akinesia by the
way ninja works in ling RabbitMQ clients
and 20 and much more so stay tuned and
still work in progress but i think this
beam will be more quote soon and
functionalized all the things
it's time for questions right fire why
do you say that 3bd jails are broken
well I guess they're not broken per se
but the community is not too much around
jails and it's not very easy how to
replicate some features of zones like
isolation of file system access and
having sparse the sparse zones like you
can like your OS can share some parts of
the file systems so that's why I think
it's still broken I need some work but I
guess there's I know that there's work
to make prove private networking stacks
for free bc and thick fog that's done I
songs will get more trails will get more
traction yeah there were some
modifications I think they are open
source now I'm not sure it was done by
Maxim who's the developer link itself
questions unless yeah thanks a lot and
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
