food beyond what we're going to release
and week and that's a swedish we're
having next week so it won't contain any
astonishing new features but we'll have
a few things that i might be interesting
it would be interesting with working
remote okay now thank you Mark fixes of
course as usual when it's in service
release it's about 100 I think it's 160
for 146 also because it black and but
it's only like twenty five six at this
time from from directly from open source
that we integrated directly and it just
because of different things first of all
we had a lot of open source
contributions that has been adopted
inside of every time we have taken them
in then adopted them and then we're
going to do release and we have also
started with it you were wrong and the
duo branches and those who hang around
get help and look at our branches may
hopefully have seen that we had one
master branch which is like leading it
development and what hopefully is going
to be our 16th and then what we call
maintenance branch and that's what
release and before with which two
branches things either go into the next
release or disappeared into thin air now
again or possibly to receive again the
next service please you never knew so
today when you send in a patch you will
hopefully soon get an answer saying
other rejected because of something you
have more and you will get a letter
saying okay I will integrate this paint
which means you have something about it
or master which means you have something
something either incompatible in some
way or dangerous so and also we're
changing the way we work in in the
vacuum machine so some patches have fun
have had to wait too long for you maybe
that is our few patches true that beings
really but we have time to review the
goal is to be even false on reviewing
patches so that so that we get your
answers you deserve and get a better
chance takes place in time for the next
release and especially if it's important
for you to get listening to in to the
release for some reason you need a
functionality do it release and you
don't want to put on their own touches
or answer it's important that we review
your patches in time and the end if you
have found the bag of course so
so what dtrace is the main thing nothing
for a lot of people we are at least
three traits patch from Scott and budget
which has been used and we had the talk
yesterday on the DevOps track about
using it and so on and we are meaning to
integrate vision and whenever we were
starting to have a release me I in time
we had changed too many things that the
past with word and see I mean Scott
fabric we work the pad resubmit so now
instead move the whole thing into the
main TV source which doesn't mean all
that much because it's still not i mean
the full field or something but you just
configure with the dynamic tracing and
you will have all of the probes and
vacuum gee that wasn't past this that's
still work in progress on telling
mortality we've also fixed the East grip
not flashing when terminating finally so
so if you write something out on file in
the new script and then it terminates
well it flushed it wasn't that
it sounds like so easy well okay there
the contest of application has had a lot
of enhancements bug fixes and changes so
if you use test framework you will be
happy the release 2 has had a lot of bug
fixes and more or less complete rewrite
a bit of the colonel functionality so
and we've also added a few things for
reba and more to come hopefully the
observer application which is this
material greeting you use it ok it's
nice i have new monitoring to which is
based on what's the last thing here
Talon statistics it's a big turn my do
this
okay Alan statistics getting a little
war time that's something definitely
name your what but that function can get
information about how much the
schedulers or work which is not the same
thing as how much CPU you consume me and
that's important because if you trying
to do it balances system here if you're
trying to your stop rocking or something
when I have too much to do if you want
to know when the system is going to be
overloaded often you see software
looking at the cpu utilization which is
not correct because because of
management but one thing is that the S&amp;amp;P
virtual machines being so so at some
point you will get near hungry person
cpu but that's the course it's trying to
be responsive by spinning on the locks
and and that's how so if you have locks
you have been a little almond otherwise
you go into carnality takes like forever
for this case
operating system so so it starts to spin
more than than you'd expect and the more
changes we make the Morlock free data
structures we make and the more you see
being a transient equations and and it
so it is separate the system like
seventy-five percent you might see at
one hundred percent cpu utilization and
stop servicing if you imagine that so
you said measure how much the scheduler
is actually working and that we can do
with this airline statistics week and
that's also what I observer is using to
monitor your system so we also have a
new application which is not like a 560
and it's called LF and it's an held up
fine and I think in now consists of like
15 1 B by a simple client but it will be
extended in the future after Sh and as
well as enhancements and stabilizations
and there's more to count so ed praise
for those who want to use it we've
changed the configuration computer para
ticket to its now you can figure with
that that's a good dynamic place people
dtrace or with dynamic crazy
system time and probably with it will
get more dynamic restraint works yeah so
and we'll have we have a lot of probes
and if you look at the council directory
on the run and tubes application you'll
see examples for most of the probes up
in your old approach so we have these
streets there then you can run and an
academy training and end up virtual
machine you can see what happens so
there's documentation to be found in
there random to application and also
there's reading 5 you might want to be
it's actually got all the reading device
slightly changed because I change some
names so and system and is the the Linux
de Tracy thingy and it kind of works you
can try them but we don't test system
type on a daily basis we just build
system we don't run tests because of
problems with have getting colonel work
the assistant at this time or Frieda ish
if you have contributions and that if
you have experience with system and of
course if you have more impressive
probes you want into the vacuum machine
submit patches it's nice if you could
give an example discreet so that most
probes that are in the virtual machine
also have this example de strip yes
firing them so so and there you can
easily see the name of the program zone
so in the future we will do some more
things in all 16 we are hoping to get
parallel code learning which you would
think we already have but we don't so
can everybody told in the system you
stop all schedulers except one because
the code is not long so we'll have
parallel code loading and we have a lot
of enhancements coming in for for the
math for cases where you have more than
more than just like four or eight goals
when you talk about what it calls a 400
course and that's me going from locking
to lock free data structures so there's
a lot of changes in the core part let's
get
going on so so you could always try to
the master branch and see what's
happening there but you might see
performance degradation to mighty
different things if you cry etrade might
see a compilation error so you will so
you're into doing something useful with
our line right now by the main branch
and all wait for next release so we also
updated the type specifications for four
built-in functions you may have noticed
before that there are no such
specifications for built in fact
actually there were but they were hidden
inside the soul or now on fire in the
education action and now if you look at
calendar earth in in the monster rock
you will see the same come you would see
they were mixed these subs and c5 space
and everything you look like like they
were next so the difference between
Dixon
not visible dialyzer will be faster both
in parallel and in the single for case
it could have been already haunted in
the year one but for various reasons
were not really ready to put a parallel
dialyzer out a main maybe would come
already
so we'll do more dynamic creation in the
future and we have this alpha TNG a
phrase framework that Erickson lives so
we'll probably great that one will have
more announcements to relative we will
expand bella ssl has a lot of things
going on for it and also we are working
on the lathe and support telecom network
communication applications and which we
have got to like diamond so we're also
working with non-uniform memory access
computers and we're working on a vehicle
color that Lucas will tell you all about
if you do to that track of the launch we
are looking we have seen up from the
relief project and Kostas here is doing
a lot of interesting work on on
enhancements message passing that will
hopefully see in the next release or the
release of that it's hard to say this is
what you might and ala king will usually
hit the Liberals doesn t not good and
maybe we'll see if you were to the Helen
news conference this
you may have chemical about you data
structure hopefully we'll see something
from that and hopefully we'll see that
schedulers and native processes which
would help
now I'm really wonderful at the CES to
dig the enhancements we will see
hopefully continue you work as you may
have noticed you can still not right the
source code from utf-8 and compiler to
compile a little bar well you can see
the characters but but as soon as the
right Oh your pride so we and we are
expecting many many more high-quality
contributions from you and I know what I
will see them I hope that we can can
handle the interactions with you better
than before even better than before and
Andy would be it would be easier for you
to contribute even more like really
crude software to our prove it
yeah I knew some new delhi answer yes I
don't know can you repeat the question
yeah the question was when will our 16
be released and and we actually don't
know yet our usual release cycle is
around one here so so that would mean is
open november december but we're not
sure it depends on internal stuff at
ericsson and also depends on you if you
have these cool things that we want to
get out we may release it earlier i
would say we won't weigh more than here
yeah you can tweet that okay and more
questions okay
people are using it yeah you mean our
implementation of SB TV yeah there's
this a few I mean I don't know everyone
that uses it but what we have a few
active customers of consortium and
internally so but a more like I know
about like three or four projects that
are actually actively helping us
equities submitting things that'll name
so it's not all that last man I mean
compared to these pictures yeah I have a
really good answer I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
