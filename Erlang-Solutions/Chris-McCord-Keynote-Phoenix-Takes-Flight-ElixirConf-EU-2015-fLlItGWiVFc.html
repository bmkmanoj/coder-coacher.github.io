and the time little talk is Enoch Space
Flight I really love alliterations so
forgive me for that but today we're
talking about where Phoenix came from
last seven months since electric romp us
and kind of where we're going so busy
they don't know me I created Phoenix
work at a company called old lines we do
web design web development and I am
taking us into Phoenix development so
Jurgis ouch I can't go talk without
mentioning mediterranea Lister I offered
this came out what months ago with Pratt
prob so check that out as a lot of fun
and hope your to gloss over on this
slide but I was just like trying to
listen what we've done in the last six
months and it's like a crazy amount like
guy like the amount of stuff that we've
added just since which prompt us has
been I'm saying to look back on so the
most of talk today is kind of good it go
over those features i think i think a
lot of people aren't gonna wear where
we've been some people make comments
online like I checked in excel in
September last year and it wasn't quite
there and it's like light you're dead so
we'll kind of go over that we have
generators reminding started quickly we
have this nice concept of router
pipelines to group know we're kind of
when I separation and concerns so we
have this concept of endpoints talked a
lot about how I designed this monolithic
system and then Josie came in and said
all these things are global way to make
them not global small talk about how 10
points
that things I've learned coming into the
kind of OTP mindset we had a nice
protocol layer for modeling so we have
echo integration by default but it's
just part of all driven so if you want
to bring your own holla later it's just
like it's like 50 lines of code you
implement a couple protocols and all
your forms or links just work for
builders are in with that you know can
use any new test through mix archives so
it's easier than ever get started we add
channel transport adapters which main
channels a lot more extensible puffs of
adapters to work on roku in cases where
you're not usually distributed elixir
lawn-mowing fall back which has become a
huge pain in the butt for the core team
but it's it was really needed people
needed that the old browsers and for
weird proxies so that's in place we have
sad gas that building which one going to
live reload so we focused on like a
development process so it's been really
nice that we solve a lot of like or what
are we need to get done and we focus a
lot on like developer or cooling just
like elixir where it's like it should be
a great experience you develop your
Phoenix applications so I kind of gave
it a nice can move that and just
recently we had a test belper so just
like your development experience should
be really nice your test experience to
be easy which would promote promote get
till too late so test helper is actually
like just like we can have a go i think
i was on the plane enjoys a added some
nice features so i'll kind over those so
this is our current 10 milestone was
like there's not much there we're
actually very close to a 10 release I
didn't want to give me dates but let
some time july this year i think we will
be competent enough that didn't go
inside with elixir
it's just something that lives for 12
and Jose am speaking july but it will
probably both be wrong on both sides so
but just to say there's really no
massive changes I think that unless we
find some things aren't working quite
well we just want to add some semester
features like challenge generator
channel authentication is kind of one of
the bigger ones but as far as
implementation wise it's not going to be
too bad you just want to provide an easy
way to do token authentication so we
don't leave that up to the user channel
test helpers as well unified lon fuller
because long point is made my life sad
but that's just a way to kind of wish
special special casing long one with
channels we kind of want to have a
unified interface for that and it will
solve a lot of problems that within the
code and then we want to focus on
extravagant some of these things to keep
the core Phoenix essence limb and with
that I've always promise we'll have ios
and android channel clients we have an
objective C in the Swift library that
will be ready so I'm assuming we'll
assume acceptable step up and write the
in to reply so I say well have it but I
don't plan on writing so if you have a
android experience please not that but
they came those the browser in most
mobile platforms will really accelerate
Phoenix I think it's it doesn't take
much code right at Channel client so i
think we'll hit all major platforms
going to be kind of a really nice thing
to get outside of just the browser but
how the same time communicating so i
can't talk about phoenix without talking
about people behind it it's much bigger
than me and games wouldn't be what it is
today without people here so i chose a
was kind enough instead
timber to hop on board and he's written
like a thousands of lines of code so
it's very much this is labor of love as
well and I'm super grateful for that
Eric career pecs hop on board recently
too added xm8 support for channels which
just for older browsers and like that's
not very fun thing to do so we need to
really pay eric's a nice gratitude is
he's done these things that are like
thankless like you know the package
manager excavate support and these are
necessarily fun to implement but they're
heated so i really appreciate that we
should really thank him and we have sony
strawberry juice in steve's as well they
could make it today but they have a
great home and now we can't mention the
same scene without mentioning Lance old
person he's the person behind the
Phoenix guides so he's written almost
all the Phoenix guys if you've been to
Phoenix framework that's his his work
for the last several months so he asked
me alistor conf us how you could help he
said Phoenix looks really cool when I
told him we really need guys and I just
don't have the time to do them so he's
like oh that's not cool i love he'll go
and he later told me he was thinking
like it was of good eating multiple
people behind the guys but it was just
him to his surprise after he committed
so turned into months of work but it's
it's super important so you're just like
the page fourteen committee code like
that's a huge help like having someone
put
together the guys is just as important
as contribute code because onboarding
new people having learned the concepts
is critical to phoenix's success so you
see in earnings people to give them a
big thank you now so what I lots of new
features uh you can easily install
Phoenix now this is huge URL but it's
way better than cloning your you
skeptical on teenage forget a building
run a mix task in one directory now you
just copy pasted man and you can run mix
Phoenix you anywhere on your system and
with wit sir 12 and 11 I easier mix tarp
Evansville excuse you're done and then
mixing two from anywhere your system you
don't have to worry about anything else
it just generates a things out so easier
than ever get started Robert pipelines
like I talked about they allow a spoke
group of scoped groups of plugs and
plugs like an ice moon where abstraction
that's just functions it was this really
nice having a little where but it's just
because as nicely as function
definitions and it allows I like a clear
separation of concerns so if you're
coming from a Californian background
it's like our answer to inheritance on
how do we build up these kind of
inherited transformations and nowhere in
like a same way so i'll show you what
that looks like this is a phoenix router
infamous if you have a pipeline macro
and you can now just scope nowhere to
say okay I have a browser so things that
concern was the browser requests I want
to do things like kesha session because
I'm going to need I think a user I want
to protect them from forgery so I'm
going to as yours see our SF cross-site
request forgery protection and these
things are kind of expensive so we can
have a guideline that we say you know
what we need to worry about cross-site
request forgery don't even touch the
session for a yacht let's make a set of
middleware that we can just say okay
inti across those can do dat guy James
my browser can either browser things and
we can just scoop that in our router and
we can just pipe through multiple little
weird so here we're using browser but
you can
this so in my applications i have like a
staff pipeline that it goes like staff
authentication so i like to split things
up really well and then just pipe
through a series of peas and it gives
you a nice adequate slowpoke but what is
the request life cycle and it's
something that has worked really well
for us so generators these are a huge
addition I resisted them at first I'll
talk a lot about by my learning process
on kind of thinking about futures
because I think these are a huge huge
tank on board newcomers and teach them
kind of ways at Phoenix so they just
bootstrap your HTML or Jason API models
views controllers templates sets up a
test for you it generates echo
migrations and like I said it's just
great for beginners to get up or any
quickly if you're using games
professionally you're not necessarily
going to be using the generators for
everything but get started is really
important and I have to joy demo because
to really drive us home so I had a
Phoenix app running here and we'll see
what happens but let's say I'm writing a
repo a chat application for our workshop
good let's say you know we're a 10
million dollar valuation and we want to
add like a blog future to it and get to
like 20 billion dollar
valuation let's do that so I can blow my
fon here the bottom here we go oops can
say Phoenix Jan HTML on this good
generation on resource but we also say
Jason apientry popular so we can
generate you know that Jason my employee
in your Jason Hughes for now we'll give
HTML we're do a blog post model we can
pluralize it and then I give some fields
here for my schema so I know blog post
is going to have a body which is going
to be text and maybe a user ID which is
going to be an integer of the post so i
can hit enter it creates a bunch of
files and it tells me add this to your
router time papi does Tommy here and say
okay I need it for figure out what's
gonna be the best location to add to my
application router and I'm in the
Phoenix source good very good so if i go
into my router i can say you know what
you just pop this in a browser pipelines
this is where I want opposed to live I
say this go back over here it tells me
to run mixed fdmi great
and it migrated up a migration file data
generated and now would go back to
browser follow those instructions here's
my chat up 10 million dollar valuation
I'm gonna go to slash posts and the
server is not running but we can write
50y abbas investor Gitmo just went down
a little bit of bringing back okay and
now we've generated some cred code
controller reviews templates I'm Creek
posts on the submit this and like oh my
gosh validation errors so like this
isn't like crazy innovated we've seen
this another frame works but it started
for users to be able to come into this
code it is super important and I chose a
did did most of this work so it's a huge
addition so I'm going to have like
what's your conf my user ID used one it
persists that in the database and we get
a listing of messages I can update it i
think the leads and like it's crazy fast
even in development mode like it's
almost crazy but sometimes like there's
no way that actually worked and we're
any development people on Twitter will
tweet out we're checking in salad bowl
benchmark in the villa look at these
numbers this is crazy and i'll find out
that they are running in development
mode which is like like over 10 times
slower than production and i can still
blow their minds so it's cold as ever
say that so that's generators I think
it's just too helpful to see how that
works i'm away through the code but for
newcomers they can check out those
controllers and views and say okay this
this is the right way to do things like
i said you're not going to just give the
right code the goal is not to just like
hey we can just run mix past the goal is
to say okay this is best practices and
we kind of give it into the user like
usually do things so that's generators
we added a static asset angling with
brunch which is an oj s project so
before you look through things out of me
it's optional and the way we integrated
is you can swap it out with anything you
want but it just works Joe's a nice have
been like in
a horrible number of hours evaluating
different new JS build tools here's like
there's a lot like third i'm gonna i
think i can name them all but there's a
lot like I have like like dozens and
dozens of hours of my fading like this
was the least favorite part of phoenix
but these problems have been solved and
they've been solved well so instead of
spending a year of my life working on
reinventing the wheel for no jayus the
opinions of us and still haven't used
nodejs anyway because if you want to
compile anything you have used Mooji is
pretty much so we've just dropped brunch
in on you want to think about it it just
worth fifty I've noticed all it's super
fast and by default we obsess and es6
support so es6 is the script sticks its
latest specification specification
JavaScript and there's no reason to not
use it it it will transpile a tes by
that will work in all major browsers
Super Bowl browsers if you had a
polyfill for certain things and adds
things that you would expect a language
ahead of like modules are finally like
solve like there's one way to do modules
i can import socket from phoenix i can
do things like a restructuring
assignment it's not like Pat matching
but you can see here I've been at least
pulling messages off the JavaScript
literal without having to kind of mess
around them and look at a string
interpolation like wow but that's used
to go bye-bye to the I go to language
like five that's right
it's like I have to like concatenate
strings together what is it I don't know
I don't know I don't know so so even if
his six was launching I had to transpile
this restraint tribulation it would be
worth it to me but it has all this other
cool stuff so use it in Phoenix you're
going to think about it you just try you
at six and it provides for you and we
have pretty ears looks are come to us we
had like I render like a texting like
something went wrong here's what we
think the speckers was and now we get
like nice pretty error as you can click
through the statuary to see the code on
the right 40 there's a line of code that
raised boom so that's nice we had a
library load which I have to demo
because it's just super nasty high drive
home the developer experience and we're
using channels for this so we've kind of
dog food our own secret sauce to add
this dress nice developer feature so if
i head over to my application and try to
make this fit on the screen i'm going to
edit my exm plates that are listening to
posts so this is the post index maybe
somewhere there we go so we can see
we're listening post and we want to edit
this to say showing post save like
instantly update oh right and after
refresh so we cool
yeah and we're using uh oh my god
there's a library that is actually using
on file system events so we're not like
pulling the file system this isn't gonna
like eat up your CPU I or any
development and just works these are
things that like we added the ability
for like real-time communication so I
hadn't planned new life reloading but I
was just speaking in my hope we've had
channels let's just set up when you go
to page i said up a little I inject my
parsley in body tag and I just inject a
little job search inhibit and then we
just broadcast positive changes happen
it's like a tiny monokote so there's
waiting things that I can't even think
about that having this like real-time
communication at your fingertips kind of
enables so and this is good work for
your JavaScript and CSS also so if we go
into our a static assets I have you know
this page here I wanna make it more like
a look-see right i say background purple
here say it and we have a purple
background so it's just really nice
developer experience and it was going
back to any of my other primer so to use
it's just like they don't have this or
have to add myself so it's just it's
been really fun to focus on kind of some
of these nice core features now that
we've all with a lot of the other
problems as I below and it just works
and spot mine to work for your
JavaScript as well so we're going to
talk a lot of our channels channels or
why I'm standing here today that's why I
came to Richard by the Phoenix because I
didn't find this in any other language I
was using the channels about trivial
real-time messaging for connected
devices wesayso
web developer from angry web background
but we have a lot of different devices
now I think you know I'm kind of biased
i really like writing web browser
applications but we have this we have
iOS minds and require smart phones smart
devices we can't just say we're a for a
traditional web framework we have to be
able to connect to any client and then
we provide the services to them and some
messages then we connect them all
together things of you on my phone to
show up on the web browser and vice
versa so this is a common problem for
any iOS app you know they're going to
have here to release a nice herbs gonna
have I osf Peter it up browser app and
there's no reason why I can't write went
back in to push out updates tall I
shouldn't have to write multiple
applications so we also recently extract
the transport later so this is a big
addition we provide a like that you it
was just web sockets able to come for us
now it's looks like a long flowing but
it's also anything else you want to
bring these are over HTTP by cactus for
see if someone wanted to have a message
queue like Renesys a rabbit in queue
they could create a channel transport
that instead of going over websites it
could just push a message on to rise and
then you could in queue and eq messages
back and forth but the channel would you
write is attractive it's all the same
we're just dealing with a socket and so
I'm interested to see where this goes
and we also attracted the serialization
format so we provided extension points
it's jason by default but if you want
some more performance you can go with
message pack or some more advanced
serialization format for like gaming we
also did a big pub/sub rewrite
internally to kind of our messages
across her lips her nose and this was
for people running on roku or not
running a distributed elixir so it's a
big deal for us to have
two events go across nodes so we had
adapter assistant there and we added
even more two channels so now they're
isolated they run her own process we can
thank Eric because I was just a handle
info at first to make them isolated I
didn't think it was a good idea but I
can't imagine having not done that now
it is really powerful and it's we also
support seniors messaging so if you want
to do know a request-response style
messaging find out what happened on a
specific message that used to the server
as in place now we had an outgoing
message filtering so alistor conf us you
can just process messages coming in from
clients now when you broadcast over
puffs so each client connected you can
actually have a callback run for each
client to customize that message so I
want to append some client certificate
information or I want to drop messages
for clients different preferences maybe
they only want to receive certain past
investigators we cannot do that and in
more closely mirrors agency rapey I
which initially I didn't he was
important but it's it's been a big
learning process as I bookings to say
like earliest solve a lot of these
problems already all is like this client
server stuff I guess collagen server for
a reason and I didn't like get that at
first so I resisted a gym server API and
then I ran into like race conditions and
problems and discover that Oh a generic
shear-wave guy makes sense for this has
just been an interesting learning
experience and we have long one that I
mentioned so we have a channel routes
which you've probably seen but for those
of the poem or haven't seen games your
router routes things other than just
traditional
was so we always support HTTP I branch
and transports by default but if I had
that Redis message queue it was still be
processed through my router so you're
the idea had with Rogerson phoenix's
they route traffic and your application
regardless of where that's coming from
so it goes from this just HTTP path
quest pathname to I dis messages coming
in my app I want them to go to a
controller or to a channel and this
works and talk about channel transports
already so i'm going to skip this but
you can use some neat things like maybe
I'd webhook transport where someone can
subscribe to a channel I by pushing to
your API we could give them a token back
any message that comes out for them over
channels is going to be actually just a
look back to your third party
application I stole this slide from
Josie I gave the Phoenix talk but it's
really important so if we look out
animals work from the outside this is
kind of the broad view so if we have
getting power applications running those
are cluster together or talking to each
other over pub/sub and we have different
devices connected together over
different transports so why might have a
browser on one connecting the window
over a channel and it's going over lawn
mowing it can broadcast messages to
anyone else listening on other nodes and
they might those are they receive them
on your browser or web socket on your
iPhone over
socket or an embedded devices so we have
this Internet of Things movement there's
a protocol called couette which is nice
for embedded devices a lot of us smart
questions are using it so someone wanted
right the coop transport for Phoenix it
would just work in your channel code on
the back end remains the same you no
longer have to worry about houses client
connected you just worry about how do i
send messages back and forth but the
cool thing is like if we look at what
erling was designed for like they wrote
a whole language for a reason they
making this all specific problem let's
let's just rename these labels and I'm
like like mind blown like it's the same
problem great at the modern web the way
we're building these connected devices
like it's the exact same problem that
only had to solve you know decade couple
decades ago so heckle switches connected
distributive Lee a new clip Penny's
phones together right it's the exact
same problem in our devices and our
clients have gotten a little smarter and
that's all it's changed so it's really
cool to see that you know this problem
was solved and this is why I came to
elixir this is how channels work so well
because these systems are deploy out
there and they run but millions of
connections so I'm interested to see how
how many connections we can get on games
so I'd your national benchmarks
hopefully sometime soon but I think you
know many many thousands and connections
definitely should be possible because
he's probably been solved and install
the label and if you look inside on
channels yeah that works we can see how
they work so on a client i can say
socket connect to create this abstract
and socket connection i pick a long
pointy web socket and i get one
attention you deserve
we multiply sec so you have multiple
channels running on your back end and
those each of those each act like i have
their own connection to the client but
it's multiplexer for a single one and
the nice thing is be dispatched to the
transport level through those channels
we then broadcast over buck's up back to
weather channels and then back into that
single connection is headed back to a
client and then our pub sub layer can
puffs up over just PG 2 which is early
standard library so ID follow if you use
clustering did you just don't you're not
that any dependencies but if you're on
roku you can add Redis and then we use
register pub sub but you want to worry
about it like it's a one line can take
change and it just works so we added
some nice things for people not running
distribute elixir we definitely promote
that as a default but a lot of farms
right there was a lot of people go ahead
set up these clusters yet so I think you
know registers a huge my future edition
someone implemented this over postgres
already so there's a postgres utzon
adapter third party that usually listen
to notify you no wonder my address but
you're already using puss risk you can
pops up over postgres RabbitMQ I've seen
as well and then we're talking with the
manga same folks about how can we add
smtp to do a lot of this there's a lot
of a solid problems over XMPP already in
mongoose i am is known to source all
these things really well so gotta help
people was sunny stronger than the
team's 14 and a person on the bondage I
team are experimenting on you ha
communities and how could you maybe ask
my veins features i cud sublevel 2 to
connect these things so it really is
just interested to see kind of where
that goes and we talked about Michigan
is so we have this idea of clients push
mrs.
server so roll servers have a call back
to handle incoming events and the
negative push events back to decline so
we can see that the server or the clinic
client push king server process had to
call back push all back from the client
and they receive it and then I call back
and then we had this other idea of
broadcasting events and this is where
client wishes ping we handle it in their
channel handling Paul Gavin and they
want to broadcast who everyone else
subscribe what happens in this case is
we cannot process outgoing events so I'm
a connected client bases all of them
receive this handle out pong by default
we just push it on the beach client or
you can you can implement your own
handle out pattern match on that and say
ok the first client we can just push it
back to them they want to receive pong
same for the second client they receive
palm and this third client is like new
it hi one isn't being so many times I'm
just going to filter I'm gonna drop this
message so it's a really nice way to
push these pups of events out and then
filter or drop them so you can imagine
if I had some alerting system I had a
bunch of sysadmin connected maybe some
only care about kind of critical alerts
you could add a preference to the
database so they don't on broadcast in
the system this is a cpu spike that's a
sad man would receive that maybe there's
some lower-level error some of us have
been I have a preference to say no if I
don't want receive that but you handle
that on my client by
basis so it's really nice way to kind of
talk these things on the channel side we
have sickness twins now which kind of
resolve lots of race conditions that we
had and we have this really nice way to
do almost pattern matching in JavaScript
it's not really pattern matching but you
write it in a very similar way it's it's
been a big pleasure so I'm going to go
to another example very similar to this
but the secret is messaging has allowed
some sometimes you're seeing these cases
that I hadn't even thought of and uh we
had hindle info now as well like i
mentioned rockin just just like agent
server i can say okay after i've started
up my process I don't want to do
anything before i initialize like i'm
not sure if his guitar successfully and
had race conditions before so now if you
want to do anything after the clients
connected you just send yourself a
message just a good answer and then I
handle it handle info and push a feed of
messages down from decline so it solved
a lot of issues things I didn't even
think of by kind of taking the speed bag
acting on and realizing like oh my gosh
this was totally the right way to go and
here's the kind of a pig pattern
matching so like I received a lot of you
bet honest and spent a lot of time
thinking about this API ax from alyssa
conf us there's no way to send a message
to the server and then actually respond
that hit a response about specific event
so now we can like we can get paid
pattern matching but like writing this
writing on JavaScript and next to my
buzzer code is like actually a pleasure
now for normally it has been so this is
what channels for me are all about in
pushing message to the server and if I
receive okay just like I'm running
elixir code I run a call back I get the
message i canna pinned it to my pad
application piracy air I think the
structure the error messages and ensure
there's the user and then I can even say
hey you know what just like processes
after certain amount of seconds I assume
all of us lost show a loiterer the
client because we have known you a hat
so it's like we brought a little bit of
glitter to
conscript and its really nice right kind
of back and forth so be sure they
client-server together I cannot reply
directly I handle one message I want to
persist it into echo I can say okay
reply okay here's your message and on
the client receive okay message like
this is almost like a lizard same thing
okay we could persist the message member
validation errors I can reply hey error
and then I could have imagined my client
okay we got an error to stretch the
errors show there's a user so this is
just a super nice ways you can I state
the I bridge or happy note to your
client code talked about pumps up so I'm
gonna skip this I just works regardless
of if you're using sugar to literature
performance has been super fast so my
pinch marks a notoriously tricky but it
is someone put a bunch of niche march
together a lot of these applications are
doing different things like a Jane
application was like one file as someone
submitted we're looking up page because
about being said but you can see it
plugs to wins so what's your fast week
but no I think if we check out the cool
thing about this chart is if you took
out this plan example in teaneck example
Phoenix is doing more work but these
features that were adding on top of plug
are not posting like massive over a so
if you take anything away from these
benchmarks other than beating you know
node and Ruby it's that Phoenix is
adding a lot of these nice features but
not at the cost of life you know killing
your throughput for these nice rugged
features we are really focusing
performance not at the cost of a
limiting your productivity so we can
talk about Phoenix 1.1 we've punted on
some features for 10 because i think
it's the smart thing to do just like
what a lizard is we've said we know
these features are almost baked we want
to say the lesser at the eyes get a 10 L
and then we can focus on what's next so
Phoenix 10 isn't good to be in we're
kind of just getting started but we have
eight guys in place like I said it
because wanna make sure the state will
release the window and we can enhance
that so we used to have
internationalisation but we pull that
out because jess i started at you get
text project skid text has been around a
long time and we can use some really
neat things that compile time at elixir
i compiled into i can test it text
format so it's gonna be way better than
what we had before another good feature
is channel replay the only new last
message I game this is a totally
difficult problem and I'll have to see
interesting ways that we can solve it
but the idea is if I'm on my phone and I
attempted a routine channelside drive
underneath the bridge I wanted to see
those messages when I kept back when I
get outside of the tunnel so today you
have to roll out yourself either you
miss those messages or on reconnect you
have to add your own Les message at the
implementation so I think this is going
to come up often enough that is a
problem that we can solve and hopefully
solve for a ride these kids and the same
with camel presents talk with the
Mongoose IM folks XMPP solves a lot of
these issues so we're trying to see
what's the best way to say you know
who's on this channel because right now
you can just put it in an agent but you
have to go to run code to say
spin up an Asian elixir and say okay
this person is showing this channel when
they leave you have to remove them from
the agent it'd be nice to have that game
before you automatically and Josie's
could work on on nested associations so
being able to send up a giant list of
form attributes a giant embed a list of
Jason objects being able to have that
build out hierarchically it's right now
you have to do that yourself and poor
you the kV eating stuff looks is a
something i'm experimenting with i
really like the flux design pattern out
of facebook it's it like it took like
100 lines of JavaScript I have a little
prototype and it's just a really neat
way to do kind of like reactive data's
little based programming in JavaScript
so it's something that would just be an
option with tendency but I prototyped
out like a Ginsu rest api in javascript
but using the flux implementation so
it's a neat way that we can integrate
channels with that I kind of have this
same way to write JavaScript client and
grading finish channels but i'm not sure
we'll see how it goes and then in
generic a store was just often enough
people want to cache things so it'd be
nice to say okay if you're on
distributed elixir we can fit it in a
table if you're on Heroku who was in
Redis but it should be one line
configuration change so there's one foot
one so I think beyond that is just get
this out to this day will get people
building interesting things with it
especially around channels i think would
see some use cases that will then kind
of take away beyond that but for 10 11.1
if we will have any crazy big changes
it's just as good as stable let's get
people building cool things and kind of
grows in there so lessons learned I can
talk about a little bit of void
monolithic design
my last several months of work had been
they had a global pub sub server before
so very little of our high level API
change but design internally everything
zamana the first we had global mix
configuration so we said I Isaac Jo's
they said this is terrible oh yeah Hydra
that goes they see you guys soon as they
said hey this could be a little bit
better we can do the one guy we added
endpoints and the endpoints would hold
your configuration and run the web
servers now you can run multiple
endpoints in your themes application and
it just works but like nothing we'd have
to sacrifice anything to get an
extensible design I same with the pups
of API it was a global gent server you
don't we have one of them on your vm it
works for small cases within unreal
applications or anything you can only
have one of me so it was a learning
process for me but the cool thing is the
top-down design has worked well I was
like this is the biggest open source
effort I've been involved with and you
remember from elixir conf I like elixir
because I allows me to do what if I
could just driven development and I
wasn't sure what I was going to work out
but the cool thing is i wanted to do
channels i wanted to write router in a
certain way so i said here's the code of
honor right and i know it looks trip let
me write code like this I prototyping
internally I had this model design
global gent servers but then we iterated
we made things better be many things
extensible but the high-level buggy eyes
are made just as nice that's worked out
really well so i'm not sure if that work
out for everyone but you'll be added
transport adapter as puffs of adapters
all these internal things instead of
trying to start from the bottom sorry
from the top and to figure out that make
it work and make it work well so my
clothes with talking about a community
much time i have here okay well so this
product was important part of the talk
the other community is amazing
you tell you that uh but I think it's
super important to talk about you know
where the community goes from here and
how to growth me not successfully which
we've done a great job out so far so
I've known that I was going to give this
talk for about a week and a half so I
gave a workshop i didn't know i was
giving ATM so surprised thanks Jim but
now so I've only collected I've
collected a few quotes that I found
online but it's only been for like less
than two weeks so I haven't been saving
these for the last several months it's
just when I found I was giving this talk
i was like I one really thought about
the community and I should start trying
to find people talking about the
community so just keep this in mind this
is just over the last couple weeks that
I found these things and it does let's
see public so looks here's the first
language where I managed to get the
instron chat before I figured it out
myself like this is super important like
if I would you know Toby in this case if
you had an hour close look at that
evening you just put his kids to bed I'm
not sure if that's the case but it could
be it's definitely case for a lot of
people if they perceive some weird error
they weren't sure what was going on did
you know how to solve it they could just
wasted that our and their first
experience with elixir saying like wow I
got nothing done what does this language
doing for me but instead they hop on IRC
gotta use the right away and then that
our turned into oh wow I got help right
away that was fun community is nice and
oh I did pattern matching I spawn these
processes of like looks really cool so
like we took but took some 12 seconds
the answer on IRC could make all the
difference for someone staying and it
was taken with the language tell them to
co-workers I'll calculate with this last
night like there's this crazy revelation
that I had with you know what book was
possible so this stuff is
super important and we ski it over and
over again so someone else experiment
with elixir and Phoenix the community is
very welcoming to those testing the
waters and like this is super important
especially with newcomers like you feel
like it's going to take you years to
become an expert so you're less likely
to seek help because you don't want to
say you want to feel dumb I want to say
this goes not working and you know usual
ask people and IRC like you just did
just show me a gist of your favorite
like I think for a lot of people
initially they're like they want to
share that because they're like all my
goods crap I want people to see this
goat so I think it's a big push and it's
going to kind of help adoption for us
anyway we're welcoming we're going to
help people out share your code I'm a
stupid mistakes all the time and I've
been doing it for a while now so I think
continuing to push these ideas it's
going to really help grow the community
and have a couple more posts because
they're really great so I have to save
my first day of issue the community is
amazing I agree that's awesome but this
stuff is important another quote as I
said someone yesterday I'll say it again
by far the most helpful community around
programming language I've experienced in
a long time like this stuff matters and
I think Josiah has done really a
fantastic job about kind of establishing
these memes in the community so I think
if we continue to be helpful on
collaborating shut down and tolerance if
we have a really bright future this is
one of my favorite aspects about kind of
this whole the lizard a journey and
billing Phoenix it's all about working
with other people building cool things
sharing knowledge so i'll leave you with
one more vote this community is full of
love all i see is hearts these days so
if you ever see employ request accepted
from jersey or anything anytime there's
a ver makes online auto parts um that's
how it should be in I agree so check
Phoenix out external network until I
have
make all questions other buddy wants the
question of the ODF dr. Kevin unattached
works on multicore n termini applying it
with two cores 4 floors eight cores and
so on so not yet so I think you talked
about this at mr. conf what I found to
my surprise it's very hard to benchmark
easily like a benchmarking my approval
application has been like just run it
run one laptop pushing traffic to it and
it's easy but time to benchmark teens
have patients have actually been are
like I mean a multiple hardware to
actually max CPUs that oh I have I
haven't been able to max my horse yes so
it's magic so no answer is you know I
have it but only because um I have to go
like by hardware to try to test these
things like via benchmark delivered I
know and I ran it from a another
instance so I always running it like
locally over my home and I was running
from a data center to benchmark the road
i own and be like the pro who died no
cpu usage wasn't mad it was like eighty
percent so we ran out of network network
links on the instant side trying to push
traffic just to a burro food item which
are tiny so it's like that i don't know
how to pinch mark these days
if you have very smart experience i'd
love to see something there oh but it's
it's been impressive so are you pushing
his robust community season is this
letter but you're kind of we're kind of
ruining their business model of spinning
up lots of dangerous because like hex
runs on wind i know i think hex will
always run on 19 I don't know that we
could not probably not finding multiple
but yeah the produce business model is
like dinosaur relatively expensive and
usually you need a lot but not with
house lizards one of the questions often
issues before but I know it's a hard one
but the hot code or live updates but
beers did he plans on that or he hasn't
started looking at that yes sir well
obviously we trumpet that you gave it we
have a talk today that's going to go
over that so it's like beyond my level
of knowledge right now but it's
definitely something that we always go
sailing we have caught hot-glued
uploading like you come to elixir and
people ask me how do you do hot goat
uploading I say I don't know um you know
it's just there's only so much time I
have focus on learning different things
so it's definitely something that we
should we should be hot upload
compatible today just hard as deploying
that
not enough experience with yet but
definitely that's something that we want
to focus on I think we'll see better
than when we will talk today really talk
about things that they built problems if
solve and hopefully we can you know
share a lot of that have established
ways to do this or much easier any other
questions all right they thought we got
a 10
I am we already talked about this is our
company we try to your arm implement
kind of the client oil web messaging
what's a good time so this is when
there's kind of web application
messaging protocol it's a sub protocol
of web sockets and the nice part is you
know you can implement the simplified
standard and you can implemented with
different technologies so for instance
right now the main motor implementation
is in Python and we think it's maybe not
for the solution and will be awesome
will it will equate a la fenix because
it all already provides like channels
but I can provide in a very extended
learning something like session handling
authentication you up or where they
mentioned that can you see something
like this on the Walkman unbelievable
yes so it says me like I said with
top-down design I think protocols or a
good thing but I didn't i was looking at
different ways these real-time
communication systems were working so i
actually started with how can I do
implementation of the paper gold someone
has experienced fake that was gonna be
my starting over with camels is they're
not gonna have to write a campfire and
it would be much easier but that
actually like stop me from being able to
make forward progress is a lot of these
problems I wasn't sure that I had the
time but now actually having gathered
the point that we're at Titan with my
mom is I'm folks talking with a wham
protocol that they're xmpp solves these
problems way of solving problems so for
us it's going to be how do we have you
bridge that gap and for the lamp example
or smtp face channels I've strap a
transport layer so my current thought is
I think the transport level is how we
converge these things but still we have
to make the message protocol that we're
sending back and forth extensible enough
but I think he'll be it's going to be
difficult to try said okay let's do mess
and GPRS you lamp and then still say
okay you can add a transport adapter to
connect over on going over over xml /
reddest so that's my heart thoughts are
I love to figure that out because I
think all these problems have been
solved well already but how can we do
that in a way that still gets all being
nice stuff via plan so far so let me
know how that goes but yeah it's
definitely exactly my minor now for sure
can you elaborate something about tested
helpers because last time I checked I
wanted to create some tests there was a
big pipeline I wanted to mock for
example the authentication fetching
session and something like that is it
sold by the first book they do yes so
depending on when you checked himself so
we actually should have had a 0 12
release I just in that time I also
playing with 98 jouet added the most
recent test up on stuff so yes that's a
test offers are finished but they're
actually really nice and pretty even if
you check a couple weeks ago we had a
way to easily test something through
your endpoint which can go through butch
will go to your router pipelines so you
just give it a route and will process
through those plugs and you the
connection back you can make assertions
on so that's in place and what does your
book release probably next week and okay
add a go-to example that yup so don't do
that don't happen I'm an inbox 380 right
now so a lot of these are from Judaism a
be good
don't don't go from ops or trying to
avoid the pipeline just have your
requests doing the whole cycle it's fast
right it's not you can do literally ten
thousand pills per second that's not a
way to make her do so just go for the
whole thing because that's really what
about to test to be sure that you're
going for the power plug or everything
in there two things myself your eyes are
going to be the world of pain and at the
end which will be testing you on every
suppose to be tested yes like I'll pull
up a just one example of you can now
just say I can use my connection case of
mine too now you just make it get two
messages and that's actually going to go
through my endpoint go through the
pipeline that throughout the route match
and give you my pension back so let's go
take that water here in your entire
pipeline walk and controller render a
response and then you can assert this it
was an HTML like you like three
assertions in one was what I chose aight
i came up with which is really nice so
instead of having like to pull through
response headers i'm going to say was
this an HTML request was it returned
response if it was men were from the
body so i can serve on the content type
of the response the status and the eye
and one
that's what we have right now and we'll
add some other tools pretty soon anyone
else
I saw the leanest that someone was such
playing with the transpiring it is here
too in JavaScript this is something you
excited about to be able to goods at the
front end and look it okay um if someone
wants to solve that and tall it well and
stable it would be really cool to see
what we can do but right now if we not
in my focuses inc it sounds easy I'm
like a lot like it exists as I closer
shrift closure community has like Close
Grip is like an officially supported
thing it's a lie it's a stable release
so I think that would be amazing it's
definitely not something I have time to
pursue so someone wants to solve that
and then it would be crazy to be dad
like I yeah channel client and elixir on
the job search side and see how that
would work so we'll find out maybe maybe
a couple years we'll have something
we'll have isomorphic apps but we would
not fall out that so so I would never
call Phoenix an isomorphic my framework
so welcome him up with a better name but
we'll see all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
