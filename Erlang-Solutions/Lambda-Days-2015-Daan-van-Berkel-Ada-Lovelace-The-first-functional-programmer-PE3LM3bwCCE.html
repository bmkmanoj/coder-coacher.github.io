and I'm up to if you don't know her I
get to juicer to you and if you do know
it to tell a story about rich maybe you
don't know ready that she's the first
functional program so first of all thank
you for coming here and thank you
organizers for organizing this event and
inviting me and also thank you sponsors
because without sponsors this
acquaintance wouldn't be and so if you
have at all time go to their booths or
websites and check them out because
they're also because they make this
conference possible I'm not that famous
although the person who headed out my
lanyard recognized me some my name is
down from vehicle i work from company
info support in the netherlands which
i'm working from i also would like to
thank them because they paid for my trip
and stay here and so thank you in push
board and if you want to follow me on
twitter that come with if handle and if
you want to see the work i do when i'm
having fun you can go to get up as well
so the Tartan when before me at least
rang true to me because they spoke joy
and i experienced yorokobi and because
of that i would like to share that with
everybody so i'm also organizing a
conference of our co organizing a
conference in the netherlands which you
may be interested in this joey of coding
it's it's will will well some of you
will be there as well i know for effect
but if you want to enjoy sharing your
love of coding of other developers check
out your coding is the 29th may for this
year so i will end the shameless blood
with myself and the conference i'm
organizing and we'll start with the talk
with a question why why do i want to
give this talk
and one of the reasons is actually an
emotional I get talked about these are
good morning I think there's a great
injustice done to our servers are our
work because if you look around you in
this large room there are very few with
and that's a shame because who who loves
coding everybody and do you think that
everybody could appreciate coding if
they in turn yes i think so and I don't
see any reason why women couldn't enjoy
coding as well and for the fact well
fifty percent of the children born on
this earth are our women so where are
they so this this question why would I
give this talk is actually right I want
you talk about emancipation I want to
talk about setting things right there's
a thing they're wrong and I don't have
the key to keeping women in tech and
getting there gag him there right i
think that one particular point is
perception i will receive women and
again this is an emotional time for me
as a little daughter actually have to
the oldest she loves cars like the
animation movie and she she really wants
to have a backpack with a car loan so
obviously i gave it to her and she went
to the playground or one of the
neighborhood kids a girl a little bit
older than she is came up to me and
asked me is she a boy or a girl I so
good why do you ask me this well she
wears a car bag and that's for boys and
that's really sad isn't it like this
little girl I can blame her for having
this stereotypical view of what boys and
girls shooter should not be doing I
can't even blame her parents but again
blame the society I think our society we
were living nowadays has a twisted view
of what women can
cannot do and what man should or
shouldn't do and one one thing that I
think will change that perception I
would perceive each other so let's start
with the beginning of our over my work
of our communities like the first
computer and a lot of you might think
that the first computer was built during
the Second World War to Craig the Enigma
but it's not as if she sent you earlier
someone thought up a computer of source
and add a loveless played a role so with
this stock would like to convey my
unsung heroes of computer science and
they need for starters idol of this
because I think and I hope after this
talk you will agree with me that not
only is she the first program not only
issue first functional program the soul
shoot the first computer scientist and
visionary so let's see how that pans out
if at all during his talk if questions I
tried to raise my attention hope to
incorporate in this session because I
can I can fill the entire length but
will be interesting to hear your
thoughts subjects well who knows God
loves father was lord baron yes so this
man was obviously a great writer and
great power also experienced wild bouts
of emotional depression and his wife the
mother of a de la vez of the many wives
he had thought that the experience of
the Lord in our as loveless lives would
be detrimental so she fought like what
would be the most emotional was studying
to send out of love us off let me be
mathematics so the Garrick start thought
talked about emotions as well and he
said it apart from mathematics I'm a
student
mathematics myself and it heard of it
it's like mathematics can be emotional
as well for me and again thinking that
studying mathematics doesn't make you a
treasure this will prevent you from
while moose reigns doesn't allow you for
the fact that a lot of mathematicians
went crazy and we had a severe
depression so that move wouldn't be very
wise but nonetheless it made other
lovelace a mathematician that's one of
the most important parts that she played
while meaning this man so you probably
can all guess who this is you know this
is it's charles babbage need so Charles
Babbage plays a formative role in adil
office work because he invented several
machines among one the analytic engine
which will be the precursor of the
computer and you can call it a computer
at last it was never built and this man
it's worth you look into him a little
bit more so Charles Babbage was a
wealthy man because it was wealthy he
had the opportunity to will do the
things he likes so he studied
mathematics he hung out with great minds
like a de Lovelace but also Herschel and
some contemporaries he traveled a lot
you went to de France he's already from
at UK and when to actually to just
discuss things he was interested in and
one things he was interested in that was
this do you know what this is a picture
of it's a picture of the world yes but
why are there different colors in this
picture it's absolutely correct so the
correct answer is the white country is
on this map other countries that Greg
Griffin did invade or
colonize so if you see this picture you
can really feel literary where the
expression the Sun will never set in the
British Empire come from does cry
frankly the British Empire of the entire
rule and so if you want to rule this
world you have to travel around a lot to
take the boat if to seal to foreign
countries are actually the same country
and only in different continent and
because of that you need to have great
skills you need to have accurate clocks
to keep track or where there are and you
need to have accurate maps of the world
so you can pull out your trajectory but
he also have need math skills and this
is where Charles Babbage ha became he
knew that for navigational skills to
travel the world you need mathematics so
how does a pan out so you need
loggerheads to do navigation does
everybody know why great it's something
I can tell you that so first of all what
is the logarithm well the logarithm of I
power is just the exponent which you
raise the power to so that's a function
it's a bit of a flaky definition not
bear with me but you can glean some
information from this looking at what
exponentiation does so let's look at a
number 80 that's fixed and we raised it
to insertion honors mmm and if you
multiply these numbers you get the form
a result which is interesting because it
relates to concept not naming
multiplication and addition and for one
I think multiplication is hard I can do
it very well if you give me time you can
do it with pen and paper but addition is
easier and the mathematics is on my side
if you look at the algorithm that in the
complexity of the different algorithms
to execute addition and multiplication
addition is it runs in linear time
to the number of digits and
multiplication the NIMH ways runs in N
squared you can do a little bit better
you have to do work really hard so if
you cost this expressions these
mathematical formulas if you like in the
terms of logarithms you see that if you
take the logarithm of the products you
end up taking the logarithms of its Sun
and this is great because now we can do
this the complicate complicated
multiplications and transform them in
the easy additions but there's one catch
you need a logarithmic table for that
does everybody know what I won't
recognize really does everybody know
what a logarithmic tail is you don't
guess that's exactly right point so for
those are the love I unfortunately
wasn't old enough to experience in me
this is a logarithmic table so it's a
table source on the on the left side
there are your entry numbers and the
increment and on the right side there's
the evaluation of the function the log
of that number so how this work if you
want to find out whether a lot for
example 23 days you go down the list
until you find your input and you go to
write and find the answer and this works
with different numbers if you know the
competition rules you can take two
different numbers a bit of interesting
yes you can take a different number for
example 51 you go down the different
lists the weight entry is and you look
up the logarithm and if you've done that
you can do the universe so you add up
the logarithms and because you know the
multiplication rules change into
addition rules for logarithms it can
take the difference of the sum of those
two and find out a worker in the reverse
way so if again you want to look at this
number like a number of this you find it
inside of table on the right side you
know what the exponent should be over
the power
is this clear yes right so this is the
basis of a lot of calculations if you
don't know about rigging the tables you
probably even don't know the slide rule
and slide rule is a calculator before
the electronic calculator was invented
it was the workhorse of every engineer
everyone had one or even multiple and it
worked alongside the similar ways just a
logarithmic scale along the axis and you
shift and that's the process of addition
to figure out multiplication so low grab
new tables were essential it easy that
eased up a lot of work for an engineer
just multiplication became additions so
look at it written below its hardware
these tables were very important sir
charles babbage at as a pastime set out
to ask calculators which were human at
the day where human asked them could you
give me the log right on the table if
he's give me such a table and the
calculor didn't she went to work that
provided use tables but again it's human
work and what humans can do properly is
work out a repetitive task without false
so these tables at mistakes obviously so
Charles Babbage it was a bright man so
he asked two different around multiple
different persons calculators give me
such a table he handed that he when he
got the results back he would
cross-checked them with his friends so I
can't imagine how great these evenings
would be sitting with Josh bearish and
just going down this table calling out
numbers and checking them but this is
what he did and he always found mistakes
and that's that's very bad if you can
imagine that you set out to seal to a
different country and you miss with your
calculations because the table is wrong
buy it with one degree at the end of
your trip you were going to end up at a
different place altogether so this
that's very bad so this man had an idea
so let's make a machine to calculate the
logarithm for me CC so then he sums on a
problem from how do you calculate the
logarithm does anybody know
sorry yes it's a good answer but if you
don't know what it's a mysterious it
doesn't help you very much so one of the
techniques is built on finite
differences so if you look at these
numbers what do you see what do you feel
about these numbers they're square so
this is a serious square and this
anything is remarkable about the squares
the difference yes if you look at the
differences they form the different
sequence and these differences are
regular than themselves so I could ask
the same question was what is
interesting about this sequence of
differences it's linear yes there are
differences itself are just constants
and this is an interest in fact and this
is not a curiosity if you need take any
polynomial of whatever degree and take
the series just increment the water the
value and look at the results and take
difference of that you eventually will
end up with a the constant stream not
much so this is interesting if we have a
polynomial that could represent a
logarithm then we could take differences
of this values and end up with a with a
stream of constant numbers and this far
occurred to chels beverage well what if
we could reverse this process if he
could start with all these simple
numbers these twos and Adam took three
years iteratively work that out we could
eventually calculate a certain
polynomial automatically and that's the
great idea of Charles Babbage so not
alone was chels Babbage a wealthy man it
was also influential he rubbed shoulders
with the best of his time so he went to
his government said look we have this
great Empire it's very fast you have to
travel it so we have to do
new navigations after that means to
logarithm tables I can make these tables
for a fraction of the time but I need
some money so the government with some
help of his friends procured him a large
sum of money so he could build a machine
and that machine which he envisioned was
the difference engine and that the
difference engine was actually based on
a contemporary of of him it took the
idea that was already present doesn't
really know this is it salut yes so it's
actually as your car bloom jacquard loom
is a loom which is operated by cringe
charge also a relic of a different
computer age but if you know how to to
make tapestries it's very hard process
there is running threads through this
machine and by putting on levers you
change the configuration which leads on
you shuttle a schakal between the
threads and that makes data stream and
your car thought about this this process
is very repetitive it's very easy to
make a mistake because the entire weave
of the tapestry is Bill of running a
show of threw back and forth which is
very our prom so Jack our thought well
maybe if you could automate this task it
will be better faster so this is the
industrial age so he built this and
controls babish knew of this machine it
felt well if I can weave stuff I
conservatively calculations so this is
this ID and he set out to build the
difference engine this is an image of
the difference engine and what this
difference engine could do was this as
was his vision is to do the difference
method we saw earlier so start with a
certain number added to another number
to get the next number and use that in a
stepwise fashion to calculate tables so
this machine I haven't seen it in real
life but it's you can you can go to Jean
long and you can find there this machine
was never built in the time that Charles
Babbage lived he tried to build it but
he got sidetracked because while you had
this enormous amount of money you got
around a lot of expert engineers and
those engine he said those engineers to
work to create this machine and and this
injured machine is really intricate so
this is a detail of of different engines
you see a column of numbers it's not
very hard to read but every cylinder
every horizontal section represents the
number 0 to 9 and those numbers was
actually read off of the calculations
the different engine makes so so chose
never set out to create this machine but
he had a different idea here so he could
you took a side project of him they
found well it's great we can build the
difference engine now let's build a
better machine it could do more than or
any differences and he thought of the
analytic engine and this is the the
analytic engine so I mentioned before
that childbirth which was a wealthy man
he seemed to throw a feminist party
parties if you didn't have to read the
logarithm tables and he showed different
persons prototypes of this machine the
analytic engine and one of this person
was out of Lovelace so she's the heroine
of the story she was a mathematician at
a time she came from from a wealthy
family she was invited to part like this
and she said well this is awesome I want
to work this man I want to take this
idea ism and figure out how this work so
I think that if you can reflect on why
she was motivated doing that just likes
emotions was really the visceral
reaction three IDs a chapter which
presented so how would that work out is
the question we are going to answer now
so before I we have to look at numbers
so here's the number again we typed in
you can choose a different number if you
like does anybody have a favorite number
42 so yeah I should change it then 242
what I can do it in this position here
so what will take 42 in later moment so
mathematicians are strange lot they they
think about things that aren't real
actually so they think about the numbers
a lot but while our number is actually
and is this a number on the screen
that's a good question i think it's not
it's actually a representation of a
number but it took me a while to get the
relation so because i'm slow you
probably not i'm going to walk you by
the actual representation that is made
and the reputation of this number is
actually if I ever might put this bang
yes it's actually it's a number well how
we read that was like the five in that
position means five times ten and the
one thing that position means 1 x 1 and
y are these numbers 10 and wrong
important well directly the powers of 10
to the power index 1 so this is doll I'm
probably boring you but you could use
another edition different representation
like this so again it's the same number
only it's represented differently and
now you can see a different favorite
number of yours I mean 42 and how this
changes and it doesn't really surprise
you so this is also one of the ideas of
shikahr to use pinch punch cards this
carp cartoon carbs appreciated holes in
them to represent numbers or in jacquard
case represent a weave patterns so if
you look at this how can you improve on
that
you can't improve this so this is the
ultimate step and computation or binary
yes we take a particular representation
take a base-10 representation of these
numbers and that means that we can use
up to we need to use ten rows to
represent different numbers but are
different bases bit binary is two
different base which only needs two
digits so we will need two rows
represent one number sorry the
suggestion here is your e 1 row what why
is that yes a suggestion is if you punch
a hole or not that's already giving you
information if there should be a one or
a zero so yes if you want to go to
imbibe arree then this will be even
better to convey information so I'm not
going to tell you that Charles Babbage
did this was he did it when he set out
to create the analytic engine he set out
to create number cards of the former
kind with more digits but the sort of
ten digits a little more indicate so he
could represent 15 decimal places it was
a de Lovelace who suggested in inner
notes that you can improve on this by
using Bible so I want to take some time
to look up this picture with you does
anybody recognize this it's a freckle
that's an interesting question I don't
think it is well it's kind of correct
like I can read that so this is the
analytic engine that Charles Babbage at
follow-up and this machine will detail
some of the important parts
and easily resembles a modern-day
architecture so this is the central
place here let's call the mill and all
these fractal parts around me our
machinery to do different kinds of
calculations so men there's these these
variables here they're actually
variables these are the cylinders you
saw earlier and taken from the
difference engines and represent numbers
that are service inputs to various
operations and this rack which is
mentioned here is a means to transform
transfer information from these numbers
into the mill to do different
calculations so this was the design the
chels Babbage came up with make a
machine to represent numbers make a
machine that can do basic operations you
have to think about addition and
multiplication division subtraction a
certain color combination of operation
of a sophomore in a little while as a
means of transferring these kinds of
numbers stored in those cylinders and
place them into the mill and operate on
that this was just 19 who knows how a
modern computer works sorry at the level
of chips and if you want to go for it at
the level of the not you know yes so
virtually there's a great book we call a
crab at school that just does this thing
it takes an and which is a logic gate
and it's immolates it but you can build
up an actual computer but she a virtual
computer about a computer that actually
computes things by building up logic
eight with mass but that's that's a too
low level for it so at a
hi lover our chips and these chips of
functions and our computers have cpu
central processing unit which is like
something like the moon and computers of
memory which is something like these
variables and there's a bus in the
computer which oh well change
information in the system so basically
Charles Babbage dreamt up a modern
computer essentially before its time
which is awesome I think he did do
something strange though so there are
various numbers of cards you can see
them in this picture here if there's a
reputation of the number cards this is a
control cars and operation cars are a
bit chopped off and these are he
envisioned these were the punish cards
needed to operate this machine you
needed three different types of pics
cards one more sort of numbers can
stories punch cards in the reader and
that will transfer the numbers into
these columns of representations that's
fairly easy to comprehend then there
were the variable cards so these
variable cards or this cars would be
call them now tell you that okay I want
to transform since for transfer this
number on this register on this variable
to one of the columns in the middle and
there you could set an option to either
erase that number of all you're copying
it or keep it like there and that was
wrong and and the last car to use or the
operation card so I already mentioned
the currency used to operate on that
will be for starters the basic
arithmetic functions cell multiplication
addition subtraction division but there
also some other cards and these cards
are actually the most interesting there
was one car to shift the numbers in
column so you could solve it it's like a
bit of like hit shipping so why would
you need that when we talked about the
logarithmic table I actually
looked up the number i'll enter but the
number shifted at the few decimal places
places but also you already knew that
you can use that to multiply by 10 and
that's how it's used so if you do for
example multiplication the difference
difference engine and also the analytic
engine would take a number multiplied by
10 by shifting it up and then adding it
to the next result she envisioned it but
these three different kinds of cards
made it very hard to operate there were
three different reading mechanisms that
fed at these cards into a machine and
other Lovelace wasn't very fond of that
way she actually envisioned a different
way and this is how she envisioned the
district computation she made it a table
actually some source let me describe
which cards you should have to enter so
if you take a look at the left hand
column just these are just the indices
of the operations the machine will do in
the next column there are the elementary
operations that are used in the mill and
the next column so that these are going
to be the program cards and the next
column are the variables cars those
transfer the information to and from the
mill and variables and the next actually
is a short and for the operation she
does so other Lovelace improved upon the
IDS chels better Chad and I think that
if you ask me it's out of Lovelace the
first functional programmer I would say
yes and the reason for that is well
first of all what functional programming
is it'll be fine so you can give it any
definition you like normal any but
should that new functional programming
the sense that she work with functions
the program you just saw and calculate
the book Bernoulli numbers does anybody
know what the ruling numbers are
well but almost so decision was that
seriously from tarick's it's almost
right there there if you the moon family
was large like there are seven
ballooning mathematicians so yes mom and
then the community origins this brittany
was actually more on the needed to
produce a lot written table so already
told me it's a lot actually that how do
you calculate the logarithmic function
well you can use a Taylor expansion and
the data expansion is mumble jumble but
it's a means to create a polynomial that
will match a given function on a given
the name and these premiering numbers
crop up in the expansion of the Taylor
function of third degree so this is a
program which tells you how to create
the coefficients of the polynomial to
calculate the logarithm so this is a
step an exposition of how to use the
analytic engine and all of us did that
so she from snowboarding or yes she's a
function programmers and girls cheap
program with functions but along with
that she is actually she took the idea
of Charles Babbage on the student which
is primed for Marvel in the age she
lived she if you want to feel how it is
to live as a Victorian aged a woman or
person for that matter and you should
read Pride and Prejudice which is a
great book i think if you if you don't
really like classical literature you can
also read Pride and Prejudice and
Zombies which is a an adaption of this
story but it introduces zombies into it
so the story is quite the same only the
characters behave differently if I
having any different than 10 because
they're zombies sometimes but it does
the same story but you know that being a
Victorian aged women woman it's very
hard there are all sorts of
confines you have to find ya fit in to
to be proper Victorian woman and she she
punched through the glass ceiling by
talking with jaws baggage but taking his
ideas and take him in the Stepford
Charles Babbage was very down-to-earth
man he took ideas that were apparent in
his age it took the loom which he then
follow it took the punch card which
overlie us was there really only what he
did was well I can think of a way to use
that to make a tape for navigation let's
a robot will feel no don't get me wrong
but though it's something that was in
the air at the moment everybody at the
age could see that something was going
to happen with it inra stories at
revolution going so we only capitalized
them but what adil of is too and i would
recommend everybody to look look into
her story and her work her work actually
was translating a letter of an Italian
engineer and she translated that into
English and watching make notes and you
can actually read the transcript of her
work online nowadays and if you read
through the letter it's like a very
verbose description of this machine you
can understand what's happening but it's
not a very good job and then Anna
lobsters steps in with her nose and it
becomes crystal clear at least for me
she was a mathematician she uses a bit
of math but let's basic mathematics is
not applied computer science so it's a
love as a function programmer yes but in
my opinion she's more she wrote to
Charles Babbage that this machine that
he envisions could do a lot more than
just making tape she envisions that this
machine could play music even compose
music if we're there was a means of
expressing just like an ensuring before
after
her cell and asked questions about what
could a machine do machines think other
levels centering for and ensuring ask
the same questions so yes in my opinion
Allah Lovelace is a functional
programmer but even more is the first
computer scientist with that I would
