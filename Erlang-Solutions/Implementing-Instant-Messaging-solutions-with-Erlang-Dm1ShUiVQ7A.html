solutions webinar my name is Martin
Miletich and I am the solutions director
here at erlang solutions today's webinar
represents continuation of a series of
webinars we are looking to organize
across topics of interest in the world
of Erlang and dealing with solutions
based on the Erlang programming language
our topic today will be dealing with one
of the most successful airline based
solutions we have created to date a
powerful affordably scalable and
massively concurrent messaging platform
called Mongoose I am the story of
Mongoose I am will be told with the
backdrop of a very successful
implementation of the solution that we
have performed but of our long-standing
esteemed customers I'm of course talking
about the implementation of Mongoose I
am with Google Communications a company
blazing the trail in video chat
solutions with this being the second in
the series of webinars we are running
please excuse any technical issues we
may encounter today to start by telling
you a bit about erlang solutions we are
a products and services orientated
company completely devoted to the
airline programming language since our
founding in 1998 we have worked with
organizations and individuals using
their line helping people the language
and supporting people and businesses
using it today we have 70 people across
our offices in London Stockholm Krakow
and Budapest and working on projects
across the globe we fly the airline flag
and are keen on creating value and
competitive advantage for our customers
across industries and through the unique
features and characteristics of our land
as a language we are quite ambitious in
development of our line based products
and we work to create lasting
partnerships with our customers I am
really pleased to say we have two
speakers joining us today and whom we
have carefully selected as best invited
to tell you about lung goose I am my
colleague and the airline solutions
cracklè office lead me Kozlowski
we all start us off with a technical
overview of on goose I am Miguel has
spent years working on and with the
Mongoose iron platform and he's also a
member of the XMP
the committee helping steer the
development in this area
Mongoose ayam characteristics sound
unrivaled on paper but ultimately the
proof of capabilities of the Mongoose
iron platform surely lies in its
practical implementations to date this
is why I'm pleased to say that our
second speaker today will be Alexander
 the director and systems architect
at Ubu Communications who will have been
a long-standing client of airline
solutions and alex has personally taken
a pivotal role in implementing Mongoose
I am within Google environments Alex
Baudette will therefore be in a position
to share the intricacies of the system
and its key features from a perspective
of a customer of ours who lives with
Mongoose I am everyday please allow me
to finish by saying you are welcome to
post questions throughout the duration
of the webinar are using the chat
facility our speaker alex foote will
answer as many questions as time allows
at the end of the webinar if any
questions do grow unanswered you are
welcome to raise them by email using the
following address webinar at Erlang -
solutions.com that's webinar at allowing
- solutions.com if you're interested in
learning more about Mongoose I am or
wish to establish whether it may be a
solution for the challenges your own
business may be facing please feel free
to contact me directly my email address
will be displayed in one of the final
slides of the presentation we will share
with you today the same goes for any
other questions you may have
feel free to contact us I would now like
to hand over to me Knox Lasky who will
be glad to tell you about Mongoose aiya
thank you madam hello my name is Mahesh
Lasky I work with solutions for over
seven years
and in the first two days webinar I will
tell you about the messaging server
endeavor which we call one who's time so
what is Mongoose I am it's a messaging
server which powers projects in social
media gaming and telecoms our focus is
on systems demanding - traffic it could
be many online users connected Oh
could be high volumes of messages or
both as you will learn later today
during the webinar
Mongoose ahem is a distributed system
and it scales quite well on clusters of
tens of machines we will talk about
scalability quite a lot today but there
is also one more aspect of Mongoose a.m.
which helped it to be successfully
deployed in many projects it is its
modular architecture open industry
standards that man design is based on
and open technologies which make it
highly customizable I will give you some
examples were Mongoose could be and has
been successfully deployed for example
in telecoms the chat feature is a part
of standard communication software so
you can find different products in this
area with the chat feature in social
media messaging is also the key part of
social websites with real-time web
applications showing on the market
today's is interesting solution to power
your chat feature of social media sites
gaining we could power root user charts
which are integral part of the gameplay
so the total just some ideas and areas
where a man was could be and has been
used
XMPP which is an open standard protocol
used for Facebook charts for Google Talk
but also many other messengers and as
the XMPP protocol has been already
widely adopted there are quite a few
libraries and client applications that
could be used with mangu SIA for those
of you who are not familiar with XMPP
I'll have some properties listed here
first of all it's an open standard which
is formalized through some RFC documents
and extensions are published for the
XMPP Software Foundation site so this is
truly open standard we're also the
community can post new ideas and discuss
new extensions to the protocol it's
secured with channel encryption and
stronger indication mechanisms it could
be also isolated from public network and
powered vessel internal solutions
as flexible as in new modules can be
added new features can be implemented
using XMPP protocol not necessarily
following the standards described on the
XMPP standard software foundation site
but some specific elements which require
which your application will require so
this is an XML based protocol and it's
quite flexible in terms of messages
and architecture of XMPP is
decentralized meaning that anyone can
run XMPP server and there is no central
master server so servers will just
federic with each other and this is how
you can for example talk to the Google
Doc users through the several server
Federation
you
XMPP also solves some of the scalability
issues when comparing Poland approaches
and is proven because it's been in use
for quite a few years are there are very
many implementations and deployments and
effectively millions of users using the
XMPP
okay now what features Mongoose has so
it supports WebSockets XMPP over
WebSockets this can be truly a key
feature for more than chant enabled web
applications
it also supports some other extensions
which are called accepts you can find a
full list of such extensions on the XMPP
or web site
I listed here a few that we support in
Mongoose again this is multi-user chat
service discovery v-cards tribe was
released and private storage on our
roadmap there is also implementation of
XMPP over HTTP called Bosh which we are
planning on releasing soon and there are
also other features which are either
requested by the community or we have on
our home and we're in developed in
branches because you need to know that
Mongoose is also an open source project
and you will you can follow it and find
source code on our airline solutions we
have account
as I said Mongoose I am is sooo very
customizable
and a lot of Castille modifications have
been built on top of it one thing that
we have learned over the years is that
there is never a one-size-fits-all
solution for complex messaging platforms
so often our team is hired to develop
custom extensions depending on customer
needs examples will include push
notifications to mobile devices in case
some users are offline and cannot
receive an instant message custom
authentication plugins to help Mongoose
integrate with existing environment
reliable message delivering mobile
networks and many more
we have developed an open source also
regression test suits that covered most
of the source code and this greatly
helps when one modifies core components
or adds new components so this is also
an interesting feature of Mongoose this
open source regression tests available
also on our github airline solutions
account
in this slide I'm trying to make it a
bit more clear how Mongoose I am can be
configured that ship target the capacity
let me explain this side a bit for small
installations mangu should be perfectly
fine with Erlang database which is
called Lygia so as long as a number of
registered users online users and
so-called roster buddies is like less
than a hundred thousand it should be
perfectly fine to deploy my juice with
the standard Keynesian configuration
however if you require higher volumes of
traffic higher number of users
registered we would advise you to use
one of the alternatives for example for
storing authentication data or roster
data we could use my sequel in this
slide the authentication squirrel
indicates that there are different
pluggable authentication backends
Veneziano sequel databases for it could
be also an external script you want to
use authenticate users also if even
higher numbers are required I'm talking
about million of online users Monisha
which by default is used for session
management and for storing sessions are
also been marina it could be that it
will not fit in Ram in which case we
would advise you to replace it with
Freddy's Mongoose I am supports readies
as a storage for transient data like
session data and this actually helps
achievement goes even higher numbers
please look any questions you may have
and I would be happy to answer them
towards the end of this webinar
okay now in the second part I will want
to show some test results with you we
have some test environment here with
almost latest airline County P and
version the latest one cool some other
software using this tests is listed here
and let me show some of the results so
we have two kinds of configurations one
with a dedicated box on which Mongoose I
am and my sequel were installed the
other one with several Amazon ec2
instances on which I rarely see myself
ever installed but let's start with
dedicated box configuration it's an 8
core AMD with 32 gigabytes of RAM and
load tests were designed to first log in
the number of users ejuice each user has
a hundred Palestine's
roster or contact list aligned and when
the long test will not reflect the
behavior of human users but we give us
an idea what is the capacity of a system
under test such tests should also help
to find bottlenecks and generally
speaking profile the system first test
here is aiming at logging in as many
users as we can
so we will be aiming at looking in
400,000 users on this box people will
arrive like every second we will login
150 users each user has also its contact
least populated with hundred contacts
but they don't use it I rather shy
there will be no messages sent between
Bill let's see how this goes
in this slide Mongoose is red the lower
the better you can observe CPU state
from the test it's about 70% of CPU
resource
and the nice thing about the Helmand got
to be technology at which mangu Zion is
based is that it has support for S&amp;amp;P
architectures in our case it's an eight
core AMD processor so the support is
built into the element beautiful machine
and effectively mongoose a.m. can scale
well from dual core quad core eight or
beyond in my next line he will see
memory footprint of Mongoose again
mongoose is read here the lower the
better and we can see that once we
manage to log in all four hundred
thousand users we consumed roughly
twenty two gigabytes of ram so this book
still has spare capacity of ten
gigabytes of ram here for four hundred
thousand users dopey
now another test that we tried on this
configuration is aiming at generating
maximum load maximum traffic and see how
many messages per second we can push
through the system so now we have
decreased the number of users to 75,000
this and let's see how many messages per
second I can push we will be aiming at
21,000 per second
this is first slide showing CPU
utilization again now can clearly see
two phases of this test on the left hand
side you will see the login in face
people are logging in then there is a
short break and when people start to
charge so you see that once we reach 40
120 1000 messages per second we had we
get was quite stable condition with 80%
CPU
here is another slide which shows
problem during the test again you can
clearly see the two phases one when
people are looking in second when they
start to chat so we need some extra few
gigabytes of RAM to allocated for this
ongoing traffic but goose's again read
you
all right now another requirement that I
would like to share with you today is
based on Amazon ec2 so we have five
instances those are extra X large extra
large instances on Amazon with standard
ami images
three of em will run in magazine now we
will replace mini Jie in favor of rebus
and for fostering session data and will
keep my sequel as data storage for all
other persistent data like rosters
passwords and such
okay we will increase the we call it
arrival rate meaning how many users per
second we want to login the user count
is roughly the same it's three hundred
eighty thousand
and we are pushing 8,000 messages per
second now on Amazon ec2 there are some
different characteristics of the system
for example the Sun tool that has been
used for general generating load would
behave a bit differently comparing to
some ran at our office environment so
this is the maximum message rate we
could achieve 8000 messages per second
but we are quite confident more could be
handled
anyway let's see how this looks on the
graph
here we need to discuss this because
it's like different from the other
slides where we had just one Mongoose
line here we have actually free
I almost disappeared behind the perfect
one because the characteristics of all
three men whose notes are pretty much
the same but you can see that here the
higher the better but the memory
footprint is quite stable on all three
machines
where we start to send traffic after we
have logging all the users around four
gigabytes of RAM remain available I also
put relish as the blue line here just to
show that this box had a lot of free
memory available yet
here the next slide is again trying to
plot all four boxes on one graph
shall we cpu utilization 7c again
clearly the two phrases the first place
won't be trying to plug in all the users
all the Mongoose boxes were busy
80% of CPU utilization Redis was quite
busy 20 percent and there was a break
and we started to send messages for
again we can see that the Mongoose boxes
used only 60 percent of CPU I also
released was reasonably low as far as
CPU is concerned I mean keep in mind
also those extra large instances are not
as powerful as the box that in the
dedicated box on which we executed
previous tests
again I encourage you to make notes ask
questions that I will be happily
addressing later and that's pretty much
it I had I just wanted to sum up now
some of the benefits of Mongoose I am
it's technically it's a proven solution
from a nonprofit company this has this
platform has been deployed in production
quite a few times so far rapid
deployment we already prepackaged
Mongoose I am in for linens and Mac OS
but it also has nice build tool which
allows you to build and deployment goose
interoperability and should by the XMPP
open protocol this is also clearly a
benefit of this platform
and the fact that Mongoose run
LTP makes it efficiently use multiple
bathrooms so as we have seen saturation
and multi-core CPUs was quite high which
is good
another thing is its customizable
components like pluggable authentication
so this should allow you to integrate a
platform with any existing systems that
you have already run running
all right that was still there was it
for me thank you I will speak to you
later
answering some of the questions I will
now pass over to Alexander hello
everybody
and Alex Pope and System Architect of
Google and they wanted to share with you
our experience in implementation of
Mongoose I am the time so we started to
work on this project with our own
solutions we thought that is a coded
jeopardy home that is not familiar with
Ubu and what we are doing here who is a
video conference provider and who today
got seventy eight more even more than 70
million customers worldwide men in the
US and who provides a free up to twelve
way high-quality video service and it
runs on a several major platforms like
easy make web-based grabbed on major
mobile bottoms like hyphenated I'll do
it and they it has caused a facebook
application in May last year we would
limit more than 10 billion mean video
minutes worldwide now what is done here
who is Mongoose I
we already had service up and running
the video service I mean and part of
video service also provide our customers
with instant messaging both warm blonde
and group chat and OB maintain the
real-time presence of users and we also
maintain a roster some key cards and
other privacy settings of block list of
users and we already had some air
commercial activity server that used the
time it was both years ago but we met
first scalability problems of the
systems that we had scalability and
stability actually so our main challenge
our main challenge was scale Google
service is constantly growing and there
was a lot of users every day so we had
requirement to build a system that
actually can infinitely grow hey you can
deploy as I was with and deploy scale
units or the system is required and
demand save days we had 600 online users
daily Peaks we have total 10 million
edges that users and all the pseudo
generated about 500 messages per second
and they repeats after some self month
even almost one year of hard work with
Emin solutions engineers we delivered
the scale unit of
Mongoose I am it was delivered my
physical hardware the times
well we didn't feel comfortable with any
other solutions so we
etosha strongly CPUs best use at the
time available in the market ever server
had the 32 gigabyte of RAM we may chose
a load test and eventually delivered the
system to production
I wasn't went well more or less
we had several weeks or months of
production system new production system
that we had to fix some problems and to
extend it all slid and since then we
developed a lot of new functionalities
based on our experience it was a visit I
want a solution engineers like for
example we found out that the original s
XMPP Federation implementation was there
and not efficient so we developed a
propriety mechanism it is based on their
on the standard scheme but is much more
efficient they also delivered a custom
authentication mechanism for users and
we integrated Mongoose I am thoroughly -
gugu application vacant applications yes
it can use today after using today
different api's and states of of the
amount of the users
at the mountain by a mongoose I am
for example if somebody wants to call
somebody to make a video call I mean you
can check it this user is online and
Mongoose I am and deliver the color
quest immediately by excellent opinions
or one can send the push notification
message to mobile device if they realize
that this user is not online currently
so for this resource we use a fungus I
am a STP as if we developed and a
patient as well another direction of
customization here was driven by a
operation apartment we devote a lot of
monitoring capabilities like SNP contest
or any for every activities that we have
today we delivered a lot of custom logs
that and provide the - visibility level
of what's going on with the system so we
can take a different anomaly usage
patterns or tablets with the problems
and see what's going on here
and also we have today extensive
capabilities of configuration changes in
runtimes it allow us to to make a lot of
changes into out of the system during
the runtime without any downtime or
service interruptions
today as you can see we have several
systems already deployed in different
geographical locations and all of them
connected to other systems so we have
full mesh those assistants every block
here as you can see I am one I am too is
actually scale unit that contains
complete architecture inside that we
look in a second and all the systems
communicate with each other all the time
here's an example of one site a one of
physical sites at exploiting us and
hosting provider so we have several it's
at the top of the system we have array
of firewalls they protect access to
system behind that we have Hardware load
balancers and here we have actually a
mongoose I am clusters each of them
contains a set of worker nodes set of
administration nodes it's local cache
for session management is I mentioned
earlier a they all of them all the snows
run on top of my sequel cluster database
and they expose kpi's to other business
applications that use intensively a
mongoose i am in there is business flows
of specific and the all that education
is done against a central directory
service that runs on top of all the
servers
you can see it some examples of
monitoring screens that in this case you
can see actually some some of TV
activities and there is a daily pattern
of thousands of messages per second that
actually hit our databases this Mexico
databases it so before hey you can see
an example of lunch of the new new
domain or new skill unit was deployed
somewhere in May last year
it's a Sabine picture the bottom of the
page so you can see that their system on
the top of the page you can see that a
number of on users dropped significantly
then we launched a new domain so it just
listed with us a lot from existing
systems to a new one and from that point
there's a lot on the system on the old
system was distributed evenly between
the existing the scale units and their
new screens you can see an example of
custom blocks or complex event record
that we can with also a monitor well in
this case we talked about a browser
event when one user send a invitation to
become a roster of another user so today
we monitor such events in real time
actually in the you can fire alarms if
when we identify some anomalies in there
and the sensitive events like somebody
sends to me
events or too many restaurants MIT in
different users definitely so such cases
and we are able to get asked action real
time another very important aspect of
activity here is XMPP presences center
shift glass actually citizen main amount
of messages it all solar systems and he
is a method velocity actually a also its
appearances all traffic from one scale
unit toward its cash use Vegas is a cash
layer here and he actually the numbers I
can reach high numbers of updates and
we're talking about a fifteen thousand
its per second on the whole system to to
the cash and actually today two years
almost two years after we launched a
system first time we migrated all the
servers to virtual infrastructure we
deployed already eleven scale units or
our scale units actually is equal to a
example T domain
I'm joining them today in two different
separate a geographical locations our
usage also gone by
so we have more than two actually almost
in 2.5 million users daily basis we have
even more than 70 million registered
users today and they say generate about
five thousand messages per second and
daily tips and the uptime of the system
is actually amazing
we delivered 99.9 a 98 percent uptime it
means that we had some minor
interruption to the service for a couple
of hours last year actually this is all
what I wanted to say today a feel free
to contact us with any business question
and now I will ask Madame to close the
webinar off with some final summation
and they will able to ask you questions
thank you for that Alex this is
absolutely the part where we'll be
taking questions from the audience and
quite a few questions have arrived
during the webinar itself first of all
just to say I'm sure you'll all be
joining me in thanking me Colin Alex for
for an inspiring talk on ruse many
thanks to all of you who have joined us
for the webinar as well the next webinar
just to sort of make that little note is
on April 11th
please join us we'll be talking about
online learning rank and the advantages
of keeping things simple through the use
of the language you will have a chance
to hear about the scalability
concurrency and fault tolerance
tolerance over land as well as how easy
it is to pick the language up and start
using it now I suggest we move on to
questions straight away and then I'll
give you a couple of further details to
sort of close the webinar off okay
I will start because I already got some
questions here let me see so one is my
sequel can be a pain to replicate are
you planning additional back and support
for persistent data such as react we
already tried react for some data
because this is also a question of
capacity planning there's a lot of data
to persist some of this is for
authentication so like users possibly
passwords and not the real table for the
rosters table for flying messages and so
on and so on so depending on how big
each table is we could consider we did
use react in the past for storing some
persistent data related to Mongoose
those extensions were built for some
private solutions custom solutions there
would be need for adding like users
scenarios next question here how come
there's so much CPU usage the answer is
that basically when a user logs in there
is quite a lot of things to do
so we initiate new connections and
there's some handshake occasion
mechanism and we exchange some messages
related to authentication so there are
some database queries to run then we
need to fetch all the contacts from his
roster we need to transform it to xml
transmitted to the client and if each
user has 100 bodies in this roster list
and then if you are trying to log in
hundreds of users per second then it all
adds up so it's a combination of stress
on the database in the case of the first
configuration
it was magnesia so actually on the same
box we had sorry no it was my sequel
plus some logical demand side so this
all adds up but once users are logged in
just persisting the session is quite
cheap it's just it does not consume that
much memory and it does not consume CPU
at all unless the user is actually
chatting so there's another question
related to rank and rank be used in
place of my support for persistent data
storage I think I already answered this
question what were the message sizes we
were using for generating the load
messages were rather small I think a
single stanza with a message would end
up being tens of bytes so the message
payload was just some bytes long okay I
have quite a few more questions worried
what the private XML storage is I
mentioned on one of the slides that when
good supports one of the extensions
basically the large users to store some
data for later retrieval it's not meant
to create amount of data but it is just
it could be some configuration service
some other data there is a detailed
description of what the extension is
about on the XMPP dot or website it's to
accept number above 49 so description
for more details
for for the test scenario presented when
loading the roster for each user was
also a precondition that users on the
roster were also not in well yes and no
I mean users were logging in we have for
example half a million users registered
in a database and as they appear online
it might be that they already will have
some of the contacts from their contact
list logged in or some of those could be
yet offline so eventually we will end up
having almost all the registered users
in the database available online this is
at the peak of the test so it's not like
a precondition that users eventually
will all end up being logged in okay
does Mongoose are um provided drop box
functionality I'm not sure if I get this
question right but one XMPP as a
technology does specify how users can
send each other files or initiate audio
calls of video calls so we're talking
about sending files when XMPP protocol
does the file how this could be achieved
however if Dropbox functionality is like
a storage on the server side then the
answer is no does not provide Dropbox
like storage for file sharing I mean I
think we don't have that much time to
answer all the questions I will pass
over to Alexander now so that he can
also answer some of his questions
okay I see some questions here was a
downturn related to the XMPP service
reasons a actually most of downtime that
we had last year was a letter to some
abnormal activities of our clients is
software problems or users and some my
secure limitations or actually problems
so required us to deploy several patches
even to Mexico so today we're much
better shape actually we didn't have a
complete downtime of very xbp service
himself a another question he is a
guardian custom authentication it was
some more detail and support for SS Oh
some of Kerberos cosmetic dictation
mechanism skins a actually what is done
here we developed a custom mechanism
that was integrated into standard XMPP
supported
Sasol education scheme and this
mechanism is based on google propriety a
key is management scheme and a token
generation and the idea of this
mechanism was to allow Google
proprietary SSO single sign-on a
infrastructure to be used also by a
mongoose a.m. service as a whole other
all services do today
another question here is please provide
some information and support for often
messaging in Mongoose I am a it's
supported according to XMPP standard
it's a certain standard XMPP part we
have a table in my sequel called spool
and if recipient of the message is not
available to receive this message
Mongoose am identify situation and store
this message in this pool table until
this user will look in again and then
this messages will be delivered to the
user
another question here is what kind of
TCP socket configuration is needed to
ensure minimal packet drops to Mobile's
running on GPRS or level stable a I'm
not sure if the question is related to a
specific configuration on server side or
client side but actually we do not have
server side you do not have any specific
configuration of Pacific set up for
mobile for mobile clients actually our
clients run on different platforms as PC
Mac or any mobile platform and we don't
have any specific optimizations for a
mobile client and a server side only a
maybe you don't you don't experience any
problems do that we can see that we have
to make some specific optimizations for
mobile clients here only considerations
that should be taken here is that the
mobile clients lose a network much more
than a PC client so
this is why they reconnect the systems
much more than a usual piece of clients
but it should be others with the
capacitor capacitor planning that's it a
other question here is a HTTP admin
removed yes we don't use the original
HTTP admin of digital developed or top
right one hey another question here is
how many element nodes do you start for
about 1 million users I assume that
there's a one minute you work users
number refers to online users because
actually we have you can have is you can
talk is about all many users or about
registered users in the database but
registered users is very small numbers
and 1 million is actually a small number
so there is no challenge in the system
but for opponent users in real time in
in real life we allow on a every node to
her to have a about 50 60 thousand a
concurrent users connected so it means
for to support on 1 million users you
need about a 15 nodes running but again
this figures from real life and the this
node can handle much more load we tested
same with a load test also this song
with Erin solutions continuous and we
reached leaves double numbers in means a
lot
is a test labs but you know I knew like
I don't want to stage system much so we
do not allow more than 50 60 thousand
users online users etc and they function
completely well I send this a addressed
all the questions if they have here okay
thank you Alex for that we had a very
interesting question coming from Thomas
and I'd like to pick that one up as well
Thomas is asking here is allowing
solutions in the professional services
business or do we maintain a commercial
branch of Mongoose I am similar to
process ones approach the Jeopardy well
as Michael mentioned earlier in his
elaboration on Mongoose I am Mongoose is
open source and you can download
Mongoose I am and start benefiting from
it straightaway
we provide services around
implementation of Mongoose and
development of new features depending on
what specific requirements are and
there's a cost element around that we
also provide support for your mungus
implementation which is obviously highly
recommended and something you need to
consider now we've exhausted our time
for questions but once again many thanks
to me Harlan Alex for a great talk on
Mongoose I am many things equally to all
of you who have joined us for the
webinar as I mentioned please join us
again on April 11th for our next webinar
which will be dealing with the topic of
learning Erlang and how to keep use of
Ireland you have a chance to hear just
how easy our line is to pick up and I'm
really glad to say that we will have
some fantastic speakers lined up first
of all none other than Robert Burdine
one of the inventors of Erlang and
Francesco Cesare need the technical
director at airline solutions who will
give us an opportunity to learn about
the language now following today we will
be sending you a short survey to make
sure we capture your feedback of today's
webinar please note that the recording
of the webinar and the presentation that
was
today we'll be available for you to
collect on erlang solutions is corporate
website at the wwl and - solutions comm
thank you once again and we look forward
to seeing you again
on our next webinar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
