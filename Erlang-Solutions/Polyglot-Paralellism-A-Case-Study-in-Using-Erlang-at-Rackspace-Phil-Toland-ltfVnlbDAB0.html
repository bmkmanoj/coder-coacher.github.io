talk is going to be about the way that
we use Erlang and Ruby together to solve
some interesting problems at Rackspace
so a lot of you probably heard of
rackspace we do we do a lot of hosting
whenever I say that I'm using erling at
Rackspace most people ask me right away
says oh do you work in a cloud or do you
work with OpenStack and in fact I don't
I work in the foundation group which
supports our traditional managed hosting
business where we have a lot of
interesting automation problems so the
team I work on is called the foundation
development in automation team that's
right f dat there you can overhear some
interesting conversations where people
say oh who do i go to talk to about that
a piece f debt and so what do we do we
are a little bit unique i think in that
instead of a team mission statement we
have a team mission haiku through
automation adapt and collaborate deliver
software i'm sure that clears it all up
so what we do is we build automation
tools and api's we have to project teams
right now one focused on storage so San
nazan des and my project team is focused
on networking devices so what do we do
what do we do i mean when i say
automation right so kind of the basics
is we backup devices we have SLA s with
our customers that say if the device
goes bad we have a certain amount of
time to restore it or we owe them a
refund so having backups is very
important and it's and basically a
backup for a device is everything
required to get that device running in
the state that is currently in after a
hardware failure we also do updates we
have a lot of devices and we
occasionally have the need to go out and
for example update all of the firewalls
in a certain data center to add a new
SMP polar obviously at the scale that we
work that's a lot of devices to update
by hand so we have some tools to do
not automatically and we also generate
new configurations for devices that are
just going online that's kind of a it's
kind of one of those things that doesn't
really involve communicating with a
device but it landed on us because it
didn't make sense for anybody else to do
it we're also doing some more advanced
things now we've kind of got the basics
handled if you use the my rackspace com
portal there is a firewall manager which
allows you to add and remove ackles from
your firewalls we provide the Appy that
backs that up Rackspace is also working
on a new project that we're internally
calling in tasks which is network
topology as a service so we go out and
we spider all of our switches and
devices that are attached to them and
then feed all that data into a service
so you can ask interesting questions
like how many devices are plugged into
this switch or which devices are behind
this firewall because of course the
logical and the physical layout of the
network are not necessarily the same so
that's a very interesting project and
one of the things that we're working on
a lot now is a nappy for doing VLAN
assignments on the switches this is
something that we do a surprising number
of times every day in our data centers
as we have customers chart or new
customers come in we have to set VLANs
on the switches that they're plugged
into also in our offices as people move
around the new desks or we add people we
have to set their VLANs properly so that
they get access to the things that they
need access to and so this this alone
will end up saving hundreds of man-hours
every year and we do all of this using
Ruby Erlang and mongodb I think maybe if
i add nodejs that slide will be fully
buzzword compliant so I mentioned before
that we have a lot of switches I don't
know about you guys I am impressed by
big numbers so I'm going to throw some
out here we have 50,000 network devices
total a little more than half of those
are infrastructure switches and the rest
are customer devices we have in terms of
firewalls
about 18,000 firewalls our most popular
model is the cisco a SI which is a real
workhorse of a device we also have about
half as many cisco pix which we are
trying to get rid of as fast as possible
but we have a lot of customers who say
you know what it does what i want i
don't want to get rid of it and we
recently introduced the Juniper SRX we
also support a lot of load balancers the
cisco CSS the f5 big-ip which is very
popular right now the brocade a DX which
we recently introduced the Red Hill web
MUX which is a piece of crap and the
cisco ace i would personally love to go
through our dcs and pull out every web
hill redhill web mux and beaten with a
baseball bat but they won't let me do
that we're getting more into our
managing infrastructure switches lately
which we have the cisco catalyst 2950
which is an older model the cisco
catalyst 2960 which is kind of our bread
and butter access switch and the cisco
catalyst 4948 which we use as a
gregation routers now you do not be
fooled by the fact that these are all
called cisco catalyst these are very
different devices and you have to
interact with them very differently
Thank You Cisco all of these devices are
spread across eight data centers on
three continents north america of course
where we have six data centers europe we
have a our second largest data centers
in london and asia where we have a small
but growing presence in hong kong it
used to be the case that all of our
services were hosted here in the US and
one data center and we have considerable
Layton sees between London and Hong Kong
that we have to deal with and so some of
the challenges that we've run up against
when trying to automate all of these
different devices in all these different
places obviously the number one
challenges there's just a lot of devices
we also run up against some significant
performance problems these devices are
just not designed for high throughput
management they can pass packets all day
like a boss but when it comes to going
in to manage them not so
much the other thing is that some of
these devices like for example the Red
Hill webmix or the cisco pix we're just
slow their old right some of these
things are running on 200 megahertz
Pentium right they're just they're just
slow and they're not going to get any
faster and we don't have the luxury of
just throwing them all out and yet the
really kind of the biggest performance
issue is we spend a lot of time in
network I oh and just waiting on the
device and that's not going to go away
the other problem we run into is
transparency with this many devices some
of them are going to fail every night
it's just a fact of life and we need to
know which devices are failing and why a
lot of times it's just basically down to
a simple configuration problem but
sometimes it's actually a serious issue
with the device getting ready to fail
and if we can get on top of that before
it happens well that's a win for our
customer and it's a win for us and we
need to keep a record of all
interactions with the device some of our
data centers or PCI certified we
actually follow I think they call it as
a ssae 16 used to be called SAS 70
basically we set controls on how
interactions with our devices are
managed and we're audited based on that
there are controls so we can say
whatever right but we are very serious
about protecting the integrity of our
customer devices and so we need we need
an audit log we need to be able to say
oh look customers device is compromised
we need to know why that happened and
who was involved the other problem we
run into is the multiple device types
remember that list of about six load
balancers well they all behave
differently and you have to take that
into consideration when you're
communicating with the device and even
the same hardware platform with
different versions of the OS
particularly with Cisco devices you will
run into some really weird
idiosyncrasies and differences that that
you just have to accommodate Cisco is
very bad about regressions between code
versions
we ran into a situation where a specific
code version running on the cisco a SI
would lock up if you tried to write the
configuration from the active device to
the standby something that you probably
want to do every once in a while so we
have to we have to take all those things
into account and and compensate for them
in our software and probably one of the
biggest challenges as management
interfaces for most of these devices the
management interface is ssh again and
using expect to manipulate a
command-line session not exactly
high-tech welcome to 1999 but it's kind
of what you got to do some of the newer
devices have real management interfaces
I like to say that the the Cisco devices
are meant to be managed by human and not
so much by a computer whereas the
Juniper devices are meant to be managed
by a computer and not so much by a human
that means that our support floor
doesn't like the junipers but I
personally love them a little bit of a
conflict there so the the brocade ATX
and the f5 both have soap-based
interfaces but of course they're
different the Juniper has an xml-based
interface that is based on net comp
which cisco in theory supports but not
really and then SNMP has its own issues
we ran into a situation last week where
the SNMP mibs that we use to pull
physical port numbers on the 2950 and
2960 are not supported on the 49 48 and
we asked Cisco about that and they said
huh we'll get back to you on that so
where we started i joined Rackspace in
mid-2009 and at that time there were
multiple rails applications and in one
case a ruby script they had a lot of
overlapping responsibilities they were
basically information silos they all
communicated with devices in one way or
another but they did it differently of
course it was difficult to change right
all of the
standard problems you think you'd run
into and they were using expect on our
be to communicate with the devices which
reads the input one character at a time
which is very slow this was obviously
not tenable we were using my signal on
the back end for the database which I
mean my sequel is a fine piece of
software don't get me wrong but we had
some very kind of specific issues in our
circumstance we had about 260 gigabytes
of poorly indexed backup data migrations
were basically out of the question
because of the poor indexing and adding
proper indexes was also pretty much out
of the question because we'd have to
take the master database offline for a
weekend while it did the indexing
another interesting problem we ran into
is that with all these different devices
doing a backup on a device means
different things for different types of
device and my sequel having a rigid
schema really was a problem because we'd
want to store different information
based on the type of device we were
backing up we dabbled a little bit with
vendor device managers so cisco has a
device manager for their firewalls and a
different one for their load balancers
f5 and brocade both have their device
managers these were a problem for us
they were expensive often very much so
typically they would only support a
small number of devices per instance
because the vendors were not expecting
someone to need to manage multiple tens
of thousands of devices and at the end
of the day you still have multiple
management interfaces that you've got to
somehow kind of abstract over so that
you can pretend that you have a somewhat
homogeneous Network we looked at
third-party solutions I'm not going to
name any names here but we looked at
quite a few of them most couldn't handle
the scale that we operate at and most
couldn't handle the heterogeneous
network they may have supported maybe
half the devices that we needed to talk
2 and when we said well what about
supporting the other half they said well
good luck with that and really I think
the most important thing is that we have
a large very complex existing network
and we simply cannot change the way our
network is built out to support a tool
and it's not going to happen and in fact
it's probably more accurate to say that
we have a large and complex
infrastructure network with thousands of
customer networks attached to it so it's
not just an issue of managing one
network it's an issue of managing
thousands of networks and our customers
come back to us and they say you know
what we want this crazy-ass
configuration we want tiered firewalls
we want multiple layers of load
balancers we say yes sir when do you
want it so where we are today we're in a
much better place I think one of the the
key one of the key things to take away
from this is that we always built the
simplest thing that could possibly work
and then grew from there so we started
out by taking those multiple rails up
applications and collapsing them down
into one and we replaced my sequel with
MongoDB MongoDB very much fit the way we
want it to work basically you know all I
really want is a big persistent hash
that I can stuff things into and get
them back later and that's exactly what
MongoDB is we then added an erlang
component to handle the actual
communication with the with the devices
we have to talk to many devices at once
we have to do so in a way where there
are no failures well we have to do so in
a way where our code doesn't fail the
devices are going to cause all kinds of
problems we may not be able to talk to
it we may have a device it disconnects
in the middle of the conversation we
need to capture that we need to record
it and we need to get a ticket off to
the right person to fix it so our lying
application basically just started off
simply sharing the database with Mongo
with the rails application and that
actually worked out quite well MongoDB
has atomic rights so we just don't
overwrite the whole document and things
worked out
and then of course all of our network
device communication happens here
eventually we found a need to add a REST
API as we need more immediate
interaction between the rails
application and the Erlang application
and we used web machine for that which I
can't speak highly enough of web machine
and we use it quite a bit and then
eventually we added other clients
talking to this rest api as we started
building out the api so as the results
of that we went from taking about eight
hours to back up our largest DC to 38
minutes and i'll get a little bit into
the architecture of our backup
application in a minute but we were
actually able to ramp up the number of
backup workers to the point where we
started having problems with a network
infrastructure our backbone team called
us up and said you know what guys you
are causing problems on our TAC x server
you need to back off a little bit all
applications with the device are logged
with details of what happened and of
course it's all very maintainable it's
very easy to maintain now there's a
clear separation of responsibilities
between the rails front end and the end
the earling back end and as as a
development team that makes us very
happy so the device interactions are
fast and reliable we went from taking
probably on average 45 to 60 seconds to
to carry out a conversation with a
device that's down to like 12 or 13
seconds now and if the communicating
with the device fails we use the normal
air handling mechanisms within earling
to capture that and log it we have full
transparency everything that happens
with the device is logged and we have a
better foundation for growth so this is
a screen capture from of the backup
results page that I took right before I
came down here and by the way this 2%
failure rate is embarrassingly hi we
have growing very quickly and our
provisioning process is not as automated
as we would like and so we have a lot of
devices
going onto the network not configured
properly a typical error rate for us is
about half a percent and on this day we
had 404 errors out of 20,000 devices
just over 20,000 devices backed up on
this so in this screenshot this is a
list of all of the events for Ace for a
single device we categorized them by
types and whether it was scheduled
backup job or an API call and the
results whether it was successful or not
and for each of these events you can
drill down into the specific details how
long it that interaction took who
initiated that interaction in this case
was a backups was initiated by the
system whether it was successful or not
what the results were in the case of a
backup if we try to back up a standby
device that result will say stand by
instead of changes saved and if there
were no changes on the device to say
then that result would say no changes
and the power of MongoDB really comes
through in that detail section that is a
piece of structured information that is
different depending on what type of
event were recording so if this were a
nappy interaction instead of a backup
then you'd see details about what was
changed on the device instead of some of
this and this this basically shows each
stage of the backup and the results of
that stage and you see saved is
underlined there that is a that is a
hyperlink to the saved backup and this
is I mean this is very important for our
network security technicians who are
trying to manage these devices and
interact with a customer whenever
somebody comes along and says you know
why isn't my device backing up or why
can't I talk to it by the API it's like
well it's right there go check that out
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
some of the high points of the
application i'm not going to go into a
lot of detail in the whole thing
but I there are three three libraries
that we've broken out of the main
application that I think are pretty
interesting and pretty relevant to
what's going on and so the first is the
command line automation this is this is
one of those things that we'd rather not
do so but we have to so you might as
well make the best of it and from our
applications point of view we have an
agent that represents a command line
interaction with a device and on the
back end that interaction could happen
over HTTP / ssh or over telnet and one
of the interesting things about SSH is
that those pics as I mentioned earlier
yeah they only support SSH one any guess
on how many libraries there are out
there to do SSH one yeah not many
there's one it's written in C and it
doesn't work very well because nobody's
maintaining it so what we had to do what
we had to do here we have to support
those devices we got to do something SSH
one is the only protocol they'll
communicate over so we had a piece of
Ruby code that would fire up openssh on
a PTY and use expect to manage that
interaction and it turns out by the way
that there is a there's a library called
our expects which reads in input in
chunks instead of one character at a
time is thus much faster so pursuing
that we have a a library for for calling
Ruby code that we call Jen script it's
actually based on some code that we
pulled out of the Ernie application that
was written by tom preston warner of
github ernie is a an RPC server that
allows you to implement the code for
your RPC in either ruby or early we
didn't really want an RPC server we
wanted a way to call Ruby code easily
from within our application so we kind
of stole the guts of that code that
manages the the Ruby scripts and pain
set it up so that we can just call
arbitrary Ruby functions from within
our line code so for those of you who
were here to see the Ruby and Erlang
working together these are the money
slides so here we have a ruby module
hello world right not very complicated
the magic here is in that last line gen
script expose the hello module with this
we can now write erling code that looks
like this we call Jen script to start it
up we pass in the fact that it's Ruby
and the path of the script and then we
can use call to call functions in that
module and this works really well
there's nothing in here that is
necessarily specific to Ruby there's a
little bit of a of a Shem to to manage
the interaction right basically all that
happens here is we start the Ruby
interpreter on a on a knurling port and
we have a little little shim of code
that when we make the call to the Ruby
application on the Erlang side we
convert that to Bert which is binary
Erlang terms also from github we convert
that to Bert we send it down a file
descriptor 3 on the Ruby side there's
that little shim that that takes that
converts it from Bert figures out how to
dispatch that function to the module
calls the function captures the result
packages impact up as Bert and then
pushes up file descriptor for on the
early side we catch that decode it and
you know we're turn it up stack this is
very cool we use this a lot there are
several situations where we say hey we
have this thing it's not that big a deal
we're not really sure how to do it
properly knurling but hey we've got this
Ruby code to do it bada-bing bada-boom
right it's not it's not appropriate for
everything right we thought we had some
issues with the earliest MP manager a
little while back and we said oh hey
this is no problem we'll just write a
ruby script and use the Ruby SNMP
manager and that'll be great and did not
work out so well but at least was an
option and it was easy to experiment
with so we figured out very quickly that
didn't work and I moved on to something
else so we have another library which we
call Jen
match just for running batch jobs and
for us a batch job is something that we
run entirely for the side effects right
so we have in our case we have a big
list of devices we want to update that
all the devices in that list or we want
to backup all the devices in that list
we want to hand that list of devices to
a certain piece of code we need to keep
the the number of workers that are doing
this we need to kind of pin that number
at a certain level so we have this pool
of asynchronous workers they process the
items in the list one at a time and
until that list is empty this is kind of
at a high level the way this works so we
have this runner which is kind of our
error colonel right we don't expect the
runner to ever crash the runner will
spin up a bunch of workers these workers
we don't care about they can crash
whatever blah blah blah and the workers
actually dedicate a delegate the actual
processing of each item to a callback
module and the callback now module also
has some callbacks for certain events so
if a worker does crash we call a call
back on them on the module to say a
worker just crashed so you can log that
the interaction between the runner and
the worker looks something like this the
runner will start the worker the worker
will send back an asynchronous hey I'm
ready message the runner pops an item
off the stack sends a process message to
the worker with that item the worker
then calls the callback module when that
is done it returns a ready message to
the runner says I'm ready for the next
one we laughter rinse repeat until there
are no more items in the queue and then
we start the runner goes into a a wine
down status and start sending stop
messages to the workers to say okay
we're done this has been great we can
scale up the number of scale up and down
the number of workers as necessary some
of our smaller DC's it doesn't make
sense to spend up a lot of workers some
of the larger DC's we want a lot of
workers and as I mentioned before we
have to be careful about stressing the
network infrastructure so what's next
we're kind of moving from being a full
stack tools provider to an appy provider
and there are there
a lot of groups working on automation
within Rackspace and they're working on
automating different things and we have
kind of carved out a niche in that in
that we are responsible for device
communication if you want to talk to a
device you come ask us we'll handle it
the idea is that eventually we're not
going to have people logging on to
network devices it should all be
automated or should all go through a
tool that is obviously a a big in the
future goal but that is what we're
working towards we're also finding that
as we shift more to a focus on API is
that there are some better ways to
structure our application and in
particular one of the things we're
working towards is removing the fact
that the rails in the Erlang application
of sharing a database and just having
the rails application work directly from
the rest api and then we can say when
people come along and say well do you
support this like if you can access it
in our front end you can access it over
the api and this also solves a lot of
problems that that we currently have
where we have validation logic or
certain business logic duplicated
between the Erlang and rails
applications for example we have a bit
of code to determine if device is
eligible for backup so it has to be in a
certain state has to not be excluded it
has to be currently active has to have a
primary IP assigned to it these sorts of
things and we have to do that in two
places now we have to do that in the
rails application when displaying that
device to the user and we have to do
that in the Erlang application when
actually deciding whether we're going to
back up that device so by moving all of
the actual business logic down into this
erling application exposing it through
the rest api we get a big maintenance
win and actually once we move to this we
don't necessarily need rails in that
spot that could be backbone j/s or
whatever if any of us like Jas we might
do that but I think we'll probably stick
with rails so I think one of the
interesting question or one of the
interesting points for me is how we got
here Rackspace is not typically known as
being on the bleeding edge of technology
a lot of people even within the comp
you're kind of surprised to hear that we
are working with Erlang so it basically
we put together a case argue the
benefits and one over our boss to the
fact that you know this is this is the
way we need to go and it took about six
months there are a lot of there are a
lot of discussions right i go to my boss
and I say you know what these problems
we're having is this would totally be a
lot easier to solve before we were using
Erling rather than Ruby to talk to the
devices and he's like ah ok if you say
so but we really don't have time to
rewrite that right now it's like well
I'm just telling you you know we go back
and forth on this for a while and
eventually I go in and I have that
meeting with him one day and I say you
know what this would be totally easier
to solve if we were using Erlang and he
says yeah you said that how long do you
think it would take and then I knew ah I
got him on the hook i was i was a bit
fortunate in that my manager is not from
a software development background he is
it's a former Marine and he was managing
network security technicians when the
last development manager for our groups
and I don't want to do this anymore and
they said we need somebody to manage
this development group hey Brad why
don't you come do this he's like how
hard could it be right managing
developers that's got to be a cakewalk
and there was a there was definitely at
first some budding of heads he's very
much of the operations mindset you know
it's like go go go do do do we've got to
be we've got to make plans we've got a
document everything it doesn't work that
way but he's very open minded he
listened so when we went back and said
you know what there's a better way for
us to develop software and he said ok
tell me what that is he was very
interested in becoming a better
development manager and as a result we
became a better development team and so
when we went back and said we need to
talk about the technology choices he was
open to listening to that but of course
we had to back up what we said with
actual results right when I said we
could do this in Erlang and he says
great how long at that point now I'm on
the hook tax when we deliver this
but it worked out obviously we did run
into some let's say some speed bumps
from other parts of the organization and
I'm sure that a lot of you have heard
these as well like erling is weird it's
got a weird syntax doesn't run on the
JVM oh my god what are we going to do
and a lot of that you know addressing
that a lot of that's just education you
know it's like well you know Erlang is
very good at some specific things look
look we're not trying to rewrite
rackspace calm using Erlang we have a
very specific problem this is this
provides a good solution and we want the
ability to actually try that before you
pass judgment we also hear a lot you
can't find erling programmers and that
is I mean I guess there is some truth to
that to be honest we have we have
trouble finding good programmers period
we are hiring Ruby Python and erling
programmers and it's not like we're
inundated with Ruby and Python resumes I
in really a programmer who's worth their
salt can pick up Erlang like really the
last two Erlang programmers that we
introduced to our team came in as Ruby
developers we said hey how what do you
think about trying out erling they said
great I'd love to we start them off on
simple tasks they picked it up very
quickly and there was a lot of there's a
bit of a learning curve around OTP but
that's that's manageable and then of
course you get the the kind of lumped in
well you know you can't possibly succeed
using Erlang and this is really kind of
a summary of a lot of objections that we
heard things like oh well you know I
heard that you had a problem last night
that's clearly because you were using
early no it was because there were you
know ackles on a firewall that weren't
right had nothing to do with early or
you know why can't you talk to 100
instead of 50 devices at a time it must
be because you're using Erlang's like
right because Java can talk to a hundred
devices at a time no problem and this
again you know it falls back to
education right but i think the the
bigger the bigger issue is it also we
succeeded right and it's like people
come to us and they say hey you know
that thing you did I could have done
that in 10 minutes in Pearl it's like oh
really well do you think you could back
up 8,000 devices in 38 minutes no I
didn't think so so you know if you uh if
your mouth right to check you got to be
able to cash it so finally I was hoping
I was really hoping that I'd be able to
post a github URL up on here today but
the three libraries that I talked about
today are in the process of being open
sourced they're still winning their way
through Rackspace's IP process but I
expect within the next week or so that
these will be available follow my github
and Twitter accounts if you're
interested and I will also probably
announce this on the rack space blog but
we're very excited about this I when I
started I told my boss we use a lot of
open source software I think we need to
give back and he said absolutely I
support you in that and two and a half
years later it's like hey remember that
promise you made to me I'm calling you
on it so keep an eye open out open for
this I particularly like the gen script
it's not a lot of code but it is really
powerful so let's hear some questions
what do you guys want to know about yes
so right now there's myself and there
are two Ruby programmers that we're
training up in Erlang and we just hired
an erlang programmer who is starting
later this month that is that's an
interesting point most of this work was
done by me I wrote about eighty percent
of the code in these applications simply
because we were working often we
are considered a part of network
security at the time it's not a
development group was a support group
and we didn't have a lot of scrutiny on
us which meant that we had flexibility
to do what we wanted but it also meant
when we said hey we totally need more
headcount that it was like why what are
you guys doing that needs more headcount
good stuff promise yeah anything else
yeah so no we have so we run on VMS
right now we have two VMs that handle
our backups and updates we have two VMs
that handle the API calls for the my
racks based control panel and we have
for VMS in each data center to handle
our switch api's
so we have kind of a natural partition
in that by data center right and we have
a proxy that that sits in one data
center and proxies all of our API calls
and what happens is our clients will
call an API or request a resource really
from this proxy we look at the resource
they're requesting determine which node
needs to answer that and then route that
to the right node we are actually
working on right now moving our backup
and Update Services out to the data
centers as well so that when we're
backing up a device we're doing it from
a vm and the data center where that
device lives and we're actually kind of
working right now on how do we get all
of these nodes talking how do we handle
things like which which device in the
cluster is responsible for doing backups
you know where does that run or live and
how do we distribute workers across
those nodes those are things we're
actually working on right now anything
else yes
that is a good question um so there's
two answers to that for the most part
right now we use Capistrano to do
deployment so for those of you who
aren't familiar Capistrano is a ruby
deployment tool which is basically just
allows you to run commands over ssh on a
bunch of different servers in parallel
so what we do for Erlang so all of our
development happens on these mac laptops
and but we deployed a red hat hmm so we
have build servers out in the dcs and
whenever we get ready to deploy our
script will head out to the DC and build
the release right so we use rebar do the
rebar generate build release package and
then we use rsync to sink that on to all
of the all of the nodes that need that
release and we have a heartbeat
monitoring turned on so basically we
just killed a pit and the heartbeat
monitor brings it back up we can get
away with that right now because there
are certain maintenance windows within
Rackspace where everything shuts down so
if if our API goes down for you know two
seconds while while the vm reboots
nobody cares we're actually working on
so kind of like the next generation of
this we do weekly releases of the
production code and release to staging
multiple times per day we're actually
looking at doing the actual full OTP
release process so that we can update
the API nodes without taking them down
and we're still working that out any
more questions alright guys i'm on the
internet
