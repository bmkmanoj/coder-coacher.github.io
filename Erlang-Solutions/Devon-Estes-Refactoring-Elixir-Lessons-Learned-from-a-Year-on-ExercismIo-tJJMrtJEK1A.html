not German I'm American I lived there
for a couple years now I write software
for a living and as a cigar dear my name
is Devin that's sort of all the
interesting stuff about me if you want
to know more I'm on the Internet and
today we're here to talk about
refactoring so refactoring is one of my
favorite things to do with code actually
I love refactoring it makes me feel good
inside but there are probably some
people in the audience that may not know
exactly what refactoring is so let's get
a definition out of the way so this is
Martin Fowler Martin Fowler literally
wrote the book on refactor given he
wrote the book in an object-oriented
context but refactoring this is his
definition it's a pretty simple
definition I actually have a slightly
more general definition for me anytime I
am changing my code without changing my
test
that's refactoring I think anytime I'm
changing the source code without
changing the visible behavior of my
application that's refactoring doing the
same thing just in a different way now
you might be thinking yourself seven why
would you change your code without
adding a new feature or fixing above
what's the point isn't that a weight but
it's not a waste there are valid reasons
to refactor one of them one of my
favorites is to increase the ability to
read or understand your code to
comprehend it as a human source code
communicates to two different places it
communicates to the computer to tell it
what to do but it also communicates to
other readers of your code other people
that might have to maintain it in the
future including yourself in the future
if you're anything like me if I wrote
code six months ago and I have to look
at it again it might as well be the
first time I've ever seen it so being
able to read and understand code is very
important and a good reason to refactor
people also refactor to make your code
easier to change now this is something
that is a big thing in the
object-oriented world where there are
complicated design patterns and things
it's something we don't have to think
that much about in elixir because as a
functional language there's very loose
coupling between elements in between
objects between functions I shouldn't
even say objects but between things so
they're having to refactor your code to
make it easier to change isn't that
much of a reason to refactor an elixir
but it is still something you also
refactor to lower complexity
so again if you're anything like me
sometimes at the end of the day you're
working on a feature and you can't think
of that really good way to do it so you
just do whatever comes into your head
and you make your test pass when you're
fine and then the next morning in the
shower you're not thinking about
anything and like the really elegant
implementation just pops into your head
so that you can go back into work and
you can refactor your code to utilize
that new better simpler easier to
understand implementation and then you
can also refactor to increase
performance now this one comes with an
asterisk because some people don't think
that that is refactoring by decreasing
for example a page load from five
seconds to one second you're changing
the visible behavior of your application
but to me you haven't changed the
correctness of your application when I
refactor for performance I'm not
changing my test so to me that's still
refactoring I understand that for some
folks that doesn't really fit but it's
something we're going to talk about in
our discussion today of why we would
refactoring and comparing different
refactorings that we're going to do and
also in today because having to refactor
to change your code isn't necessarily as
important in elixir or another
functional languages we're just going to
ignore that so these are going to be the
three things that we're going to look at
today when we're evaluating these
refactorings that we're going to do now
in general all of these things are
around trying to make code better but
better I think always has to come with a
qualitative occation you can't just say
something is better because it is you
have to be able to measure it and you
have to be able to compare ways in which
something is better and frequently there
are trade-offs that we have to make so
we're going to go on a journey today all
of us together we are going to explore
some implementations of some toy
problems on a site called
Exorcism dot IO and on that site there
are the toy problems that everyone can
solve and it's a really really wonderful
thing to look at when you're looking at
things in a refactoring way and again
for those of you that may not be
familiar with Exorcism this is a sort of
brief definition of what
statistic is and that's Katrina Owen who
started the project several years ago
she's really well-known in the the Ruby
and NGO communities and is a wonderful
maintainer of open-source now Exorcism
is particularly good for looking at what
we're doing today I think because these
numbers you see on the right are all of
the numbers of different implementations
of some of these little toy problems
some people might call them Coty's or
exercises hence the name Exorcism that's
sort of the joke there but nowhere else
to my knowledge can you see hundreds or
thousands of different implementations
of the same problem it's really
beneficial to read other people's source
code but frequently for me at least when
I'm reading someone else's source code a
good half of the time if not more is
spent just understanding the problem
with their solving understanding the
domain and not necessarily seeing how
they're solving it being able to compare
that to other solutions to the same
problem now for me this is a really
really interesting way to collect data
and to see how people are solving
different problems in the same way so
we're going to go through some of these
problems and we'll start with a very
important one binary search it's
important because it's on all of our our
tech interviews and we all have to wait
for it to get a job right yeah that's
the only time you're ever going to use
it but we're going to look at an
implementation today a couple
implementations we'll do some
refactoring so for those of you that
aren't familiar with binary search we'll
go over sort of what it is in quickly so
this is as big as my code is going to be
if you're having trouble reading it way
in the back there are seats up front if
you want to come up so binary search is
a recursive search algorithm so
basically what we have here is we have
our search function and take some items
in the case of this particular
implementation those items are a tuple
of integers and then we have a value
that we're looking for and because it's
recursive we're going to have to do some
sort of recursion and we're going to
define a new private function search for
search I already for and the way binary
search basically works is every time you
you take the element in the middle it's
a sorted collection so you take the
element in the middle and you compare
that element in the middle to the thing
you're looking for and if that element
in the middle is bigger than the element
you're looking for then you know you can
recur Segen but this time only caring
about the bottom half of that collection
likewise if the element in the middle is
smaller than the thing you're looking
for you can recur Segen but you know
that you only have to care about what's
in the top half of the collection so
each time you're going through the
search you're having your search area
and that's what makes it a particularly
fast search algorithm for any sorted
sorted collection so you see here we
need to first define our beginning so
that's the very bottom and the very top
and that's our search area and then we
need to find that middle index and that
middle element so that we can compare
that middle element to the value we're
searching for and then we have a common
statement and because this is a
recursive algorithm we need some base
cases to end that recursion so if the
bottom index is top greater than the top
index that we're looking at we know that
the elements that we're looking at is
not in that collection so we can return
that not found Atem
likewise if the middle element equals
the value of congratulations you've
you've found your your index which is
what we're looking for in this case so
we can return that tuple with okay and
the middle index and then we have our
recursion cases so again if the middle
element is less than the value we're
searching for we searched again this
time only carrying about what's in the
top hat and otherwise we can search
again only caring about what's in the
bottom so that's binary search and this
is a pretty simple implementation I like
this implementation but there's one
quick way I think we can make it better
white space white space is your friend
elixir has a lot of flexibility with
their use of white space we can use
white space to increase comprehension
and for me this makes it a lot easier to
comprehend your mileage may vary of
course but white space is a good thing
now there's another way we can implement
this exact same algorithm in a way that
some people might consider a little bit
more idiomatic elixir you leveraging
some of the things that are unique to a
lecture and powerful an elixir so let's
look at that that refactor so we start
with the same same beginning the same
search arity - when
we define that search area for the exact
same as before but now as you've seen in
that third line in that in function
we're replacing that com statement with
a new function and we're pretty much
replacing a con statement with pattern
matching and and with guard clauses and
we can go through again that's our first
base case if we found the element we can
return that tuple if the bottom is
greater than the top we can just return
that atom and then same thing here we
can either just look at the top half or
the bottom half of the collection as
we're accurse you know what if we're
going to go this route to be consistent
we might as well do this too right we
might as well just pull looking for that
middle index and that middle element out
into their own functions too now this
this is a different implementation very
similar same same algorithm just a
different implementation and there are
pros and cons to these implementations
because I like to have numbers for
things we're going to benchmark things
just to see what happens these two
implementations and to do those
benchmarking
today we're going to use a tool called
Ben Chi written by another Berliner to
bias-ply for it's a wonderful tool I
encourage you all to use it if you
needed for your benchmarking needs and
I'm just going to show you one example
of these benchmarks just so you have an
idea of what they look like we're not
going to look at the other benchmarks as
well if you want to see those later all
the code will be on github but basically
to do these benchmarks we define a
function and that function is going to
accept a module because we have those
two implementations defined in two
different modules we can pass them in to
this function and and then we're going
to do some searching and we'll see how
many times it can do this in a given
amount of time and then the actual setup
for the benchmark looks like that you
just give it a map with the things
you're going to benchmark and see we use
that that bench bunk and we pass in the
modules as we've defined and then we're
going to run each function for ten
seconds each which is nice nice long
time to benchmark there's also some warm
up in there so that that's taken into
account and then here's what we get so
I'll be honest this surprised me because
when I came to elixir
I heard pattern-matching is fat use a
turn action it's one of the great things
about elixir but functionally it's kind
of the same speed as a calm statement
that's a big surprise to me and it might
be to some of you as well and now
because I like to make charts and graphs
keep my my head together we're going to
do that we're going to run down the pros
and cons of each implementation and see
if we can find one that's right for us
so for readability I prefer the con
statement having those four cases next
to each other helps me understand the
algorithm a little bit better for
complexity the same algorithm you know
it isn't that hard to understand the
same implementation so to me that's
that's even and for performance that's
pretty much even as well but when we
take a step back and we view our
implementations across multiple things
to try and have a holistic comparison of
these two implementations these two
refactorings of the same problem that
helps us define something that is a
little better rather than just for
example for me readability is very
important so I have a tendency to
overcompensate for things that are
readable the things that might be a
little bit more complex or things that
might be a little less performant so I
encourage you to take a holistic view of
what you're doing when you refactor
so let's look at another pretty simple
and this one's even simpler than binary
search so this one's called space age
and in this you need to define a
function that accepts a number of
seconds to say how long you've been
alive and you need to tell how many
years old someone would be on all of the
planets in our solar system so because
each planet takes a little bit longer or
shorter to go around the Sun the year
lengths are a little different so if
you're ten thousand seconds old on Earth
you have more years than if you were
living on Jupiter so here's again the
basic implementation so we have a little
map that's functioning like a lookup for
us and those numbers there are our
coefficients to tell us how many how
relative the year is two an earth year
so earth is one and then everything else
is relative to her and then we do a
little bit of math so we take the second
and then we do our coefficient lookup
with that magic number there and this is
pretty simple this isn't bad but I think
we can do one better
couple things better actually the first
thing we can do is to give a name to
that magic number a very important
reason to refactor is to name things to
name concepts that become clear in your
code as you're developing them sometimes
upfront we don't know all of the things
that we're going to be dealing with and
as we work with our code we develop more
a deeper understanding of the domain
that we're working in and the problems
we're trying to solve and refactoring to
name those concepts is very helpful and
while we're naming things and pulling
out things that are constant into module
module module attributes let's pull that
map out as well and we'll name that
something better than just a lookup
something a little bit more descriptive
and now this isn't bad we've done some
too good refactorings to name two
concepts that were previously in our
code but weren't named very well but
there's another way to essentially look
up a value based on given key and it's a
little tricky it doesn't it doesn't feel
natural for someone like me who came
from Ruby it feels a little strange can
anyone guess with that might be pattern
matching
so this functions exactly the same way
we're looking up a value based on a
given atom but there's some benefits to
this so when we benchmark we see that
the map workup is almost twice as slow
as the pattern matcher again this was a
huge surprise to me coming from Ruby
where a hash lookup is just about one of
the fastest operations you can do to see
how optimize pattern matching is in this
case and comparatively how slow looking
something up in a map is that was a
revelation to me that's going to change
how I create elixir code in the future
but I think we can actually do ourselves
one better so all of that math that was
done in the body of those functions we
can use macros to basically do that math
once at compile time and now we're still
readable we still see what's going on
but we're getting another little
performance boost it's a very small
difference that has a significant input
that's the whole deal with refactoring
small little things that are too small
to matter but they all add up to be
significantly effective and that when we
benchmark these that's another
significant little performance benefit
so now we have an implementation that's
twice as fast as a lookup in a map and
the other thing that really jumped out
at me as a lesson I learned from this
exercise was to look for things that are
constant and to try and use avoid
unnecessary computation I mean that's
just a great rule in general but to use
the compiler to help you deal with
things that are constant in a more
performant manner so let's again let's
let's look at our chart so the
readability I think are all about the
same it's a very simple algorithm it's a
very readable and understandable thing
complexity again it's just about the
same but the difference here is in
performance that macro version is
significantly faster like with no other
real trade-offs so this is a rare case
of where something is just better in my
opinion and now I'm gonna have some
water and while I do that you can look
at cheetahs
okay next one this is a problem called
allergies the gist of this problem is
that you take an allergy test and the
result of that allergy test come back as
a number and that number will tell you
what you're allergic to so be alert if
your number scores one and you're
allergic to
for example egg if your score is two
you're allergic to peanut your score is
three then you're allergic to eggs and
peanuts so let's look at an
implementation a little bit further so
first we need to be able to say am i
allergic to a given thing so you give
the number and then the thing that
you're looking for and you're seeing if
the item that we're looking for is in a
list of the flag but we need to make
that list and here's how we can do that
so we take the flags and I'm sure some
of you may have seen looking at those
numbers those are binary numbers we can
use binary to see basically it's a bit
is turned on or off and that can help us
tell us what we're lurk to so we use the
integer digits with that two to give us
the digits in a binary representation
and then we reverse it because of course
the map that we have there is in human
readable order from lowest to highest
but in binary it's reversed so we need
to reverse those digits to map up with
the map because we're going to zip them
together and then we do a reduce we use
a nice anonymous function with the
multiple function heads to the pattern
match there and if the bit is turned on
if we have a 1 then we know we can add
that allergy to our accumulator
otherwise we just move on
and now that's pretty good I'm I'm
generally pretty happy with this I would
push that code to production but we can
do a little better I think so we're
going to keep this map the same and
we're going to keep this function the
same - I actually really like this
function I think it's really descriptive
it tells us what's going on it reads
pretty much in English which as a native
English speaker makes me happy but
here's where we start changing things so
that list function we can also do a
filter map that's built into the
standard library but the advantage I
think here is we get to name another
function other--
idea we have that flagged a flagged
question mark I say flagged a because
it's fun to make fun of Canadians so we
have that flagged a function and that
will filter just the ones they are
flagged and then we can reduce based on
what we have back from the filtering and
now that flagged a function this is
where things get a little tricky this is
the trade off we're making we've named
another concept and this will probably
be faster but who knows what those three
ampersands are doing yeah not a ton of
people so I know again for me coming
from Ruby it's a pretty high level of
abstraction and very rarely do we need
to think on a bitwise level but that's a
bitwise operator as you see from that
use statement up top what that's doing
is a bitwise and so it's comparing two
integers and comparing each bit in those
integers and if they're both turned on
then it will be it will pass through as
true so one and one is true one and zero
it's false zero and zero volts and
that's what's happening there now we
have the trade-off of using a slightly
more low-level
function but we've also given a
descriptive name so in my book that's a
win because if you're touching this code
again you may not even have to know what
those three ampersands are because you
know what the function is doing because
we've given it a good descriptive thing
but I think we can do one better still
or maybe better different at least so we
start again and again because I like
that function we're going to keep it but
now we're going to do a little recursion
and before I continue I'm going to tell
you in advance that what we're doing is
a reduced function
it's just reduced now who knows what
those lower then less than less than
greater than greater than anything
around the flags do but again that's
turning stuff into a binary so binary
representation because we have those
binary numbers and now we can pattern
match on that binary so if the first
bits turned on we're allergic to cat if
the second bits turned on we're allergic
to pollen if the rest of them are turned
on or the third bits turned on we're
allergic to chocolate and so on down the
line and then of course
have our base case now who here can read
this this is sort of what my mind looks
like there feels like any time I need to
deal with binary pattern matching it it
gets me really confused because it's a
little tricky to comprehend them to
parse visually but now who can see the
pattern so the first we have one seven
and then we have one one six and then
two one five all the way down the line
comes a little bit more clear when you
mess around with some some colors and
some some shading to see the pattern
there it's a little hard to see that
pattern normally but there is a reason
to do this it's really fast again
pattern matching is really bad I I again
was not expecting this level of
difference between you know I thought
when I saw the the bit shifting
implementation that would be just about
as fast as it gets with the the bitwise
implementation because that's a very
very fast operation but because there
are other parts in that algorithm and
because there are other things that we
need to do it's a little slower than
this pattern matching the pattern
matching is actually a very simple
algorithm it's just a little dense to
read so let's compare now for
readability I really liked the bit
shifting version I like that we've named
the extra concepts I'd like that it's a
shorter implementation sometimes that's
a lot easier to deal with complexity I
also agree that the bit shifting one is
a little less complex there are fewer
operations that we're doing it's a
little easier to understand but for
performance that's the big difference if
you have done some some profiling and
you found that this is a hot path in
your code and this is something that
you're spending a lot of time on you
might need to make that trade-off of
readability and complexity for
performance that's a very very common
trade-off that we have to make but I
think it's important to know the
trade-offs that you're making and the
extent to which you need to make that
trade-off that's why benchmarking and
profiling is very important
but really what's the point of all that
we've gone over tonight we've seen that
white white spaces your friends the
pattern matching is fast that bitwise
operators can do cool things but there's
another thing that I saw in going
through all of these exercises in
exorcisms I oh and I think there's one
general reason that people make less
than optimal decision and I don't want
to take bad decisions because I don't
really think there's a bad decision it's
all about trade-offs and but sometimes
there are easy wins that we can do that
people don't make and I was thinking why
why would they do that why would they
write something that's a little slower
when you can just as easily write
something that's faster and I think
there's one reason that this happens and
to illustrate this this is where this
talk takes a kind of strange left turn
and I'm going to need to to helpers to
come up so olih in the lab come on up
and we're gonna do sort of a little
little place for you guys so in this
example a live constant here in the lab
and over here in this example Ola and I
are on a team together and you know
we're working on our stuff individually
and he has something that he needs to do
to the code and depending on what he
chooses there may be consequences to
those decisions okay so again right so
if depending on the hands that will it
takes there may be consequences he needs
to get this nice shiny gyro that's his
his job did you get fine miss gyro and
it's going to be in one of my two hands
so he has a 50-50 shot chance of finding
the gyro but he has a decision to make
left-hander right so oleh which hand
would you choose nope okay so I'll try
again okay thanks nope let's try again
fifty/fifty you can't go on that long
okay dragon go now because all they
chose the right hand allowed punched me
that caused me pain but he didn't know
did you you didn't know that was gonna
happen
yeah now that you know by choosing the
right hand that's going to cause me pain
would you ever choose the right hand
again yes do you get the year no cos
euros works thank you for helping so
that's the little weird thing allowed
well thank you very much let's give them
a hand for helping so in general people
make the best decisions they can with
the knowledge available to them at the
time now this is actually really well
known problem in economics it's a
problem called the imperfect information
or the imperfect knowledge problem and
it basically means that if someone
doesn't have all of the knowledge they
need in order to make a decision of the
the benefits and the consequences of
that decision but it's impossible for
them to actually make the best decision
and the way to solve this is by sharing
more information and a particularly
great field part of economics I think is
a field of study called behavioral
economics and that field of study was
pretty much started by a man named
Richard Saylor and wouldn't you know it
he's written a book well co-written the
book with Cass Sunstein now in this book
as you can see they talk about nudges
and the way they define a nudge is it's
any anything you can do that will
influence someone's decisions we as
software engineers have a lot of power
to influence people's decisions both in
the design of our applications but also
in the choices we make when we code we
can influence our decisions in the
future we can influence our co-workers
decisions we can have a lot of influence
I think it's time that we do a little
bit more nudging so the first thing is
to lead by example if there are any of
you in the room who happens to be
maintainer Zoar contributors to any
popular languages or frameworks I know
when I have a question about how to do
something in a liquor the right way the
first place I go is to the Elektra
source code or to the Phoenix source
code or to the cradle source code or the
Benji source code code written by people
I think are doing good things you know
people I respect and that's how we
propagate ideas throughout a community
we lead by example if we do something if
you happen to be in a position of
influence your decisions will have
impact in the rest of the community so
keeping that in mind it's very important
when you're trying to ship a bug-fix
late at night and you think oh I'll just
do this this hacky little workaround and
it'll be fine
yeah it will probably be fine but it
could also influence the way that we all
write code and that also matters within
your teams if you have junior developers
on your team or people that are new to
elixir even the way that some people may
design or write code is going to
influence the rest of your team's
behavior so lead by example it's a very
important thing to do also talk more
about your mistakes we all like to talk
about our successes because that makes
us feel good but it's great to learn
from other people's mistakes there's no
reason that we all have to keep making
the same mistakes over and over as a
community when one person makes a
mistake and learns that this is maybe
not a great way to do something you can
share that knowledge with the rest of
the community and then we all don't have
to keep bumping our head up against the
same wall now because I'm putting my
money where my mouth is starting today
there's a new repo on github
called fast elixir on my github so I as
I mentioned came from the Ruby community
and in Ruby there's a very similar thing
called fast Ruby which shares some
common idioms in Ruby and shows you some
benchmarks to show which is faster or
slower lots of those before I had seen
them I never knew I never knew which one
was faster or slower and after you see
it you don't make that mistake again so
I would like all of us as a community to
start sharing that information there are
two examples up right now that we've
actually seen today well one that we've
seen today one that about i/o lists and
how there
faster than string concatenation which
for all of you Phoenix folks you know
that's where a lot of your speed comes
from so if all of you who have far more
production experience with elixir than I
do hopefully have things to share this
is a place that it would be great to
share them pull requests are very much
accepted and welcomed and then the last
thing is more and better tooling one of
the reasons that I was so excited about
coming to a licks er was because tooling
was at the center of the language and I
believe that tooling is a very important
part of a language but I think we can do
a little bit better we have more road to
go down now some of you may have noticed
that I played a little trick on y'all
with some of the code examples we have
seen for different but completely valid
ways of defining a function and we have
seen three different but completely
valid ways of using the pipeline
operator and those are just the
beginning of the ways in which I was
extremely inconsistent trust me that was
by design I was not just being lazy part
of that came out of me trying to think
of the one right way to format the slide
when I decided to just say forget it and
go a totally different way and I did
some research over the last couple
months about formatting and I found this
study which is one of the better studies
I found by two researchers at the
University of Oregon and it's kind of an
old study it goes back to 1991 but it
made me think that maybe formatting
doesn't matter maybe all of those
discussions that we have are not the
best use of our time now I like to
prefix some of my more controversial
ideas with this I like to think of it as
like the MIT license of ideas but don't
make me think about formatting its 2017
there are more important things that we
can spend our mental cycles thinking
about more important problems to solve
just let it tool do it for me and then I
was actually really happy to see this in
this morning's keynote so I'm happy that
it looks like this tool might might come
into existence hopefully but there is a
good amount more that we can doing
tooling as well I'm a big fan of
the tooling that we have and I think we
can do more Kratos a wonderful project I
I think we can do a lot with that and
it's done in a very empathetic kind way
which is a great difference from some of
the other static checkers out there but
yeah tooling is something that I think
we can do better at but we also need a
definition of complexity that works that
you may notice of the three things that
we looked at if we remove formatting as
as a thing to care about and then we can
benchmark performance then the only
thing that we need a number for is
complexity and complexity is really
difficult to understand in functional
programming because really all we have
the ABC complexity of the cyclomatic
complexity of a given function because
that's our unit but in a lick sir
especially I think that's not exactly an
accurate representation of complexity
when you have pattern matching and you
have ten clauses that's syntactic there
that's semantically the same thing as a
case statement we it's a tough problem
to solve but I'm confident that we as a
community can solve it and have
something at least some baseline that we
can use as a solid measure so that's
sort of my the end of the rant about
that part of the talk so that's it for
me today if you're wondering why I put
so many Sheba's in my slides that's my
Shiva
Miki when she was a little puppy she's
much bigger now but she does still like
to lick my beard for some reason so
that's it for me today look let's have
some questions
so didn't have any questions
hi thank you for the talk just out of
curiosity
have you tried refactoring the last
version the binary pattern matching
version of the Aled Lee's example and
make it just a news macros to make it
readable but just as first at compile
time and does it work I haven't that is
something that I thought of doing and I
actually I was speaking someone last
night and apparently there is a existing
library that kind of does that that
they'd fooled around with I forget the
name of it but that was another thing
that I think you know the binary pattern
matching is one of I think the stronger
feature is in elixir to be able to
pattern match at that level but it's
also one of the biggest it's one of the
hardest things in the language to read
so some sort of macro that would
encompass all of that behavior would be
incredible I mean I would love to see
more of that I it's something that I
would love to dive a little bit deeper
into because I think as a language we
could maybe have a more user friendly
API for that like a more user friendly
way of defining those but no I hadn't
tried that it something I thought about
but didn't really have time for this
Thanks yeah there's a good question and
thanks to your email for sponsoring
again does anyone else have a question
if you just raise your hand I can pop
over going once going twice
alright chance well thanks so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
