why we went through the trouble making
this what exactly it is how to use it
and with the invitation looks like and
then I would this plugin freak work for
us this is the two things we do we need
a plugin framework plugin based on
leveldb the plugin framework is you
don't stop from scratch earlier could be
an answer experimental work with a
framework as a back end tunisia to be
you back ends
so why did we choose leveldb we may
order the most trustworthy choice 17 we
also both person use it seem to be well
tested and there is well tested Adam
binding probation also and this is it
taste that was very well to align the
two initiative was it's icky very sore
so what this level ed and TV is library
Google Ricky back east or implements a
segment and it stores everything on this
water wouldn't set
vocalizations it can support feeding
searches first part of the key is this
much we only have to move so we got
parties for starters getting it going
was really really easy you just call
this register function and then we
already have kind of a framework for any
time in exchange I changed to a table
indonesia it propagates those out to
your tables immediately but just on the
next restart or even so i decide to
change a few places which specify the
table type and switch it to below the DB
table type and then you can just use
your standard nisha functions as you
expect which is really the most
important part in most useful part so
even if leg the performance is a little
bit worse the major values you don't
have to do anything to get all these
other benefits of starting time if if
that's what it gives you so for initial
testing I just did are we have a common
test suite takes a reason a lot of time
to run but it just sort of tells you
that everything you expect to work
actually did work and then once we got
through that we use bachelor bench using
a live data we can just pump power logs
through it and check the output texture
it's the same or make sure that there's
no new errors and stuff like that so
start with a subset of the data and then
you migrated almost all of our data over
for real live big test and so the
experience the good parts are the
application from our testing respond
the same the performance had the same
profile same basic characteristics it
wasn't a slower by any usable measurable
way we are first attempt to reduce
startup time by a fourth and that
doesn't sound like much but the main
problem is we have this really big bag
table that takes forever startup and
we're working on my video and once
that's gone we're pretty sure we'll get
either a pretty confident again half
start time or better and um yes I lost
data bags it's not a good idea it's just
it'll ruin your day oh and also
importantly we reduced our startup
memory by two-thirds it's a lovely view
does this caching layer and once you
start actually voting request through
and doing gets and all that the cash
fills up so you can end up in abusing a
more ram but the it doesn't have to load
much of them all in the first start
which is really nice so it's loading
stuff and then the migration was really
really easy like I said I do is change
the table type and then the plug-in for
app and has bring you into that new
table type that the plug-in represents
and it's also really nice for testing
because you can have machines with a lot
less resources for all your testing and
then why you actually want to a real
test who's bringing up on your real
hardware and then see who works but with
a smaller data set I was able to get
that down to about half the size with
much smaller so I could just run it on a
desktop
really nice now that I'm saying like
anything this is as far as I know which
better be true is for the only one using
this right now which means it's
completely unproven so far it's been
very stable for us though but we haven't
really tried to push a lot of data to
the voltage been doing performance
testing here and then so it could be
unstable in ways we don't know oh and
implementing a plug-in is a bit messy
but this is just sort of getting changes
into the minutiae code that exists me to
code is someone messing places so you
have to kind of a decision whether you
want to have something that performs
well or you really want purity there and
performance your datastore seems like a
good trade-off the other problem is w.e
has terrible re tons on diluted keys for
the initial on our common test suite
each test will add a bunch of data then
delete at the end and then reread those
keys later on another test something
like that and our common tests we ran
about 30 x slower and it took a long
time to figure out by and it turned out
because the first one right normal speed
and then the next it delete all skis and
the next one controlling slower and so
on so perilous is fixed in the current
version even local DB which we aren't
using but we fixed it by instead of
actually deleting things we just have we
wrap every single entry up that we store
in a tough old that has like an active
true or false on it and then a delete is
just staying active defaults of
migrating out of LGBT is not so easy you
can't just do it change copy type
we copy everything to another table make
sure it's correct and then delete the
old table and then rename it and that's
not super hard anything like that but it
certainly is something to be concerned
about if you are moving to one of these
plugins and the level DVD raw speed is a
little bit less than that but for what
we how we use the data store it is not
that big of a deal but its robust though
so you get the same so honest every
single time and if I you've seen the
keep video from the row about them
scaling react they talk about a level TV
the idea is there is level soy-based or
and the more data you get in there the
more levels ahead each level is another
directory point and they talk about how
each time there we've got more data in
there a level went up and then that add
about 15 microseconds or something to
their latency and we did not experience
that mainly I think because they're
running on bc2 running on real hardware
so we don't have the i/o obstacles that
they do on you see too but we didn't
notice any issue with a little TV the
way it stores data and then just some
little cabinets searching a key that
starts with a wild card could it oh well
it will iterate your entire table space
your key space in it and it is possible
that iterating a whole table might
destroy your little to be cash so if you
do that on the live system for example
you could be running very slow for a
little while until every piece so I
suggest against doing that and some of
the semantics were changed or new Jonas
so for example if you want to get all
the nodes that have a certain copy type
you do table info and then they will
take
and then the copies are interested in
and if you create that table before you
add this plugin your leveldb copy type
won't exist and your table info call the
thing don't think i can say but very big
there is also an option in the novel TV
you actually prevent it from blowing out
there yeah so what so it depends on your
how you choose to iterate the table and
that's not an option that we can use
because you either have to it's either
on or off all the time because the
minutiae interstate interface itself
doesn't have a way to say when I want to
iterate this past these options to the
backend to decide how to iterate it so
you're stuck with you there being all
the time off all the time I don't think
so roll might have a better idea but the
interface itself is defined by Monisha
and your kind of the plug-in framework
is way below that so you don't really
have a good place to pass information I
was just thinking about the theater I
hope my name is dizzy I helped write the
local TV stuff and not being able to
pass that option and you see much better
performance if you could pass options in
when you do the iteration okay so okay
if that's not in the plug-in framework
it might be useful to add it easy
anything else thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
