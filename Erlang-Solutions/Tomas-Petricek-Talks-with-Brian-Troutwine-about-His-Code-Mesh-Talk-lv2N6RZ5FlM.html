my name is Tomas pathetic I'm doing
quite a few different items so doing a
lot of f-sharp programming can are part
of the F Starworks
consulting where we do trainings I'm
also a researcher so I worked in the
alan turing institute on the transfers
data science making data access for
trans friends and my most recent
interest that is relevant for the
conference is history and some of the
programming could you could you describe
what you talked about yeah so I did a
talk the title is would aliens
understand of the calculus and it's sort
of a covered cover-up for talking about
about history and philosophy of
mathematics pingos when you say with
aliens understand other calculus how do
you go about answering that's true it
can be like well yes
Monda calculus this eternal truth so
obviously aliens we find it yeah but
that's the sort of like platanus as
philosophers of mathematics with tell
you so I talk about a couple of ideas
that we used to look at this with some
more rigorous methods yeah
would aliens understand like a
calculator well so the one the one thing
that I sort of referred to is this idea
of embodied by a bloated combat
cognition where basically the only way
you can understand mathematics is by
looking at how we do mathematics with
our brains and it turns out that a lot
of the mathematics we do is really sort
of arises from dealing with real stuff
in the world so for example numbers you
can understand them as collections of
objects and there is actually some
scientific evidence that we do it we
construct metaphors and so what I was
talking about this sort of partly would
could be the physical constraints or
having something like London and there's
a couple of things so one is you need to
have all sort of set theory and logic is
grounded in what they call a container
schema where like if I have something in
my head and I put my hand in my pocket
then the thing that I had in my hand is
in my pocket
sure and that's like a physical
experience that we used to understand
SATs and mathematics so you need to have
some sort of boundary and I I had a
bunch of different aliens and people can
watch the commonalities learn about all
of them but if you have aliens that sort
of live in a very chaotic game series
universe where maybe for if you're
floating freely
in some chaos though you wouldn't really
have this nest near boundaries like you
can't say something is inside sure or if
you if you watch the movie arrival and
the aliens there they have the sort of
circular language which changes their
perception and in the movie is sort of
fun because of the changes their their
perception of time but they don't have
this direction of the day and then yeah
in London calculus that's what we used
for a reduction so when you have fun
evaluation or reduction that has this
digress so if you didn't have direction
well then maybe you wouldn't
sure if you could you speak about the
data science yes that no transparent
that what we mean yeah well say that the
sort of core idea there is that when you
see chart in online newspapers if it's
if it's a reputable source then they'll
tell you source the World Bank but you
can't really reproduce it on this you're
pretty good programmer typically so the
idea is to build some tools that would
make it really really easy to grab some
data from some data source do basic
transformations and that the
visualization in the page together with
them with a fully reproducible strength
and it's it's poorly sort of motivated
or inspired by high providers in Apsara
which is this really nice way word
accessing the dime and writing simple
code to just very trivial trivial things
you know I've been working on a project
called the gamma and in fact you can
find it online that implements similar
idea in a browser so you can use it as a
JavaScript package that's just for the
Jews and then
can run these little scripts that embed
to produce visualizations and can let
readers edit them as well yeah as well
thank you very much for talking with me
thanks I was a pleasure yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
