fire fossa chancing much more dramatic
thank you for thank you all for
attending this is very exciting
hello Joe introduce yourself so if you
could just give us your name and then
your and then answer please the
following question dog person cat person
or other person well to start with I'm a
dog person in fact I have got a dog
website as well whatever nowadays I'd
advise anyone trying to nice website not
to do it in airline and not to do it in
WordPress both of them are equally
horrible not the airline says it's such
for the airline websites but I
definitely don't person and my role
basically was that I started the
Buddhist science lab at the same time as
biana was a person starting it and my
role is basically thinking about what
the requirements were what needed to be
done and then I
was the person who thought about the sea
wire which we can talk about the
simulator
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm a cat person
I've got two cats Daisy the bipolar cat
and a very scared cat and Mike conned me
into joining the computer science lab
and the onon might gave me some problems
to solve I started looking at how we
could program telephony and this things
were kind of blossomed out of control
well Mike and I and two other guys
started the computer science lab that is
we went to the CTO of Ericsson and
suggested a computer science lab because
there were soldiering labs and chemistry
labs and all sorts of labs and we
thought most designed they dealt with
programming so wise they had no computer
science lab so we suggested that yes we
could do it and and we were given
permission to it I think that was in
1980 Ericsson must have had some money
to spare or something those were
generous times or something like that
and in 1984 it became sort of a formal
unit not just four or five hackers there
are a few others like pal had London
others who were were along at that time
as well and I think I might be a sort of
I don't know birds of prey person Oh
kite or a buzzard or something I I
should say I should say one thing more
about Joe because Mike and I we were old
sort of Ericsson people and Joe came
from outside and if Mike and I and
others had
then the Harlan manual would have become
an internal Erickson report like some
other languages and Josiah ever why not
try to book and have prentice-hall
printed and that was sort of stepping
outside the box let's just answer the
question I've always had whose idea was
to write the book we waited 14 years
after the developed probably a dog
person but doesn't really matter I mean
if I if I was to have a dog I'd be a dog
person for us to have a cat I'd be a cat
person it just
I am I like implementing things and
writing stuff that's really what my my
posture the whole thing for unlucky for
many things and with if it's a telecom
system or something else it's one I was
my name is Jane Jane wallet
I joined airline systems in order to
sell the airline to other companies just
after the summer one year and within two
months the use of airline was within
Ericsson was banned and that made it
rather difficult to sell it outside the
company there was a man in the CSF named
Hulk on me root who's not sitting here
who persuaded me that there is something
called open source we really ought to
make it open source and he gave me some
stuff to read this hey that's a good
idea
so I persuaded Erickson's management to
do that and then I was one of the twelve
founders of blue tail I think the only
real businessperson of the 12 founders
of boom - I said something earlier today
which it turned out people didn't know
I was at a dinner with a woman called
Sarah Mizzou who is chief of research at
Ericsson really very impressive person
and she took me to one side and said I
want you to know that I think that
making Ericsson open source was probably
a mistake because it could have been
Erickson's major competitive advantage
okay this is the head of research at
Eric's and she's as far as I know she's
still the head of researchers in our Sun
I don't you know what these things
change but I think so then it's not that
long ago so I want you to also know that
that there is a high level support for
airline within Ericsson okay excuse me
yeah I have two dogs they run my life
we their bird dogs and life has changed
a lot since we got them hmm excellent so
getting into this so I want to structure
this roughly chronologically and in I've
read a few times now Joe's history and
Byron's history and there's a lot of
detail there but there's a lot of
backstory that I'd like to explore and
one of those is what the ingredients
that went into the computer science
laboratory both technically and then
within the team so I want to ask this as
sort of as a two-sided question I want
to go all the way back to a ke on it I
want to just the lessons that were
learned from that experience which then
fed into the ax Ian flex and then then
you came along that formed a lab to look
at solving problems that had sort of
accumulated but you also accumulated a
lot of internal DNA's you sort of
collective wisdom about how to do these
things I'd like just to give an open
forum to talk about those things both
technically and then what you would have
brought to that equation so this is kind
of open-ended to start things with Joe
would you like to start with that no I
don't know anything about Michael beyond
how to talk about education
well the a ke was the pure honor to ax e
it was a system before one realized that
computers very expensive and it was a
system with the distributed system
programmed in assembly language with a
number of processors
running on number of processes number of
memory units which is separate from the
processes actually assessing him along
bus and it had a lot of advantages that
it was one of the first what we call SPC
which restored program controls systems
it had a lot of disadvantages one of
them it was horrendously difficult to
program because everything was done in
assembly language and a lot of pointer
errors and this sort of thing
Along Came a guy and when they decided
to make a new system because they could
make it simply didn't have enough
capacity to make local exchanges they
decided to make a system called ax e the
I could defend a long time he's telling
what these abbreviation stands but if
you want to know now the ax e were
really designed by a guy whose name is
largely forgotten called your own hem
doll urine was brilliant
he designed the hard way he designed the
software he designed the programming
language he did the bloody lot and
without a urine hem doll I think I could
reasonably say that Erickson wouldn't
exist today he realized that he had to
have large number of processes he called
them regional processes and he made a
central processor to coordinate all
these things and he designed the
language called Plex to get together
with another guy called who like the
back team who wrote the first complex
compiler in in Fortran it was brilliant
architecture because he was the only
person I know that actually did what
would you call memory management in
Hardware all memory management was done
in hardware and you could relocate data
you could reboot you could by changing
pointers in there in a separate Hardware
control unit it was cut control memory
IANA probably can tell you more about
that and I can that he he could actually
do everything which airline could do
today about him producing code the
changing code on the fly now it had it
was very good and he made a lot of money
the time that Joe was talking about that
Eric's now begun Charlie Beyond was
talking about with founded science lab
because a terrorist an excess of money
at that time was simply because we run
the lowly large contract with Saudi
Arabia and was a loan money over from
Saudi Arabia Saudis is well known as
usually quite well-off they have this
thing called oil and they the only
problem with the xes developers firstly
it was very difficult to program as well
flex was a sort of real-time basic
language there were efforts to try and
make it better
but the general metric which was used in
Ericsson at the time mister the Plex
program had produced to code two lines
of flex code per hour which when you
think about coding and distancing was
not wasn't very very good it solved the
problems of the a ke and there's no
pointer errors because the hardware
memory unit could get rid of the point
of errors or pointers for the answer
wonder reaction degree of any
indirection it also had another problem
which shake it turned up later and I can
explain why but it's not time to do that
now that the you could not duplicate the
central processor and the central
processor was a separate Ericsson
hardware design processing with Ericsson
designs circuits initially discrete
logic circuits effect they finally
became a sixer ckets and they were it
cost more and more and more to keep the
central processor going so you couldn't
duplicate it the specs of such made it
impossible to distribute to different
processes so the challenge was that
firstly when we were sort of thought
this restarting criticized I was find a
way to program more effectively trying
to get it a bit more than sort of two
lines of code per programmer per hour if
you get it at least a three or something
like that but hopefully a bit more the
second challenge was that could we get
rid of this sort of specially designed
process and using the network of
processors instead and so productivity
and distribution were the thing
otherwise the other characteristics with
the CX he already had no pointer errors
no memory management nor the rest of it
that was where we start with our
starting point I think that's sort of
basically beyond of you anything - I
don't know you know the same time - well
I think a lot of you have heard of a
programming language called ADA well
that was part of a quite a big tradition
of concurrent languages you were called
ADA they were called chin we had a
language that I helped create which we
called Eric Pascal and what all these
languages had they had modules and they
had processes and I had process
communication and sometimes they had
very complicated process communication
like an ADA if I had something called
rendezvous etc and well I don't want to
go there but Eric Pascal was quite
useful and used for some some projects
and then at one point I went to two-week
summer course to Uppsala University and
learn Lisp took at least one week to
understand it and I've never been the
same since I mean but once you move to
sort of symbolic programming and you you
can't go back and we were actually using
Lisp for some some support systems which
for actually much well inter-process etc
which are actually symbolic it's not
mathematics is symbolic so so then we
had some idea ah to go the functional or
symbolic way might be one way to improve
product programmer productivity so we
had sort of various threads and ideas
before and then we carried out the
sports experiments Mike you you gave a
presentation of that data sets
conference in Southampton years and
years ago
but we managed to get Dec VAX to the lab
and we had a switch which pal he had
learned somehow got connected to the VAX
and then we had a laboratory environment
to experiment with programming
technologies for switches so we wrote
rule-based systems and we had logic key
whether an hourly ada read all sort of
things so to experiment with and that
was a sort of ground and the silly
result of those experiments were that we
could actually write telephony and sort
of all kinds of languages so we were a
little bit confused but we're drawing
some conclusions and then we were ready
to take a depth next step and then in
enter Joe sort of combined with our
previous experiments and there's a
terrific quote here
Joe in your paper you you mentioned you
you went and said you know hey boss what
should I do
and purportedly he says you need to
solve Ericsson software problem yeah and
I wanted to ask about that
that's a I'm not sure if that's a
wink-wink or if that's not you know
seriously you've got to solve this
problem or what was the what did what
were you really asking him to do there
what was this what was your thinking
that's a pretty big border especially
for somebody on it just coming well you
are a physicist and I think you were
doing rockets or something just that was
your last gig now I been working for the
3d space corporation doing an operating
system for I just translate their suite
and specialized we always said that our
language rocket science you know but it
it was just something about less that
that I told him I mean that the lab had
two jobs to do one was create software
technology for future systems and the
second position helped introduce new
technologies in
pleasant activities so we were doing
graphics interfaces and we're doing
using expect expert systems technologies
we've got got one of the first
workstations ever in Sweden etc so we're
doing all sorts of other things so so
this was yes create the new technology
for future systems so this is the ask
and and in the work continues at what
point did it dawn on you that he might
actually be other team might actually be
delivering on this rather tall order
when did that happen what did you look
at that work and say wait this actually
might be something well the thing is to
be a boss of a person like job might be
rather sort of tricky everything you say
beyond it but the thing is that Joe is
quite a friendly kind sort of person so
to sort of keep control of Joe East you
have to go or sort of roundabout way and
that was that we were working together
with the use of team who were creating a
prototype of a new type of over for a
new switch and they needed a language to
do this so that's that's how we work so
essentially I I told Joe he helped those
people with the best technology you can
and then this was combined with all the
sort of 15 years of experience that Mike
brought along at that cuz when I came in
I these guys knew all about telephony
and I didn't know anything about
telephony so we could make a telephone
call and Robert you know our way of
learning telephony was you know pair
hidden under built this exchange and we
just programmed in every language we
could think of just that was learning
telephony for me and then the
people said well that's all wrong and it
should work like this and I started
messing around with small talk and built
a small talk model of telephony and we
used small talk on a Sun workstations
very slow and when it was garbage
collecting I went and had a cup of
coffee because it literally was time to
have a coffee in 20 minutes or so and we
ordered a Tektronix Smalltalk machine it
was very expensive I persuaded Jana to
buy a techtronic small talk machine and
there was a long delivery and while I
was waiting for the delivery
I was described by there's a guy called
Rajesh Gagarin I was explaining to him
how how I thought you could describe
telephony and he said that's the Prolog
program and he took me into his office
he showed me how Prolog worked and I
went Wow fantastic
love Prolog and sorry I wrote this
telephony thing in Prolog and we started
running it on the machine and the
Tektronix machine came along and we
Donna had managed to get us to buy the
Sigma 3 fearfully expensive and it was
the first one in Sweden and by that time
I wasn't interested in small talk
anymore and actually unpacked it and sat
on my desk and then be honest I'm only
gonna use the small talk paid a lot of
it and the Tektronix salesman kept
phoning me up and saying how do you like
this portal machine oh it's great it's
fantastic and and yeah are you having
any problems with it no what no I said
no no problems I thought what had an
unpacked it so the world of problems and
then could I bring some customers to
look at it and talk to you about your
experiences with it and I said well I'm
very busy at the moment so and then
there was a guy down the corridor who
wanted a small talk machine and he was
doing objectory
remember thing very often and he built
an object order design method in small
toes I accidentally sort of lent him the
machine that became an opportunity to
design method which I didn't like that
much after
it got him off my back and so he did do
some good and then the prologue story
started and and that led to Erlang and
Robert got involved and then so you got
hooked on prologue prologue yes wasn't
concurrent it was no and this is that's
why I needed to beat you guys
no I wanna I want to ask you about your
this is called Joe's abstract machine
yes yeah and I want to read to you a
quote from Chuck Moore the creator of
fourth he says that compilers are
probably the worst code ever written
they're written by someone who's never
written a compiler before and will never
do so again and when I read that it I
made a connection to the jam because as
its counted you had to do quite a bit of
research and I got the impression from
the the account that you hadn't ever
written that this was this is sort of
new uncharted turret yeah and as it
turns out there's there's still a great
deal of design that's that was an
original Jam it still lives today
there's a fair statement or has it been
completely Robert actually did all the
groundwork because Robert you heard
Robert had collected a large number of
papers about the implementation of
prologue and things like that and he
lent it he lent that to me and I read
every single paper in about what we kept
dodging I read very quickly I didn't
understand any of them and then there
was a oh oh that's how it works and
started writing a compiler yeah we've
done some work before an implementation
at this view if we can introduce new
technology into the company it's a
higher-level language and some we should
at least know how to implement them even
if we don't do our implementation
products we should know something about
them so I spent quite a bit of time
implementing languages I still do but so
I am commended least well partial
implementation of Lisp I did look at the
implementation Prolog that's work or all
the papers from there was also a vain
then and doing concurrent logic
languages number of concurrent logic
languages I was looking at implementing
current logic languages - we were
looking at par log one called parler
than one
called strand so we're looking at
implementing them and we actually did
telecom systems in them I mean they
could running out on an hour lab and
they did everything you know multiple
calls most concurrency and so on it
worked but there was still problems with
the logic languages that didn't quite
fit and logical variables weren't very
good for this and a lot of other
problems as well too so you migrate you
could not do backtracking over hardware
if you started sending out a signal
Yokota's oh that's very interesting yes
yeah you can't backtrack if you set
Hardware you can't backtrack over that
happened with a colleague Nabil
absolutely he was doing a lot of work in
concurrent logic and one of those
systems he wrote he'd forgot in Prato
he'd forgot a cut so if something
happened I think basically if you're
talking to someone the other person put
the receiver down your system would
start backtracking you need to
immediately come into a new call which
was quite what I'm supposed to do so
yeah you had a lot of these problems
using using the logic languages in some
cases they were just do power can't
unring a telephone so that's why we cut
logic stuff out we cut out things like
logical variables we cut out bank
tracking and weird then you sort of
Prolog without by the way Mike didn't
you do the first scheduler yeah yeah did
the first Joe designed the machine well
just started writing in the virtual
machine the Jam and see I took one look
at so joe's code oh my god awful did the
first Jam implementation which I suppose
would gladly left over to someone else
you did want to go yeah and then I did
the first application see was actually
used in the product which in the thing
that John was talking about I use
investigating a new system in well
Ericsson business communication which
was a unit in Balmoral outside Stockholm
and actually was used and became a
product called the mobility server so
the first airline based product was
actually the mobility server and I've
lost the code at least I think I've got
it on a 3m cassette trouble is I don't
know how to read 3m cassettes now
there's a tremendous amount of work
that's been put into the the virtual
machine the beam technology and it
started it's evolved and it's a
fascinating read I want to bring in a
quote by a famous computer scientist
last name Verdun it's birding first rule
of program don't know if he's related to
Robert it goes like this any sufficient
sufficiently complicated concurrent
program in another language contains an
ad hoc informally specified bug-ridden
slow implementation of half of airline
yeah of course for a two Greenspun for
the upstream source there and and that's
a clever that's clever and it's funny
but I I'm I know that there's a lot
under that so when I ask this to
everybody who's been through all of that
what is so hard about concurrency what's
hard about doing it doing it right what
what so hard about what you guys did
what Mike do you remember there would PL
one six three but this was the first
concurrent system we did one of the
tricky things is getting if you look at
airline it's got a send and receive and
it's got a link and it's good it's got a
small set of primitive from which you
can construct all these other things it
took us a long time to figure out what
that small set of primitives were we
tried lots of different combinations
before we found I mean after the event
it looked simple you know could all be
together but before you've done it it's
kind of tricky
well I remember meeting we had when we
were discussing with these people in
Baltimore what they wanted we were
trying to work out the concurrency
primitives so in that reason the time
we've got hung up about pipes and UNIX
pipes so we decided that they're all our
processes should talk to each other
through pipes we had all sorts of
problems like sort of two processes
decided
talk to a third process we had a sort of
month pipe join them together and then
we had another one that was going to
talk called bend pipe I think we were
trying to work out how to do this and
then we had this sort of big talk to us
sort of the people who were supposed to
support we're looking at is getting more
and more goggle eyed and sort of say we
trust these people we said well we sort
of had it so quite breakout session then
we said let's think of some other way of
doing something that sounds I always
thought a pipe algebra sounded very
simple because you'd have a pipe with
ends a and B and you just have an outer
a connect agent with processor X and
split pipe a into B and it turned out
that when you moved a pipe you had to
send a tracer message all the way around
to the end and had to get back and then
you had simple you know kind of
simultaneous things had to happen it was
it and I implemented all of that it was
like four thousand lines of prologue and
that way
and now you see people write pipe
systems on top of their line like AMQP
and things and they in themselves -
extremely complicated so we just said no
point-to-point communication with
mailboxes is what should be in the
primitives are not pipes but it wasn't
the parent cause it it just sounds easy
but it's not
yeah I mean that's one reason why for
example there's nothing synchronous in
the physics synchronous communication is
difficult possible well difficult it's
possible yeah it doesn't travel
infinitely fast it's impossible that's
why you don't want synchronous in the
bed you want to keep things a sinkers
then you can implement your level of
synchronous on top of that but once you
start baking it in it suddenly becomes
complex impossible look the problem is
really from your background if you if
your background is sequential
programming and Fortran common I mean
you'll be stuck into these things like
critical regions and rendezvous etcetera
whereas if if your background is
telecoms
even telecoms relays
here is this box here this box here this
box and they obviously all operate
concurrently and they they send messages
to each other I mean if that is your
background then then the sort of well
that's an idea of cooperating as state
machines
that's a telecoms background I think all
said the problem is finding the level
the right level of concurrency so
getting back to the concurrent logic
languages they were extremely concurrent
basically everything was concurrent
so you have a clause with a number of
reductions on it they're all done in
parallel so there you had to put a lot
of work effort into making things
sequential because we had I mean we're
controlling Hardware things had to be
done in a specific order you have to
first have do this then do that do that
if you're running things extremely
parallel and you put effort into making
them sequential so the problem is
finding the right level and that's why
we ended up with having lightweight
processes but within each process
everything is sequential because that
was a suitable level for doing things
you could sequential eyes things very
easily you could see the order things
were being done and you had the
concurrency there because you had lots
of them it's just finding the right
level of doing things right and this is
through laborious experimentation sounds
yeah yeah because don't mention strand
so stranden is a concurrent logic
language again it's extremely concurrent
and we experimented with that and we
actually had a chapter in it in the
Strand book where we implemented our
line as it existed then on top of strand
and one of the problems we had was
making sure things were done in order
and he gets a really strange thing so if
you write code that did ABC then directs
it at the end but you got that
concurrently got to see a sequential
ization wrong would just crash
immediately because the XFL is straight
in so they had to put we have to do a
lot of effort to make it sequential
we'll get a level of sequential
execution which we needed for our
problem one of the things well we found
out when you could
the hardware you had to do things in the
right order right otherwise the hardware
got very confused and it did nothing
more crashed or something like this for
that was one of the most biggest
problems I had with our spotters
experiments setting the things in the
right order for fine well one
fundamental thing about our language is
I think actually comes from the thing
that beyond I was working with earlier
which was the language which was called
very Pascal and that is what we called
selective message reception and that is
absolutely fundamental
now I so a series of unfortunate
accidents I became a manager in Ericsson
for a large number of years and I
managed a period of time for about 10 15
s not well for number of years I managed
a unit which was developing the current
3G system using a horrible disgusting
and I probably get sued for saying this
must say concept called Rose real time
the interesting thing is did have a sort
of fundamentals of concurrency concept
they did send messages no the rest of it
but it did not have selective message
reception and this means at any time you
have to be percent prepared to read any
message and if you think about the sort
of message reception as a matrix of a
state number of states and the number of
messages that come in again can come in
if you have selectively intercept
messages seps you can actually reduce
that matrix to much much smaller but in
every stage you just say I would only
receive the messages which irrelevant to
me now now that actually came from a
language for animation shield which he
incorporated in unary Pascal and that I
think is is became we've generalized
that in in in airline by having a
pattern matching or message reception
and I think that is probably one of the
fundamental things which makes I believe
the same mechanisms gone into scholar I
don't know scarlet but those of you that
do probably don't know know that I mean
they talk about airline based
messaging or concurrency and Scala now
that actually is actually fundamental
because that makes systems at least a
factor to easier to design because you
don't at every state have to know
receive every message I think also
indicates one thing a lot of the things
in our line I'd hate to say this we
didn't invent it we did not invent
asynchronous message passing okay I
would love to take claim that but we
didn't we did not invent the idea of
isolated processes we did not invent
pattern matching
I think links it's the only thing and
that was Mike's idea I think links is
probably the only thing in our long that
actually is we initiated and so in that
in that sense one of the strengths of
our Ling is is how we put things
together and also we managed to keep it
simple to keep the basic simple and
whether that was any great philosophical
design or just laziness I don't know
right look look look Robert remember
that I invented the process concept it
was only that I discovered that a lot of
other people hit on the same same idea
yeah yes yeah yes we did actors but
someone else had done it before but we
didn't know about it so so airline moves
forward with an Ericsson and and shows
great promise and great success and
there's a there's an entity formed to
sell it externally and it's ready to
unleash in what I'm a so and I ask you
Jane about your experience of coming
into this organization a few months
later there's the ban and you're and and
now you are tasked with or asked to sort
of promote the idea of open sources can
you tell it go a little bit more detail
and how that went right so in airline
systems I believe was five years old
when I joined it least successful
company in Ericsson I had the advantage
of being its second CEO which is why I
didn't have a brilliant career at that
stage in there
so are they they've been running for
five years and had 20 people or
thereabouts employed mostly doing
consulting within Ericsson on Ericsson
projects using Eric's airline the
purpose of the organization was to
spread the use of airline both inside
and outside of Ericsson because one of
the problems with plex although it was
an excellent language was that people
didn't want to learn it because they
were thought of as a dead end in their
career so that it was hard to recruit
good people to program flex and Ericsson
wanted to make airline popular and so
therefore again make it possible to have
a career doing programming ever lying
outside of Ericsson this was not
successful and so about two months I was
I started work I think in July or August
as well then like something like October
the bang came through so just one unit
there one business you know with the
radio tiny little company that they
called airline systems that was inch
ista the cs lab was a little bit south
of no the band the band came down from a
the CTO though it was at the top it was
at the top the top yes absolutely
do not use airline in any new products
within Ericsson just well I was already
told to well and so it but it's pretty
hard to sell something out from Ericsson
as this greatest thing since sliced
bread that Harrison refuses to use just
doesn't quite work that way but straight
enough I wasn't fired immediately which
nowadays I suppose I would because
they've got better control you know
there was a guy there named UK graben
who was at the CS that we had picked up
one of Joe's ideas for a startup and
said well let's do this nothing called
Eddy and he sent out an email with
saying what he was planning to do to the
gang and I had time on my hands
and so answered well who was gonna buy
it
and why and who's the first one to buy
it and these sort of business I like
questions and Mike told me no you've got
to work with yoga because you're the
only one asking these kinds of questions
I said okay well I guess and so I got a
part-time assignment at the CAS that
helping you okay with Mongoose turn
twist to do that and when I was there
then the CS lab decided that I wasn't
really all that bad although I was
female and businessperson I'm not a
programmer and all that I remember the
first time I went walking down the
corridor anyway then ho con then told me
well we've got to get it out and we've
got to get it out we've got to get it
out of Ericsson because it is this
excellent and the only way to do it is
Eric's one good way to do it is that
seems very very fortunate because I mean
if that commerce say those conversations
don't happen and you don't participate
in that and hurling isn't open-source
early becomes an eternal forever
internal and since it was banned it
would have it would have time they would
have been no no no it was critical
without actually without me there to do
the persuading who could have happened
either people got yeah but but I mean
once it was out well then we needed to
do something else which was basically we
a lot of the gang were reasonably upset
with Ericsson management we were
planning murders actually I remember
sitting on sitting in the sofa in Mike's
office planning different ways of well
learn how to dive and then we'll swim
out to his sales boy to put like when
he's limping he's still alive
so we we decided to leave our economy
and people's IP was was there was
available was open sourced and and I
thought right fine well you guys free us
how hard a start-up is we need a
business idea first
they said oh not a problem we want to
meet at Joe's place on Saturday we'll
come up with some business ideas and I
said yeah I'm sure yeah
41 business ideas were used to
generating options and experimentation
well they've been gathering them they've
been thinking about them but they knew
nobody knew how to build a business so
okay there's Jay Wright we're gonna do
this down then and then oh god 41 B okay
so how do we choose I think if I
remember correctly that's the first open
source software Erickson had oh yeah
my father and now they still only had
very little open source software so
getting it out was a real feat just a
moment ago you said that somebody was
revalued that decision I mean they could
have just been you know somebody wanted
to keep it away from competition or
Eric's airline is really good okay all
of you agree cuz you're here like is
really very good and so either as be
honest at once upon a time either it
steady-state a reasonable state for
using Eric's airline within Erickson is
that Erickson can then make these huge
complicated software projects successful
and none of the competition can okay or
you can let it out open source and then
lots of people the the more savvy people
first will use it and that will then
you'll be able to get people who make a
career outside of Ericsson to use
airline but it will still it won't be
Ericsson secret weapon those are the two
studies station Bell Labs had a lot to
do with setting a standard with CNC plus
to get technology out that wasn't
important it wasn't important know about
that no no one even because that was a
that was a that was a net sort of define
a model of knowledge sharing that good
but Ericsson was that was as far as I
know nobody knew about that at that time
so I want you to so which conversation
Oh
oh I'm not sure you see it might make
know something here because I just heard
somebody who your your bona fides in
start-up space are second to none and
you just said Erlang is great it's
really great now you you believe you
believe that so what have you seen not
escape because you we're used to always
battling through a business case in
managerial case at least there's a lot
of stories of people practitioners will
use this as a tool to solve something
sort of an angle and under under able to
sort of sell it upstream I know that's
been a history of her life what has been
your experience in in in industry with
this technology specifically along those
lines that dynamic of its merit it's
it's it's virtuous from a technical
standpoint but you face opposition from
sort of the manager accepted ah you see
I'm in a start-up space I don't deal
with big managers anymore so you up so I
can just sort of say yeah it's gonna be
airline guys so they say fine it this
this one very important thing that we
tend to forget and that's one of the
success stories very long and that was
about that period just before the open
source etcetera Allen was being used
success in successively more and more
products and at that time that was a
transfer of Ireland from the research
laboratory to to a product unit run by
Kenneth London who is here somewhere and
that is something that could have failed
or could have caused all sorts of
problems but actually somehow we managed
to do that very well and I was for a
while sort of overlap between the
product people and the lab but now I
mean the true ownership of our language
lies in the hand of that group and and
they have existed ever since supporting
both internal and external customers and
that is also one reason that people like
Joe could sort of this idea this
disappear because
Ireland wasn't dependent on on these
three guys and the longer community it's
a very it was then a very small
community and people are interdependent
definitely and I think that's what's one
of the fun things now is that we're
still are I mean I'm I'm pretty much on
the outside no but still true that clock
Ian you wanna be a mirror is spent three
days at my house just I left them in my
house just yesterday evening I mean
we're still friends we still there's
still this level of trust which is great
I'm gonna ask can we have a little bit
more time we'll just lock the doors
anyway okay well let me do this because
I think the segues into I'm gonna just
loft up a big softball here for everyone
to hit and and it's it's yeah I want to
try to connect a few dots because
history is a big part of this story and
I think there's so much that we can
learn by studying the history of this
life's so unique and the circumstances
relative to other language is very very
very unique but I want to now fast
forward to this moment I'm gonna name
some companies here and you may have
heard of a few IBM visa Facebook BT
mobile pivotal whatsapp and there's a
telecom startup called Ericsson the
these are all companies that use use
airline in a product that is central to
some
business line you forgot Cisco another
startup they do networking of networking
and the list goes on and on I don't know
now that'll read
I'm gonna read ten points that I think
if you look at the products in each of
these companies and I have I understand
sort of what these do I just want to I
want to enumerate their feature set here
number one handling a very large number
of concurrent activities number two
actions to be you may you may recognize
this keep it keeping her out you may
recognize this list and then you tell me
what this list is number two actions to
be performed at a certain point in time
or within a certain time so real soft
real time number three systems
distributed over several computers
before integration with Hardware number
five very large software systems number
six complex functionality such as
feature interaction number seven
continuous operation over several years
number eight software maintenance
reconfiguration it set without stopping
the system number nine spending quality
and reliability requirements number ten
fault tolerance both to hardware
failures and to software errors and
looking at the parts that are built it
seems to me the Erlang was was selected
specifically because of these rather
phenomenal characteristics
what is that list well I'm cheap because
I know well it's in my license thiet
thesis but a lot of it actually comes
from Mike so the these are all
requirements when I joined they'd
already figure that's what I do there
was there was no this is the let's say
that that's the problem that's the
problem that's the problem you don't if
you if you're going to make or we were
going to make a system that would be
useful for telecoms programming they had
to fulfill all those requirements
otherwise it just wasn't interesting are
you ready for the question here we go
this is a super soft
so after 30 years now looking at how
Erlang is used inside helix and on the
outside
are you comfortable saying mission
accomplished I think so
at the same time as we were fully
prepared that there could be better
solutions to each one of those tariff
items absolutely not I mean that was the
first good prototype you know whatsapp
is the first prototype of a big system I
mean we're going into the future what
kid I mean I feel computer science as
this little kids we've invented all this
stuff with I give these lectures you
know that the iPhone 6 is a 250 times as
powerful as a cray wand and what are we
doing with it playing pokemon go what
are we around with come on we've
got all the edge power that you know
we're gonna look we're gonna lose all of
history if we don't we're not careful
we've got millions of times more power
in the edge network basically in
computing the edge network this is all
the things that are connected Internet
has got billions of times more power
than the surface in the center right and
we'd never be able to use it with
distributed computing we have to do it
and things like a Erlang and a lot of
other things are going to come into that
we have to redo it all because it's
totally up does this change the
problem definition does your
observations there change or augments
that problem definition or can we go
back to this list of 10 as a sacred
document oh yes yeah I mean that can be
just taken and carved into a stone and
then put that we're add another 10
things yeah the problem domains correct
and relevant and I think that gets back
to what the one to one reason why our
Lang is interesting is because a lot of
other things apart from telecoms have
exactly the same set of problems
otherwise having wouldn't be interesting
I mean there are things I hate to say
but the things out and will not does not
do very well if it doesn't all but
problems that domain it is a solution to
it perhaps we can do a better one today
we start over
trouble was the trouble would be that is
we have influenceable it's a lot of work
we now know it's a lot of work to do we
didn't know that then I would like to
add an eleventh requirement that you
also need good programmers if you have
crap program as you get crap systems
there's a theory today that's no printed
not read the paper there's a paper
saying the myths is a ten times
programmer this is totally untrue that
some programmers and some software
people that's not called programmers
call them software developers because
it's a lot more than programming is
testing it's working out to high
abstractions it's a programming it's
just my new part of it unless you have
good software developers you would not
gonna get anywhere and a lot of people
are awful lot better as software
development than other people and just
just keep that in mind but I used to say
in Ericsson that I could do when I was a
manager there I could probably do the
safe and really good people I could
probably do the same thing as a hundred
and fifty people I was managing at the
time oh yeah that's actually what I
would say is the one of the things that
I would like to add to that list and
that is that airline is the step into
airline is a bit too high so that
although you've all taken it it's
daunting and so a lot of people don't
take it and if it were easier to learn
or that we somehow brought that step
down I don't know exactly how that would
be an extraordinary boost for the
airline community Jay and I actually
disagree with you I think keeping it
hard to those good because it gets
program is he brain-dead stupid
languages which teaches him to think
incorrectly to start with I mean there's
no Java and things like that
you've got to unlearn all that stuff if
Donald Knuth said that learning Fortran
causes irreparable brain damage
that's what caused it thank you with Joe
here if Ellingwood your first language
you wouldn't say that it's because Java
C first language that you say that we'll
see you do think slightly differently
some of the concepts in it are just not
what most people are used to doing the
concurrency in the message placing us on
if you don't if you've done if you're
coming from a sequential background that
is really strange right and however you
think about it it's a rethink on how you
design systems you just can't get around
that if I write something in Fortran if
I write something in our line the
systems are going to look very different
that's I always say I mean the world is
parallel right and okay we've yet we're
talking at the same time everybody
learns the further a lying is the first
languages need they usually learn
something else first what's the fault of
it universities and things it's not the
university they're in second grade or
first grade at the moment they're
learning not airline learning something
else I think that's where the problem is
really not the language itself most
people can learn the language if they
want to any language if they want to its
grasping the basic ideas and if those
basic ideas are different from what
you're used to
you're gonna have problems there's
nothing strange I mean I had prop
trouble the first time when I was moving
Lisp
that's way back my initial problem with
list funnily enough was the parenthesis
but I was thinking of parenthesis is
something that brackets stuff right
not as defining structures so I could
not see why can't I write a function
name and put that in a list because it's
in parentheses because it's just a
bracket and of course it isn't
that's what once there's just a
different concept and that's what didn't
I think it's the same same thing with
our Lang or the type of language our
Lang is you a lot of concepts there a
number of concepts there which people
are not used to and they're the ones
that cause problems you know but
something else was bad about telling
that people forget that even bad
programmers quite often get here
programs to work which is real
disadvantage if it's stuck to C++ they
never get anything to work so I can say
one thing also getting back to what Joe
was talking about I think one of the
reasons we couldn't develop our lang is
we had time this this wasn't sort of a
three-month project what must take in
four or five years before from when we
started until we got we were happy with
the basic ideas behind it and we still
hadn't worked out the proper syntax
anyway but we just worked out what other
basic ideas you need yes you need this
concept of processes concurrency the
sequential nature in the process of the
function was nice linking and so on for
doing error handling just working out
these basic ideas took a long time and
one reason we could do that is what we
had contact with these people involved
were who could come back and say yeah
this is a fantastic idea but we can't
use it or what our patient happened this
was a really bad idea like the pipes
written and so they say yes this is good
idea we can use this this works for us
just getting this feedback for them and
it took time and we could do that and if
you have something realistic to say you
got six months to developing your
language to building this type of system
you're not gonna get anywhere right no
more than you want anyway okay we've got
a wrap up we're out of time but I want
to give everyone of you an opportunity
to close and I sort of prepped you a
little bit with an email ahead of time
and this is the question that I'd like
you to answer there's a student out
there who wants to taking computer
science very seriously and wants to
learn wants to be excellent I ask each
of you as succinctly as you can to give
that individual sort of the the most the
advice with that occurs to you what
would what advice would you give that
individual embarking on a career
starting with with with study and
entering a workplace that individual
advice would you give well I'll just
restrict that question to computer
languages and not to sort of knowledge
of operating systems databases and
everything else because I would say the
important thing is to learn several
languages not to say how long not just
start and what's what making sure you
actually learn assembly line
we assembly that was very important
assembly language is seldom taught
because unless you actually understand
what is actually ticking away at the
bottom of a machine you'll never be able
to understand what optimal and what's
not optimal learn lots of programming
paradigms the list and Prolog young
functional languages learn a lot of
things so you can actually understand
the various different paradigms
don't just stick to do what they seem to
do in university today they teach people
Java and that's about it
that's horrible that make sure you
actually learn Prolog for example it's
very very intuitive to learn because
it's totally different programming
paradigm for everything else very
important not just to sort of be a
singletrack do a lot of things it
doesn't matter if you don't do a lot of
things completely learn them to the end
just know enough about them so you
appreciate that are other ways of doing
things so it depends what sort of
programming you want to do but if you
want to do scientific programming or
technical program I think a good
grounding in maths and physics is
although you're not majoring in it I
think you know don't neglect the math
you don't neglect the physics and
English you know learn to write and
things like that and to communicate with
people I think that's just as important
of learning to be good at programming
and do it a lot you don't do a lot of
programming well I agree very much with
what Mike says I mean programming
language technologies is like a lot of
concepts abstractions so that each
programming language is like you sort of
take a subset of that and take another
subset I mean process what does a
process look like here what it's called
odds here it's called task or here to go
up but it's a safe I mean it's a concept
and then also like Joseph but maths I
mean early on when there was no computer
science education a lot of the best
programmers were people who had done
sort of both technical physics because
they were used to dealing with
abstractions and I felt very much when I
was doing programming that it was like
doing so
tricky maths I mean you had hit hit on
the idea how do I solve this and people
are more or less good at that and you
can sort of train your abilities and you
can sort of study how hard had done it
and I I remember when I was manager of
people who got stuck on something and
they they were using more sort of tricky
facilities in pl-1 etc and I started
looking at it from and I realized yes
that he had not managed to solve the
problem I mean it was like a mess he had
been hit on the solution and the
solution is an algorithm and well you
have to do maths etc and you have to
study lots of languages just to train
your mind to doing that sort of thing
okay both I agree with Mike here
different learning multiple languages
and their different languages I mean if
you learn three languages and all
basically the same that's that's really
not gonna give you very much you need to
learn languages that that are different
yep think Java
I can't recommend a bit of big Java pick
a functional language pick a logical a
pick a concurrent language they're all
different so you get the feel for the
different concepts you also give you a
better feel of what you felt for the
problem what is the correct language I
mean I don't think there's any language
that's good for everything you can
program anything in any language but
whether it's good for it's another issue
and yet it's all about problem solving
now I'm lousy at maths I fortunately
forgotten all my physics as well but
it's all about problem solving
whether you're developing a system of
developing language it's solving the
problem that that's what we were doing
we were solved we had the problem that
ten points basically we're solving the
problem for this and so it's all about
problem solving
I don't know if you can practice
problem-solving but yes you can but when
I started mass at university I got got
books of sort of old exams and my fellow
students they were sort of sold one
probably here one program I was so the
whole book and that that was just
practice to get my mind working much
more diligent than I was but anyway it's
the problem-solving methought about with
you whatever you're doing for it is the
problem solved if you don't like problem
solving okay I'd like to add something
as well and I'm not I would say that a
lot of the problems even a good program
is gonna face a knife or how to
influence people how to get what you
want done done okay and that is also
possible to practice and to learn in
university go into the university
societies and you join them and you
build the bloody float and you wear the
funny costume and you go to the parties
and you try to figure out how people
work okay and there are lots of books
around it will help you okay but I think
that's really important because I think
that the people who I know who are
unhappy and their 40s or the ones who
didn't learn enough of that skill they
might have wonderful technical skills
but if you don't know how to get your
will through if you don't know how to
make a an argument persuade people get
something done that needs to be done
that needs other people to accept it
then you will probably not be as
effective and happy in your life as you
want to be so I think that's pretty
important
and remember very well meeting will
managing people etc where Jane presented
the idea of open source and I remember
very well that you did not say one
single word or mentioned anything that I
did not know thing was just that you
could sort of get the kid into the heads
of those
which I couldn't so this is and this is
a skill one can learn it's it's like
another thank you for watching you
recommended a book to me once called
influenced by Delhi I read that book and
I have that book of my vocation I read
it once a month and Robert child Dini
it's all now it's still wonderful
influence and I have to thank you Jane
for something I mean when I was younger
I thought the way to deal with technical
problems sort out I'll give people
technically and then Jane came along and
and very patiently explained to me and
he said to me time and time again he
said the relationship comes first
and and I think you will probably
remember this I disagreed and then I
began to notice that you were right and
I was wrong thank you for teaching me
that so our view was if we present a
better technical solution we between
adopted let me just say this has been a
dream come true for me
I appreciate this has been very special
I think for everybody here we've gotten
so much out of this I'd love to do this
more more often but for now thank you so
much ladies and gentleman please give a
round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
