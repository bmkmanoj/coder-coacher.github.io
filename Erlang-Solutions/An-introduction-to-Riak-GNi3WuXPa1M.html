try and put the conference back on
schedule by being a little bit quick
I joined Paschal on the 3rd of December
2012 and I'm still learning you know
it's a very steep learning curve to join
a company like Michelle with very
intelligent guys one of whom will follow
me and deep dive into one aspect of the
technology for you but what I'm going to
do is just to introduce our product
react at a high level talk about some of
the use cases and talk about some of the
reasons why people are interested in
using react how many people in the room
are already using react comes up ok how
many people in the room have never
played with react at all awesome so you
are the people I'm speaking to right now
and those guys who know much more than
react than I do please keep it to
yourself I don't want anybody to know
the reason that products like react
exist is because the computing landscape
has changed and I don't want to talk to
you about cloud computing and I don't
really want to talk to you about big
data but the fact is that now there is a
difference to say 10 years ago some of
the complete that we're working with
right now tell us that they are HP's
biggest customer they have HP's
superdome's for 256 cores they're
Microsoft's biggest customer with Pat
abouts and petabytes of sequel server
databases but this is an expensive way
to build big systems those servers are
expensive those database licenses are
expensive and operationally it's
expensive to run those environments so
the change is now commodity hardware is
available you can buy fairly cheap
servers and buy lots of them and that
way not just reduce the expense for your
company but also get a lot more bang for
your buck you end up with a lot more
memory it's a lot more current a lot
more power and I think that's the that's
the major difference and that is that is
the change in IT that has allowed us to
develop products like react which
approach I'll explain to you now but it
is also the case that there is a lot
more data being created now than there
is existing capacity to store it and we
need to try and catch up because the
change over the last year or so
according to the analysts and some of
the companies that I work with is some
of this data that we're not storing
actually would potentially have a value
so we want to harness it so that we can
analyze it how are we going to do that
how are we going to catch up given the
rate of data growth
everybody is saying the same thing
everybody in in our own community that
distributed systems are the future but
the fact is this isn't widely accepted
in 2014
Gartner says only 20 percent of Fortune
1000 companies will be investing in
distributed systems so the point that
I'd like to make is that this is an
exciting place to be it's early on in
the cycle we can catch the Waverly and
really make a lot of money we can we can
help to change the world over the next
few years because we're early and that's
the reason that I've joined patch oh
yeah just in December
well poncho is doing of taking Amazon
standards and creating products so that
everybody can take advantage of some of
the technologies that Amazon has
described or actually built pablo
mentioned in his introduction the amazon
dynamo paper how many people are reddit
awesome so tosh.o has implemented a
faithful implementation of dynamo in
react so hopefully that gives most of
you straight away an understanding of
what we've done we've opted to focus on
availability
rather than consistency because we
believe that availability of systems is
usually the most important factor that's
a philosophy that we argue about with
some of the people that we engage with
every day but for the vast majority of
systems that we see we think
availability is critical
so bashes almost 110 employees ended a
couple of several years ago but only in
2011 we came to market with react
version 1.0 and so it's an open-source
database but we control it we support it
we are training professional services
and we are bringing react to the market
directly to you guys as an open source
free were database also with an
enterprise distribution if you want
support and some enterprise features and
we've built on top of it more recently a
cloud storage platform which is quite
like Amazon's s3 which you're going to
implement in your own data center we're
doing that with partners like Berlin
solutions and their parent company try
fork who are investors in Russia as well
as other partners like Yahoo Microsoft
Citrix and others
2011 was a good year for us we acquired
a lot of pretty good logos that were
very proud of 2012 was even better again
and tomorrow will be hosted by zing in
Hamburg for area community meetup they
became a customer just a few months ago
were particularly excited that the meet
up tomorrow so please tweet your friends
about the Hamburg meet up tomorrow what
I want to talk to you about is
distributed systems higher availability
schema-less
databases no sequel databases and what
sort of performance you can expect so
really I was speaking to some people at
lunchtime so I think it is right to
style it very very very high level with
react we're talking about clustering a
few databases food culture a few servers
together we're recommending that people
start with no fewer than five service
that is a little bit difficult for some
people because they they've played with
say MongoDB and they used to maybe just
needing one server for their experiment
but you will need three copies of your
data for integrity purposes you'll want
another machine that you can take
offline for maintenance you don't want
to know the machine that can simply fail
and you'll still have your three copies
of your data that's critical for us and
although it's expensive for some use
cases if you have an application that
requires scale five nodes isn't going to
be a big deal for you
but it's a pretty good qualification
point
our philosophy is to build for failure I
guess because you have no unconference
you're thinking the same way some of you
I know are here thinking about whether
it might be a useful tool for you in
future I think this is the critical
point we are cross fuse that we want to
start building systems now understanding
the failure the normal parts of
operations
I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir on
that one so the first major
differentiator will for react versus
some of the other no sequel end of the
databases is that it's masterless
there's no master slave situation so
therefore there's no single point of
failure and there are other benefits for
that architecture to that we'll get onto
one of the companies that we work with
the chose react for its high
availability was in Stratos have you
heard of them no you have now so this is
an advertisement for enstratus so these
guys are a public and private cloud
management platform as a service they
say that they need to be more highly
available than any of the clouds that
their platform is asked to monitor and
manage it's pretty common for us now to
talk to organizations who are using my
sequel and looking for something new the
reason that they're looking for
something new is sometimes because they
need very high availability and they
need to get away from this master/slave
architecture
react is also non-relational and I'm
calling it non-relational because no
sequel is a little bit useless as a term
basically Riya has no schema one of the
guys I office tells me every day that
the advantages there are no schema
migrations I guess for people who are
coming from the world of Oracle and
sequel server and my sequel from an
Operations perspective that starts to
sound like a really big deal so some of
the things that you don't get though if
you choose a murmuration all database
you you want up blocks you want of joins
and a lot of people are saying to us hey
how does your database handle this
situation or that situation and
oftentimes they're talking about
business logic one of our most common
conversations with developers is where
we say our philosophy is that the
business logic for your application is
something you should get to decide we're
not going to implement rules that will
constrain your creativity in our
database but that does mean that there
is more for you to consider than there
was when you were using an Oracle
database for example
I'll edit who has heard of a logic
security services provider
well another advertisement them so
another replacement to my secret but the
important thing here was the operational
efficiency that they got a much more
highly performant under my secure
environment and they're likely to grow
very rapidly five terabytes a days
they're constantly increasing the size
of their environment and adding new
features to their service the fact that
react is non-relational allows them to
change the way that there's nothing to
change the services they offer on a
regular basis in a rapid way and grow
their business very quickly so we talked
about high speed we as I said because we
are focused on availability we are
sacrificing performance to some extent
but which we are we are from consistent
performance so you know when you have
when you add a node how performance is
going to be affected in general I hear
guys talking to customers about will we
would expect you to have a certain eight
millisecond response time from the
database there are terms and conditions
apply to that statement but that's
roughly where most of our customers seem
to be you get an even distribution of
load for for both you know foof when
you're writing to the database or Korean
from the database that's evenly
distributed load and one of the
interesting use cases that we found is
for organizations thought they needed in
memory cache and actually when we react
attacked for react it turns out that we
can replace some of that and you know
some of you are probably dealing with
the high availability issues with
letters and so on these are interesting
conversations that we're beginning to
have
Best Buy best boy Best Buy is is a good
example of a company that switched to
react for four foot performance which as
I say isn't the it wasn't sort of the
architecture we were going for when we
built the database but because the
performance scales and because it's
predictable it was suitable for them and
crucially you know Christmastime or
during peak periods for them they can
scale their coaster and be confident
that they will meet the performance at
the business as expecting it will
require
one of the really nice things about
react if that it's DevOps friendly and
erlang solutions parent company try fork
has a good example of a customer at the
Danish Health Authority where there who
we are compartment they say in a blog
post which you can read is about ninety
five percent cheaper than their Oracle
environment was and most of those
savings were found in operations adding
notes your cluster is very very easy
we had a sales team in San Francisco for
a team meeting two weeks ago and every
one of the sales team managed to set up
Riyadh clusters and add and remove nodes
within fifteen minutes
honey the salespeople that's that's
pretty good we like that sir
not me me not anybody heard of mad
beaming he probably got tons of email
from maddening me and don't realize
where it's coming from
these guys move from odbms to to to
react because they didn't want to have
to deal with sharding anymore and
actually that's it that's a complaint
that we hear from a lot of people that
we speak to you want to want to get away
from shouting so probably one of the top
reasons that people are looking at real
you know high variability you know very
large scale and kind of in this same
vein another company called open X
delivered by four trillion ads on the
react cluster last year so you know very
let's go and I think the point I'm
trying to make is even at extremely
large scale from an Operations
perspective react is still you know
fairly low touch
so we're not going to get into the
depths of the react architecture today
but it's important to say that it's
essentially HTTP friendly
delete
there are also protocol buffers for some
for having of course for also for it for
you you know my library's for Java for
Ruby there's one coming for D for dotnet
anything I've missed who's got a
language that they won't support for it
but I haven't mentioned
yeah I said I mentioned our own phrases
the first one I said I'd be fired later
on
a couple of interesting things about it
and Chris who's comin to speak actually
is going to talk about their the depths
of react pipe which is an
underprivileged member of the react
architecture because we haven't been
talking about it and the truth is I
think most of the companies that we've
been working with on react how sort of
overlooked it but recently it's come to
the fore and Chris is going to explain
why we think it might become very useful
I mentioned the the products we've built
so far so I'll skip on to a few use
cases if I have time so the two first
use case I want to talk to you about for
the cloud storage product this is the
object storage platform that you can put
in your own server room so Yahoo Japan
and also AT&amp;amp;T have set up their clad oh
I'm very about slide I'm sorry what this
says is that eighteen sees cloud storage
platform which competes with Amazon is
built on unrealized storage reacts yes
but I'm sorry about that
with the react database there are few
use cases that I think might be
interesting to some of you ATT have an
EM health platform which is a consumer
facing up and it's HIPAA compliant a
couple of people everyone we're talking
about compliance for thought I did
include this this essentially is an
application that you use every day if
you're concerned about being healthy and
when you go to your clinician and you go
to your GP or your doctor you can bring
the information from the end up with you
just be diagnosis and to help the doctor
understand your lifestyle
sensor data seems to be one of the areas
that is causing this massive
acceleration in unstructured data growth
to Metra is a company in Ireland which
is reading water meter gas meter and
electricity meters probably the
information from almost every home in
Ireland currently moving into the UK
soon - a central repository and allowing
the water companies the gas companies
new electricity companies to you request
reports from the system so that they can
project trends so that they can do some
individualization and and so on growing
very rapidly and one of the reasons that
to Metro chose this is because the data
is streaming and from the meters all the
time they need a system that's very
highly available that will never go down
boxer who's heard of Buxar walkie-talkie
apologize I think it's like number of
five or six most popular number four it
says on the slide most popular app on
the App Store and Lux was an interesting
one for us it's again going five
terabytes a day and they take up in the
user community was so rapid in the
beginning that they really needed
something that was operations friendly
which is the main reason they say that
they chose RIA and the CTO tweeted a
couple of weeks ago that in his primary
a cluster he had 17 nodes go down at
once what his system kept running it was
a little bit slower than it should have
been but it it remained alive remained
accepting of reads and writes
I really heard of them 7 concept iphone
app a Windows Phone and I actually
resent that everybody helps pad iPhone
applications but the threat is 800
million pieces of structural data and
react so stuff that you upload from your
telephone essentially a very low latency
when you're dealing with consumer based
applications one of the important things
is to have your data close to your
end-users to minimize latency and that's
what one post on Comcast good project
for us we're delighted to have them as a
customer and they migrated from Amazon
s3 which isn't really our goal you know
we're very big fans of Amazon so our
message to people isn't get off Amazon
and come to us but there are times when
hosting your data in your own data
center is preferable to use in the
public cloud and you know it was very
nice new customer for us to have for
that use case
again best buy which we spoke that I
already saw skip of I'll finish on this
one this is interesting for me because
this is a a use case for rent calm and
it's about interest graphs an interest
graph is an analysis of you as an
individual and your interests mind
through your search patterns so
essentially they look at what are you
interested in over time and they build a
picture of what you might be interested
in future this is an area that's going
to explode we're told the IU CEO has
been talking a lot about it recently and
I'd be particularly keen to talk to
anybody in the audience who maybe is
thinking about interest graphs I think
it's a really interesting use case and
we'd like to learn more about it so in
summary
we have found on clusters of service
it's highly available its schema-less
it's fast it scalable developer family
operations friendly and that's why I
titled the presentation you need react
we've got version 1.3 coming out this
week so for those of you who I haven't
been talking to for the last 20 minutes
because you've already got react and
production and you know more better than
I do
here's a little bit of news if this news
for you thumbs up if you didn't know
this was coming out this week about 200
people for the hands up there so the
thing that we're most excited about is
at fancy entropy there are already
features in react to help essentially
maintain the integrity of your data
we're improving that now significantly
and we'd be happy to talk to you about
that a third scenario you're interested
in the other area where we've put a lot
of work into which is an enterprise
feature ceuta by enterprise version of
react to get this is improved
replication performance between data
centers so we built a product with the
idea in mind that people would use this
replicate from one data center to
another but increasingly what people are
doing with this is they're offloading
for reporting purposes so they're
replicating from one react cluster to
another nearby and then they're doing
some work so it may be some heavy
MapReduce jobs
recon our IC o---- n is coming to Europe
it was launched in the States last year
is we believe the first distributed
systems conference first distributed
systems developer conference and we have
a venue which is London City but we
don't have a date it will it will be
maybe towards October and if any of you
are interested in an invitation so that
please let us know before you leave and
we'll make sure that we email you when
the event becomes available we held it
in San Francisco last year it sold out
it we have hundreds and hundreds of
developers all of our investors and
partners speaking lots of customers
coming to talk about the challenges and
solutions that they've found and it's
like a react tech talk only on a very
grand scale and it seems to be well
worth while the feedbacks really good if
you are interested in looking at react
for your own use cases one of the things
that you might find is it's hard to
explain back at work why you should use
maybe or why you should use react we'd
like to support you with that so if you
would like partial engineers to come and
talk to your team's about your use cases
and how react might help then you can go
to this link and we will be absolutely
delighted to come and help you do that
this is something that we do all the
time we've got dedicated engineers for
this role and you know the more of these
we do the better
so I'll finish I'll give you back a few
minutes but before I do it does anybody
have any questions that you want to ask
right now
okay so which aspect ever to be driving
folks on Saturday it's a key/value
database where the data that you you you
can put a the energy using the HTTP call
and it will be in the form of a key and
a value so the key might be the Stewart
McCall and the value might be my address
but in fact the value can be JSON so you
can put almost any data into the
database into that value space we
organize those keys and parties and
pockets and it's a very simple
coordinate system so if you've come from
sort of the audio or DBMS world you use
the sequel one of the one of the
differences you'll find is that the
reacts not a database where you want to
do transactions but when you think about
your use cases you might find that a lot
of your use cases would actually fit a
key value database system because in a
lot of use cases all you're really doing
is reading and writing data
yeah unconscious that I don't want to
serve any systems although that are
developed or emotional and in the next
two about the fact explain what will
download system is another
so hopefully that will answer your
question but if not we can spend time
later on anybody else
okay thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
