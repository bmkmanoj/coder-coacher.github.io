section which is
models what I want to do in this section
is to talk a bit about general
principles what a client-server model is
and then to talk through a particular
example of what we call the frequency
server so a client-server model
typically is is as it illustrated here
we have a single server which provides
services to a number of different
clients and clients use used resources
provided by the server in some sense or
another and the typical interaction we
have between clients and the server is
that a client sends a request message to
the server and the server replies to
that providing a service or handling a
handling a resource
so typically this is a message passing
interface so the client sends a request
message of some sort to the server and a
reply is sent back to the client now
typically this sort of message passing
is hidden in a functional interface if
you remember when we talked when you
first introduced concurrency we looked
at the example where we sent from the
shell bear send and receive expressions
in the shell but we saw very quickly
that it was much more elegant he was
much clearer to hide those that message
passing behind a functional interface
we'll see that in the example we look at
here and it's in a typical client-server
systems there are two models one is an
asynchronous model where a client can
issue a request and doesn't need to wait
for a reply before it continues or the
synchronous model where a client is user
requests and wait synchronously until it
receives a reply to its request now
let's take a look at an example what we
see here is the clients are mobile
phones and they are requesting from a
server a allocation of a particular
frequency and that's behind the server
perhaps it's a database or some sort of
some sort of mass storage but as far as
we're concerned here we have a number of
client processes which will send
messages to a single server process
which will reply to those and you can
see that two sorts of messages get sent
a client can ask for a frequency two
frequency to be allocated and typically
in that case they all get a reply which
says ok here's a frequency they may get
a reply saying error I've allocated all
my frequencies that's a possibility but
what we would hope is that in most cases
a client will indeed get a frequency
allocated to them the second case is one
where a client who's had a frequency
allocated to them says I want to
deallocate this frequency and
we would expect is for the reply from
the server to be ok that's done so there
we see this on this interface and in
this case what we've got is a
synchronous behavior that the client
will will wait for a reply and here we
see a typical message sequence chart for
the client and server we start off by
the client sending a request it says I
would like a frequency here's my PID and
the third part of the messages allocate
so it's saying I would like frequency
and then what we expect to see is a
reply so wrapped up in a tuple beginning
with reply is either the tuple ok
frequency or they tuple error no
frequency and then subsequently what we
might see is a request again from the
same client PID to the server saying
could you please deallocate the
frequency I've got and that's a reply
from the server saying ok so there we
see the the pattern of messages the flow
of messages between the client and the
server between a particular client
because there will be a number of
clients but for each of them we'll see a
similar pattern of interaction just
before we talk about the the structure
of the the code itself I just wanted to
remind you of the process skeleton that
we saw in the section on concurrent
programming that a typical pattern for a
process in in this case a typical
pattern for a server process is that we
we start the process by calling spawn or
as we've seen just now perhaps form link
and then we initialize the server in
some way by setting up the initial state
and then we loop and what we do in the
loop is receive messages and handle them
in an appropriate way and then for some
messages some message will will cause
the the loop to terminate and when we do
that we clean up
termination so that's the remember
that's the skeleton we've seen before
let's have a look at what the code for
the frequency server looks like well
here we can see what are the from the
functions that we we export from this
export start and stop we export in it
and also an allocate and deallocate
function now let's have a look at what's
happening first of all in the start what
we're doing here is we're going to spawn
the whatever's in the init function so
this is precisely as we saw in the
template and then we're registering that
process as calling it frequency and what
we do in the init function is we set up
some initial frequencies but what we do
is we our state here is a pair of lists
the list of frequencies which are not
allocated and frequencies which are and
so we initialize this with the
frequencies 10 up to 15 as being
unallocated and an empty list of already
allocated frequencies and then what will
happen is that we will loop through that
so the server that's the server's state
and each iteration of the loop will will
see that state change in some way now
the client functions we have a function
which we call to to stop the server we
have a function we call to allocate and
a function we call to deallocate a
particular frequency we've put those
behind a single a single function called
call and what called us is send messages
to the server so let's have a look at
what called us with a particular message
what it does is whatever the message is
it sends that message wrapped up with
the Adam request and a PID of the client
together with the message gets sent to
the frequency server and then what we do
is we receive replies which are wrapped
up in a reply tuple we pull off that
initial Adam
and in return simply the second
component there so what call does is
it's just send messages to messages of a
particular form to the frequency server
and process the response that's a
synchronous call we send a message and
wait to receive the result and the reply
function what we've done here is wrap up
inside a functional interface sending a
reply message to a particular PID so
instead of saying PID pling reply paired
with a particular message we call the
function reply with that PID and message
so those are going to be used the reply
is going to be used by the loop let's
see what the loop does because this is
the this is where all the work goes on
inside the frequency server and you can
see that there are three sorts of
message we can send we can send a we can
send a request to allocate a PID a
request to deallocate a particular
frequency and a request to stop let's
look at the stop case first what happens
in the stop case is we simply reply okay
to the client and terminate so that
indeed terminate the loop in the other
two cases we will have a tail call as
the last thing in our body we will call
the loop again so let's have a look at
what happens in the in the allocate case
what we do is we generate a new new
frequencies data that's allocated and
unallocated frequencies and a reply by
calling the function allocate and then
we send the reply back to the client and
then we call the the loop with that new
set of frequencies which have been
allocated and D allocated when we do a
similar thing in the D allocation case
so we handle those those particular
messages to allocate and deallocate by
calling these local functions allocate
and deallocate
so the final bit of the jigsaw here is
to define those functions and what we do
here we see a bit of pattern matching if
you remember that
the frequency's is a pair of two lists
the first lists are is this list of
frequencies that are not yet allocated
and the second is those that are already
allocated and we pattern match on that
first list if that list is empty then
all we can do is keep the frequencies as
they are and send a reply saying error
we've got no frequencies left on the
other hand if there are some frequencies
left what we do is we pattern match on a
non-empty list and the first element in
that non-empty list becomes the
allocated frequency and the remaining
frequencies stay as free and we make
sure that the the one we've allocated
goes now into the allocated list in the
case of D allocation we use a library
function from the lists library which is
used to as you can see in the previous
example what happens is that we store
frequencies which have been allocated
together with the PID to which they were
allocated we use key delete to ensure
that we delete the frequency and it's
allocated PID from the list of allocated
frequencies and then put the freed
frequency into the list of unallocated
frequencies so here we're doing it's
these it's on these two in these two
functions what we're doing is
manipulating the state data moving
things from free to allocated and vice
versa in the but in the previous
examples what you see is this pattern of
request and response send a request of a
certain sort process that requests to
produce a new piece of state data which
here is the new frequencies reply and
then loop on those new frequencies and
that's very typical of server
Avia in Erlang so just to summarize what
we've covered here is a an example of a
client-server model where the clients
are requesting frequencies from a server
and the server is allocating and
deallocating those as appropriate
