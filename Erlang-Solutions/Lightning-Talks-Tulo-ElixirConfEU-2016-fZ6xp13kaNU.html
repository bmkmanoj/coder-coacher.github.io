is too low I've developed again last
week for this study stock and it's a
massive multiplayer online game based on
classic minesweeper this is how the game
looks like you are you have had a
virtually infinite world it's built
right because of the memory you have fun
and Undertaker enter a number of bits
from JavaScript side and everyone plays
in the everyone play in the same in the
same the same arena so how how is it
down using Alex serum Phoenix and all
that kind of stuff this kind of work you
cannot words words the channel game work
breaking the world in in little pieces
called tiles and it's peace it's going
to click to a channel like being a room
in a in a chat exactly the same so this
is how it looks the channels there so
that's the ring and the channels then
everyone every every every moment when
join into the game knows what what he
said what he sing and he can move and
see another tiles and then he joins to
the to the tiles to the tiles he sees so
i can show you maybe yeah okay here it
is so i can look there as you can see in
the end of the top so the two of us play
the same the same more
you can see the thing everyone makes at
the moment it's not a real game Lily
serves as a thing to learn from and with
how it works you see you know you are in
a position in the world so use you know
which ties you see so when you join you
get okay detail in the in the b12 world
and then it responds with the values of
the time then you render on your client
and every time someone touch when 11
value it is it can be a bomb well it
gets guess the time you are touching it
can be a bomb so you die it can be a
account so you update the value or do
nothing if something that anyone has
touched before so anytime some someone
show something weird at the tile and
broadcast to everyone so that's how it
works you have a live demo in this
webpage you can try and you can break it
because for sure it will break and you
have the source code on github and there
is my my Twitter account if you want to
talk to me take pretty much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
