not what your airline can do for you so
what would this be about just start with
a definition what I think we can say on
your anger is so say that rancor is
someone who uses and promotes healing so
is these two parts on that and assume
there are some Wranglers in the room so
this has been asked before but I see
some suffering of people around hope so
how many of you are using our long I'd
like to do so okay so how many of you
are here because you don't know where
long and you would like to learn more
about that just one anyway we have
representatives of both groups so that's
good so what's happening here sorry
there move it okay my sly someone to
move yeah one second sorry there
having some technical problems
what hope it works anyway I need to not
synchronize I need to keep both in line
now so as long as we like to start a
lamp rackets and the other side of that
easily they also like to convince others
that they should do that as well so if
some of you who are in the small group
of people that no no airline ask any
wise from the other group what to do
about your next project or how to solve
a certain problem then you probably will
see that language like advise you to use
airline will probably back you to use
airline or even threaten you if you
don't use Aaron I will never talk to you
again if you end up using Java or
something else yeah that's sweet of
exaggeration but is what happens in real
life when we are like in problem solving
groups we have some trying to solve and
we are like trying to promote the best
technology for that so we we are going
to be obviously biased with the good
things about darlin so this a list of
things that we are always going to
mention that provide you know by heart
is language fault or not it's functional
distributed scalable all these goodies
and then we are probably going to be
successful convincing people to use it
because of that so however atom project
may fail eventually so may you may not
believe that sometimes they do and this
is interesting because there is usually
much more abundant information about
things that go well done and things that
go right there go wrong sorry so we
don't very often see reports about
failed project so that things that
didn't come out as good as they should
and also references like bias so it's
difficult to admit that the parade has
failed because of that even for price
that are not as good as we thought they
should we may come up with special bits
of that that are good
and this is the one that the other ones
that we report in conferences papers or
talks cetera so from the outside is
typically a much brighter image of
what's going on in those place than what
actually are inside so for the purposes
of this talk I want you to consider our
file trade some right where we are not
comfortable working with we know that is
delivering much more pain than it should
and I we see probably things that we
thought should have happened even happen
and what happens in those cases when we
suggested that the which would yours
around airline fails somehow damn it oh
no people would blame us for suggesting
this technology and what's even worse
they could blame airline itself because
we have said things that should happen
that didn't happen so they would claim
that darling is copy as these concrete
specific file private actually proves
which is not fair and we don't want that
to happen so
what can we do about that obviously we
know that just choosing a good language
is not good enough right there are a
number of engineering practices that we
have to apply so we can increase our
chances of success and when airline when
I got an braids face if you are involved
in that the lamplight and you have not
yet joined the around attractors group
you will resume allowed those things and
we do we'll have a little rest of
retrospective anything maybe yeah our
testing was not strong enough or the
architecture was weak or we didn't put
enough time thinking all that or all
those issues that make a private fail
will come up to the seeing and we will
claim that it's not actually Airlines
fault or any other than Allah what using
that has failing as that is something
that we could have done better there and
if this is the case of course we can
just apply that in the successful case
when Sun a vampirate goes well it's not
only about that one right so this a lot
of things that we have to considering a
project that have to be done correctly
so that we increase it increase the
chances of having success there so what
I want to do here in this dog is cover
the specific qualities of feran that are
can of relevant and that affect the
shapes of the price we rank and we have
both advantages that we can use but we
need to use to make them reflect a
sexual benefits and of course aaron has
some weaknesses that we need to take
care to avoid them making operates fail
and feed with arguments to those that
want to criticize the technology itself
so yes to put things in context this
mind that we are in this situation that
we have a opportunity to start writing
or company and we are in good situations
because company has a problem to solve
and we have enough trust so we can
decide what to use there and what's the
problem they want to solve so the
problem is
that they have a current version of
certain sulfur diesel exhaust which is
an instance of one of these mythical
beasts we call legacy when we speak
about that with mixture mixture of
height and sorrow the sad part is that
every company that has a sixth it for
long enough will have at least one of
those monsters like under the roof or in
the cellar but a good part is that at
least yeah since like I see so bad you
can just patch it continuously without
being afraid of hurting someone's
feelings and this is a good way just to
convince everyone that this completely
unfixable and then of course you will
come up with a better solution for that
which is rebuilding it because obviously
is retaining a vastly inferior language
that is not that one that's probably a
language that is not even functional and
they'll be used things like loops with
something horrible and mutable values
mutable sounds like a horror movie and
they have shared a status I don't know
who that could work ever so because of
that the code ends up being so
complicated that central Iowa
maintainable and like this picture is
something that you see that it works but
when you look at it it really shouldn't
nice so you don't know what's going on
there and yeah people then don't even
they are twitching that for correcting
whitespace services like stay at CC as
it is it can only go worse yeah um also
obviously is super heavy and slow so
it's using inferior technology so we
cannot work the only way to make it work
is as buying more expensive hardware and
to scale it up which is painful and
obviously has a limit so
since this is a mess you have the
solution which is of course reveal
eating airline this is going to solve
all the problems first because airline
is fault tolerant so we are not going to
have more vaccine production supervisors
are going to take care of that so that's
one problem solved that's good segun
rung it scales very well everyone knows
that so we are going to scale to
infinity second problem solved it is
functional obviously so the code is
going to be so clean and neat that
adding features is going to take hours
if not minute we have all these nice
properties that everyone knows how to
use and then just the icing on the cake
has hot coal loading so even for
maintenance or to a great the software
we don't have to take the assistant down
so we are truly speaking about one
hundred percent up time here so
obviously that's the solution you want
to go and all these reasons you just
create an awesome piece of software even
in this tangent not promised everything
goes I suspected your system is rock
solid I in some amazing piece of
engineering so that's the end of story
right why are you laughing so how many
of you think that this is not likely to
happen come on we're using our line of
course I don't think that this is going
to happen so yeah yeah oops you are
probably going to say like well so we
are experiencing some life disturbances
production issues or or you can to call
bugs and then those guys are going to
comment saying I'll tell us that the
lung is fault tolerant so what's going
on here those are false can hopping also
that yeah we might have
a little bit of trouble yes handing the
expected low for this year and then the
same guys we say but you tell us that
you're going to write this in Elam you
can see the scales so what's what's
missing here I mean sometimes it's even
possible that you have to say well
cannot really do that change that fast
so the thing is that the the one who
wrote that just left and Cody's little
bit messy and we don't really understand
that and I guess is like they will come
and say what didn't you write it in
airline this you line two US dollars
that is functional how come that you
cannot read that code it's functional
code what's going on here so is anyone
here more familiar with the situation
and the unicorns and rainbows thing I
need to find it I thought it was only me
well yeah so obviously we know that dang
is not the magic wand right it's a tool
for writing software writing software is
still hard is easier when you write you
choose the right tool but is hard and it
sounds very obvious when we say that I'm
not saying anything new I hope the
problem is that after repeating and
repeating the good things all the time
there are people that kind of end up
believing that especially the
non-technical stakeholders I have heard
that many times from people from
businesses lad not yet just rethinking
everything is not going to crash it's
like man yeah sure it's good for us like
they believe that but sometimes it
affects us as developers as well because
we kind of rely too much on the
technology and forget about of or good
all engineering practices and this is
bad for airline itself to saying it
creates these situations where people
like thing now it doesn't really work
it's all lies which is not
so let's go up to our the benefit of
using airline and try to reformulate
them in a more credible way just for us
and don't tell this to the business guys
keep it in mind so we said that that
long is fault tolerant I I guess that we
mean here is that telling helps building
fault tolerant systems it has tools and
concepts that make it easier to reason
about fault tolerance but that doesn't
mean that any software eating airline is
going to be any fault tolerant at all so
for example you have code reading for
thinking something really horrible C++
but with the strong focus on fault
tolerance with a group that is a group
of engineers that are solid and have
been doing that for a while you compare
that to an airline prayed that has been
hacked in a weakened by a couple of
students that didn't know much about
software yet so it's not going to be a
surprise at the C++ software is going to
be more robust and fault-tolerant a
teller software which is something that
sounds really striking but I don't think
anyone here with respect otherwise so
the first thing that we hear hear is
that well you can just let it press and
it will work because you have
supervisors that's something that's very
common to see reading and said in
conferences I think that is I can say
that is a lie don't throw things at me
yet it is not only that just by letting
it price is not going to be faltered and
we of course this is a good it's a good
principle it means not being defensive
but it's not the whole story there is
much more than you have you have to do
there so first of all is really true
that with airline you can recover
assisting pretty easily from a failure
in a process but that comes with the
precondition that you knew somehow that
that good path could be failing there
and you knew how to recover that
sometimes it's easy sometimes it's not
as easy so if you know a code part that
is going to depend
on a reliable hardware or unreliable
software or requires input from the
outside that can be incorrect it's
pretty easy to write software there that
hyundai's letting a little process and
if it crashes then you have supervisors
that will start it somehow I maybe you
need to do some cleanup but writing
software it is robust and falta learning
in general is much much harder and that
I think apart from letting in class and
having supervisors implies other good
practices that are not specific to a
language is isolating features like
having clean epi is having avoiding
processes that do too much thinking
about the supervisor and risk but this
is Alan specific but you have to get all
those things correct so that you have
more chances to recover from bugs
because in that sense those are problems
that you are not really expecting you
may have some intuition where they could
come from but you need to have a clean
software structure to be able to recover
from most of those cases it's part of
the design and it doesn't just happen
for using a long and letting it crash
because obviously this poison that that
line is not going to design the rest
rata G for you just a nice very nice
tool to implement it so properly used
airline simplifies these compared to
almost any other language or at least
any other language that I know but it
doesn't free you from thinking a bit
beforehand what's the strategy here so
one problem that I very often see is
that we somehow started to believe that
is possible to just write the good cases
and let it crash everywhere with but
matches like okay equal blah blah and
then the later stage we can just slap
around hunting on top of that angling we
are going to get fault tolerant and
robust services Alice in my experiences
it doesn't work because then you are
high level of higher abstraction level
and you don't have information about
what happened under the roof you will
have crises that are all the same being
it bugs being expected problems like not
having
I sang we're being being it probably
sing a parser so how can you recover
from that at that point you will end up
like trying to catch too much in order
to recover from the scenes that you know
you could recover you're very likely to
start catching also backs that you
didn't know we're there I'm masking then
so they have like weird effects later on
in some other code path they are going
to be very difficult to spot and more
difficult to debug and these ghost wars
and worsen it n apps with software that
is not really fault tolerant even though
is rethinking our so it just boils down
to saying that it's not trivial to
design a good application and
supervising here so we have the tools to
do that but we still need to iterate a
bit over then put quite conscious effort
on doing it right if you want those
tools to become actual benefits and show
the world that they're long is actually
fault tolerant so yeah I'll on a nasty
part of this thing is that I think it's
rather difficult to test which makes it
even easy even more difficult to get it
wrong is there is much more cases where
you can fail then cases where you are
correct so writing the test here is kind
of thick so we also said that airline is
a long ass case well let's have it found
it a bit weird when i try to map it to a
something i can like think is correct
and we can use to build on and come to
that level because the closest iphone is
that a lie helps to use SMP cpus
efficiently which is right yeah we have
this nice model were half isolated
processes we know that those processes
running single course we know that the
scheduler is song how far and this with
little
of effort of course but the song is 10
helps us building algorithms that will
utilize a fair number of course rather
easy compared to what we would need to
do in other language but either them
distribute some work you see that too
explicit or too abstract so this part is
I think it's quite fair to say that this
angle I advantage that inside a SNP CPU
we have a very nice model to utilize all
the resources there however problem
concert today when we talk about the
scaling is very likely that we are
talking about the scaling out so here
using the resources in a single core
wearing a single node is still very
important of course but it's not the
whole story and we are talking when we
are talking about the scaling out I
don't see airline specifically playing a
big role here this is more how you
design the distributed application how
do you make sure that you have
communication bottlenecks hold connect
everything to a network how do you avoid
single points of failure how you recover
from that nose etc etc etc could you
make sure that adding more knowledge is
going to scale close to linearly all
those things you can't do with any
language you want it's true that airline
helps a bit with the transparent
distribution but still if you just used
inspiring distribution blindingly you
are very likely to end up having
communication bottlenecks and messes
like even a nose having too many
chatting and things like that so I think
we have gone a bit overboard here and we
have tabulated the true fact that the
ranks k is quite nicely in SMP
processors or in multi-core processors
to the it more difficult to buckle at
least fact that Darren sk is nicely out
so the positive thing I can find here is
at least I think that this is true
the LM model the actor model we used to
program our applications and to make
better use of SMP processors it's rather
similar to this one of the models we can
use to build this video plication said
distribute the applications are just
collections of nodes that don't share
anything between each other and that
communicate sending messages so
basically we have if we are used to well
and we have the modeling or heads so we
have this indirect benefit coming from
it so maybe this is what makes this
claim to appear so often among their own
strength finally the functional part are
not final yet but we have said that the
airline code is clean and concise more
or less and sufficient to write write
clearly we mean that helps writing
concise and easy to understand code but
this means of course that you have to
know how to write clean code yourself
and you have to know that anyone that's
going to touch the code in the code base
have now is how to do that because there
is nothing on this by viewing Ireland
not prevent to prevent spaghetti i
believe is quite easy to write spaghetti
airline and this I've seen quite song
spaghetti there so if you don't prevent
that you will have that in your code
base and then you will not be true that
airline code is clean and easy to read
so this is the obvious cling of the day
the point here is just that the
implication goes inductor ASEAN if you
know who to write clean code if you know
all the principles as you pray apply
then doing it in Erlang is probably
easier but is for sure easier than doing
that thing all the languages like for
into the other extreme like parallel c
or bash there you can still apply the
principles that is much much much harder
so Alan helps a lot here
but sometimes you get the implication
reversed like reading about Ellen
benefits out there and this is not true
and becomes a little bit dangerous
because then some people just believe
that they don't need to care just
because they are writing the coding
error and there is another point of did
of this aspect is we said that darling
while we say obvious that the longing
code is sufficient to write that's
correct a so if you compare it to the
languages that are more Barbosa more
cumbersome you need to apply obviously
fewer effort to get the same amount of
features which is obviously good
especially at the beginning of the
project when you have a small other head
and by overhead I mean anything else
that's not creating features including
mid-teens fixing bugs discussing with
bosses or clients whatever so the
winning of the plate is going to be a
significant benefit from using efficient
languages like darling or any other
high-level language that is reasonable
the problem is and is probably the most
important part this talk is that as the
pray it goes through those other heads
are going to be monstrous anyway no
matter what you do you can just try to
make them smaller and that's that has
very little to do with the language you
choose is more about the practices you
apply in there in the language in the
prior sorry so the point here is that
these choices like the language we
choose other technology Isis end up
having very little impact if we run a
long project and if we don't manage to
control this thing here we will end up
like fishing box all the time and
discussing features and implementing
things that we don't need having people
moved around things because managers or
whatever want to do that or live in the
company and coming May having to hire
new people that don't know the software
etc etc then these green things are not
going to move they are going to move a
little bit faster with our London with
the others
but over the lifespan of the pride they
are not going to make a big difference
so the thing is this is this part where
we should focus on once we have done the
right choices in technology and makes
made sure that we are using the
technology the best way we can okay so
finally hot cocoa oding the this a bit
different compared to Dallas is a killer
feature there's nothing to say about
that however my point here is I believe
that for most of the bride's the impact
throughout this is fairly low unless you
find a specific scenario to leverage it
like we saw in the in the keynote so
what do I mean with that first thing
obviously comes very handy for the
bugging there is no discussion about
that you can even change the code in the
production servers I not sure whether
that's good or bad but you can do that
but if you are relying into this to have
an application that is always running in
a single machine then you would need to
do a ton of work on top of that
this is a prerequisite but you need much
more things to make this real so having
application running a single machine
24-7 is very very hard and it's not only
about how you're right application is
about how you handle the underlying
operating system how you handle
migrations between data centers for
example is a very very hard problem to
solve if you want to do that then hot
cool loading is obviously a feature that
is really really needed is a strong sell
point for airline however if you manage
to not do that is often much easier to
have a distributed application where you
can just take individual notes down
without killing the service legend
obviously so most I guess this is what
most people do this is what I think
think yes here in this scenario hot
reloading is still nice because you can
use it for debugging or for doing like
night nice tricks here and there but
it's not actually asked relevant as we
seem to imply when we mention it among
the most relevant benefits out of
Ireland because for this scenario is not
actually his benefit it's nice thing to
have but is not a huge benefit okay so
that those were my points for the good
parts we obviously need to go through
some bad parts and here the the idea is
the opposite those but parts are some
are things that we can control so we can
avoid those but parts that people are
going to wave against our decision and
prevent them from becoming actual
problems so there are just things that
we have to take care about a natural
problems will mean that these red other
had seen grows so this is the thing that
we don't want the first in my list and
this is this is not what I often see in
lists about in these kind of blog posts
or talks that say everyone sucks so the
first in my contacts list is dynamic
typing as well that is not often
mentioned this is weird for me because
is the for me is the worst offender the
biggest thing that creates overhead in
the prides apart from all the social
management things like how to handle
teams and communication technically this
is the part of Berlin that causes more
trouble at least for me and think yes
it's not an advantage I think eventually
places where they claim that this is
here because we want that well at least
I don't think so it's a compromise so I
by having a loser type system it's
easier to implement other things in the
language the vm the compilers etc but
this means that we are now prone to a
class of
is that can be avoided in other
languages so this is not good comparing
when you compare airline to a statically
typed languages course because of this
you have other features that you can use
have points as points to see that
airline is a stronger but that is where
the compromise comes the actual input is
that as the software materials on this
project goes on if you don't if you
don't have any missions to control this
then you will find yourself fixing more
and more and more bugs that are actually
typing arrows those bags couldn't be
there if our language not dynamic that's
what I mean that this is a witness and
also you may find yourself in the typing
in your head so you may find yourself
trying to understand with a piece of
code does everyone have typing
information there then you will need to
go deep in the code and try to find out
what kind of values several could have
or go out from the code trying to
understand what kind of values that
function is to handle and that's mental
effort that you good i need to do if you
were using other type of languages so
what to do here at least what i try to
do is try to keep typing in my head well
while I'm doing when I'm writing a line
so not try to think that because of
airline is dynamic you can just type
whatever you want and you are free from
the type insisting because the types are
going to either you like it or not is
just they are in visual and you don't
handle then they are going to be crappy
and if we could do Honda and this means
more than just Ryan dialyzer and having
type specs which you should be doing of
course it means thinking about having by
cling a pH got a types are clear using
robust a DTS maybe you need to use the
commendation or code conventions to make
sure that the types are cohesive across
your application domain i said that i
said that i said so in short it means
not forgetting about types just because
our line is dynamic and try to prevent
that quickness
creep into your code base this other one
is very popular this is as opposed to
dynamic typing is very often mentioned
that the long is tooling is weaker than
for more popular languages of course
this is an effect yes of being people
people writing libraries and but I'll
testing them so there's not much we can
do here is the price for not being
mainstream so that's what we have first
of all you just need to be aware that
library support might be immature or
simply missing and why I'm mentioning
this here is that just when you are
trying to promote airline you will need
to be realistic here and handle
expectations about this as well is you
otherwise you made up you may end up
finding yourself implementing some piece
of the software that is not really core
I'm having to report that to your
stakeholders being in dying investors
managers friends or whatever so this is
something that we need to handle on take
care of properly the other more
technique the concrete problem is that
releasing and packaging in the last is
typically painful is normally more
difficult than people think beforehand
so this usually raises problems later in
the project and is not by any means an
unsolved problem there are definitely
ways of doing so but it's not very
standardized so it depends quite a lot
on the type of project you are running
and the release pipeline you end up
using so you just need to know that you
may end up trying to figure out a nice
way of doing this somewhere in your
project so here I think that best
practice could be like just try to do
that very early in the stages of the
prior try to start building the ultimate
this release pipeline so you have this
push only thing that everyone wants and
it's a bit easier to do when the
software that you want to deploy and the
system where you want to deploy to are
not very complex so the beginning of the
private is very nice
time to do that and also there you will
have more times to iterate over that and
profit it so that when the software and
the system you want to employ a really
complex and really awesome you don't
need to care about how to avoid running
five different scripts and ten manual
interventions every time you want to do
a release there's no up to today I don't
think there is a solution that is agreed
to be sort of universal foreigner here
okay this is the other issue that I'm
very often see causing overhead inbreds
is that encapsulation model for our line
is not that great it's not super
horrible but it's not something that's
going to help a do specifically
designing and keeping the structure of
your software so if you don't put some
effort they can get of this you will end
up with very funny messes so well as you
know just have flat module namespace
public-private encapsulation for
functions this means that you have very
little to play with if we want to imply
some liar architectural structure in the
software we have inside the language so
all that effort has to go outside
somehow and this means that you just
need to be serious about the
architectural structure and have some
sort of control there outside of the
language using name conventions or
documentation or tools or whatever you
want to use to make sure that everyone
that reaches the code base knows what's
acceptable dependency and was not an
acceptable dependency Excel wise it will
bring on giving maybe implement the
phils pershing of this and then after
three years you will end up having that
ball of mud which is really horrible and
it's something that you don't want to
show tune on Ellen people when you want
to convince the not that long is great
top of that you may even think of using
tools here and then the good part about
the good thing about darling is that
those tools are I think are easy to
write what part is that there are not
that many so it's practical examples in
klarna we have one tool that we use to
try to enforce some reasonable layering
of the software controlling that we
don't have calls from say bottom layers
to the upper layers or from different
applications that are not supposed to
depend on each other that helps a bit
this this yacht application that helps
you well unless you declare up api's for
other applications and check that other
applications don't call anything that is
not the clearest API so all those
standard things that help preserving a
better structure of the code will help
you to avoid having overhead because of
this in the project so yes conclusion is
don't think and don't say that darling
is going to do things for you so don't
say that the ring is fault tolerant what
you can say that to longer than people
that don't say that to yourself yes say
that this a nice tool that you can use
to build awesome fault tolerance and
that's going to be on you which is
better I think when you're talking about
scalability just keep in mind that this
about the scaling on a single node where
our line is going to help a lot it's
going to help a little bit scaling out
but is a lot about how you design the
distributed application finally the code
is going to be cling only if you write
it cling that's obvious but sometimes is
understated and if you put an effort on
having clink out because you can do that
thing Alan ensuring that you have strong
fault tolerance because you have tools
to do that I'm making applications at
the scale of it because you don't have
to care much about the design because
you already know who to write agent
based systems and you prevent all the
problems coming from dynamic
typing the lack of encapsulation and you
manage to handle the witnesses in tools
thing is much more likely that your
airline pilot will succeed and you will
not end up in this horrible situation
where people think that the run is
crappy and you know is not so that's it
I don't know who we might have a thing
so I know it's lunch so remember to vote
if you stick off early and otherwise
it's time for questions there thank you
great talk lots of truths there and
wanting it up and notice is the I don't
know talking to our long developers I
find this I don't know a version against
thinking object orientation what are you
comments about that I mean we have
objects in our code it's just that we
don't have object-oriented language and
yeah are your reactions on that why I
hope no one throws anything at me but i
remember when i started writing airline
I was an avid reader of the of the
mailing list and at that time they were
quite common at every few weeks or every
week thinking about thread about object
orientation sucks is like wiring is much
better that was a bit shocking for me
because before doing that I out in my
mind that whoa a garland process is the
best object that I can implement today
with today's tools which were airing or
Java so before getting deep in the
community had in my head that a language
Matt was much more clean defining of
this the Java which was supposed to be
the object orientation paradigm that you
should use so my comments that is that I
think telling
if you manage to mix the good parts
about all these paradigms we know which
is sort of object orientation
concurrency functional programming and
use the right tools you may end up
building a stronger software and for me
in airline is very easy to think about
objects that are processes that
communicates any messages which much
very nicely to my too many principles
that you can suck from other parts of
the industry but don't know anything
about the elements they have some valid
insights about how to design systems in
the last and how to keep how to build
cling api's hope to handle dependencies
and all those things are typically
expressed in objects and I don't see any
reason why not to use all those in
genera because they map very very well I
will claim that they might be mapped to
a lung much nicer than they map to java
at least so yeah that's my comment I
don't know if I answer anything what was
my run then I guess we're done with the
questions thank you again very much and
