this beautiful new room that's that's
fantastic we help you organize that well
so I'm going to do the wrong thing i'm
going to give your presentation and I
demo some and less number one is never
do a demo during an important
presentation right so I'm going to do
that so I all we get things ready
because I have to type and with this
smart for a silly difficult we haven't
done all microphone this one I don't
know if you don't hear me shout okay I'm
gonna make it painful okay don't work
fantastic so let's see this works well
be yes the real so I'm not eat elevated
about quick check Andy unit and how
things can be combined this is a kind of
a food project we did together some
talks on one of the authors of jen i'm
looking probably notice professor at
university my name is tamas knox and our
with cubic I used to be professor
charles as well they couldn't that job
in general because this estimate or firm
so that's the reason our full-time now
do cute stuff and Pablo romaine lettuce
on most people's dreams of that one
which helped me implement is this part
new projector starts you so what is this
all about develops they do not human
test what so that's what we teach and
that's what the writer says write unit
tests and every developed knows that you
never work
because your time somehow management
thinks that is very important to learn
soccer quality but they never give you
talk to our tests so you write a few
tests and the question is how can we
help you to write a few more tests and
the ideas of course use quick checking
account read by projector and I'll not
go to tell you much about it i'll show
you a little bit so quick check is it
too which generates test automatically
for you of course you need to get so
much food as well you normally have to
write them all you have to write a
mobile and from that model you get your
test free for you right properties if
you like and I find that very simple and
engaging and I like writing properties
but some people have a bit of a trouble
right now because it's a shift of
mindset you have to think a little bit
different so it's a bit much so what we
did this step was then to let people
write tests let me run a few tests and
then use machine learning to learn from
the rest what probably the mobile behind
it is create the model your stricture to
generate contest shown to them that I
should've done up and say hey wouldn't
you test this as well computer for you
yes you test ever stop so that's the
whole door story so you use test you
learn from the best views learning
algorithm for that your visual large the
informations it it even if you don't
protest gently see what's happening and
then automatically propose a new test to
say hey should you test this so if you
want to read all the details on how this
is going on which algorithms
that's the rich publications in elma
workshop nation proceedings of 2001 the
former better 2011 and you will see how
it works okay what I do now is to show
you an example because I don't like to
show me you the elevators to use and all
the competitor I just not be showing
others their student practice see if you
can get a feeling would this be
something for me as well so as an
example we take a frequency server is a
very simple Alan program and if not
simple it needs some testing one and are
these that the server has a number of
radio frequencies and the mobile phones
they can talk to that stuff up and they
claim a frequency to talk and then when
it goes down they release the frequency
and that's it so that kind of systems is
typically a system you would implement
an hour and of course that's what we do
here and we took this example in the
book from some thousands and Francesca
Cicilline and I will just show your mind
Avant of tests ok so this system is a
state-based system rights in today's of
course of stick you have some
frequencies to Jennifer serve them and
they are taken and also free and you ask
for one you subjects now let's
concentrate first and four on the most
stupid thing you could do starting and
stopping a circle so somehow you have to
be able to do that so I'm now the
software developer here and I want to
write a proper I want write a test case
to start distort this earth now I'm a
very fast program and first looking
specification for that one that's kinda
see especially in sir okay that's four
functions start function you stop
function and algorithm the ugly and look
at the start and stop function and start
function takes an endless
and if it is true and the store function
always returns okay fine and I'm no
different places meaning like that so I
write my first test so this is my first
test it's brittany unit unit is nice
trailer for our contestants I wrote in
to be human you can also write it in the
government installer earrings nicer
because it is far framework to do so it
has some conventions that you can follow
this is an elephant you move you are
seen Alan forces before is this your
first introduction to Ella as you see
now on form this is an elephant and this
strange Metro discretion or a surf match
that's a unit telling that the left-hand
side should be equal to the right hand
sorts of battle match and it raises an
exception in the dispatch so basically
what we say we can start the server
without any animals but with an empty
list of frequencies this is a war guess
you're in testing people like to test
the water tests this is a water depth
tested and then we also test an onboard
case where your one element one
frequency that you cannot get in between
units stop sir we can't start but start
to surface stop it and start start and
then start again you only have to stop
didn't win and we also learn to clean up
after that we are done so we clean
energy so this is our first test duru
test I can't think of any other tests
and probably putting some more
frequencies in the list but then we
really have just this attitude so what
is then you would order the simplest
model that this test three presents so
what what can we actually test and
giving from the test case turns on can
we see what mobile I'll be actually
testing and the answer you don't have to
know now we will see that very soon so
what I want to do now if I can
is to demo this by running this test is
oman test at the moment i'll run this
test and then officialized the model
that my machine learning program goes
out there ya go to try to do the might
the night action work ok get out of this
one make sure I the mirroring home yep
I've never displeasure that's fun then I
see the same thing I should see that's
good so let's go into the tests I
prepared to solve every well so what is
doing is it runs the e unit test after
running the urine test its starts that
machine learning program learning from
the output of the test because we keep
the treasure to test from that learning
we make more than three steps in this
devil to minimize the risk the test post
fantastic and I started up visit this
picture and I hope it's big enough
complete make it much bit of it here we
are the minimum all that I have here is
to be starting an initial state we can
all do is stop or start fantastic that's
a proud that's all there is in that test
case we can order to restore horse time
in initial stage hmm some of you will
already now that's a big beer isn't it
then we can do this what we can do now
is to tell quick check well giving this
more what come to test case would you be
able to generate for us so we start pre
check with the model and this model of
em that I'm using now is
the new smaller after just come back so
while I was making this model I was also
combining into and business the new so i
can show you their comment indeed this
is not preview range but i'm making this
code on the fly unicorn fly and then
have none more so let's run great check
back of two tests that fits and what you
can see here is that you get a long test
case here right this is this is the
failing test me this is what quick check
fight giving this model it says I can do
start this guy can stop the server I can
start it again I can stop it stop it
start a stop-and-start dense fell it in
my walk the moment only once they've
delicious thing you can do all that
stuff so I propose this new test case I
proposed this test case as a test case
that you haven't talked but that's a lot
of big test case like and it doesn't
really make easy to understand why you
would add that task it but then quick
check is smart enough to start your
shrinking it's as well I can probably do
something small what about this one I
start in an empty state and I just stop
the server shouldn't that be an error
because I do get the narrow back you
know if I storm us the circus taught my
server without starting if i get an
error back so shouldn't you test it you
actually get the hell back isn't is
depth to correct behavior if you know
that's correct you could start stop
something which hasn't been started so
you actually say that's a good test case
so you go to your tests and this piece
where the test i was running I have to
stop stop testing and thence exactly the
one another and then
going to add the new test and in order
to again minimize the risk I take the
one that I here I couldn't go back to
that so here we are this is a getting
error if I'm only stop that's the test
case I want to do it that's okay all the
net and then I start demo again I how we
run all my tests and that's not to test
and hopefully they passed and if they
pass i will see another figure here than
the one before there we go to test
passed so machine learning and so are
you you mean that you're actually making
this system the system where you start
an initial state then you can either do
story you can you come into a narrow
state at this one you get into an outfit
or you start and then you get the
mistake and I have no clue but
apparently you can do stop and start in
that state however you want right that's
my next mod five add the test case I
learned from that again no more fine
what I'm going to do now is it what
that's fantastic with their run a few
more tests that you automatically
generates your I've star picture the new
creature for this new model and it
starts to set wait a minute now i get
this tester don't look at the top this
is bit boring but look at this one it
says actually in the empty state i can
actually stop the server and that's okay
it's not an error its match hmm we did
why is that so let's run more few tests
ah it says in the empty state i can know
to start i get an error back that's
weird isn't it so why is that that's
because our own a lot of tasks and those
tests are completely run and sometimes
are simply forget to clean up my mobile
hasn't said anything about cleaning up
there was no cleanup vote in that wall
so i don't clean up after my test the
test ends up in the interstate where it
has to be started then
first page comes in and propane stove
works or the star fails that's not
really not so my model is not good
enough I forget the cleaner foot so now
i can do two things all I think of some
cleanup code that i want to add and do
it they might play my tests and we'll do
that in a second or i can go if I mean a
bit more fast quick tickers I can go
look into the quick check out and look
at clean up this and then I ask this is
talking and I prefer to do the second
one just for sacred so I had a window
open here where we have all the clothes
and here we have this frequency see
which is today created two minutes ago
and that's the one that I go here is the
code so this is the model that i got
from the picture that you saw from the
test cases room and here we have some
some cleanups god but the cleanup is
actually doing not it one so i will stop
the server it just for the same so we
stopped serving the cleanup code and
then we wrinkle ball just ghosts don't
and now i just run creature and now i
get it all out so i get an error saying
that ok the first thing you do is you
start frequency that's ok you mention it
through and next one is that you get an
error it got started to serve when you
have started before and then the
questions okay that's that's not but we
shouldn't be able to do that so I'm
going to add this test as well I can
copy this test case and put it into my
suite or I can do something slightly
more plants I can use eat unit this has
to become close you're ready can you you
can do both a setup of something and
then running some code and then we will
stop so it's a special data structure
destroy being that first you do this
then your room whatever you have here
and in the end to cleaner by using this
code yeah
that's the most unit test frameworks
have data structure we can explain what
to do in which order and how to clean up
fine so this is confident our case that
I asked so let me see what what happens
there I don't have to demo didn't say it
I think so let's do that save this and
then I run three tests now a possible
tests and this is my more it looks much
better doesn't it occur even when I site
you can see that this is indeed what you
want to do you want to do if you start a
server then you go to a state number one
here and then you can stop it and of
course in English you stay together or
you can try to start again and then you
get to the error state and if you start
each day to go and saw it you end up in
the air estate as well much nice so do
we have enough tests now order is there
anything else we can tell from the
Moodle we would say but this is about it
point we can't do much more but let's
not just to be sure test this a bit more
ah right and then let's have a look at
the code that I change just before so
this was the coder hat but let's reopen
that one because I changed it for disk
let's eat first we throw a very long I
will have to read the new code and as
you can see i added something actually
in the cleanup code because I understood
this a unit test I will stand as a
center and stare down and at Iran's
cleanup code so let's take that clean so
I added that already in my bowl because
it is in the test cases okay so no
worries there this will work possibly
test
another test so this really works so
that's that's the ID go back to my
slacks for a second okay so what I did
show was that you you run the tests you
visualize the model you try to fit from
the simplest model that you get to
understand in SF and be kind of behavior
than I expect you could already see from
the picture but well probably are
missing something but instead of
thinking part of the book that I should
I actually out here we just left good
check give you a test basis which makes
sense in that context so quick check
makes automatic tests from specification
and as first patient is to come thing
you saw in the dinner instead that's
more we create that more by using she
learn while we were running the tests we
wrote detective novels running creature
also available to help myself we got
this all model here where we say well
look we have one down two to the our
state and in Salem the one we can still
do a lot but we depend on what test case
we run bitch it again and again and
again we find the new error case I mean
at this kind of closure to the tests and
Daniel equation and we find a hermit
task edge which this boss okay so this
is an fun wall that we have with that
last catch those are little repetition
so what we do is we actually get the
tests for free one we both knew tests
for existing test Suites and we do that
by underwater by direction
actually the specification that tests
are only a part of the specification you
can get them for more information from
those are those tests and with that
information you can start ferrying we
can vary the deceptive the list of
frequencies you can vary the sequence
that we wrote we can all that do that
automatically so I want to go back to my
turn around and show you what happens if
we start allocating resources to the
fans because something really also a
test with this
oh well you will so what does shall we
ask for an application on frequency we
need to at least this disk which account
do it come to come make up the test test
for you completely for me so we have to
get one that's let's take it very simple
one what do we have here this district
breaking which effectively so what we do
is we do a setup where we start with one
frequency and then we Haluk ate it and
that should be okay and we should get
one has to allocate frequency because
we've only one in there and then it
should stop okay that we could do now in
for tests and this is what's happening
as a picture right so we can do start
and stop and if we are here then we can
actually allocated exactly what we
expected but do we have enough tests
that's the question ok we can out right
here bit does that really work so we
want to see that while running more
tests to say it's the frame case and if
any case it comes up with this mo look
your test don't really text that if I
started surfing with an empty shuttle so
empty center of at frequencies that if I
then do an allocate I actually get it
that much because there are no
frequencies available yeah it can tell
you that that this is a test that you
have never tested okay let's add that
test case if it is not already on me I
will just copy and paste it in there
there is much more the faster so let's
let's take that test kitchen
copy so what shall we call it say
allocate 0 you cannot allocate 0 save
this I run the demo handbooks discussed
edgefield action so I made a mistake oh
yes I you stop them no this is the demo
thing you know don't do it I frequency a
fourth I think that's the forum in this
guy so but she not make any difference
but or I have something else you will
expect success okay well let's try not
to one now i don't i don't really seem
to get it together working so i will
remove that and jump back today that's
just bad it's always done small things
that you can happen that can happen so i
can sell better look for the whole i
wanted test case here okay i forgot
Scott yes I forgot the clothes you wear
it should say hey you have to clean up
after this test yeah so this is what was
actually you start the best here you do
this pretty allocation but you have to
tell it to store after that that's
because all
of course go Floyd oh you have to clean
up in your test Couture was even tougher
all five tests passed and now I can find
one bitching so you start you can go to
take one you can allocate and then you
get to the arrow stage or else you go to
stay to where you can navigate as many
times as you like or you can stop as
many times as you like so this is still
a bit of crappy crappy model we refer to
them before because i can't i will get
infinitely often here when i start with
the emptiness so here you actually see
start the engine started well there's
two different cases one gives you one
application and you get to the air case
and here you can still allocate as much
is your life for then again you can now
this is long time I show really you can
create a new one new test case which
says well no you didn't test this one if
you start with one element and then you
stopped you can you try to allocate what
happens then choose you put that past
cases well you actually talk you can't
allocate after story and then you add
those test cases and in the end you get
a very nice picture here of a model
where you can allocate as many resources
as you have and then you know that the
picture looks nice in your boss a random
test this is well does its offer and
therefore so this is how we can help
people to write better test test
and then of course my hope is that if
you see the model the green check mark
if you look at that and you look at the
page you and say but it's actually not
so difficult next time I just find the
model straight off from the start but it
helps you in learning how to do how to
write proper human tests and what kind
of tests you really want to do good
anymore so the implementation how do we
do this well first of all we instrument
unit to actually create a trace of what
it has been doing so you can actually
trace through the coating every if your
call you do you keep in mind then you
add a number assertions to that trace
and particularly following the return
value rules and get a free coke
connected to the input values and all of
the tree you make a long and rich trace
then we use the blue French learning
algorithm roof wrenches laundress
algorithm switches very good and
learning it have both posted the
negative tests let's exactly what we
need here so we have experiment of the
number of machine learning algorithms
and we just found this the best one to
two surface bows so we run that over
this long trace and we get some
information from it give them is first a
picture and then the picture together
with the actual traces give enough
information to make a quick check model
which is Richard on the picture because
retin dated in years well but it has the
same structures today so we make a
critical when computer on the fly we
compile it and it doesn't compile we
both remember Norman compulsive is
automatically generated then we wrote a
quick check property or a variation of
course that you can make them do the
randomization you randomize input real
massive number of course according to
the more given what the Molalla loves
and then we get a new test
test test to the test suite let me start
over that's the whole the whole
procedure okay and to conclude my talk
the main purpose of this is to make
further out of testing so y tu the tests
get a lot of fun with this now this is
necessary about you from 200 can we
start this but this is comfortable for
himself we did this because from scratch
quick check which was hard yeah this is
powerful because you were only a few
point of view test and bang Digga
tobacco-free which is still not enough
control you know which the sketch to you
actually want to add to industrial power
turn the learning algorithm with blue
fridge faith and threesome will choose
blue French yeah that's a good question
so the question was does it happen that
blue French and yeah doesn't get nice
learning outcome nice station as output
and of course that happens your French
is one of those help
has some weeks falls so in blue French
is extremely important to have at least
one negative justice because the girls
are possibly connected so if you have
only positive test cases then you can
always one state and lots of errors
errors so we when we did this we look
for an example in your intestine Gator
let's look in Gator and we do that
instead of our own example we we do
skater so we look at all the ghetto true
positives with an e unit directories or
at the unit in it in the text somewhere
we found plenty of them we look to the
key unit director E and really excited
and talk aunty you know that's how we
will really like to write as unit that
so and then we found a few which had a
few test cases they're all positive test
cases were no negative test answers so
ask in industry you want a garrison you
have some sort of test suites with lots
of test cases in the unit and Erickson
said well you mostly use contest that we
had a guy in literature Pengy refer to
something he had done Calvin lots of a
unit test yes you know that's right no
negative test at all and then it gets
bit heavy because you get so many things
catches but so the answer is yes you get
some very strange things if you don't
get negative test but if you have a nice
combination of pasta maker the other is
pretty good and getting you the north
wall right gasps oh well I get I was
good lacing it i use the normal picture
output from station so the percentage is
on the arrows where the likelihood that
that bar was tested so you test if you
have a very thick error then most of the
test
an arrow so contains that the variation
is based on the model you have so as yet
more then is a standard distribution for
how Justin generated and if it is the
standard distribution then this is your
test how quickly do not improve that and
that's better too difficult to explain
here but if you want to improve your
testing you want to improve the
likelihood that certain transitions are
met you want to do that's more our case
or you want to test more allocated and
then you can change that in in the model
with the force that's not something you
get from the tests so you have to add
that later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
