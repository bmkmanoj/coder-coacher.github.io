it's my second time on the stage I've
been here for the first time eight years
ago when i had a pleasure to present my
master thesis and it was about
implementing airlink based game server
after that i was so happy with her lung
and like the language so much that the
toes last eight years I spent at Erlang
solutions working with different systems
training teaching people also learning
from people a lot and one thing that I
realized is that it's quite time
consuming quite often to explain to
people what the system is doing so over
the years I have learned how to use dbg
and tracer and red bug and probably each
one of you has some other techniques on
how you find out what this system is
doing but when you have someone who has
never been working with her lung and you
have to explain to him so what's going
on it's not that easy so here is a tool
i would like to present to you which is
trying to address this issue
so the tool is called airline
performance lab it's just a common line
tool that you can start as regular
common line and tall and if you have
some parameters here one of them is
airline note that you want to observe
okay now we may be increased slightly a
font so I'm going to start some note
here okay start it I'm going to observe
this node now and point my browser to
this address which the tool display okay
so this is like welcome screen of the
tool and you have some plugins here and
I can click dashboard for example and
this gives you some rough idea what is
the system look what like so you get to
see some basic information what's the
release number what is the runtime
system model is the operating system
peed how many schedulers we have some
other settings like Colonel Paul
something which gives you a rough idea
what the system is like then second is
actually we get to see also some
statistics here how many messages are
flying for the system you see every once
in a while something is sending us free
messages and there is some processes
that are currently running my more
reallocated so if i run the demo here so
let's say we're going to start some some
code i'm not going to tell you what this
does yet because this is something I
face usually IM expo I'm put on a
project I need to discover what the
system is doing and try to help people
understand where are the bottlenecks
what's going on so we can start let's
say a system
okay actually the system is now running
I will make it do some message passing
okay now you see that there are actually
some message is flying through the
system so there is some traffic going on
okay that's good and now here in this
shell you would probably start to use
your favorite tools so some people would
use eat up some other would use red bug
maybe there are some other techniques
but it takes some time so instead i'm
going to switch here and i'm going to
visualize all of those processes in real
time in 3d so you get to see actually
what's going on here uh-huh okay i see
some it looks like a ring ok so those
processes are apparently passing message
in a ring and it's so obvious when you
look at it right yeah this is a ring of
airline processes and we're just passing
messages now to make it a bit more fun
you can see there is a button here put
on 3d glasses ok so I have 3d glasses
with me ah you will need 3d glasses too
so now this lady over there will give
which one of you a pair of 3d glasses
okay put it on
you need to fold the glasses okay so
that they stick to your ears
are there any people that want to get
the pair of glasses but did it get one
yet can you please raise your hand if
you don't have glasses yet there is one
over there okay all right good I need to
take a picture of you okay can we please
turn off the lights
okay your brain has to get used to it so
it takes a bit of time until it actually
starts to look like 3d let's see maybe
it works for some of you maybe doesn't
for some other but if you keep looking
at it for a while it will eventually
start to look like 3d so not only we get
to see what those processes are doing
they're passing a message in the ring
but there's also a bit of fun okay so
that was my talk thank you so the
question hello the question was where do
you get this there is the URL on the
glasses
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
