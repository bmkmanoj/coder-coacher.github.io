we'd speak into an empty room with it
being the last thing on the last day so
hello my name is dan het and and I am a
creative technologist and a cryptic
flowery creative technologist don't
think program uses a creative thing but
I'm here as sort of an impostor and so I
hope you have massive imposter syndrome
at this kind of event I'm definitely not
a computer scientist I'm not a pro I'm a
programmer by trade now but I kind of
shoulder barge my way into the industry
a little bit and so I epicly speak a
creative conferences that kind of thing
I'm code mesh so I definitely use
alternative technology I definitely do
crazy things with stuff I'm definitely
not solving any real-world problems but
whatever also i speaking really quickly
i'm trying to cram an hour's talk and a
demo into 45 minutes so we're gonna have
to like really really well through this
thank you for falling for what's
essentially conference title click bait
which is really really handy and so what
I'd like to show you is a bunch of work
i'm a big believer in moving really
really quickly in experimenting with
high speeds and throw things away not
being too precious about what I make and
wipe out into the world and so
programming of course it's a very
serious business typically white males
doing serious things in office
environments slightly hairy necks and so
obviously we know that we do serious
things with code for grown-ups this is
not the case for me and I this has not
been my experience and I'm quite happy
that I don't tend to use code to make
boring things i'm also an ok program at
best on a good day you know if I
sacrifice a goat to Bill Gates in a
pentagram of fire I could be a good
programmer but typically programming
forms kind of half my creative skillset
so I go my first job as a program in
2008 you'll never guess how I'm a big
advocate of saying yes in advance and
figuring stuff out a little bit later so
I was working in the creative industry
already doing a lot of flash stuff back
in the day lot of games and I was asked
if I could do a load of technical stuff
with video in flash and I said yes and
the voice in my head when I know and so
but ya know it works out fine I mean as
long as you have the kind of mindset
where you want to learn it generally
works out all right and the this advice
doesn't so saying yes is good
if you're on a plane and somebody says
is the reductio on the plane don't you
can't learn on the job then but for easy
stuff like code you can learn it is fine
and so at some point during this kind of
first gig I I transitioned into what I
regard myself as a real programmer and
it was a mindset thing I went from can I
do this am i capable of doing this to
what's the best way to do this and that
is not a technical thing it's like a
cognitive thing where you're initially
just bewildered by somebody something
that you're being asked to do and at
some point your experience than brave
enough to start saying okay well I'm
sure there's always a way with code
there's always a way it just might take
a little bit longer so by day I work for
BBC are and date of immediacy this is a
very very nice image it's photoshopped
it's not raining and so any views and
opinions expressed in this sob do not
represent those are the v8 BBC let's
just got kids to feed and stuff please
and so I for a few years before that I
worked for cbeebies in CBBC anyone here
he's got young children you'll
definitely be familiar with the work
that we do we're the guys that buy you
an extra few minutes in the morning I do
this kind of thing and it it's a story
time I think it's time Jensen and I have
just finished reading a story on the CBB
story time app will you help me choose
another story to read Jensen there's a
world of stories at your fingertips with
all your favorite cbeebies fans like
Topsy and Tim so my confession is that I
actually died intensely dislike the the
actual acts of programming I know that
some people find a real zen-like calm
and sitting in front of a computer in
that writing code I don't I thought I
find it very frustrating thing I'm good
at it by I don't enjoy what I do enjoy
is having a thing at the end and making
things is my jam I'm not particularly
interested in code as an activity but I
am very very interested in making stuff
happen digitally so feels good to go my
chest actually it's good and I also
possess a bunch of qualities we should
make me a terrible programmer as well so
I'm extremely impatient very short
attention span am like a seven-year-old
is ridiculous a terrible maths and my
tantrum threshold is just awful and so
this is right so why do I even
do I program and it's simpler that I
feel like programming oh sorry
programming is Magic and it feels like
even though i do it feels like a magic
thing and it's because the only raw
ingredient in program used persistence
and it's I can't think of any other
industry where you insert no raw
materials and stuff still comes out and
all you really need is persistence and
last time I did this a pedantic guy when
you need to compute it obviously you
need to computer look you it most of it
is just persistence and and time and
effort and I think that's a really
exciting thing so specifically what I'm
in to be very very short projects I like
getting stuff done evolving things from
small things and keeping kind of I like
to keep the energy up i'm not i showed
you the story time project because i can
work on years worth of projects but i'm
particularly interested in very very
short than projects two big reasons why
shop projects are amazing the first is
new project smell new project smell is
just the greatest thing in the world you
know and you're you're at the precipice
of a new projects you've got your
boilerplate written everything compiles
blank screen ready to start climbing
features in that there's nothing nothing
better than I fike a bottle new project
smell I'd be a rich man it's amazing and
conversely the last two percent of a
project is always like the death march
horror and I short projects to just get
rid of it just have a new project smell
every day is great the other one is
actually getting stuff done finishing
things is the most important thing in
the world is creative and when I say
creative i do include program is fully
in that it's like not finishing
something is just the mind killer is the
worst thing and also you can fail
quickly so failing still counts as
completing right definitely and kind of
excuse me oh and i had a third reason
for enjoying short projects and needing
to do shot projects and a couple of
years ago i was unfortunately you've me
and my wife unfortunately diagnosed with
children it's just really has an impact
so this this all nighter kind of six
months the year long side project thing
is just the thing of the past now so I I
really enjoy getting stuff done super
super quick and I ruin things like
Manchester game jam so game jams for
those who are not familiar it's just a
really good shot contest to design build
and deploy a completely finished play
all video game in very very short spaces
of time so often in the weekends
sometimes in a day sometimes at a couple
of hours
I've even built the game in zero hours
so every time the clocks change every
year but not zero our game jam happens
so you wait til one o'clock you do you
gain the clocks go back and it's
midnight again so it's which is a really
really cool thing and we make all sorts
of digital non digital games we make the
kind of games you can't take on a plane
which is always cool so so yeah I'm
really into just really really quick
stuff and so I built prototype a lot of
prototypes for a place called the corner
house or from Manchester this gallery
space so we met at hack day and we built
them this tabletop thing designed for a
surface up early age ages ago where it
would constantly recommend stuff in the
middle of the gallery and you could you
could throw it off the surface and it
would just throw stuff at you constantly
so that we did this in a couple of hours
after a few beers and it was fine and we
kind of it kind of led onto a
relationship of them wanting more and
more kind of digital sketches which is
quite nice which lent itself quite well
to kind of why I enjoy doing and so I
this was the only sketch that I made for
a project they asked us to do which was
to take and they were opening a new
building called home in corner house is
closed closed after 30 years in business
and they said oh we want a load of them
we want something interesting to
represent the day around this new
building and they gave our architectural
plans and surveys and also this stuff
around this new building and most of the
stuff that we did most of the sketches
we did we're like processing sketches
and a couple of openframeworks pieces of
work just to start exploring the data
set so we had algorithms that were
making things out of vertical and
horizontal lines and none of it was
really sticking but the beauty of it is
that we because we were we were working
in a very agile sense agile in meaning
raw speed and each of these was a couple
of hours of messing around and see if
sticks move on to the next thing none of
them ever made it into anything there
but they're interesting just because
they kind of led on logically to the end
point so this was like the seats from
the theater and we kind of like arrange
them in need it they were all they're
nice enough but nothing stuck and we
even tried it with video and stuff
differently work then the beauty of
working faster days you can just been
it's great and so what we landed out was
a lot of the strongest thing they had
was this typography it's a really
industrial building and although all
their things like they have the
impression of being nailed on it's all
very sort of industrial style and what
we wanted was not a finished sort of
polished pieces because it's an art
space we're more interested in the
process so what we wanted to do was
create a piece of work that represent
the process rather than some big
polishing in the end it's what we did
was we built on the work of Roger I'll
sing
there's an open source project that we
create symmetry using randomized polygon
placement and all those it's really
really simple but it's horribly brute
force it takes us that X a source image
starts with blank canvas draws a polygon
assesses to see if you're getting closer
or not draws another one once it reaches
50 just start adjusting colors and now
lines and stuff I mean this is the this
is awful in terms of resource this is
like this was something like 200,000
iterations you have to leave it running
for hours my computer was on two books
with a fan running and then he said it
was awful but the point was that the
code wasn't the deliverable it was all
about using code as quickly as possible
to output something at the end so code
is kind of like it's just my gateway
into making artwork and actually they
don't care how I did it which is good
because it was terribly done so readers
fourth the home gallery and when you
were outlining like this you can kind of
see the process so initially it's just
putting polygons together if you look
closely I can distribute a high-res
version of this you can see it kind of
readjusting things as time goes on it's
quite nice
process
Oh
okay anyway and so this sort of thing
led on to a bigger project so when they
actually closed the building they said
oh we want something big in the space
that will let people say goodbye to the
space they didn't special it was a
completely open brief which initially is
quite scary because you know when you're
a kid and you sit down to draw something
but because you've got that blank piece
of paper you your mind goes blank and it
was kind of like that it was quite
difficult we threw around loads of ideas
we wanted like live graffiti in the
toilets turns out they don't want
cameras in the toilet so who knew what
we settled on was have you seen big you
know that automaton thing that kind of
the start of big sigh kind of thing so
I've ended the pea style machine we
wanted it to be sort of off in the space
and then it would were into life when
somebody sends a message and it would
write the message your message would pop
out so we called it the scribbler the
initial spec was my typical level of
detail it was this and I actually handed
this to a carpenter who built the
machine and just gave him some rough
measurements and he went away and did it
so that was literally all I did for him
which is really good so while that was
happening we started building your
prototype I'm a big fan of cardboard
boxes and prototyping and so what then
what we did was we wanted an end-to-end
prototype straightaway because we had to
build we built this whole thing in about
two weekends in a few evenings so it was
really really white knuckle so the way
it works is we have a machine hidden
inside inside the box and constantly
monitoring Twitter and the website that
we built for any messages that come in
so we've got a little debug panel here
that lets me put one in and what happens
is it finds finds message sticks in a
database checks for duplicates and then
if it's not it's not a duplicate print
them out and do some profanity checking
your stuff which therein lies a tale
that's high in a minute and basically
what it does is adds it and then prints
it out and at the same time we've got an
Arduino in a couple of mowers and we've
got this giant animatronic pencil the
rice it out I always get asked how we
made this giant pencil write the message
we didn't need his wiggles around but
the whole idea was it was just it was
supposed to be sort of all janky and
like like fairground style we also had
lighting in the top had a load of LEDs
in the back so again it busted out this
is kind of a specialist material that
would like to fuse the light that's the
ikea sandwich bags that we lay it up
it's fine so we had an Arduino stuck in
the top and had each letter was going to
be addressable like fruit machine style
and the idea is that the machine would
occasionally do like an attract mode to
kind of let people know that it was in
fact on
also and I didn't know anything about
hardware when I started this as well so
one of these is a 9 volt arduino power
adapter one the other one of these is a
27 volt not an Arduino power adapter so
I reached into the drawer and the
universe kind of flipped a coin and I
lost twice ahem in blue too hard weenus
so let the magic smoke out trip the
power out in my house just a ridiculous
but I thought my wife is going to leave
me at this point it's just awful so yeah
basically the what happens when you it's
basically the same thing as what happens
when you jam 27 of anything into a thing
designed for 9 of something it was just
ridiculous so yeah so we prototype the
lights and we basically we have to do it
like this because the detrol machine was
being built at the same time and we only
had a couple of weeks so we were really
really cracking through this and then
the actual machine starts coming
together we had the printer there so we
had to prototype the angle of the
printer and tear the front of it because
if it was too steep the cards wouldn't
go through and if it was too shallows it
it just wouldn't work unless you've got
it just right so we were also
prototyping where the pencil would sit
for some reason the guy who built this
thing has a baseball bat in his workshop
so we didn't ask he just used it and
want to know he's a bit scary he's the
guy he's been he spent my last 20 years
building stuff for the gallery and we
were a bit paranoid because we thought
he was in a laugh at us when we said all
we want this big stealing machine and it
turns out that he's been doing
installation path work for every mincing
create if that comes in and says oh oh
what the giant banana or something and
he just that's his whole deal so it's
quite cool I'm talking too fast now and
so we also had a giant pencil built to
go inside the thing this is built by
girl code Daniel Spinks who used to work
admins you know a product designer of
Dyson and she baked her whole deal is is
making models so she either makes really
big versions of tiny things or really
tiny versions of massive things it's not
the best job ever so for scale that
metal bit where that holds the rubber is
a baked bean can so it's actually fairly
giant but it's at aluminium shell with
like this lacquer over the top so
doesn't weigh very much and it is like
giant so the lights i showed you before
which we're going to go in the tub this
is that this is a lesson about
destroying stuff we ditch the whole
thing and the reason is that we had
these lights that we're going to sit
inside their thing just to light it up
and we move them out the way and just
chuck them on top of the machine and as
soon as they went behind that we went oh
my god these are these infinitely better
than the light
stuff that we've been designing so we
had to make a decision and the decision
was this is much better and we bend
everything and it was it was a lot of
work that we've done into patterns and
things and we we could if it was the
right decision and letting go sometimes
and just ditching what you're working on
entirely is definitely the right
decision sometimes and so we also had a
website and so the website had a really
really nice high res live stream so the
idea was that you could leave a message
on the website and after a few seconds
you would see the machine spring to life
in the space in your card would pop out
in the real space which is really
satisfying to see also when we were
testing this I was SAT with a laptop
near the machine we're not looking at it
and I know it's this dude this like bold
guideline messing around in the machine
and I shouted it said like can you get
all the machine made turns out it was me
on a 20-second delay because of this is
the stream delay i was like so if
anyone's like worried about losing the
hair while building machine with a live
stream don't worry about it it was a bit
intense but yeah I've made my peace with
it so anyway we got sons instant
messages we had about 800 what we call
legit messages which weren't penises
more swear words swear filtering I wish
we hadn't spent any time on because you
can be breathtakingly offensive without
saying any swear words as we found out
about 800 times it's just a nightmare
then but of the 800 some of them were
really really nice so we had some really
nice pointing kind of messages the
corner house made a difference to my
life oh I met him a gallery open opening
I loved him he loved himself more the
end I saw her at counselor here once and
he nodded at me while zipping up his fly
as he left the bathroom and then the
last one I'm not even going to read out
but this is it apparently a true story
true facts and so we also got a little
bit of local press and this was
interesting because when this went up on
the manchester evening news we had a we
had a surge in two particular kinds of
messages there must be like a certain
kind of person who reads this stuff we
had surging two kinds of messages one
was a ski penises and I have got loads
of ask if anyone wants to see any ASCII
penises I have every possible
permutation and then the other one which
I quite liked was help I'm stuck in a
machine we had probably probably
probably 30 or for a help I'm stuck into
machines which is quite funny and we
also made a very quick video which I
will show you
which I will show you
moon
you
you
penis
look at it and there's a load more
singing in not allowed so what was also
cool is I'm really into work that leads
on to other work so short projects are
going for that and what was interesting
was this local illustrator Tash Wilcox
started notice this machine running in
the space inside illustrating some of
the cards that were popping out which
was really really nice and so we've got
tons and tons of these like blood
spattered musicals make ideal first
dates couldn't agree more and she did
things like joined to the outside and
everything and these are now Black
Prince available which is cool and I
also led straight on from this to a
project in Manchester called the
Manchester moleskine and the idea was
that they passed around a notebook to
creatives all over the city everyone
would get a double page spread and then
the final thing it was exhibited and I
think is going for charity as well which
is quite nice so I thought well how do i
do an art as a developer that's actually
meaningful and rather than just drawing
something so I wrote the code out and
let painstakingly and writing writing
code by hand easily most difficult thing
in the world because it doesn't flow
like English it's really really
challenging to do my wife at this point
just assumed nygren insane and
essentially what we've done is we've
open-source the project by hand which is
quite cool and so it's got happy with
this and it did go on a gallery gallery
wall which is quite cool and so I feel
like I'm a legit artist at this point
ahem so yes a quick projects really
really good and so the if quick projects
are good then surely live projects about
it right so I can just get stuff done in
zero time and so regular programming
this slide is actually left over mostly
because I speak to creative ordinances
I'm assuming there is no non-programmers
in this room at the moment awesome ok so
obviously regular programming typically
write my code press the magic button
computer thinks about it something pops
out fine and this doesn't excel if
you're the kind of person who wants to
be really really quick and really really
unpredictable and so show of hands
people who write code in an office ok
people who write code in the home people
who write code at two o'clock in the
morning in a nightclub come on
three okay that's pretty good okay cool
so yeah so what I'm support i'm speaking
about his live coding and when i say
live coding I don't mean live coding as
in just doing a demonstration and
talking about live code needs to
generate music and visuals and this is
very very white norful compared to
typical development so the way it works
is we have an environment like this
there are many like it but this one is
mine so this is Cyril built an open
frame works I'm going to demo it in just
a moment and the way it works is we've
got a renderable surface we've got a
text field and the buttons the things at
the top are markers for different pages
so you can do a bunch of other stuff the
way it works is you type a thing thing
popped out pretty easy right so what
exactly is happening here and why is it
different to sitting in an office coding
we're just running on a ripple so this
gets me because obviously read eval
print loop is the concept older than
time certainly older than me but Apple
still made out that they invented it
when they released switch no you didn't
am so and the other big thing about life
garden I really dig is the fact that the
code is exposed this is really really
important so when you are live coding
more or less you are exposing the code
as part of the visuals and part of the
sound so occasionally I will I'll hide
it but for ninety percent of the stuff I
do part the exposing the code to kind of
revelers and onlookers and things he's
part of the deal this is got a load
Egyptian stuff I did all live coded and
I've got a little just to show you it in
action
you
so I didn't have to make that I just
asked someone if he could send me some
footage from a live thing and he cut
this little thing together which is
quite nice and so yes all that stuff was
done at one gig it all purely encode
there was no kind of video or anything
it was all just done on the fly and the
other thing is I don't tend to turn up
with anything prepared the idea is
behind live coding that you react to
what's happening so it might be a band
it might be a whole bunch of DJ's or
whatever and it's quite nice that you
can just react on the fly without having
to worry about bringing gigabytes of
video or whatever else and so there is a
live coding manifesto like the live
coding is is quite rooted in academia
and but there's so there's a rough
manifesto and most of it involves things
like code should be seen as well as
heard underlying algorithms viewed as
well as the visual outcome which I've
thoroughly agree with no backup so no
DVD no safety net computer which is
quite m it just adds a little element of
terror to the proceedings which is good
and there was the important one actually
and again I've left this in because I
typically speak to groups of artists and
things it's not necessary for a lay
audience to understand the codes work
really all of your code exposed
projected massive which it which sounds
horrifying if you're a traditional
programmer and it is in many ways and
you can mix it with other things so so
what we're seeing here is a live brother
is using triggered stuff and then this
is Alex illegally oh my god bless I'll
great move and he's actually using
titles
it was a really interesting capital T
and actually over any of any that user
using it to create tremendous abrasive
pepper they go so yeah so this is the
kind of thing we get up to so we've got
people doing music and visuals all the
same time so this was in a sweaty
basement in the deaf institute in
Manchester quite a lot of fun and we do
really unpredictable things and part of
live coding is being able to react so
what's going on and sometimes that
involves somebody holding the projector
and following a single round and
projecting onto the face so this is a
band called miko rex and we basically
they started going all over this off the
stage and all over the venue so we had
somebody holding the projector just so
we can keep him lit up and the overall
effect was that just his skin was lit up
and i was able as a live code to react
to this and start doing something a bit
more abrasive so it was quite
interesting and also don't pick up
projectors in my clothes because they
break true story and so I've also
started using live coding techniques in
like a more traditional VJ set up so
that's we like with video and that kind
of thing so I did a I did the analog
trash festival few months ago and I like
live coded a kind of place holder thing
that was kind of like this audio
reactive equalizer with their logos and
stuff on just to display between the
balance which is quite cool and again I
was able to just mess around with it as
time went on keep it fresh and so I mix
things of video so the stuff on the left
is a little video channels at one square
on the right that red square is the live
coding element that's been piped into a
bj setup so live coding is still my kind
of primary visual element you can mix it
with video and run glitches and things
on it and also us then so a good example
would be things like neon soul there are
like a fairly wanky electro band and
they have like a sort of space thing so
I live coded a load of their logo and
loaded that these orbs that all kind of
moved with the base and then they have
like Spacey video underneath so it kind
of works really well as a creative tool
similarly it loads of metal bands and so
you just swap everything out for footage
of people screaming and then people
scream over the video of people
screaming which is cool and these guys
also yes I tend to ask bands and things
if they've got any artwork or kind of
themes that you want to represent
visually and he's certainly the most
high resolution inverted crucifix I've
ever seen it's like six thousand pixels
high it's like yeah I could have just
drawn an acoustics it's fine guys and so
I also am really into unpredictability
so live coding is great because you just
don't know
going on half the time I also quite like
pulling stuff from the web while I'm
playing so when i'm doing chip two
nights chiptune being things like an
8-bit style music made and Gameboys that
kind of thing i like to pull in gifts
over a few channels live from the
internet so i have no idea what's going
to come in until i'm mixing it together
with glitches which is a lot of fun and
again you can put live coding over the
top and so yes and the fun lots of cats
go wrong with cats and again if you take
a screen grab every few seconds you end
up with this absolutely horrible
mishmash which is look this a bit
intense now but it's great in a Hannah
club environment and I also use live
coding to kind of make things like like
Prince so when I did the Sheffield
algerie recently I left a script running
and it would capture HD screen grab off
the projector screen every two seconds
right to an SSD and then I've got a
processing sketch they will then
assemble those into time-stamped unique
prints so the idea is that each of these
prints represents precisely five minutes
of improvised performance which I'm
doing for an exhibition in Manchester
and again it's kind of like it's quite a
nice snapshot to kind of show the
evolution so the idea is that you live
code continuously over over a long
period and you get this kind of nice
sort of effect so why on earth would you
live code really like so the developers
and I said developers in the room room
full of developers so you are probably
going this sounds awful and horrible and
terrifying and it is is very very scary
sometimes especially when you've had a
few beers as well and you know what's
going on and because as a programmer by
day I am I need to be methodical and
diligent and risk averse right we don't
surprises of the enemy i would say if
you're a developer and actually when
you're live coding surprises are great
so um live coding requires sort of a
total reset of your sensibilities as a
programmer and it there's no none of
this lives on github none of this is
documented and in fact none of this
exists after I leave the club and this
is intentional so I could save it I
could write it to disk or stick up and
get home if I wanted but the thing about
live coding is this it's very transient
so I will never have dozens and dozens
of lines of code on the screen cool 10
minutes right I'm going to do a demo I
would now have loads of loads of code on
the screen and there would never be what
I would regard as a complete set of code
it's more about taking a little bit
and just tickle in it just setting with
them just just give it a little tickle
and just change things as you go and
that's much more interesting to me and
I'd much rather work in the moment and
then have fun with it and be gone rather
than worry about typical programmers
stuff like documenting or worrying or
doing it properly or any of that
nonsense gonna see all right then I'll
share once right so this this is where
the wheels normally fall off because all
the resolutions are stuff go of it would
so we'll show you a couple of examples
of music but I don't have time to like
actually live got any music so this is
sonic PI by summer this runs on
everything from this will run run like
your toaster if you want it it's amazing
and it's designed to run on the
Raspberry Pi and it's a music sort of
creation tool that allows live coding so
it lets you do things like this
sorry and so yeah this kind of thing is
really really nice and and then the
browser also gives you a load of options
which is really really cool so this is
jibba so this is entirely
javascript-based so a lot of live coding
languages are domain-specific which i'm
going to show you in a minute and
they're designed to be very very concise
jebra is a bit more complex so you write
your actual live coding actual
JavaScript so I don't think this is new
friendly but if you know JavaScript
already and your insurer interested in
terrifying electronic noise then
gibberish got you saw it and you can do
really really good things so a moment
I've got like well you can go with the
crazy right so you can do visuals and
connect the audio so you could do a
complete live set yourself and also
there's an API for accessing the
renderer is the code when yourself so
you could you could put audio reactivity
on the size of the phone that you're
typing you know you really want to blow
your own mind not people are watching
you can literally like a live code your
own environment that I would recommend
it but okay and so I'm going to quickly
do a show you some visuals so several is
my weapon of choice and I made one with
a massive thumb so you can see stuff
okay so very very quickly so what we've
got here is two commands and it's not
that aggressive in terms of compilation
so you have actually have a button to
activate it but you our environments and
like live code lab which I'll show you
in a minute guys here from life goal up
which every time it detects a valid
instruction set it will immediately
update I prefer this approach because I
can do a bunch of stuff and then
activate it so if you've got like a drop
coming in a song or something you can
change a lot of colors and hit all at
once and the language is domain-specific
so the idea is that it's designed
specifically to be as easy as possible
so in this kind of context when I'm
still talking to a load of very very
intelligent programmers wrote books just
sounds really done but actually when I'm
when I want to get some visuals on stage
two o'clock in the morning when a band
has just started and they've kicked into
that best song I need to do something
super quick and so what you're doing is
you're abstracting everything away so
lowest level you've got a load of OpenGL
craziness
level above that you've got a load of
C++ not right in that two in the morning
and then above that you've got
openframeworks which is like a creative
coding library for c++ still too
complicated I'd rather just right box so
there you go and so the main draw of
life coding for me is the audio activity
so I want to be able to I want my stuff
to move with music right so what you can
do is you can listen for fft values so
FFC for people who don't know fast
fourier transforms layman's terms short
version when you look at the equalizer
on your stereo it just represents that
as a scale from 1 to 0 on each channel
so a low number will give you kind of
low blow base and you can go right up to
really really trebly stuff so straight
away what we've got is something a bit
more organic than a measurement and this
is quite nice and once you get your head
around this so I haven't even got any
music on it's just listening through my
crappy macbook Mike and straightaway
you've got something a bit more
unpredictable and you can start piping
this in two colors so colors you can set
as three channels but if I set this as
oh that's so what it will do is it
what's not very good example Ashley and
yes it'll change color as I'm when it
detects noise an audio like anything
which is kind of cool and what I've also
done is you can hide the code so you
could do a little live coding and when
you reach a certain point you can you
can hide the code go to the bar whatever
which is quite nice and so yeah and so
the idea is that the the whole thing is
geared towards getting results really
really quickly so if I do a tile for
example make these a bit smaller what
you've immediately got is a bunch of
geometry which is quite nice and and
also what I was going to show you yeah
yeah so I mean again what I want to do
is if I want to very very quickly make
stuff look massively different what you
can do is you can add things like noise
walk to the to the process so straight
away you've got this sort of amorphous
weird blob which is quite nice I quite
like things like just adding things like
pixel post-processing so you've
immediately got this really rad demo
scene sort of thing and this whole thing
like so what's the size six lines of
code and and there's actually a
monstrous amount of stuff going on under
the hood but actually I don't care about
that in a live coding context and so
yeah so Cyril exists on OS X but there
are tons and tons of very very similar
environments if you want
this stuff and I'm just going to quickly
show you live code lab so lifeguard love
it is the original thing that influenced
Cyril and so guy at the front the purple
t-shirt hassling later he had just
hassling leo is fine mmm kicked off do
you kick it off or you just look the
good stuff it's the same sort of thing
but in your browser which is really
really cool so as long as you've got
chrome this thing will work which is
always really really nice and the thing
I like best about live code lab is that
you can auto code so if you're really
lazy so we've reduced we produced our
code down to the barest minimum sort of
thing and if you want to just ditch
everything all together and let it get
on what you can do is you can turn our
code mode on and it will continually
modify everything in the code which is
quite nice so if you leave it running
long enough really really weird stuff
starts happening or it could disappear
while I'm demoing right so occasionally
interesting things will happen and we
are certainly highly recommend giving
this stuff a whirl and try one more time
who wrote this thing okay so you get the
idea anyway so that's that's how
lifeguarding works so yeah so I did
somewhat facetiously talk about
destroying work and actually I don't
talk about this I don't mean destroying
words what I mean he's not keeping it
and not getting too attached and all of
the stuff i showed you is I would done
live and no longer exists or in the case
of things like the machine has just been
squashed into pieces now and i quite
like that i like the fact that i'm not
going to end up a year later still
clinging to the same sort of safety
harness of something I know really well
and I it's just the the one thing that
keeps me kind of gets me up in the
morning apart from my toddler sticking
his finger up my nose is is doing new
things and that kind of thrill of the
new and like that when you find that new
thing and you get chance to play with it
i want that constantly and that's why i
prefer really really short things so
yeah it's all about forward motion so
you can take anything from this ramble
and definitely say yes to stuff unless
you're on a plane and someone's keeled
over and get it done even if it means
failing that still counts and destroy it
afterwards any questions yes
mm-hmm good time for that nonsense no
sits yes it's very it's very typically
pattern based so typically I mean the
most popular example I can think of is
tidal which is an audio the sort of
thing I mentioned that was building
Haskell and it's incredibly concise and
doesn't have any there's no scope in it
for any kind of user-defined kind of
objects or anything it's all about
patterns and repeating patterns so I
mean I can't speak for all environments
I mean there are many more more
complicated but I prefer to use and but
certainly things like Cyril it's all
about kind of just looping patterns
rather than spending any time defining
my own functions I just know it does it
just in that kind of context doesn't
work I don't know if you know of any if
you if you're smart yeah yeah
the most unusual input that drove my
sound probably the guy who had the green
stuff on so I a lot I live codes at him
literally screaming for about about
10-15 minutes which is kind of weird so
it was kind of making sure that you are
typically have like a load of hardware
it's tough so I can adjust the gain and
things so having to drop the gain right
down because he's screaming into the
microphone while we're following around
with a projector so yeah that I mean the
beauty of live code is just being able
to react to that kind of really weird
sort of thing and also i forgot to
mention that we are holding an algorithm
london in december i think is the eight
feet so if anyone's interested in this
stuff come down and i'll post i'm gonna
put a blog post up later on with a lot
of resources and dates and things but
highly recommend checking out and if so
i know the Venn diagram of people who
are into code and people who are into
abrasive electronic noise there's only a
small overlap but if you fall into that
i definitely recommend check it out
anyone else cool as me uh i will tweet
it i guess i will get done it sorry oh
it's not only sorry I apologize my
twitter handle is done at done hat I'll
get code mesh to maybe pass it on as
well I guess cool yeah yeah I'll put it
all together and also there's a really
good cycle top lapdog and as in the
laptop top lap and basically top flap is
the home of live coding so that's a
really really good repository for any
kind of tutorials there's videos and
stuff it's kind of a news feed for
everything happening in the live coding
scene I definitely recommend starting
there and going from there or else cool
that's me
