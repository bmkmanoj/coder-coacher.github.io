going to get a quick introduction of hex
and how it works within mix and before
we're going to dive into the
architecture behind it the community
aspects of it and how we handle security
and finally what features and changes we
we might be seeing in the future so heck
is doing pretty well now just yesterday
actually we reach 50 million total
downloads and looking at download
statistics it's not really a great way
to determine uses though because
depending on how downloads are counted
and so on and how good clients are at at
catching packages the numbers can be
inflated so I think looking at at at the
change in downloads how much the growing
is the better way of looking at it and
we can definitely see some growth as as
you can see just one year ago we we had
a million monthly downloads which I was
very excited about and now a year later
we're seeing more than six times the
number so that's that's very fun to see
and it introduced hex we first have to
talk about mix which is to build tool
that ships with elixir and we use mix
for a bunch of things it's more than
just a build tool you can think of it
more like a project manager and a test
runner where one of the tests is to
actually build your projects it can also
be used for for scaffolding for example
it ships with the test for generating
new projects and and the web primack
phoenix and ecto which is a which is the
database library also includes
generators for creating things like
database migrations controllers and so
on and it's also of course does more
common tests like a compulsion code the
current tests and it handles your
dependencies which is what we're going
to be focusing on here and so you can
see the mixed file
or the mix at the excess file this file
configure project and it's it's a
central power mix and files endings
files ending in da TXS our script files
which means that they are not compelled
to be to be fast they are just evaluated
when they are run a mix will load this
automatically when it exists in the
current directory and it's what and it's
what the defines your project and now we
can see that this week files this mix
file defines a single function that's
the project function and and it's what
it's what's configuring your project and
here you can see a minimum example that
and this is also where you would list
your dependencies compiler options and
anything else so let's let's look at the
actual dependencies and so out of the
box make supports Jeet and path
dependencies a pet dependencies is just
a project that exists on your local file
system and pet appendages are useful
when you're working on a new feature or
maybe fixing a bug or something like
that and you want to see how it works
before any project context before you
actually push the change to your version
control and and we can see here that we
have a pool by dependency from from jit
and an ecto dependency so for pool boy
we have defined that we're going to
fetch it from jet tub and and the name
of the repository to fetch it from and
for actor we haven't defined how to
fetch it which means that mix will fall
back to an external package manager and
there's plugged in and if you have hex
installed it would be used to fetch the
dependency and so we have a bunch of
tasks for getting updating and print
your dependency yes as you can see here
tips get tips update we have a test for
listing your dependencies and so on and
and it makes
have something called the dependency
converter what what it essentially does
its its is that it resolves your mixed
dependencies and it does not resolve
actual hex packages but because but
let's handle by hex itself and and it
performs two basic tasks it's it
converges dependencies and sort them
we're converging mean is that we can
take to dependencies with the with the
same name and merge them into a single
one and and we need to do that because
at the runtime that we're running inside
can only allow one application with the
same name and so you can have two
dependencies that actually depend on the
on the same dependency so you can have
for example to you have two different
dependencies depending on on on pool by
for example and we need to make sure
that they're compatible and we do that
by checking just if we fetch it
somewhere if if you purchase on the same
place so both dependencies has to be a
defined as beneficial from from jit for
example from the same repository and use
the same branch or tag or anything like
that and if there are conflicts we're
going to complain about it but you can
always oh you can always look you can
always override that and we also have
the the mix log files and what it does
it's it gently take the core feature of
it is that it ensures repeatable builds
and a repeatable build ensures that all
developers and when you're deploying if
if you're if you're not using releases
or or your continuous integration all
those places are going to get the same
version of all your dependencies so this
file LOX LOX your dependencies so here
we have carbachol a branch and pool boy
and it defines that so some of these are
from hex it defines the hex version to
shake some of the hex package
for poor boy it just defines way to
fetch it and the checksum digit
reference to use for it and for this to
work it's important to remember that you
should always commit this to version
control to ensure that all uses of a
project are going to get actually the
same version real dependencies yes that
was repeatable builds and mix can also
compile and lower the work with non
elixir projects as long as they follow
the standard OTP conventions so it
handles rebar and rebirth three projects
and any project that has a debt has a
make file it can compile and mix also
knows how to read a rebar the config
files so it can get cerebral project has
has dependencies you can actually get
those dependencies and fetch it itself
and then just use rebar to compile lows
and and this is really great because it
means that we can use all of the
existing great libraries that are
already out there so that was a bit
about mix and next we're going to talk
about the architecture of hicks and more
specific about where we're going to
focus on the specifications and sort of
talk about a bit about how hicks works
internally and the two main parts of
hicks are all the service the
repositories and the clients and but
they are just implementations of
specification and that's what hex really
is its its specifications and then
separate implementations and these
specifications are are fully documented
so anyone who ones can be a little
repository and they can implement their
own client and and the specification
specify things like like this destructor
packages what endpoints the repositories
need to implement the layout or registry
and
to lay out of the registry and the
administrative interface which is where
your work push packages and so on which
is the HTTP API and you can also use the
API to to browse and find packages and
and and get metadata and so on and so
let's start with the with the package
structure and this is this way looks
like it it's a single on campus tour
ball akon tales it contains four files
the version file which just contains a
single number defining the version of
the package we have a metadata file that
has a theme well the metadata like the
package name version description and so
on and we'll just take a closer look at
that in a bit and the shake some file
has the shot 6am of all the files 6
except for the six on file and finally
we have a another nested tarball that is
compressed and that contains all the
files that the user decided to include
in the package so like the mixed file
the reebok config files source files
configuration files and so on anything
that is needed to run and build a
package and so this is what the package
metadata looks like it's just an airline
term file and this was silly initially
electricity in tax but we started to
realize that Hicks could be used by the
whole beam we change this to Erlang so
that other build tools like rebar three
could read and write it and again this
is just some basic information like name
version links to for example G tab the
dependencies of the package and so on
and the repository needs to implement
three endpoints it's very
straightforward it needs to have a
register file a signature of the
registry file
it and all the package tar balls it has
and I'm going to look we're going to
take a closer look at what the registry
currently looks like it's a single a EDS
table that we have sterilized to a file
and here you can see like an example
content of the registry so for every
package we list all day all the released
versions on that package and forever
every release which it releases a it's a
version package / in here you can see
ecto 0.1 we list the dependencies and
the version requirements on those
dependencies and in the mix exclaims we
need to fetch the registry every time we
run the dependence resolution so that we
have so that we can find all the most
recent packages and and today we have
about 2700 packages and over 12,000
releases so this file is almost 3
megabytes now and almost one megabyte
when compressed and this file size is
starting to become a problem since we
have to fetch it it's often and later in
this talk we're going to look at inner
proposal for registry format so a core
part of the package manager is the
dependency resolution and this is the
basic algorithm for it so we take the
dependencies from the mixed file and add
those the list of pending requests
pending requests are or what we call
dependencies that we have not yet
processed in the in the logic here so we
take the first a pending request and we
try to find the latest matching release
so the latest version that matches the
version requirement we compare these
this against the packages that we have
already seen as
activated so those are packages that we
have determined a version for if we
don't find any matching we need to
backtrack to an earlier state so each
time we activate a package we save the
state so that we can later go back and
change something to try and make it pass
and if we find a matching version we can
actually activate the past that package
and try to use it a we add the children
of that package to the list of pending
requests so that we're going to process
them later and as I said we save the
state at this point for later
backtracking and when we no longer have
any pending requests we're going to see
this as the list of packages and
versions to use and so this algorithm
will always find the best solution so
it's always going to find the solution
if there is a solution and it's always
going to find the best solution and that
is the latest version of a package or
they can be made or they can be multiple
based solutions and and then it's going
to pick one of those the problem with
this is that it can have very high time
complexity this with this logic and we
have some optimizations for that but
sometimes we find bugs where this will
hang for for for for longer than we want
it's also kind of tricky to find if
there is no match is it's tricky to find
wait actually fail because it because it
tries everything right it's hard to find
where it actually was a version
incompatibility but what but but what we
do now is that every time we backtrack
we save the state at the location and
and and while a match failed and we use
that to present to the user to show with
one of the possible failures and so that
was a dependency solution let
let's look let's quickly get at the
systems the bill hikes so the main
repository for hex is sex RPM and and it
has three major it has three major
components all of these doesn't have to
be implemented to have your own
repository you only have to actually
implement the repository endpoints but
txt p.m. also has a website and it has a
hex talks which is for hosting
documentation and the website ASAP API
runs on Heroku the repository and hex
talks or just static file hosting so we
have them on amazon s3 and they go
through fastly for for content delivery
which are very kind of sponsoring for us
so let's let's take a look at some of
the complete the community and eco
system aspects of package managers and
more specifically Haig's so so first of
this the website we have we recently got
a new design for it which anger which I
am very glad for and last one was
designed by me and not very pretty and
we have on the website we have Dale
download statistics for the whole
repository and you can see that here but
we also list and most popular packages
new packages and those that were
recently updated and you can search for
packages you can search for package name
of course and we have a full text search
on the descriptions and this is not
great but we're we're looking at adding
maybe some kind of categories or a
tagging systems that it's easier to find
packages and there are a few people are
working on improving the full text
search as well which is very nice and
this is an example of what a package
pace looks like so here we have a very
very popular package
the web server cowboy and here you can
find the releases of a package download
statistics for it the links like links
back to the GTA repository and it also
shows which build tools it's made for so
not the build tools it supports the so
here Cowboys shows with the rebar and
make tags and that means that it has a
make file and it has a rebar config file
in the package but all the major build
tools erlang make riba riba three and
mix can can build this project so makes
for example as i said earlier can build
rebar party thing can build a make
projects reebok and of course bill
itself and and make as well and also
show small snippets that you can paste
into the configuration of your favorite
package manager a sort of your favorite
build tool and the three main build
tools that we support today or that
support Haig's actually are our mix
river 3 and early make and the both
support fetching and using dependencies
and actually publishing the appendices
but having all these build tools use the
same package manager and being the same
ecosystem doesn't really mean much if
they can't use each other packages and
elixir has been lucky because we've for
a long time have had had support for
compiling and using rebar and and and
and make projects i think our line may
has plug-ins for for compiling mix then
i think it supports three part of the
box zebra three actually just very
recently got a plug-in for compiling a
elixir projects which is which is very
nice
but Erling is also easier to use from
elixir than the other way around and and
it's nice that rebar 3 and and early
mike has has plugins to compel elixir
projects but i think i think there's
still ways that we can improve this and
and we need to work on this from from
both sides and so hicks talks and this
is where we where we host the
documentation for for Hick's packages
this is an example this is echoed this
in an example of the documentation for
an electric project and s broker is an
airline project and we support that as
well and the using the documentation
part when you publish a package is
completely optional and elixir
developers seem to use it a lot but
allowing developers list so and actually
if you remember from from Fred's keynote
yesterday it seems that even rebar 300
meters doesn't really bother doing it
and so so in mix we actually recently
started to automatically publish talks
when you when you when you push your
package and maybe rebirth we should do
something similar so that actually
people are forced to use it and in the
documentation is version so you get so
you have separate documentation for each
release and we link to these talks from
the from the package page on the website
and and i said earlier hey Clark is is
just simple static file hosting and so
the user the users build tool or for
some kind of plug in for the build tool
built the documentation put it in a
tarball and pushes it to the API server
that then later puts it on Hicks talks
and so this is this very basic I built
this quickly it's it works but it's
rudimentary and
even was more sophisticated we could we
could get more fancy we could get a full
text search or documentation so you know
if you want to work on this I will be I
will be very glad to help out with that
and in the mix bill tool we can also use
hex to install East scripts and for
those of you who may not know what an e
script is it's basically an executable
that runs a our line code containing it
so it's a it's a small script file and
the zip file containing precompiled bin
files and we can actually use the
existing functionality in mix to fetch
dependencies to to fetch a scripts and
well it doesn't actually fetch a script
it fetches a project and then it knows
how to how to build this project and to
how to build an escape from it so it
does that and then finally stores it in
some occasion that is hopefully in the
users executable path so for better or
worse we can we can sort of get people
installing a application executable
through Haig's so to kind of summarize
the community and ecosystem parts of
this we can talk about what we get out
of hex and what we get out of package
managers so one nice thing is that we
get a a single location to find
libraries and documentation for those
libraries and we have stuff like
download statistics we can see how
actively a package is used we're links
back to jeep type of stuff like that so
we can easily find where it's being
developed and help out with that and
another thing that at least i think is
great is that hex forces or hex p.m.
which is the main repository forces a
single name for library and that
improves the collaboration on it so a
one-issue I've seen in the ecosystem is
that people people are using a library
and the
like using pipe but they find this
little bargain and they fix that bug in
their in their fork of it and they don't
really bother a and the don't really
bother contributing back to the main
repository or maybe the original
maintainer it's not really active
anymore so they so the pull request just
sits there and and from this a lot of
forks are born and when I come in as a
new user some of these forks may be more
actively maintained some may have died
off by when I come in as a new user it's
really hard to find which is actually
the library to use and and having a
single location so having a single name
for package AXA means that people are
more encouraged to collaborate and
contribute into a single place and so
you're more completely we get more
hopefully more collaboration less forks
and I think it also contributes to cross
beam language use and you can of course
get all the things that we talked about
here without a package menu but I really
think that a package manager helps
pushing it in these directions and other
nice things is that we can contribute
back to the OT tip the OTP team for
example so hopefully they can use takes
two to like ken was talking about just
recently about splitting the OTP project
into into smaller applications so maybe
they have lists of a workload and easier
to use essentially and so let's talk
about about what goes into a securing a
package manager so let's start with what
we actually need to secure and first off
of course we need to secure the servers
and other services that are used to run
hex p.m. and so for example Heroku and
Amazon and pastor that we use and
for this there's really nothing much
more to it than we try to follow the
best packages use long random generator
passwords two-factor authentication when
it's available and so on and other
things that we need to secure is the
actual binary that is the hex client and
this is from mix by the way and elixir
ships with a public key that we use to
verify the the hex client that that is
that that is installed so for every new
hex release we sign it by the
corresponding private key that that we
keep offline you also need to secure
this to PAP I integrity of the registry
of packages and also try to help up with
securing users API keys I'm going to
look at that in in more detail in just a
bit and so to secure the website and the
API were of course use HTTPS and the hex
line uses this api to to publish
packages and to fetch from the
repository and when we do that we of
course need to connect over HTTPS and a
HTTP see which is the client that the
HTTP client the chips with OTP lets us
let us do this but other box you don't
really get all of what you commonly see
us HTTPS and in fact it's it's quite
insecure to just use the HTTPS that
thank you get for free so ultimate OTP
as the ssl library which will helps us
connect over ssl and it encrypts the
connection but it never actually shakes
that the server that we that we that we
connected to serve the credit
certificate so we have to do
our own hostname verification to
actually check that if i connect it
takes p.m. if i want to connect to a hex
p.m. hex p.m. actually served a
certificate that says IM expand and
another issues that you have to well
these are not really issues these are
these are just things that you have to
build yourself and is that you have to
handle partial certificate changed
yourself and to just quickly explain
what a certificate chain is and it's in
public key infrastructure which we use
doing secure https connections in in
browsers and so on and we when we
connect to a server they they send back
a certificate that tries to prove who
they are and so we have certificate
authorities that that signed is
certificate and that can be companies
like like like Symantec GoDaddy or
foreign governments and you know people
that we trust and to actually go back to
this issue the the server sends a chain
of signed certificates that so you have
your own certificate at the bottom and
and it's signed by a certificate
authority and itself can be signed by
another certificate and you have to you
have to yourself looking to the
certificates chain and check that one of
those matches the a certificate that you
trust in your store and the ssl
application doesn't do this by default
but it's very nice that we that we get
the hooks and we get the callbacks to be
able to implant this ourselves and right
so i mentioned certificate stores you
have to bring your own so OTP or elixir
that we used Austin doesn't provide a
certificate store and there are no
bindings to actually find a certificate
store
on the system so like the one that you
get with your up with your operating
system so you have to provide this
yourself we use the Mozilla certificate
store but we have to bundle this with
installer and we have to make sure that
it's secure that we fetch it securely
and so on day we can ship it to client
security and we have to make sure that
it's up to date because these things
they they they change from time to time
and we also had some issues with HTTP
see it has a weird behavior in some
places which is not common well if
follows specifications were well but
sometimes there are things that are not
specified in specifications which is
sort of common what HTTP clients does
and it it it may not follow those
conventions and it also has some race
conditions that have been reported and
known for some time so it just doesn't
get as much love as it as it could get
so a lot of these things had to figure
out for myself other things were figure
out other people so for example SSL
verify fun by dead trickster implements
the hostname verification so I could
look at that and it was very nice
sometime I don't really know when but I
think this year maybe late last year we
got this airline certified package which
sort of just brings your which adds a
certificate store which is built by Ben
would see that that's a hackney client
it may wonder why we don't use a more
commonly used HTTP client that may be
more actively maintained and the big
problem that we have is that Hicks runs
within the mixed application well within
within your mix project
and you can run your your your
application in the same virtual machine
that that the mix runs in so if we for
example would add Hackney as a
dependency that would that would
conflict with the with applications that
the user has has loaded in the same
virtual machine so we also have to
secure the integrity of the registry and
in packages so the registry is signed
with hex pm's private key and this is an
online private key and the reason it's
online and not offline is because the
registry changes multiple times per day
so it's not really feasible to have it
stored offline and so that's how verify
the integrity of the registry we also
have to verify integrity of package tar
balls and we do and we can do that
because the registry includes package
checksums and since the register is
signed we can also verify that the
packages have not changed the mix lock
files include checksum so that can also
be used to not realize the verification
but at least you would know if if the
repository for some reason change the
package shake some or or or change the D
the package that you have already locked
we need to secure authentication is a
bit hashed passwords they are not
they're basically used to to get api
keys that you use to communicate with
the API width and keys so just until
recently we had the key stored in plain
text on the user's computer now
encrypted with the way the user password
and by encrypting the API key on your on
your machine we are protected against
volar a vulnerability found in npm
earlier this year and the vulnerability
report describes how a worm can can can
quickly spread inside of a package
manager well inside of the repository
package manager so and so this was
described for npm and in NPN when you
when you fetch a package there is some
code executed which is part of the
package and we had the same thing in hex
and rear with the mix of the XS file
which is just code that that is that
that is run rebar river has the same
thing with the rebar convict script and
so this an issue because someone can
create a package which and actually
which when only when fetch not when run
finds the users local API key finds all
the packages that users published
publishes in a new version of all of
those packages with itself as a worm and
this can this convert very quickly
spread across the repository but just by
encrypting this with the but just by
encrypting the API key we are we are
protected against this and we're also
adding two factor authentication that
that would also help with issues like
this another issue is type of squatting
so there was a paper that came out this
summer that describes an attack and
package manager where a malicious user
can find popular packages they find
common type as for those packages and
published packages with the common type
were names with malicious code and we're
very simple protecting like against this
right now we just have a knighthood job
that runs every 24 hours that shakes the
similarity of new packages that day
against existing packages and if there
are if there are two similar admins are
notified and and and they can do a
manual take
a manual review so you may have heard of
left pad it's a package in n p.m. and it
was a bit of controversy around this
this summer and so so the kind of
explain what happened was that there was
this packet left pad which had a single
function it it padded string with the
certain number of characters and and it
was very dependent on there was a lot of
packages that depend on this package and
it had over a hundred thousand downloads
or almost one hundred thousand dollars a
day so very very active and the package
owner suddenly removed this package from
the repository which subsequently broke
large part of the of the of the large
part of all packages inside a NPM and
and to fix this issue the admins just
said well they just decided that they
would take ownership of the package and
against the general the original owner's
consent they they republished the
package to fix this and the main
takeaway from this is that we should
limit what users are allowed to do one
user shouldn't be allowed to break and
other users products right so this comes
back to the repeatable bills that we
talked about earlier if my project
worked last week and I did making
changes to it it should still work today
right and in hex we don't have this
issue because we limit these these kinds
of things you cannot change to remove a
package of has been published so
the main issue security-wise with hex is
that we do not yet have used to sign
packages the only signing we have is by
the repository so the repository is the
single
that entity and and there are a few
different solutions for this we have
public key infrastructure which is the
certificate which is similar to the
certificate of horses authorities that I
was talking about later this is not
really great because if xpm is this
typical certificate authority we still
have the same issue that that the tech
spam is the single trusted entity and
there's also the web of trust like GP g
and PG p and the main problems with that
is it's not very user-friendly and it it
it proves that you are certain person
but it's hard to to connect persons and
packages so someone will have to do that
linkage and the person that does that
linkage is again a single trusted person
and and for use of sight packages to
work it of course has to be secure but
the other thing it has to be is very
easy to use because otherwise people
just won't use it and we seen this in
other package managers that have
implemented signing which was not really
easy to use and people simply do not use
it so there's not a civil as far as I
can see there's not a silver bullet for
this but if someone has ideas i'm i'm
very interested to hear about it and so
before when the talk let's quickly talk
about the future of hicks and so we've
not yet reached wapato where we do not
have a stable API yet and am and what's
needed for that is we need to make sure
that the specifications are stable I
feel that's pretty close right now and
the HTTP API it needs to be stable which
is part of its specifications we also
need to fully implement the register the
new registry format which is which I'm
going to talk about next and make sure
that we are happy with that so I
mentioned that we have some issues with
the current registry today it's a it's a
single e test files it's a single e test
files it's almost mega by
compress it grows with about 20
kilobytes a week so in a year it would
be to double this size the other problem
with the ETS file it's kind of tricky to
do forward compatibility so we might
want to add things to registry and we
don't want to break all existing clients
and and that's we do that by using lists
and only matching on the front at least
but it's kind of informally specified
and they can be bugs in clients that
would that would suddenly break them so
we have a proposal for a new reads your
format and the fix for the for the
scalability problem with the file sizes
that we sped it into one file per
package so we have a single files /
actor for example use you fetch a single
file just for a CO and get the versions
and dependencies of ecto once I have
index files names and versions that list
the names and the versions of packages
those should not be used those those
would have the same scalability problems
so they should not be used for clients
they should only be used for things like
for a mirroring and and we use protocol
buffers to ensure forward compatibility
and to get the somewhat compact
representation of the registry and for
mix at least we still use the locally
test file as a cash for the whole
registry we're all we're also going to
add namespaces and this would allow
private packages and the issue with
namespaces is that I don't think it
should exist for public packages on hex
p.m. because we would have the same
issue with forks again there was talking
about earlier so I think this should
mabel excuse for private packages and if
if people want to have their own
repositories they keep snakes basis for
that too we're also adding package
retirement so this is if you find a
security issue in your package you want
to deprecated rename it or so on you can
you can retire the pack
you will get a warning we're fetching it
the package would still be available
because we of course need to make sure
that we still have repeatable builds and
to finally round this off these some of
the current issues that i see in hex
that needs to be improved and that we're
trying to work on first of package
signing if you have any ideas i'm happy
to hear them we have the issue of some
existing ireland packages that are very
highly depended on or not on xpm because
I the maintainer is not active anymore
or they're not interested in using
package manager they use a build tool
that does not support hakes or what they
just don't care right so that's a
problem that we have and I think that's
mostly an onboarding problem and trying
to help people see the benefits of using
a package manager the other issue which
Fred mentioned in the keynote is private
repositories which we are currently sort
of investigating the best way to do that
I know the group of three has a solution
for it and if that works out well for
them we might do something similar from
week so this might not be a an issue
that has to be resolved by the
repository but specifications maybe
clients can have their own rules for how
to how to use private repositories and
so I'm not sure if we have time for
questions but if we do we don't have
time for questions so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
