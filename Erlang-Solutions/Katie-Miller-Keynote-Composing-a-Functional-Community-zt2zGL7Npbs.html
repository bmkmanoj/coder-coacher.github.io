functional programming community and how
we might be able to improve the way that
we share the lamda love or in more
technical terms how we might be able to
do some refactoring and rework to help
make the community a bit more extensible
I know that refactoring or change of any
kind really can be a bit of a slippery
subject but I think this is a really
important topic so please bear with me I
promise there will be cute animal
pictures along the way
although this might be a bit
unconventional for a keynote I'd
actually like to start by showing you
some code and I'm not actually going to
do it using one of these the left up or
the puppy I'm going to write it by hand
so I'm going to pen the code in T line
it's pretty clear how it was derived so
I won't waste time explaining the syntax
we'll put that as a slug at the top for
miss compiler and the name of the
conference
- so Erlang user conference there you go
you're all excited to be at the Erlang
user conference yes you look like a
pretty smoking-hot audience if you don't
mind me saying so fact I'm actually a
little bit worried this might be a bit
too difficult for you
it has its roots in secretarial science
and it is pretty hardcore I know you'd
usually use Erlang for this sort of
thing but let's face it hardly anyone
likes the syntax so let's open our minds
to a superior solution so let's start
with something you might be able to
grasp we want to figure out SRV ours so
we'll declare that and to calculate them
we're going to call on the underscore
Athenian and use that to percolate or as
I like to say do a bit of a pen or
morphism we're passing and assembly of
points and a transformer even though you
code in Erlang I'm sure you're familiar
with those at least that takes a point
and inside the transformer we're going
to figure out a live rating by calling
on the next door
transformer with a point and the
assembly of points and then just simply
figuring out how long the result is the
Next Door transform I've penned
elsewhere but I'm sure you can imagine
it I bet by now you're a little bit
surprised by how elegant this is shaping
up to be it really is the only correct
way to write code especially when you're
talking about speeds of 120 words a
minute if you're really good at English
and maths and you work really hard maybe
you two one day will be able to do this
but you know or not just don't nag me
with any questions so next we're going
to simply perform the obvious exam to
see if the rating is true or 3 and if so
simply return it and hail it as a
bastion of truth and that's it IIF so
when you're trying this at home you'll
just need to set up one of these cameras
and run the standard command oh and hire
a compiler of course so did anyone not
get any of that put up your hand so we
can all see look at you awkwardly so
that was my coding demo how many people
feel confident they know what this code
does does anyone want to hazard a guess
no not even that even if you figured it
out I think you'll agree that was a
pretty terrible way of explaining it and
the purpose of that exercise was to try
to help you cast your mind back to the
time when you're an outsider to
functional programming the time before
you knew what all the jargon meant that
time wasn't actually all that long ago
for me but even I still know that it's
it's quite easy to forget sometimes what
it was like when you're on the other
side of that experience so let's do a
bit of a retrospective sorry post-agile
people what worked well with that demo
well the code I showed actually does
work but everything else was pretty
terrible I think there was unexplained
jargon there was an assumption about
your ability based on your appearance
they were insults based on the
programming language that you like you
were primed to believe that what you
were seeing was going to be hard and you
won't even the opportunity to ask
at least not without being made to feel
a bit silly you weren't given any
resources for doing this in your own
environment or anywhere to go for help
and you weren't given any context or
motivation to want to understand what
was being communicated I could have told
you I was writing a function to help
implement Conway's Game of Life which is
a cellular automaton and explain that
it's about cells or points that either
live or die over a number of iterations
based on the a few rules around the
state of neighboring cells could have
shown you this Wikipedia page to
motivate the example and show you how
interesting the results could be could
have also told you that the syntax T
line is a type of shorthand used by
journalists but that was actually using
it to write JavaScript got some cruel an
unusual person I guess I could have
broken this down for you to give you
some idea of how it works for example I
could have told you that this symbol
stands for cue or the word equal and the
little circle means s so together this
means equals and this is in the code
here here here double equals there and
there she might have given you a little
bit more of a handle of what's going on
I could have built on some knowledge
that you already have by telling you
that T line is based on handwritten
letters by showing you the alphabet here
where you can kind of start to see that
and most significantly I could have
explained what I was saying in terms
that would be familiar to you rather
than unfamiliar ones I did none of this
and although this example was quite
extreme in that almost nothing I did
really helped serve the goal of helping
you understand I hope that it reminds
you of some more subtle but nonetheless
off-putting examples of things you've
seen like this out in the real world the
world real F P world if so please keep
those at the back of your mind
so I've titled this talk composing a
functional community for a few reasons
notice I'm talking about a e community
one I hate to disappoint you but I'm not
actually talking about the Erlang
community I'm talking about the
functional programming community more
broadly some of us may embrace different
languages different syntaxes
different ways of working but I think
there is more to Unitas than there is to
divide us and we should be working
together
Erlang community elixir community
closure Pascal Scala regardless of the
differences we want to refactor the FP
community as a whole this community I'm
talking about building is a functional
one functional of course in that it
embraces functional programming but also
one that works one that operates well
and this functional community is
something we want to compose composing
functional composition and building up
results from smaller puzzle pieces you
need all those different pieces to get
the desired result
I also want to point out that
composition is a deliberate act it
doesn't just happen without any thought
so the key idea of this talk spoiler
alert sorry is that all of us are
responsible for sharing the land of love
in an effective way to help compose a
bigger more diverse functional
programming community and a few
questions naturally flow from that most
notably why and how given most of us
here are likely programmers I've decided
to delve into that by looking at the
core topic a bit like it were a coding
exercise so I'm going to give you a
little bit of background and then define
the problem we're facing discuss the
structure of a possible solution looking
at the inputs outputs and method and
then finally finish up with an brief
chat about the often forgotten postlude
testing I'm truly honored to have been
given the opportunity to speak to you
here today given I've met very few of
you in person before I thought I might
start by giving you a little bit of
background about who I am in the
unlikely case that you can't pick my
accent I can confirm I'm from Australia
the land down under which seems to
inspire a lot of interesting animal and
insect memes like these ones I promise I
didn't bring any spiders or sharks or
drop bears with me and in defense of my
nation don't forget we have cute
creatures in Australia too although
those koalas actually do have some
pretty nasty claws on them so I'm an
Aussie and the reason I was able to
write the T line shorthand you just saw
a little bit of earlier is I am a former
journalist
I worked in newspapers for a bit over
seven years before switching over to the
tea industry about three and a half
years ago I should probably admit up
front that Erlang isn't my functional
mother tongue so to speak I am actually
literally wearing my programming
language preference on my sleeve right
at this moment so you don't have to come
up and stare at me awkwardly later
here's a close-up so when high school
designer Philip Wadler saw me wearing
this he actually chastised me for not
including a QR code linking to the
source code so I apologize I did neglect
to do that but I can tell you that these
are sorting algorithms written in
Haskell so if I am a fan of high school
however I have made a habit of
participating in a variety of
programming communities FP focused and
otherwise so I'm a pretty familiar face
a variety of meetups and other events
for people who write high school Scala
Clojure Erlang JavaScript Ruby Python
and PHP among others my day job is
working for Red Hat as a developer
advocate for the open source open shift
platform as a service which requires me
to deal with all kinds of different
developers who are interested in using
the platform and if you're interested in
that feel free to talk to me during the
rest of the conference i co-founded a
group for women in FP called lambda
ladies which I'll talk a little bit more
about later and I'm a co-organizer of
the brisbane functional program group
which is a meetup group based in
Brisbane Australia with more than 500
members now we've really seen it start
to take off in the past couple of years
and finally as you may have gathered I'm
a woman this means I'm a member of an
underrepresented group in the FP
community and in the wider programming
community I heard a said once that every
woman in tech will eventually do a talk
of being a woman in tech and I'm not a
candidate to be a counterexample for
that I'm going to share some of my
personal experiences today to be honest
I'd rather be talking about something
more technical both because this is a
somewhat contentious area to address and
because I wish there weren't any need to
talk about it I wish that there wasn't
an issue but there is and I think it's
an important important enough topic that
we spend some time and effort focusing
on it so that's a bit about who I am and
where I'm coming from but I
so I want to make it clear who and what
I am not so I'm not someone who can
speak for all lambda ladies or all
female programmers or all women just one
person whether you like what I have to
say or you don't please don't assume
that any of my ideas presented today are
necessarily shared by anyone in any
group that with which I happen to
identify this is something that those
and underrepresented groups always have
in the back of their minds that if we
make a mistake it's going to underscore
some negative stereotype and affect
others from our group please don't fall
into that trap finally I want to make it
clear just because I happen to be
someone who is part of an
underrepresented group in the FP
community this doesn't make me an expert
on diversity or community issues I don't
necessarily know all the relevant theory
and I certainly don't have all the
answers I'm not here today to offer the
silver bullet for addressing community
issues I'm really just here to start a
conversation I have made an effort to
crowdsource some of the content I'm
presenting by talking to other people
and by doing some research into relevant
areas so that I can do my best to
reflect more than just my own thoughts
but dealing with these issues that we
have as a community is something that
needs to be done with healthy dialogue
between many parties rather than anyone
put one person's take on it so with
those preliminaries out of the way let's
move on
just like with any technical issue we
can't tackle a problem
unless we first understand what it is so
let's ravely stare this issue in the
face I want to look at two problems or
two different facets of the community
issue the first is that our community is
not as big as it could or should be
functional programming is awesome it has
elegant solutions for dealing with
today's computing environments and the
need for concurrent distributed systems
I don't need to convince you of that you
know it especially as users of Erlang
and OTP FP has all this goodness and I
think its popularity is on the rise
because of it but if we're honest we
have to admit it hasn't really hit the
big time yet and become a dominant
paradigm this is reflected in many
places but just to give one example I
did a search recently on the stack
overflow job site which has almost 1,500
jobs listed
and of those there were just 12
mentioning erling or Haskell receive 14
mentions closure 8 and Scala a little
bit higher with 53 and this was in
contrast to Java with 532 mentions
python with around 300 and C Ruby in
c-sharp with around 250 now of course FP
isn't limited to particular languages so
that doesn't perfectly reflect are those
positions that embrace FP but I think
it's still a pretty good indicator that
there is work that can be done on this
front why should we bother well with a
bigger FP community helping FP r to
become more mainstream they would likely
be more FP jobs that is more jobs that
don't make us want to poke our eyes out
so we more chance of us getting to work
with code that we like and there will be
more people to share the workload of
creating awesome things with FP more
open source code more libraries perhaps
even more languages I would argue
strongly that this is a very good thing
the second problem in our community is
that it's not as diverse as it should be
what does that mean
what is diversity when you hear the word
diversity in tech sometimes it's used in
a way as if it's synonymous with gender
diversity that is one type of diversity
but it is only one diversity is about
including people of all kinds and
categories here are just a few of the
groups that are included that in that
gender diversity is there but I'd like
to point out that it means more than
just the lack of women gender diversity
also encompasses people who are
genderqueer
a gender non gender conforming and a
fluid gender among other things the
aspect of diversity I'm going to mainly
focus on in this talk is the lack of
women in our community as it's the area
I'm most qualified to speak about but
many points will apply as well to other
types of diversity and the conversation
that we have around this as a community
must be broader than that if you want a
good general primer on diversity I
recommend watching a straightens
programming diversity talk which will be
linked to in my references something I
do want to mention which at which Ash
sites in a talk is that marginalizing
people based on group stereotypes is
something we're all susceptible to doing
you might think that you're a logical
rational person and you would never
treat someone different
because of one of these characteristics
well consider this there was a study
done on hiring for a job in academic
science for a laboratory manager manager
position and there were two applications
that the people running the study used
and they were identical the only
difference was that they had a male or a
female name and the science faculty
members who received these applications
who no doubt would think themselves
logical rational people just like us
rated the male applicant are
significantly more competent and
horrible than the identical female
applicant and they said they give the
male a higher starting salary and more
career mentoring interestingly the
gender of the faculty members who are
doing these ratings did not affect the
responses males and females rating these
candidates were equally likely to
exhibit bias against the female student
so bias can be really subtle and we can
have biases even against people from
groups - we - which we ourselves belong
none of us are above this so to homed in
on the lack of women now how are we
going with gender diversity in the IT
community generally well I have a few
stats so back in the mid 80s about 37%
of computer science undergrad degrees in
the US were rewarded to women compared
to just 18% in 2010 again in the late
80s 42% of us software developers were
women whereas today it's around 20%
there was a 2013 survey around free and
open source software and it found that
women make up about 11% of the
open-source community and this is
actually a rise on what the previous
survey found the previous survey was
more around two to three percent are
those some stats released by Google just
last couple of weeks and they showed
that globally only amongst their
technical employees they were just 17%
women and I might mention too that the
racial statistics that they showed as
well were actually even worse sure only
for the US but again other big issues
there - not only do we have a problem
with getting women into the industry of
a problem with them leaving the industry
so one study found that 41% of technical
women are gone after 10 years and 56%
after 10 to 20 just more than double the
quit rate for men
and finally I might mention there was a
study that showed by surveying all the
other research that is done that there
is no biological reason why women should
perform worse than men at mathematical
tasks so you often hear this old
chestnut it's just simply not true
that's not the reason for these kind of
stats so that's women in IT generally
what about women in functional
programming specifically as far as I
know we have no official statistics on
this but anecdotally it would seem that
the percentage of women in FP is far
worse than even the percentage of women
in IT generally one illustration of this
from my own experience I was at the GAO
lambda jam conference in Brisbane last
year I walked up to get my lanyard and
my t-shirt and someone I'd never met
before handed them to me without me
saying the word they could do that
because out of 120 our delegates I was
the only one now that's a bit of a perk
I suppose to be instantly recognized but
it's one I'd gladly give up and it was a
bit heartening to see that at this
year's event the same event I was not
the only one although there was still
only a handful of us and I might be all
the way over in Australia but I have
reason to believe that it's not just me
experiencing this I spoken with members
of lambda ladies from many places in the
world and they to agree that the
percentage of women in FP is far worse
than NIT generally so I have a few
snippets of their responses so one says
yes women are definitely
underrepresented in FP based of their uh
based on their observations and
conferences in Europe in Europe and in
the US another says that at a particular
London FP language meetup group they
went and out of a hundred attendees they
think they were the only woman there and
she says I've never actually felt
acutely out of place in an FP community
until then and finally lest you think
this is only other languages one person
says in the Erlang community in which I
know there is a fast under over under
representation of women so we're not as
diverse as we should be as a community
why do we care I think we should care
because we write programs for the whole
population and we should have a fair
representation of that population
creating them the technology we produce
has the
power to shape our world and our future
and we want it to be shaped in a way
that reflects the interests of all not
just an empowered few this alone I think
should be enough reason to care but if
you don't find that convincing consider
this also studies have shown that having
a more diverse workforce leads to more
innovation better performance in the
marketplace and increased profits and
there is a wealth of research to support
this but here just a couple of findings
one study found that teams comprising
women and men produce IT patents that
decided 26 to 42 percent more often than
the norm for similar sorts of patents
and another study found that companies
with diversity in leadership and says
all types of diversity now were more in
a roof and outperformed others employees
at these companies were 45% more likely
to report market share growth over the
previous year and 70% more likely to
report that the firm captured a new
market why is this people with different
experiences have different perspectives
sometimes it just takes one key insight
to open up a whole new suite of
potential applications I saw an example
of this just a couple of weeks ago as a
developer I have this problem where I
find it really hard to resist buying
shiny new things with an API and as such
last year I ended up buying a string of
ossie designs intelligent Christmas
lights called holiday but I hadn't
really found much use for them since
Christmas time so I decided to take them
along to a weekend Hut retreat a few
weeks ago called can't yes so what do
you do with a string of programmable
lights and there they are there yeah
well before long so in a camp had a key
insight that opened up a new world of
possibilities they decided to arrange
them as a grid before long there was a
camp up to do countdowns wonderful
scrolling text an app that would display
flags of the world based on Twitter
hashtags and even a snake game which is
what you can see then I could have got
in on the action too
I created a node.js app on openshift to
show the output for the game of life
which I've embedded here so it enables
people to do different seed patterns and
then see the effects both here and up on
what was the big screen 7x7 res for the
win
so this may not have been the most
innovative idea ever thinking inside the
box but it's something I hadn't thought
of on my own having diversity of
perspective makes these aha moments more
likely to happen and when they do the
whole group benefits so why is our
community not as big or diverse as we'd
like it to be why do we have this
problem I started to ask members of
lamda ladies why they thought there was
an issue particularly with regards to
attracting women they had a whole lot of
different ideas but there were three
kind of main threads to them firstly FB
has an image problem that turns people
away this was reiterated over and over
in the responses I got and here are a
few snippets they use words like deeply
academic vein of elitism a sense of
protectiveness Clubhouse science style
and a culture of intellectual
territoriality
that's unfriendly to outsiders someone
else mentions the whole neckbeard beard
thing and says how unappealing that is
both to men and women and finally since
FP tends to be sold in a hyper
intellectualized manner this evokes the
math is hard brand of
anti-intellectualism
it has a differentially powerful impact
on women due to the way we gender the
sciences that is FP propaganda has a
habit of taking the things which cause
women to be underrepresented in stem at
science technology engineering and math
generally and then cranking them up to
11 so for anyone wondering what on earth
these quotes could be referring to let
me give you a bit more of a concrete
example I'm sure many of you have seen
this t-shirt before by all means
it's a pretty funny slogan to NFP and
I've FP Insider who understands it but
for outsiders this kind of thing
perpetuates the image of functional
programming as inaccessible and academic
let me be clear on this point promoting
this kind of image to the wider
community to keep FP exclusive by
deliberately making the barriers to
entry high that doesn't make a super
smart coding ninjas that just makes us
douchebags this is underscored by the
second theme I saw running through the
responses but the functional programming
community can at times be unwelcoming to
newcomers and here again some snippets
that reflect that so one
person says that the meetups have been
going to the members tried to make the
titles of the talks inaccessible and
they actually kind of saw that as a
barrier to entry that they wanted
another says there were no women there
that was bizarre and made me feel very
uncomfortable I'd go to conferences and
literally no one would talk to me unless
I was very forward and grab people's
attention someone else says this simply
always too much showing off and never
enough treating people with respect and
finally countless minor jokes were told
to be honest I felt pretty convicted
conflicted after that evening on the one
hand I really enjoyed the talks on the
other I felt completely disassociated
with the community itself so finally
there was one more theme that I noticed
Chazz it was a lack of support for
beginners or learners so one person just
says this right out they are not
welcoming or encouraging to beginners
despite what many of them say they're
the nerdiest of the Nerds and on some
level they want to keep it that way and
now that person talks about the amount
of privilege and luck it took them just
to get to the point where they
discovered functional programming and
then after that adding on all the issues
about maintaining involvement in the
community and another says most of the
inroads seem to be academic and require
a great deal of proactiveness which
takes confidence and importantly the
privilege for someone to be willing to
mentor you now keep in mind too that
these snippets come from women who are
in the functional programming community
these are the ones who managed to
overcome that the barrier the barriers
that they're talking about at least for
now people leaving the community because
I've had enough of this is another
dimension of the problem one respondent
made the point and it's an excellent one
but really the people we should be
talking to about why they're not in the
community other people who aren't in the
community I suspect that their answers
would reflect a lot of what we've seen
here
so we have a problem a community is not
as big or diverse as we would like how
can we solve it I know sometimes you
look at a kind of social problem like
this and it just seems huge and unwieldy
can feel like you don't even know where
to start as I said earlier I can't offer
definitive answers but just as if we
were writing some program I think there
is some value in considering our
function signature our inputs and
outputs before we look at a proposed
method so firstly inputs the inputs were
talking about in this case are people in
growing our community we really need to
reach out to a number of different
groups this includes those who have a
program before at all and those who have
but aren't actually doing FP and I think
for FP particularly the difference
between the way we educate and reach out
to people who have prior exposure to
programming versus those who don't is
quite stuck and community growth isn't
all about quantity either its quality to
is sometimes forgotten that the target
of our efforts should include members of
our own community present and past we
need to make sure we're both attracting
new people and retaining the ones we
have by making sure we're not burning
them out and that they have the support
they need we may want to reach out to
those who are no longer active to see if
there's anything we can do to help them
back into the fold and of course within
these three broad groups there are many
subcategories we might want to think
about using different approaches for for
example children or people who are
vision impaired it's important that we
consider who we're targeting with any
outreach efforts and tailor what we do
accordingly we can't expect the same
approach to work for everyone
so these inputs cover who are targeting
with our outreach but what about the
people doing the outreach work who is
responsible for growing our community
this is sometimes overlooked so I wanted
to hear this point loud and clear you
are I am all of us are it is not the job
of the minorities within a community to
improve the diversity of the community
putting the burden of this on them is
unfair and only exacerbates the problem
if women for example are expected to be
the only ones spending time going around
and running special outreach events and
doing other things to attract women that
is less time that they have to
encoding and actually improving their FP
skills to put somebody at disadvantage
it is everyone's job to help grow the
community let's not burn out certain
people with the responsibility you don't
get to say it's not my problem if you're
a part of this community then it's as
much your problem as anyone elses next
up what outputs do we expect to see from
what we do what would it mean to be
kicking goals in the community growth
arena
I think this flows naturally from what I
talked about earlier we want to see a
bigger community so more people popping
out at the end of that process as
members of our community and we want
greater diversity in those members that
we see and we also want it to be as we
said a functional community want those
members to be happy people who haven't
been lunch with all the responsibilities
and are actually able to focus on
growing their knowledge of FP that is
going to help us reach our goals of
making FP more mainstream driving
innovation creating more jobs and all
that good stuff so we've got our
function signature down what are we
actually going to do to turn those
inputs into the outputs how can we break
this problem down into smaller more
manageable pieces that can be composed
to serve our end goal this of course is
the tough part there are a lot of
different ways we could tackle this I
just want to talk about three main
themes connected to my own experience
and the three reasons behind the problem
that I talked about earlier so when I go
around talking about FP and mention the
lack of women sometimes I get the
question well how did you get it into FP
then you know what are you doing here
when I reflect on this there are kind of
three main catalysts I can identify for
why I am here today as a member of the
FP community I first became interested
in FP in university thanks to one very
passionate professor to whom I'll always
be grateful you see at my university the
only course that covered different
programming paradigms such as logic and
functional programming have been removed
from the curriculum by the time I came
to study there this professor though was
so passionate about the need to educate
students about these things that he
offered to teach parts of the course to
students in his own time in the library
from secret sessions so I went along to
these secret sessions in the library and
learn about Haskell
Lisp and all these good things although
I didn't really learn I didn't really
write a whole lot of code during these
sessions I was influenced by the
professor's passion for this area and
the many many elegant functional
solutions to problems that he showed us
he gave us an education in FP but most
importantly it was an education that
provided motivation which is the first
of a three faint themes I want to look
at it gave me a reason to want to learn
more about FP in the future and this
story isn't unique to me actually just
last night I was talking to another
conference attendee who said the reason
that they are in Erlang is because they
had a professor that taught a course in
their own time on early so no these kind
of people are around and that passion
it's really quite powerful I think so
after I'd finished university and
entered the workforce I decided to go
along to the local functional group I
was sufficiently interested and I have
to say the first time there was pretty
uncomfortable when I walked in I felt
like people would look at me as if I'd
wandered into the wrong room
I felt very intimidated when the speaker
asked questions like put your hand up if
you know what a closure is just still a
bit of a fuzzy concept for me at the
time the dilemma was putting my hand up
would be a confirmation to those around
me that I didn't also not putting my
hand up would be a confirmation that I
didn't belong in that room but putting
it up meant I might be called along upon
to explain the concept which was quite
terrifying I probably only understood
about 10% of the talk that I saw
although luckily in that 10% there was a
discussion of the maybe data type and
some of my colleagues at work had just
introduced an optional jobs have been
our Java so I actually saw something
that was immediately useful and which
did help to motivate me to return
ultimately though if the only exposure I
had to functional programming was that
that meetup group I'm not sure I would
still be here and still be part of this
community today because it wasn't a safe
friendly place to learn for me the
breakthrough for me came when I was
invited to join a small study group that
was going through the learn your Haskell
book just meeting once a week it was I
was undoubtedly the least experienced
program in the group but it didn't
matter we were all new to Haskell and
everyone's ideas were valued there we
all took turns leading the group
there was no there was no expert we were
a group of equals so we worked our way
through the entire book together over
the course of about six months and it
was exactly what I needed to get up to
speed it was a safe space for me to
learn and that's the second theme I want
to talk about safe spaces so at the end
of the study group I had a reasonable
handle on FP and Haskell basics but I
also knew there was a huge amount I
still had to learn so for that I kept
attending the local functional group and
there I found two people who really
helped me along my along the way the
first of those is someone whose name you
might know because he's been part of the
Erlang community and that's AJ Reeves
O'Jays contribution to my journey is
just that he was always friendly and
encouraging while others wouldn't say
anything to me when I was new to the
group Oh J always made an effort to come
up and say hello and introduce me to
other people it's a very simple thing
but it made a huge difference it's also
just always encouraging when I felt
overwhelmed by how much I had to learn
he always seemed to be there to give me
the boost that I needed another person
that's been significant for me is Toni
Morris who again is someone you may have
heard of I refer to Tony as brisbin's
functional programming guru he really
knows his stuff and importantly his door
is always open I knew I could always go
and ask him to look over my code or
explain what something meant and he
would make himself available to do it
and this has been really important for
me and my growth as a functional program
and it's also given me the reassurance I
needed to start to step out and do some
presentations to help other people come
more up to speed with FP I knew that if
I showed Toni my material first he would
pull me up on anything that wasn't quite
right which gave me the confidence to be
able to go out there even though I'm
certainly no expert so AJ and Toni have
both been important figures on my
journey because they have served as
mentors and that's the third theme I
want to talk about mentoring so that's
my story and based on that I want to
talk about those three areas that I
think we can work on to grow our
functional programming community
education providing motivation creating
safe spaces and mentoring I think all of
these are important if we want people
who are currently outside us to become
productive happy members of the
community
so firstly let's have a look at the
details of how we can implement a
solution for education providing
motivation this part of the solution I
think we can use to help counter the FP
image problem I mentioned earlier
cutting through all those misconceptions
about our craft being academic and elite
and whatnot so let's consider the inputs
to this method there are a few firstly
we want to educate beginners and this
means we need to create beginner
friendly content this is easier said
than done I said at the start of my talk
that it's it's easy to forget the
struggles you face there's an FP inside
I once you're on the other side of that
I think it's also really easy to forget
all the little things that you had to
learn along the way and the way this
manifests is that when you then come to
teach someone else you often skip steps
that seem just so obvious to you now so
one classic example I have of that is
when I was teaching a workshop to
teenage girls teaching them how to use
the terminal I thought I'd explained it
adequately but as I went around the room
I saw some girls and they were they were
there scrolling up in their terminal
history trying to change things and I
realized in that moment that you know
I'd obviously skipped over something
quite core to how one user terminal
users eternal because it just seems so
obvious and natural to me but of course
it wasn't obvious or natural to them now
we have to be very mindful this kind of
thing when we're trying to educate
beginners a second group we want to
reach out and educate about people in FP
is those in underrepresented groups but
how do we do that in my experience the
answer to this is pretty simple you
invite them you ask them there's a
functional programming course run by a
company in Australia called NICTA and
they ran it in Brisbane earlier this
year and not a single woman applied to
attend or came along the organizers
weren't very happy with that so they
reached out to me and we decided to run
the course again in Brisbane but this
time we called it the lambda lady's
nectar course and we specifically
invited women to come along even though
we also still allowed men to apply the
result was that the participants in the
course ended up being about 60% women
was exactly the same course material as
as has been run before the difference in
the demographic was just due to the way
we advertised it we just
promoted it in all the different women's
in tech groups that we had locally and
also that we had a woman on board to
help teach it myself and we found the
women who attended it equally as well as
the men here's one comment from one of
the women that I found really
encouraging she says I think a lot of
people are scared of functional
programming it's definitely a barrier
but I think it was helpful that women
was specifically invited to this and she
says I feel like I have a decent grasp
on one ends now I'm wondering what all
the fuss is about
just always nice to see the last input I
want to mention is people from other
programming language communities and I
think we should definitely reach out to
people from other programming language
communities but I also think we can
learn a lot from them and their
approaches to education rails girls and
rails bridge for example are two
fantastic efforts to attract more people
to rails that we can learn from I think
rails girls does a really good job of
very quickly getting people up to speed
and giving them that motivation to keep
learning so we run rails girls weekends
in Brisbane twice now I took part of
those because I believe it's part of my
job to support all efforts to increase
diversity and the events I think we're a
resounding success we've already seen
people who attended just those short
weekend events now going on to actually
get jobs as Ruby developers so someone
the functional community have already
started to copy this approach we now
have some events such as closure bridge
which we ran for the first time in
Brisbane just a few weeks ago these sort
of events I think really need our
support but I also think there's plenty
of room for more of them think we can
also learned from the really friendly
welcoming nature of a lot of other
programming language communities I've
experienced this in many communities
including Ruby Python and JavaScript so
at Camp Jas when I wrote that note up
for the game of life I struggled a bit
because I don't do a lot of node and
Java scripts in-home surprises me with
its return types and it's non-functional
way of doing some things but someone
else from the camp sat down with me and
they went through every line of code I
wrote with me and helped to explain some
of the node idioms which I think was
really helpful and it's just quite
typical of that community and the
attitude they have it's very valuable
when you're a newcomer to have that and
I think this is something we should be
known for - as a community taking part
in that camp jace event was also really
worthwhile
it's just to actually genuinely have a
go and try to experience what these
people the JavaScript people are going
through so I have a first-hand knowledge
of that when you then come to try and
talk about functional things I think
sometimes we just come in and start
criticizing the way that other language
communities do things without first
actually really trying to understand the
frustrations that they have and how
things really work for them so I think
it's quite useful to go through that
experience so what are the outputs we
want for our educational outreach I
think there are two key things we want
learning to take place we want to be
able to set some learning goals and make
sure participants rather than leaving
frustrated and infused actually get
there and reach them and secondly as
I've already talked about we want our
education to provide the necessary
motivation for people to keep learning
we're never going to be able to teach
people everything about FP in a talk or
workshop whether it's one hour or a day
or a whole week even we but we can make
sure that we leave them with a hunger to
want to learn more and to continue the
journey so how do we actually go about
this well from my experience teaching a
few workshops and on functional
programming I don't know the topics and
some of the reading I've done I'd like
to offer a few suggestions I think we
need to really carefully consider our
curricula and our pedagogy that's what
we teach and how we teach it and some
general tips out off around that is that
we always need to consider our audience
and build on what they already know to
do this you need to assess what they
already know first rather than just
charging in and inundating them with
information and then set a series of
small attainable goals leading up to
your overall learning goal so that your
students are buoyed by some success
along the way I think one often
forgotten aspect of how we teach is to
use visual mediums there's certainly a
lack of that in a lot of the material
we've seen but it really helps to
solidify knowledge and also as I was
always taught as a journalist we need to
keep a language simple words matter in
teaching unexplained jargon can be
really intimidating use unambiguous
simple language and explain every
acronym or unfamiliar term break it down
basically do the exact opposite of what
I did in my demo at the start
secondly language choice this is a
pretty controversial subject I just want
to look at a few points based on my
reading what makes a good teaching
language can be very different for what
makes a good programming language
generally and there are some evidence
that the best language to use may
actually depend on the cognitive
characteristics of your students so
there may not be just one language that
is always the best one to use for
teaching and there's also some evidence
that syntax may matter there's a really
interesting study that's linked to in my
references you can read about that it
didn't actually include a functional
language but they found that students
taught Java or Perl performed on par
with those taught language with randomly
generated keywords whereas students
taught Ruby or Python did better which
is it's interesting I think those using
the Erlang VM have a really great
teaching option with elixir the gateway
drug into the functional world as Dave
Thomas has used it I'd love to see how
successful efforts can be using that to
teach functional programming going
forward next I want to mention tooling
this can be a real headache for
beginners and it's often overlooked most
professional programming tools are not
designed with beginners in mind we have
to make a concerted effort to explain
environment setup and tooling to novices
so they're not stuck with error messages
that they have no idea how to address I
think cloud computing can be really
useful here we may be able to abstract
away some of the environment headache by
hosting educational material in the
cloud and I've tried this by using the
openshift pass for some of my workshops
and I found it to work really well
especially with complete beginners to
programming I think education can happen
in many contexts but we've seen great
success we make the effort to organize
focused events like rails girls closure
bridge and the NICTA workshop I
mentioned earlier our local functional
programming group has been running some
hack nights where they're just
experienced functional programmers
available to help get beginners up to
speed and help set up their environments
and all that which has been really
useful I think we really need to
consider our onboarding processes from
the point of view of a beginner as was
pointed out by Dave Thomas and Jose over
Lim and their Erlang factory keno so
when the workshop is over people still
need a path to follow to get themselves
set up and delve into development I
think we can definitely do a better job
of this
make sure there's plenty of good
beginner-friendly content available to
walk people around some of the potential
stumbling blocks and finally it's my
opinion that we will do a better job of
attracting people to FP if we take a
positive approach you catch more flies
with honey than you do vinegar as they
say after one of my recent talks on FP
in another language community one of the
attendees tweeted they were interested
in learning more and they said the
following not starting with all your
languages suck was pretty compelling I
think that sums it up nicely
let's tell others what FP has to offer
rather than just going around telling
them they're doing it wrong so that's a
brief look at some of the details of a
possible approach to education obviously
there's a lot more that could be said
about this area but hopefully that's
just provided a little bit of food for
thought next I want to talk about
creating safe spaces this approach I
think helps to address the problem of
the community sometimes being
unwelcoming this is really important for
functional programming because
functional programming is such a
different way of looking at problems and
even experienced programmers have to go
through this period of adjustment when
they feel like complete beginners again
it's hard for everyone but it's
particularly hard if you're from a group
that happens to be a minority in the
community when you're already battling
all the things that go along with that
so I think this is one of the big
reasons for having a group like lambda
ladies actually when I first had the
crazy idea to start a group called
lambda ladies I not actually met any
other women in FP and I dismissed the
thought because I was worried it would
be a group of one and there would be no
point I turned out to be very very wrong
about a year after I first thought about
that I decided would be cool to submit
something on functional programming to
the Grace Hopper celebration which is a
large women's tech conference and I put
the word out on Twitter for some other
women in FP to collaborate with there
ended up being five of us and that was
for more women in FP then I never dealt
with before so we submitted to the
conference and ultimately a proposal was
rejected however the process of working
on the proposal together was a really
positive one for all of us we never met
in person but we developed a bond around
these shared experiences we found we had
as women and FP and often the only women
in our local functional programming
groups
so out of this camaraderie lambda ladies
was born and far from being a group of
one or a group of five it has grown to
be a group of more than 200 members it's
mostly an online group with most
interaction taking place on Google
Groups but there have been several
real-life meetups these often happen
around conferences the five of us who
formed the group had already found our
way into their feet community despite
the hurdles but we were able to create a
safe space for those who possibly
weren't there yet and the responses from
my lambda lady survey going to spell out
the role of having such a group so one
person says it's space we don't always
have to be on your guard against
harassment we don't have to worry about
how you present yourself that femininity
femininity will undermine your
credibility or that asking stupid
questions will affect the way people
think of women as a whole just seeing
other women is energizing one says and I
certainly agree with that another makes
the point that it's important to
understand that women create their own
spaces to create tech because all the
existing spaces are for men by default
and now that says it makes them feel
less isolated and finally on the point
of whether or not this is about
segregation which it certainly is not
one says women's groups ultimately are
not insular they exist to strengthen
members resolve so that women can both
achieve individual success and bring
progress to the program community as a
whole and that's certainly true this is
not about separating in and having all
the women over here and everyone else
over there it's about giving women or
any other group a safe space to be so
that they can then come out and bring
that success to the community as a whole
so what are the inputs to this well I
think it's just those who may not
otherwise participate but also all of us
because rather than having these safe
spaces off to the side perhaps we can
make the community as a whole a safer
space for everyone and it takes all of
us to achieve that here's a quote from
Tim Chevalier on this point he says men
seem to feel powerless to do anything
about the state of affairs and yet they
have power they can let men who make
these comments know that sexism isn't
okay and he says countering it requires
courage and moral stamina it's work that
largely needs to be done by men so again
it's the
all of everyone to make this community
better for us as a whole and it's
article linked to there is a great one
if you haven't read it before what's the
output of this we just want people who
are comfortable to be able to focus on
FP itself rather than all this other
extraneous stuff that we just really is
just getting in the way how do we do
this well there's a few things that are
useful one is codes of conduct and we
saw this actually at lamda ladies there
was a woman who was looking to learn a
particular functional language I won't
say which one and she found a mentor
online was a guy and he introduced her
to a particular IRC channel for that and
there she was exposed to some really
negative things there was sexist and
homophobic language and she was not very
comfortable in this space so she came to
lamda ladies and you know she talked
about this and what should she do she
didn't want to lose the mentor but she
was really feeling uncomfortable with
this in the end she didn't have to do
anything because the mentor realized
what was going on was inappropriate talk
to the people on the channel called them
I find it and created a code of conduct
for it so we saw a really good outcome
there from people just been willing to
stand up and call this stuff out when
they see it and then providing a way a
path for these things to be addressed in
future when there is an appropriate
behavior think using inclusive language
is really important if you read that
full a blog post from Tim chapelier
you'll see it's actually sparked by a
single line that someone said in the
high school community that instantly
made everyone in that room who was a
woman feel like they were the other they
were out of place and that it's just
it's so easy to do it can just be you
know a couple of words and you've done
that so something to be really mindful
for the words we speak do have great
power and finally there's a few
suggestions from the high school
symposium where they talked a little bit
about this issue last year and the way
that people have been harmed in that
community their suggestions were yes
speaking up calling the stuff out
listening to one another and the effect
of the things that are going on
supporting one another and taking care
of ourselves so not letting people
burnout shewing this stuff so the last
thing i want to talk about in terms of
the three themes
is how we might address the problem of
lack of support for people who are
learning and I think that's through
mentoring education isn't enough in
isolation I went to a conference in New
Zealand recently with Tony Morris to
talk about monads and other principled
things and afterwards I heard overheard
someone saying well I still don't know
what a monotheist
and this can be a bit frustrating cuz
you think well you just had it laid out
like really clearly there were no
analogies of what not but I think what
they actually meant was I still don't
know how I would sit down and apply this
concept for myself and it's difficult to
give people that in a talk or even a
workshop they need to build up their
intuition on their own but in doing that
you want to make sure they're going down
the right path and as they do they're
going to have questions I think this is
where mentoring comes in helping to give
some direction to the learning and
encouragement and stepping in to provide
assistance as necessary so who can do
this mentoring well anyone who's one
step ahead of the person that's being
mentored recently at commit who's like a
prolific high schooler came to Brisbane
and everyone was kind of Anor in him he
was this Oracle just everyone would come
up and ask a question and be writing
scribbling down formulas on the back of
an envelope kind of thing and we're all
so impressed by his formidable knowledge
and then a week later I found myself at
camp yes and people were coming up to me
and they were asking about peeing in
Monde ads and I found myself scribbling
on the back of it envelope and writing
formulas and things and I had this
moment where I thought well to these
people in this context I am like they'd
commit even though I am no expert you
don't have all that knowledge but you
only need to be just that one little bit
that one step ahead and you can fall
into that role of being the mentor
what's the output of this mentors become
mentees become Mentors
this is growing our community and just
continuing that cycle how do we mentor I
think it's pretty simple
it's about being friendly and
encouraging and really listening to what
people are saying and just sharing your
knowledge in that context so there are
three areas I wanted to talk about but
there are also some other suggestions
from the lambda lady so I'll quickly
show you a few more things that they
said
one said just getting rid of all the the
FP propaganda and treating FP like any
other paradigm something quite easy that
we could tackle now that talks about the
lack of mentor saying we should get more
women featured on numberphile Haskell
cast and what not outreach training
scholarships for conferences also
education not about FP but educating
everyone about the ways that tech
culture enforces power dynamics that
disadvantage these groups that we've
been talking about and reaching out to
organizations that focus on improving
the experiences of these people we're
not experts necessarily on on diversity
and codes of conduct and all these kinds
of things but there are organizations
that are and they're there and willing
to help and finally if we can get a more
open discussion of the phenomenon we can
change it I think that's really key just
having the conversation so the last area
I wanted to talk about briefly is just
testing I've mentioned along the way a
lot of these things you know they're a
little bit of guesswork don't really
know what the numbers are for the FP
community so why not actually do
something about that we could do some
kind of FP Community Survey to give us a
benchmark so we can actually then
measure the result of our efforts I
think we could probably do some work to
assess the teaching tools that were
using and how they affect beginners it
may be that we need to develop some new
tools we're not going to know that
unless we take an Imperial cool approach
to this and finally I think we really
need to be open to feedback from outside
the community it's hard to do but if we
can find out why people from particular
groups are saying that they're not in
our community and they haven't felt
welcome and we can listen to their
stories that's really going to inform
our efforts going forward so let's recap
I say that the FP community has a
problem and that it's not as big or
diverse as it could or should be the
percentage of women for example appears
to be much worse than in the program
community generally there are a number
of reasons this might be I suggested
that FPS negative image community that
can sometimes be on welcoming and lack
of support for learners can all play a
part we considered how we might solve
this problem looking at who we should
reach out to and who is responsible for
doing that outreach
and that was all of us we looked at the
outputs we'd like to see or the goal of
the community being bigger and more
diverse without burning out individuals
or failing to support the existing
members of the community we looked at
some possible methods for doing that
education that provides motivation the
creation of safe spaces and mentoring
and finally we had a brief chat about
how we might be able to test the
effectiveness of our efforts at the
start of this talk I showed you some
code written in t line to help you
remember what it was like when you are
an FP outsider the code was part of an
implementation of the game of life I
wrote at Camp Jes to be displayed on a
string of intelligent lights arranged in
a grid thanks to the input from others
at the camp may not have being the
greatest innovation ever to think inside
the square but it's a reminder that we
need those light bulb moments to drive
innovation but having a diverse array of
voices in our company in the
conversation helps to promote that I'd
like to conclude by revisiting that up
in the game of life little communities
of live cells form but they also die off
when there are too many as if by
overpopulation new cells can be spawned
but only when they have exactly three
live neighbours what if we changed the
rules of the game what if no cell died
off due to overpopulation and any cell
in contact with at least three live ones
came to life or in other words what if
we were able to retain all the
switched-on people in a community and
all clusters of members were able to
attract new people well we get growth
life and eventually world domination
if we can attract more people reflecting
greater diversity educate people create
safe spaces and mentor them then the
result of that is going to be a bigger
better community and that benefits all
of us all of us are responsible for
sharing the land of love in a positive
effective way to help build this bigger
more diverse functional programming
community if you're interested and some
of the references that I've mentioned
and resources that you'll find them all
here on my slides and you can find these
slides at community code millicom i'm on
twitter on code miller and i'm just
encourage you to keep the conversation
going
