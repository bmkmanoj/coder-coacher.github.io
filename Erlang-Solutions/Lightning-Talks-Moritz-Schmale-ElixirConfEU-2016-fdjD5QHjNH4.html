fixing fixing the audio on the desktop
which is a title which I chose because
when you when you do some like browsing
and you have music in the background and
and then you come across some youtube
link or something and you click on it
and then the audio of the youtube video
place of the audio of the background
argument and so on and then you have to
go back to your other player and pause
it and then you can finally watch your
youtube video and after that's done you
have to go back to your audio
application and started again and i
thought and yeah that is a problem that
i can fix and so I and thought of
something called audio stick which is
basically every everything that may
create an audio output on your on your
computer should live in some kind of
stack and every time it actually starts
playing audio it moves on top of the
stack and the next thing in this text
should be paused and so I made a
proof-of-concept you appreciate am going
to demonstrate so it's already running
in this mini terminal and i have i have
spotify here and i can just start
playing stuff here and then when i'm
playing stuff in itunes and i can i can
start a video and in my control blah
blah
as you as you have noticed every time I
I switched my players the the other one
turned off and it's also a visible in
here so you you can actually see the
stack in this little console and and
right now I I support itunes and spotify
on austin and i have written a chrome
addon which detects video and audio
html5 elements and they they have a very
nice API for that so that I can get the
event if it when it's playing and also
when when I'm I'm when when it's going
to feel actually for that I have to I
have to play back something again so I'm
doing this and then maybe we watch the
the rest of this scene
well it's very dangerous okay and and as
soon as the video has ended and Spotify
started playing again so that that's
something I could do with this sooo nice
ahead as I hit every every plugin
written down and with with play and
pause methods and so on yeah so I'm
planning to make this a bit little bit
more beautiful than having this in a
consort or something like over here and
and then I release it somewhere we can
get it
