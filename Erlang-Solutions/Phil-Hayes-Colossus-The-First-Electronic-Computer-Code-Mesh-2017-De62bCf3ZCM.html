not a bad turnout because I'm I'm not a
software engineer I'm a true hardware
engineer software I'm afraid doesn't
really drive me cables and transistors
and valves and things that's what drives
me anyhow I'm going to talk to you about
Colossus Colossus being the first
digital electronic computer that was
ever built and the reason why it was
built and that's what I'm going to talk
to you about I hope you find it
interesting couple of things first of
all the technology I'm going to talk
about is late 1939 early 1940's
this is BC before computers yeah so you
can forget about laptops iPods Cray
mainframes or whatever they just didn't
exist the technology of the day the real
technology was strategy telephone
exchanges extremely complex and that was
the most powerful if you want engine
that had been built to process data and
process data it's a bit strange
telephone numbers she died a telephone
number some mail it's got to be
processed because that calls got to be
routed around the UK or even abroad and
that was basically the most complex
machine that been built at the time it
had been built by an organization known
as the GPO which is the forerunner of BT
so right 1939 Second World War starts
the German High Command need to transmit
their reports orders etc around Europe
you've probably all heard about enigma
well nygma's alright for very small
messages because it's Morse code that's
how they're transmitted Morse code if
you have a message like a report that's
going to go to Hitler that is 20 30 up
to 60,000 characters long you ain't
going to send that by Morse code so the
German High Command go to a company
called the rains they commissioned them
to produce a device that will encrypt
teleprinter traffic everybody happy with
Tony printers yeah yes said 42 this is
the machine that the Rennes company came
up to encrypt the German High Command
messages it is nothing like enigma
enigma' has three routers the Abwehr has
four that's a different version of the
Enigma
and each rotor is 26 positions the
Lorenz s-said 42 there's 12 wheels and
the biggest one is 61 positions this is
much more complex than enigma
what you what I've just given you is
information that the Allies never had
this is a secret machine it is so secret
that the Allies never see one until two
days after the war in Europe as was over
I think I'm going to talk to you now I
have no idea what they're working on the
other thing before I really stop is the
detailed information I'm going to give
you today was not in the public domain
until 2000 the rebuild project at
Bletchley Park started in 94 we were
forbidden to talk about this technique
because at the time it was still
classified said today is in the public
domain that's just one of the techniques
there's only one in the public domain
all the others are still classified the
messages are sent via Tony printer tele
printer uses five bit international
teleprinter code it became an
international standard in about 1930
when all the countries around the world
adopted it it's five bits that will only
give you a maximum of 32 characters
while hang on a minute got 26 you've got
all the numbers and punctuation there
does that work well on the right-hand
side there are the control characters
and if you notice there is one of the
control characters it's called figures
and what that does is like a numbs lock
on your keyboard it shifts the character
set so if you send a figure key we'll
think of a figure character what happens
is you use the other character set and
it will carry on until you send another
control characters which is the letter
key and that would drop it back to
letters again that's how it works
when you deal with encrypted teleprinter
traffic you have to be able to write
down on paper the control codes if you
send the carriage return that's a
function of the machine you don't print
the carriage return so hell they got
around that during the war is they had
the additional numbers you see they're
three four eight five etc for the
control characters yeah because when you
write down encrypted text you can't miss
anything so if they were going to write
a character which represents the
carriage return
there's write a three the other
interesting thing that you see on there
is on the right hand side it says all
space not used the teni printers were
electromechanical certainly the earlier
ones would go out of synchronization if
you sent a complete sequence of zeros so
the only character that's got complete
sequence of zeros is the one on the
right so under international teleprinter
code to all space is not used this is
encrypted traffic and is used so
Bletchley Park had to be able to write
down all zeros and it's the flash
character that's what that slash
character is thought and it is extremely
important because what I'm going to talk
about now is the slash character that
slash character is how you break this
cipher
how does the Lorenz work well gonna bore
you now it uses modulo to addition
without carry or exclusive or I'm
assuming some of you know what I'm
talking about if you don't that's the
truth table if you add bits together
very Mises 5-bit code if you add two
bits together that are the same you have
a zero that's your result and if the
bits are different pizza one so if you
add one on one together your result is a
zero if you add 0 and 1 you get a 1
everybody reasonably happy with that
yeah good that's the hardest bit get
this the hardest it gets yeah we now
pass that I mean that's now becomes easy
right so how does the Lorenz work what
the Lorenz does is that it produces a
pseudo-random sequence of 5 bit patterns
5 bit pattern is a character so it
produces pseudo-random characters so if
you were to sit to send into the
Lorraine's
so you typed the AE on the keyboard and
it goes into the Lorenz attachment and
the wheels on the Lorenz are configured
in such a way that the Lorenz will
produce the letter C another 5 bit
pattern and you add the a and the C
together using modulo 2 addition when
the bits are different it's a 1 and when
they're the same it's a 0 so an a is
represented as 1 1 0 0 0 that's
international teleprinter code for and a
and the C is represented as 0 1 1 0 and
you add the two together the first 2 is
a 1 and a 0 they're different it's a 1
yeah
the next two bits are the same that's a
zero the next two bits different
different same you end up with a pattern
of one zero one one zero everybody happy
yeah it's a few nodding heads there
which is good right so your plaintext
was a your encrypted text is now F so
you can now put that into the public
domain in those days it was transmitted
by radio
so your receiving station what do they
receive they receive the letter F they
also have a Marines machine that you set
to the same positions as the sender's
machine and what letter well his machine
produce the same letter as the other one
and it will produce the letter C do you
go through the same process and you add
F to C you will get a because the first
two bits are different that's the one
the second two bits are different that's
the one and the remaining bits are all
the same so you end up with zero zero
zero which is the same as what you
started with yeah not complicated yeah
so receiving end he will receive
plaintext was the same as what the chap
sent one from his keyboard yeah the man
in the middle all he ever sees his
encrypted text and he doesn't know what
character to add to it so it's secure I
hope
right what you see there is a sheet that
was used at Bletchley Park during the
war Bletchley Park are all of you or any
of you not familiar with Bletchley Park
there is only buddy here that's not
familiar Bletchley Park I will explain
what Bletchley Park was like there's a
couple of you okay
during the Second World War Bletchley
Park had been set up by the government
codes and cyphers school which later
became GCHQ it's a big place there's
over three thousand people working there
during the war and what Bletchley Park
is is a covert of a code stroke cipher
breaking Factory and that is their job
to break ciphers and codes so when I
talk about Bletchley Park that's what's
going on there in order to break this
cipher you need to have some form of
matrix on the if you were to add
characters together like we added a and
C yeah on that chart there it will give
you the third character if you had two
characters to get together you will end
up with a third triplets so if you
remember I added a and C so if you go
down that chart on the left hand side
you will find that there is a row
starting with a do you go along the row
till you find a see you remember I added
to C and then you look at the column for
C you will find it's an F yeah I see F
that's the triplet you add any two
together of those you will always end up
with the third every combination is on
there and this is one way of breaking
the cipher if you worked at Bletchley
Park on this die for
that's the language that you have to
remember the likes of Gerry Roberts is
one of the last Co bracket breakers
he knew that instinctively even to the
day he died he would be in the car and
he would recognize tick triplets because
that is what he did at Bletchley Park
all those years ago and it never he
never lost it the interesting thing
about that triplet jar is what happens
if you add the same character together
let's take the letter A so you have a
column on the a you're finding a you go
on the row you'll see it's the first
letter yeah
and it's actually a slash character you
add the same together you have a slash
any two characters which are the same
add them together you had two slash okay
this very very important character had
the same together
it's a slash so why is the slash
character so important explain that
after this slide this is the weakness of
the cipher it's got one massive weakness
first message you said a plus C will
give you f you send the F if stupidly
you send another message using the same
obscuring character in this case you're
going to send a B and you add it to the
same obscuring character which is a C on
that triplet chart you'll get a Q okay
in the public domain you've now got fmq
quite harmless isn't it buteven to fmq
so what happens if you add F and Q
together that you've now sent what is f
F is made up of a plus C
what skew that's made up of B plus C so
what you're actually doing is adding a
to C plus B to see if there's characters
that are the same you produce zeros it
disappears from the encryption so now
you've got the character J
well what's G G is actually made up of a
and B which is your plain text the
problem is there are lots of triplets
that make G so what you have to do is to
make a guess at one of those plaintext
messages and then you add that to you G
and if you're correct what you'll get
out is another English stroke German
word if you're wrong it's going to be
rubbish how did that get there there's a
bit missing there's a slide missing oh
right okay that slide should show and
encrypted so I should show two encrypted
messages that have been added together
and what you will produce is this random
string of characters and if you add the
word London into this very obscure
string of characters what you'll get out
is another word Glasgow I'm not sure
where that slides gone it might appear
later but I don't recall that it's
supposed to be in that sequence but
anyhow and what would happen if you put
the wrong word in if you put Brian into
this sequence of a scaring think of the
sequence of random characters if you
would have put Brighton until you get
rubbish shell the only time you would
get the correct second word as if your
guess is correct that was how well that
is how you can break it
well you put you have a string which
might be four thousand characters long
and in there for example this German the
plaintext is German you had the word
Fuhrer and you put fewer in the first
place yeah in the first X number of
characters and you get rubbish l you
move it down one rubbish rubbish rubbish
then all of a sudden you get Berlin
coming out you know that those two words
fit in those two messages so then you
make a guess for the next word yeah well
what would come after Fuhrer would it be
a space yeah and that's how you do it
takes a long time yeah but that is a way
of doing it and it does work and that's
what Gerry Roberts was actually doing at
Bletchley Park using that triplet sheep
except it was all up there for him okay
so now we move on to summer of 41 in a
metropolitan intercept station they were
listening out to spy transmissions
leaving the UK during their listening
they picked up a signal coming out of
somewhere in Germany and it sounded a
bit like Morse code except it was
extremely high speed and it could not be
written down and it was believed to be
teleprinter traffic coming out of
Germany so the idea was build at the box
and they connect that into the radio to
print it out on a telly printer and sure
enough German came out don't break the
code however all of a sudden the
teleprinter started to go absolutely
berserk and printing out rubbish the
reason being was that the transmission
had gone into encrypted mode
okay so the guy who sent the message
I've gone from chat to encrypted mode
where all the major real information
resides it's now all encrypted okay so
that started in 1941 at the beginning of
that message or those messages there was
a 12 letter indicator which it was
suspected it was something to do with
the encryption okay very much forget
that they know about the lorentz because
they don't they've got no idea about
this machine all they know is that it's
encrypted and it is teleprinter traffic
at that time there was not a machine
that was known about that could encrypt
teleprinter traffic this is a totally
unknown machine okay they have no idea
what this twelve letter identifier is
they've got no idea what machine
encrypted this traffic this information
and the messages the early messages went
to Brigadier Tilton up to Bletchley Park
brilliant Hillman was probably one of
the most important code breakers at
Bletchley Park a very very brilliant
code breaker he suspected that it was an
additive cipher which is the technique
that I've exposing about
the big break on the 30th of August 1941
a German operator from vienen from
Vienna to Athens Athens he sent 4000
characters of encrypted text and at the
beginning of that 4,000 characters he
sent an identical identifier of HQ ìbe
beam another said muck twenty minutes he
sat there typing away his colleague at
the other end in German I'm sorry I
can't speak German he responded by
saying sorry fritz didn't get that can
you resend it now your message is going
to Hitler Hitler does not take prisoners
now you've got a type out that damn
message again and you are against the
clock Hitler is not going to thank you
for being five minutes later they're
under a lot of pressure great deal of
pressure and he's now got to tamp tight
this damn message out again the big
mistake happens just before he puts the
machine into encrypted mode because he
sends the same 12 letter indicator and
it's now known as the Zed mug message a
really important message so he starts
typing again and by the time he gets to
the end of that second message it's just
under 4,000 characters so the first
message was just over 4,000 the second
is just under 4,000 so those two
messages are different they might have
the same context but they're different
because of the lengths are different but
this I indicator is the same
does that mean that the encryption is
the same and the message is the plain
text messages are different
this was given to John tilt Minh what
did he do
combined the two encrypted messages put
the gas in Fuhrer put it in different
places eventually what happens he gets
the two plaintext messages out of those
two encrypted messages he's now got the
to plain text messages that have been
encrypted by the lorentz great all the
information is there however you've got
the plain text
you've got the encrypted text so what
does he do
takes the plaintext then he adds it back
into one of the encrypted messages
what's the same plaintext so what will
you get out you'll get out the string of
obscuring characters that's been
generated by this unknown machine so now
they've got 4,000 characters what's
known as the key stream still don't know
where it's come from because this
machine doesn't exist so remaining
months of 41 it was given to the
Research Center and the man in question
oh I've got that one that's what should
have died earlier there you go that was
that was done yeah those are two
encrypted messages add them together
that is a string of characters that you
will get out the encryption is the same
that disappears and you will get out
this sequence of letters which is the
additive of the two plaintext messages
one of those plaintext messages is
London you add London to 3k whatever it
is if you had that triplet shoot you
could do that you don't have them so you
can't do it but what you will get out is
Glasgow but if I was to put Brighton in
there you wouldn't get Glasgow well
you'll get rubbish so by putting your
guess in in the right place then you get
English stroke German coming out the
other side your guess is right
that was how I was done it slide should
have been earlier I shouldn't have
really but there you go so what he did
was he took the to plain text messages
yeah and he handed them back into the
encrypted and what you get out is the
keystream now if you actually followed
that process through with that sheet the
triplet sheet you will find that the key
string was ABCD so you've now got the
key string but you still don't know how
it's been generated it looks totally
random totally random
until this man gets hold of it built up
he's a young chemist who's got an
interest in mathematics so he takes that
key stream and he and his job is to work
out how those patterns of characters was
generated this is one mad given that
task so what does he do
tell me printer code 5-bit code yeah he
takes bitstream one for all those
characters and he writes it down he
knows knows they didn't use noughts and
ones like we do in those days it was
dots and crosses same thing but it was
dots and crosses so he wrote it down and
he's looking for patterns in bits dream
one to see if he can find a repeated
pattern there's a break a cipher
patterns when he got to a pattern length
441 in his eyes he could see a repeated
back
41 so why is 41 so important well
41 is so important because oh sorry this
is his work this is Bill Tut's work 41
yeah only 1 columns that's the bit
pattern of bitstream one of zed muck see
where it's underlined that's bill tucks
work not mine those are the repeated
patterns I will admit I'm looking at
that and I find it virtually impossible
to see repeated patterns there and it's
underlined when built up saw that when
he did that it's not underlined okay he
saw it underlined 41 brilliant now I
think that built our was slightly
autistic I've asked some of his family
who remember Bill and they have thought
about it and said he was a bit strange
he didn't like the limelight they just
like to be left alone in the corner
reading a book he did not like the
public around him and this family has
said he could well have had autistic
tendencies
now some autistic people have got
fantastic skills that seeing patterns
and I believe that was how all that was
why I built up saw that because I can't
see partners in but why is 41 it's so
significant this is what he did this is
the architecture of the Lorenz s said 42
they didn't know it as the Lorenz I said
42 they had to give it a code name that
code name they gave it was tiny tuna and
the reason that it is named after a fish
is because during the war teleprinter
traffic the Bletchley Park came under
the
of fish fish traffic all teleprinter
traffic wherever it came from or to was
known as fish that's generic term so
every all the codes that we use daily
using teleprinters were named after fish
this is tunning and this is what
Bletchley Park or the Allies called this
cipher tummy that's the architecture 41
if you notice the Chi wheels the K
wheels on the left hand side five of
them the first one is Chi 141 positions
that's what he saw bits dream one he saw
repeated pattern and believed it to be a
wheel going round each one of those
wills had got pins on and they produce
bit patterns each wheel will produce a
single bit pattern and the arrangement
is that the 5ky wheels they receive the
incoming plaintext 5ky wheels five data
bits the Chi wheels will produce a five
bit pattern and it's added to the
plaintext which is five bits and the
result of that is added to the Sai
wheels the s wheels so it's double
encrypted the Chi wheels move one
position every time a character comes in
all those wheels are a different length
and most of them are primary they're not
all but most on the primary now the side
wheels they stutter and they are
controlled by M 1 and M 2 so M 2 will
not move unless M 1 has got a 1 on its
output M 2 will not move certainly so on
the side wheels will not move until
there's a 1 on him too
so effectively M 1 and M 2 control the
stuttering of the side wheels which
gives you more combinations yeah yeah so
it's double encrypted Chi wheels sigh
wheels Chi wheels move one position
every time the character comes in that's
the architecture of the machine
so now you've got that architecture what
do you need you need a Lorenz machine or
a tiny machine yeah max Newman at
Bletchley Park he's in charge of
speeding up this process of breaking
codes he's involved with machines and he
goes to the GPO Research Center at
Donna's Hill north of London sees the
engineers there presents them with that
build me machine that would do that
function please well that is a close-up
of the reins 12 wheels you know if you
have a look at each wheels each wheel
there are pins and those are the north
and ones okay so that's the wheels of
the schematic if you want not just
showed you goes through Donais he'll
build me a machine that's what they come
up with it's called a Tunney it's not
arranged because they don't know its
name there's three of them in the
picture there and what it is is a
teleprinter where you type in your
encrypted text yeah tell your printers
5-bit code though the 5-bit code Lisa
teleprinter it goes into the machine
there and all those pins those noughts
and ones are all to do with the starting
positions of the 12 wheels of the
lorentz so effectively that's the reins
you type in encrypted you type in the
encrypted message and goes through the
tiny machine and if everything's correct
what you get out is German okay problem
starting positions if you were to run a
crib on one of those tiny machines it
would only get an answer you only see
the plaintext when all 12 wheels are in
the correct position
yeah here's a challenge for you if you
could process a 6000 character message
1943 this is in 1.5 seconds and that's
the speed of Colossus every one of our
seconds you will change one of those
wheels starting position
look for German don't see it move one
one wheel one more position how long
will it take
there's a war on you need to read this
message there long will it take
come on guys one wheel position everyone
in a half seconds don't be embarrassed
do long as how many seconds there are in
a year
ok there's a war on 31 million won ok
any advance on there ok enjoy a thousand
years we've got now there's still a war
on give up it's going to take a long
time join a know the answer if you want
to do the calculation it's in front of
you I think you would agree that that
message will be useless after that
period of time very quick technique I'm
coming towards the end I'm running out
of time there's a technique called Delta
a doubter is where you add the adjacent
characters together to produce the third
character same process ABCD etc I will
be added to B B will be added to C then
what you get out is a delta which is gqu
that's the Delta characters that's how
you break the encryption is on the Delta
characters not plain text this is this
is plain text teleprinter frequency
distribution and it's deltad and what
you will see on the right hand side is
this massive peak of slash characters
and that is because of duplicated
characters
that there's been added have been have
been typed in by the operator this is
the cipher that has been Delta this is
the encrypted message if you Delta it
you see it splat flat random however if
you put it through a tiny machine with
all the Chi wheels set to the correct
position and you do a frequency count
when the wheels are in the correct
position what you get is a slight
increase in the slash character and I
don't really have time to explain why
but that is what you have and that's due
to the way the operator keyed in the
message slash character if you can
remember is all zeros yeah so now if you
went through all the Chi wheel positions
as only five and you could process
60,000 characters in one and a half
seconds yeah divide that by the number
of seconds in a year it takes about a
year to go for all the combinations well
that's using five bits built up realized
that perhaps you could do it not on five
bits but four bits would that work
yeah four bits works when you've taken
ten days three bits ie hours two bits
30 minutes so you do two bits it takes
half an hour do another two bits takes
half an hour do another two bits yeah so
you've gone from 760,000 million years
down to about three and four hours built
apps work this is how you break the
cipher this is not brute force you break
the cipher trouble is two bits up to
seven point six million calculations
need to be done it was completed in four
to six weeks at Bletchley Park by lots
of reigns working in three shifts doing
these calculations you need a machine
max Newman it goes to the GPO Research
Center there's max
first attempt is what's known as the
Robinson there's a rebuild at Bletchley
Park which what job I'm doing at the
moment it's got some problems
programming is done with leads and it
needs to paper tapes one is a message
and the second one is the patterns
generated by the neurons you have to
synchronize them and that destroys the
tape because you have to use the
sprocket hole Max and human goes to
Bletchley Park again speaks to a chap
called Tommy flowers here he is
brilliant electronics engineer he's
asked to modify the Robinson he can't do
it but he builds a new machine that's
Colossus it was first delivered to
Bletchley Park in January 34 it
contained one of our fails and valves
took nine months to develop and it
worked so well they ordered twelve in
all the mark twos twelfth bucktooth and
they are 1200 valves apiece that's the
full-blown machine that's Colossus ten
so there was ten operation at the end of
the war that's ten wartime photograph
that's number nine the Colossus that
you'll see a Bletchley Park today the
rebuild I worked on is a rebuild of
number nine rebuild started in 94
finished in 2008 fourteen years 20 20 of
us worked on this not a very good
picture is it but that is it and if you
want to see it it's at Bletchley Park we
do talks up there in actual fact the
next talk I'm doing is in December and
that's all about the documentation how
we got hold of it acceptor which is
another story which is very interesting
this is some of the photographs from the
National Museum of computing that's a
bit of an advert or suppose you've got
games machines on the left on the right
top right is an analogue computer bottom
left is an IC our mainframe and on the
right is the oldest original working
computer
that's in existence and we hold the
Guinness Book of Records for running
that machine the oldest one in the world
that's still working so I've come to the
end there's a lot more to the story in
what I've said but I'm running out of
time I'm more than happy to answer
questions if we've got time what for me
to carry on or questions we've got one
minute for questions you can always
tackle me afterwards that you want to
talk to me any questions once they once
they knew what what machine they wanted
to build how quickly could they crank
out a Colossus the first mark one the
prototype took nine months of
development the mark twos they were
delivering those one every six weeks 12
on order at the end of the war 10 were
operational at the end of the war i
dismantled two indeed their days Oakley
farm GCHQ the last one was destroyed in
1960 now what I've told you today is in
the public domain there are a lot of
documents that are still classified
today okay a lot and a lot of techniques
that are not in the public domain but I
talk about is one document that was
released in 2000 which is the general
report on Tanya if anybody wants to read
it down the public records office I
wouldn't advise you to get a copy of it
because it'll cost you in excess of one
and a half thousand pounds from public
records office okay okay thank you thank
