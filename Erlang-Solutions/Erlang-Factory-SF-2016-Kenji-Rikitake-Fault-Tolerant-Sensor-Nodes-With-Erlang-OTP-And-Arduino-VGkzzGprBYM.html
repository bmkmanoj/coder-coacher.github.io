Kenzie retail care this is actually my
seven stall corner or factory in San
Francisco it's been long my first one
was 2010 and I thought I talked to many
different topics but today I'm going to
talk about something ani not necessarily
a photon networks what about note ok um
before getting into the details I'd like
to explain some of the basic principles
on building fault tolerant systems um
they are I think many of you know have
already know this but oh it's faint on
keeping system stabilized this is a very
important thing and to make a statin to
make a stable system are the whole
system has to be simplified don't put
too many functions unnecessary functions
that will that will almost always cause
troubles and don't be afraid of
resetting or restarting system this is
what we call in a horde of the world
were the well and let it crash and the
system should be able to be dynamically
update on demand for minimizing the down
time which means that every component
including not only the software but also
how where would be to be much better to
be able to update it to be updated okay
in the soul in the stock i will explain
the peripheral systems and sensors which
is a redundant temperature system sensor
system for our own TP and i will also
talk about the basic design principles
including 8-bit arduino which is the
platform for the sensor device and its
basics and why protocols and how all in
talks with arduino i have to skip the
slide explaining why the name is per
person and explain it by my arm by my
words belford means be4 being a are for
arduino and for
for fortified and I scan it on the
google and actually there was a place
called there is a place called barefoot
fridge in new jersey USA I don't know
what the place is but I own the only
only only thing I know about the places
that it's a very beautiful place in
eastern it's a part of the United States
although I've never been usually in my
life but anyway is called barefoot and
this is a sensor sensor sealed aight i
actually made three and this is one of
them and they are all identical i tried
to build a full torrent system by myself
but done I I actually haven't tested
well the boards a multiple device but in
this talk i will explain that all the
basic function again components which is
necessary for building a fortran system
so this is basically temperature sensors
a set of temperature sensors and i made
it by my hand soldered environment
selves one digital thermal sense
temperature sensor and for analog
temperature sensors okay what this can
do this is a digital sensor and these
four are analog sensors and i put the
filter on this filter means um a power
stabilizer for this so that it won't
fail easily and all of these sensors are
operating independently no dependencies
with each other as of course escape
except for one thing its shares on this
it shares the same microcontroller AVR
on e how do we know so for those who
haven't heard about how do we know this
is what people called out ueno no Marie
the company of selling out the window
has already sold lots of different
configurations about Daniel some of them
are 32 bits but the basic alguna is
about 8-bit it with cpu it's a very
basic stuff and okay this is CPU and
this is a power supply part and this is
a serial interface part and excuse me
these connectors are all external on all
the arm for the convenience of
connecting the external circuits and
this could be driven by the USB power or
external power from seven to 12 volts
okay I'd like to talk about the general
style of the AV AV our development the
main tool change for 8p TBR's all last
one in old ms-dos days or much older
days when people are typing the assembly
language or machine language by hands
it's all about guna c compiler assembly
assembler problem motor and the library
and it's about the event loop so our
cake but you have to survive with that
so um what i want to tell you is that
you cannot do so many complex things on
the this all doing your basic i'll do we
know type of sensor you have to keep it
simple and during the problem in phase
of course you can use some some kind of
an inserted emulator or in certain
circuit debuggers but you usually try on
there if it fails you just you just put
it out reprogram and just doing that
kind of trial errors and on this on AV
arts interrupts up for timer only it's
time alone this means you cannot draw
you cannot do much about interrupts
there are many other ways to use it
interrupts on
maybe oz but basically you you should
only use it for the timer output or
waiting for some time kind of period
otherwise you you'll be getting into a
some sort of bugs better say
Heisenberg's which is very hard to debug
okay um before talking about details on
how do how to do with the small device
I'd like to show you them the usefulness
of the chip programmer which is another
external device for doing day for what I
say I'm doing the many things on the AVR
this is a picture of a br drivin and us
we program out which is sold by am I
bolt this in 2008 about sixty or seventy
dollars and this is connected to USB as
a dedicated device and it can perform
all necessary hardware configuration
from the protection bit comfy
configuration or prototype protecting
the firmware is so for protecting the
interrupter property and you can use you
can use this for replicating tips like
okay this is it this is what we call
zero pressure socket you pull the lever
up and put the plug zips and put in a
new tip and put the level down and you
just repeat it for replicating a lots of
tips you can use it in this way so I i
suggest you if you are suggested to have
this kind of the disc and of an
independent chip program if you want to
do the development on the AVR or any
other kinds of sips okay let me talk
about um about the hardware principles
on the making the for making our photon
system first you made to need to make
this stable hardware there are a lot of
tips and keep it simple
and the hardware should be capable to be
able to reset when something goes wrong
which is in other words read if crash I
I'm not saying that let it explode or
something but now you should be able to
edit crash okay I see a lot of examples
for arduino may Arduino actually made on
breadboard breadboards are not something
why not something rude or solar it's
like a pinpoint be unconnected to the
with independent wires with a lot of
holes and dancer convenient because you
can change configuration without without
any without a lot of with a lot of
effort but those contact pins and wires
are usually very fragile so I suggest
soldering instead soldering means ya
doing this kind of stuff soldering and
I'm not going to the details of
soldering but there are lots of lots of
tips about soldering so if you want you
found that if you want to know about the
tips on ask later after this
presentation okay so I talked about
solder soldering and the second the
second important thing is that keeping
the small number of contact points as
smaller as possible this is to prevent
contact filers every mechanical part
will fail on that that is so every
connectors may fail and the problem and
the general problems on the USB device
is that if you keep the USB device
connected there might be some sort of
contact favor happening and no not if
not in the short time period it should
be in a very long time period or even
one or two years so you eventually have
to pull it up pull it pull it out and
pull it back on so wanted to summarize
um
contact fellers will eventually happen
anyway so you also need to prepare for
to design the circuit what for the for
the consequences of the what if contact
failures occur so there are briefly two
kinds of contact trailers number one is
open circuit and number two is short
circuit open circuit means losing
contact and short circuit means two
independent points which are
accidentally connected so and both cases
may cause hardware malfunction and you
have to be very very careful not to make
the short circuit between the power
circuit to blast especially if you are
trying to drive a circuit on the lithium
polymer lithium polymer batteries their
internal resistance of the battery is
very low so it will blast and conspire
and maybe or may TSA will catch you
Cherie speaking you cannot check in the
down reach important of batteries you
shouldn't do that okay let's talk about
the open contact feller um usually i
assume usually turn signal paths like
this works okay but an open contact
trailer it's disconnected and this will
cause this will the disconnection on
this point will cause this point voltage
or current or whatever whatever passing
are just including digital signal very
unstable and I found I found many of
Arduino examples leave input open if
disconnected and that is very bad
because some kind of static voltage can
hit the open the input or other than
that making things unstable so a very
fundamental tip to
prevent this point become unstable is
that to add to add a register in our
case for our temperature sensor it was
grounded because the ground vote and
because it because that that is more
easier to handle them pulling it up to
the power supply voltage but anyway
connecting to connecting at this point
we'll see some sort of a high impedance
register will make the here stable so
and resistant against any kind of static
voltage so this is a recommended
practice and about this open circuit
failure I'm talking I'm going to talk
about my experience this is a normal
state this is normal state what
temperature gradually going out and
gradually going down and when the open
contact trailer fellow occurs here I
first expected this kind of fraying
voltage will occur so that the some sort
of anomaly analysis of the converting
this voltage into the digital
information could detect this but the
reality was different it just voted
shifted a little bit but the change was
very slow so it could hardly be
distinguished from this table state so
um so I so the this this fact also
suggests that i should make the output
I'm the input to thee to the ground and
on LM 60 the minimum output voltage is
about 0.1 7 volt or 170 million volts so
it won't be coming right here so if one
once it comes to the ground this is very
easily be detected and you can
immediately
is a fault I'm in a sense of fault so I
talked about the open circuit and next
I'm going to talk about short circuit
failure when a digital signal i
accidentally makes the short circuit to
the ground signal transfer is no longer
possible on the line because it's going
to be falsely turned and to set to the
lower l level or h level loh its binary
so in this example two devices
communication and communicating with
each other and accidentally the clock
goes down to the fixed to the low level
so the clock between this and this
device is disrupted because of the short
circuit and and when I when I
intentionally created this situation on
this device it's actually very easy the
only thing you should do is to put the
coin between to the distance d2 terminal
and that caused the whole software
halted this and so on this kind of
failure is very hard to prevent so so I
think this kind of failure should be
created as a permanent if intermitted
failure intermittent failure that should
be on that the sensor will be revived by
the reddit crash principle but if it
doesn't this sensor will be permanently
for holt honor in fault or should be
removed so
okay I explained in the open and show
circuit failures and another principle
on hardware is that keep it simple don't
try to do many things AVR is slow so
crop frequency is 60 megahertz it's much
slower than 1.6 Giga health or something
that one on one hundredth of modern
computers like here like what is here
actually this is a macbook air and so
the keeps the firm work keeping the
program called small is essential for
robustness and don't try to do many
things I mean for example the value
conversion or other input input data
formatting on the Arduino side on the
inside because it takes a lot of CPU
power on and their print F of C function
may cause mikhasti I mean it may
increase the size of the firmware to Q
bytes or 3 cube I just for and F printf
so don't do that just returned to raw
sensor values also a tunable hardware
parts such as variable resistors or
variable capacitors or whatever
variables including mechanical contacts
and moving mechanical context those are
inherently unstable and may easily fail
so don't use them if possible if
possible don't use them okay and let's
talk about let it crash principle from
the hardware point of view on noland
this is very easy but on hardware the
only thing you can do to to perform this
facilitate this principle is that is to
reset the hardware all together and to
restore it so the old er will say arm
all the Heisenberg's will be gone but
reset and allowing external reset is
required
for restarting from olin anyway and ii
yes and so that the arm can control the
this device and in them in a more
critical case sometimes you have to use
the hardware called internal hardware
called watchdog timer watchdog timer is
a totally independent timer which is
embedded in the cpu GPU chip although
cpu I mean AVR chip and the story
independent from where we are and if AVL
does not sign the watchdog timer for a
certain period for example 50
milliseconds of 100 milliseconds the
watchdog timer will force AVR to reset
so it's a kind of all let it crash
principle implemented in hardware so how
to reset our do we know from USB or any
kind of software including all the
answer is turning off serial signal for
15 min seconds and turning back on maybe
100 milliseconds or we'll be ok but the
15 minute second is a suggested value on
the Michael Santos own library called
the SDK 500 and sry yeah that's it what
this does is that this is a kind of gum
list comprehension but actually writing
a loop because the sequence is off and
on and off and on this is the value of
status the status goes into here and
it's turned off 350 milliseconds turn on
350 milliseconds and that's it ok so I
until here I explained about the
software are no hardware and now I'd
like to talk about the software side of
principle on communicating without you
know first you need to have a simple
simple and robust wire protocol
and you often need a learn to reset out
you enough so that you can let it crash
and you also need to override Arduino
firmware for hot cold swapping the wire
protocol between our host and arduino
should be simple as possible because
well listening to the serial port on the
on the for example I'm actually
connecting the this device to the mac
over here but if this is talk this is
trying to send something always and then
Mac actually have to process it and
discard it for example if I nineteen
ninety six hundred bps flow of 40 by 40
bytes on every message continuously sent
from this device to American Tosh I'm in
a mac mini which is actually I use at
home it takes 0.4% of CPU and it's not
that small it's not negligible although
it's small so when you try to connect a
lot of devices maybe 100 or 1000 you
shouldn't to do that so the host should
ask the device first I mean the polling
that's what I right here pulling host
pose the device then the device answers
that kind of protocol will make the
things more environmental environmental
environmental phone environment friendly
and using fixed lengths output for
Arduino is also effective as well as
minimizing the number of tuning
parameters for keeping the sensor system
stable ok why fixed length is important
let me explain about the serial line
protocol um how many of you have used
modems raise your hands please about
one-half yeah time flies the moderns are
the very old device to communicate to
the internet or whatever to the between
and between a computer and computer and
models in 1980s we're using serial rhyme
protocol and the problem I have faced I
faced during the modem line modern
programming was that serial ports have
not had no data framing it doesn't it
doesn't make it doesn't make a packet
for you if you want send the 22 by for
example 20 bytes packets the easiest way
is to put into the ethernet some sort of
API and nowadays the eastern end API
will convert it in the internet is in a
packet of 20 bytes or whatever with
header which is absolutely out the
easier the size Dez decodable but for
sheer lines she reports have no data
framing so you should expect receiving
data not from the beginning and this is
very hard to decode if you are not
trying to synchronize the transmission
so this is a another benefit to polling
because I when you decide to hold the
device from the host you can discard all
the data before its polling and you pull
the device then you try to talk wait for
the answer and if the answer is fixed
length or for example a 2020 bite or 16
bytes and you receive 16 bytes all
together and you verify the packet
whether it's okay or not and that's it
so fixed for fixed lens is much easier
to handle and Nolan you can always use
pattern matching pattern matching is
very well suitable for this kind of
purpose and minimizing the tuning tuning
parameters it also makes the sensor
system idempotent Eden potent means not
affected by the hidden states and this
is also a better practice so how do you
control the serial
from ldp a very talented hacker called
Michael Santos has released quite a few
interesting and libraries for
communication for example he released he
had he has released a package called pro
kit for Ethernet and he also reached a
package called sry i don't know how do i
how should I read may be sorry or
something like that but I don't want to
use the word so I sry in my presentation
but sry has a has a lot of advantage it
uses native interface functions or near
and calling directory to the operating
system interface of settings us what
people call so-called line disciplines I
don't know why lines have to be
disciplined but it's well it's it's a
detailed up there how do you set the
zero line such as speed or setting the
line up and down or something like that
so anyway this srl i sll why library is
very useful and the dis library also has
a fixed length reading function with
time out which is very useful on
communication without you II know so
here's what it wire portable it's it's
just all this thing the number device ID
and all sensor output they are all 16
bits and I wrapped it with the this is
the ascii code STX and etx I don't know
whether any anyone knows about this ad
but this is actually a start of
transmission and this is the end of
transmission so defined in ascii code
and in other words this is just number
two and this is a number three but
anyway i use a i respect us called or
reno meaning so i use them and um
coincidentally etx is actually control c
but anyway this message number and I I
said it to some number which I am going
to explain the next slide okay this is a
piece of piece of all encode it's
actually a binary matting from here to
here with a lot of attributes but this
is basically about X specifying
little-endian integer what's a lower
bite first and and this is you this is a
convenient for AVR so i chose literally
indian format and one of those are set
sign while less of those are sent on
sign because the second ATT I mean the
digital sensor output is more convenient
to be treated as a sign number of so
this is the this I only do this and this
effectively decode the data from a
sixteen byte packet in 26 / 6 / integer
if the magic numbers are all meshed and
I set magic number here 8255 in
hexadecimal and the you and for those
who do you know what 82 54-51 means
maybe not ok this is the name of the
Intel chip in 1970s 8215 one for 80 80
80 a CPU it's about the UART serial
interface just trivia also forget it
please ok the phrase video crash is
popular among their own community
further well over there who kindly fuken
derriere came to this presentation
against Thank You Fred they also have
learn you some room for great good
recently explains the phrasing his
proguard go to journal article as a
principle of transforming filers
exceptions and crashes into tools tools
we can use
I'm pretty much impressed by this
explanation actually and and so you can
use whatever sometimes you use failing
system has a tool but this let it crash
is much more moderate where you're gone
using a reset or other out what you say
hot hardcore better say hard resets
restart features to control feathers and
along the oh and do you know
unfortunately you don't have much choice
you need to reset the AVR chip under
islands collins control okay um and
there's another thing on how do you know
our own allows hot cold rolling and you
can update the code of function without
stopping the entire all note but i'll do
we know you can update arduino remotely
but it's not that easy you have to
rewrite the firmware code under Allen's
control and boot folders help it takes
five to ten seconds practically but it's
feasible and feasible is much much
better than not feasible and it's very
useful on Android debugging the firmware
or sometimes you have to remote
redevelop d how do you arduino or any
kind of ABO tip which might be connected
to raspberry pi or other more more
intelligent device knows which might be
running on so let me example let me show
you the example of the memory model um
AVR has two distinct memories you cannot
run you can run a code from random
access memory so no one can do the best
thing here it's a it's a very strict
protection over here and so the AVR
programmers use ram only for staff
worker area and other volatile stuff and
because you cannot use not much ram it
so it only has two kilobytes and on the
AVR the cold is cold resizing
the flash memory it has 32 kilobytes but
you have to have a bootloader if you
want to control it from remote some sort
of remote communication and ABR has a
hardware protection mechanism for the
bootloader section on regular LD know
it's only 256 bytes but in my case I
have to I have to enhance the boot
loader code a little bit more so I chose
512 12 bytes here and that section is
completely protected from the external
access access until not until sorry
about that unless you reprogram it by a
cheap by a chip programmer such as a be
our driver so normally you don't have to
worry about being this part being
righted rewritten and so when you try to
access from access to out in from a
remote island or whatever software you
use bootloader you call boot order to
rewrite this user called according to
the external input and ok oh I forgot to
explain this one this other than a flash
fresh cold arduino or a video has a
section called EPO EPO ms a nonvolatile
permanent storage which will survive the
reset or even a powerful power cycle
sequence so this in this part you
usually put some sort of a device
dependent data such as a device ID which
is the permanent ID like those in sim
card all of your cell phones or or some
kind of a persistent data which is
retrieved in a long time long term and
long term measurement and should not be
forgotten on the in case of accidental
reset or power cycle okay so this is a
piece of our own code for the dynamic
update it reaches a program file as an
turn right here and this is a file name
and break it into chunks of 128 bytes
actually this is a list of binaries and
opens a communication channel this is a
very lengthy device name but this is an
actual name on there mcqueeney and this
this part may be far if you use freebsd
well linux or now then might be windows
sometimes and all we've got to do is to
invoke this function hold it and the
loader speaks all the protocol and
commands send the command to the and
arduino to quit and after sending quit
the boot loader will immediate
immediately handle the control to the
user code so that's a that's how the ham
research sequence goes on and the
protocol details are described in an AVR
application note and so you can you can
find it online and if you if you don't
know about if you can't find it ask me
ask me later and I can give you the
information about all the details so
before explaining the whole size I can I
think I can do some demo so let me do
that ok actually during this speech this
Pro real sensor has been measuring
temperature every one second this chrome
pulls the device so this stuff is
changing until I I know this is not not
a good way to do the demo but I just
can't I'm not a very good web front-end
programmer so this is all I've got and
an interesting part is that you
when you put a plug of this digital
sensor it shows fault and sorry for my
eyes I'm very old man and when you put
it back like this it revives and when
you do the same thing to the internal
sense over here for example fault okay
and you put it back my eyes I'm sorry
when you put it back yeah let's back and
showing up slightly higher higher than
the ambient temperature because of my
body temperature body heat transfer is
transmitted to the each device so this
is a very simple demo about how to
detect a fault immediately or better say
the being about about using the polling
so that the all the state in this device
can be communicated to the here and some
some people may complain this can be
done in Ruby or this can be done in
Python but they I should tell you that
this is actually done in other this is a
part of yours called yours is a name of
the island server oh it's not cowboy and
it's a little bit old-fashioned but that
it's stable and it runs as an
independent server like Apache web
server and that is very convenient for
me and it has a very interesting feature
and when you declare Earl the whole HTML
supposed to be a GM it tons it turns out
to be our own code from here so i write
the old functions that gives us some
sort of style changing of the CSS and
you can even call external functions
from the yours which inherited very
insecure bar but this is this is not
about security and this is about
convenience
and when you do a savory it's ok you you
can you just can put it in a docker
container or freebsd jello or whatever
and this is the core part out this out
function that's the whole computation
when the when the page is being loaded
out is being cold and it opens the
device do test is a sort of convenient
function i made for is it it's not just
this thing it's actually do the polling
for pulling and get the data and close
the device just in case and it generates
the whole this complicated this not
complicated this complicate style of the
actually topple tapper and listen I
don't know yeah this is actually won a
single temple with lots of nested lists
and tuples but this is a factory
representing the structure of HTML and
this is a feature of HTML HTML which is
a feature of oreos and this is very
convenient when you think about them
designing a web page and on the oils and
within this data structure you can built
in a function and this is very
convenient for converting stuff or you
again you can or you can put into some
sort of conditions so that the value
changes when input change and i'm a lazy
programa so i didn't use the risk
comprehension here i just listened old
stuff and it ends the Earl tag ends and
the body and HTML ends so that's it for
the HTML and yeah that's it all right
and
this is a small function when you want
to do output in just a more capital user
interface you can use I of formats like
this okay so on so this is the end of
the demo and back to into slice so I'd
like to explain the issues and further
directions to conclude this presentation
I've explained how a sensor capable
fault tolerant operation can be built
but there are still unresolved issues
for example when you pull the plug of
this USB I'm not going to do that now
but the unit sometimes especially in
buggy operating system pulling the USB
called system crash why because
fundamentally the communication between
the USB device are all wrapped into a
software and when you try to detect a
fault on the software you have to use
the some sort of a heuristic like
timeout and in in case of a mac mini
well it takes about 10 seconds to detect
whether app or whether they put the
device is unplugged and that is actually
very slow so when you do with the USB
failure you have to be very prepared or
otherwise you get into a lot of trouble
and there are other issues calibrating
the heat sensor is actually very
difficult you should all you can do is
to put this in very stable ambient
environment or you put into some liquid
actually ice water or something like
that of course you have to cover this on
a beam vinyl vinyl bag or otherwise
you're getting into trouble but it takes
time because heat heat capacity of these
devices are signal are not negligible it
takes at
10 minutes or something like that and
sometimes an hour to make the whole
sense of stablish so it's very hard to
do it in computer people I've been
software people's risom or a speed and
in this in this presentation I didn't
mention details about them ma during the
full torrent operation but that depends
I I all I can say about this operate an
operation that it depends you can
average the sense of values for example
you have full sensors but what if it's
going to be 3 or 2 or 1 or 0 you have to
change the mode the fail of the and how
to remove the failed values is not that
trivial and if you on there's a IBM
research paper about how Space Shuttle
on try to deal with the fault a lot of
accidents with 55 independent computers
but the failure mode dealing with
failure mode is not that trivial you
have to notify the computers has to
notify the astronaut before shutting
down the system although otherwise
entire the mission will be aborted and
there will be a lot of and there will be
a precious casualties of astronaut on
I'm not joking on and that this is am
and this is a discharge of difficulty of
how ma during fall torrent operation is
difficult now you have to evaluate the
pros and cons ok for future directions
I've just I've tested this sensor
outdoor when it wasn't raining but morph
and it worked but more rigorous field
testing is certainly needed for
verifying the variability and I'd like
to use this together with a raspberry pi
because raspberry pi runs Ireland so
actually makes a very good photo and
sensor and of course I need to
using multiple sensors and no sim
simultaneously though it's not it's not
it's definitely not an easy task okay
and I extruded a lot of things from this
talk on the real world ilt you have to
do with our MQTT or cooperative some
other difficult protocols I have I have
a doubt they wither discard this kind of
protocols can be spoken from remote
device without thinking about the power
dissipation or power consumptions but
anyway and I didn't talk about
cryptographic security because it takes
a lot of CPU time not on the Macintosh
but also but on the AVR and the host
device driver this would be an important
issue because it's very hard to debug
and some people especially on those
dealing with the latest aldino don't
have to deal with the 8-bit CPU taken
program with a 32 bit cpu so maybe those
may be running linux or whatever or
whatever more sophisticated operating
systems and that there was a talk about
implementing shown called our own ale
and oli i actually on tried some had a
training all 18 on factory 2003 and no
2013 sorry about that 2013 and it was
for raspberry pi so i attended a
excluded from this top but I'll a was no
is actually very good example so you
should not take a look ok and a lot of
berating rated works will be found on my
slides so I'm not going to the external
detailed now because the time is
constraints but there are lots of tools
and you should take a look then we'll
take a look at them and there are at
least two created talks on the factory
San Francisco Bay on 2013 Oh mercuric
talked about Aaron al and on 2015 there
was an excellent talk about how to
control a robot but
Eric sir now funk homeless did a very
good job on about that you should see
their presentations okay so thanks I'd
like to say thanks to Michael Santos
because he did a lot lots of interesting
things although I'm I I don't know
whether he gained variety on that so i
should mention him here and i should say
our solutions for allowing me to do this
talk and I have to thank you all thank
you for listening to my top so thanks
again any questions and questions yes
ok the question was um if not a USB what
would be a what vehicle better
alternative right for example erm l ii
can control the GPI or general purpose i
oh directory from the all the functions
and using the GPIO or I square C which
is a protocol between the sensor device
and the cpu or spi that is another
protocol directly from the cpu will
remove the problem of the USB connection
and disconnection or built into the USB
control tree or removing it so but I do
not suggest using rs-232c or other older
protocol because it would have the same
problem although there won't be a
connection or disconnection problem so
whole the whole problem is based on the
details are realized materialized by the
software it's ok for you ok so we've any
other questions yes
yes um okay the question was how what if
bluetooth what if Brutus being used on
the being used on this kind of
application or how it fits on the model
I intentionally excluded Wi-Fi or
bulletins for the exact reason because
at the same reason are the USB because
it's heavily based on software and I've
been the ham radio operator for 40 years
actually today is a 40 40 year
anniversary of my ham radio license in
Japan and radio is very unstable and
unreliable for example when you think
about bit error rate of the wire between
the wire the difference of wired
connection and radio connection the
radio connection will be I will have the
error rate of 0.1 percent and why it can
but the wired connection will have much
less about this the difference will be
the difference of the bit error rate
will be 10,000 or even 100,000 so I do
not let me up opinion ate a little bit I
do not believe in wireless application
unless you have to use it for example
Wi-Fi and Brutus will be ok but and
Bluetooth le butta butta celly will be
okay but you have to write a lot of cold
and you have to do a lot of testing for
that so um I intentionally excluded from
my choice but I understand your question
and your questions one hundred percent
valid
in answer questions okay so I conclude
it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
