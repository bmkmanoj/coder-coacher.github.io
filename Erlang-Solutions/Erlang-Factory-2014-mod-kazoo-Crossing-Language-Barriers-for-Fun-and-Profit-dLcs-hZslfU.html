I'm with 2,600 hurts and this
presentation is about crossing language
barriers for fun and profit kind of a a
example of what we did to improve a
c-note performance issue that we had so
Who am I my name is Carl Anderson I'm
one of the senior bit herders at 2,600
hurts I don't have any real credentials
that would wow this group but I hope
that you find this talk intriguing
interests are interesting at least so
why am i giving this talk we had an
interesting problem and with the cenote
implementation and we came up with a
fairly novel approach to correct it and
I think that it's something that at
least warrants thought on your on your
side because it was something that we
weren't used to so when I say kazoo and
2600 hurts how many people here have
heard of those and how I'll Wow okay
that's going to explain a little bit
about it but we'll go through it may be
a little quicker now so kazoo is of
course our open source distributed
communications platform and a little
while ago it had a fairly significant
problem one of the core components the
free switch which handles all of our
media wasn't scaling the way that we
anticipated that it would by itself free
switch is scales extremely well and
handles very large volumes but every
time we plugged into the existing mod
erling event C node we were reaching
capacity rather quickly just because of
the bottleneck in that connection so
just real quick for I think the one of
you who doesn't know what it is what is
Gazoo this is a bit of an architectural
diagram you can or high level diagram
that you can see on our website but in
its simplest terms its control layer
focused around the telecom and
communications problem domain and right
in the middle there you can see the
media service which we'll be talking
about in just a moment but the basic
premises you have your clients
connecting via your mobile your fax
machines your cell phones
your office phones into a cluster which
is broken up into zones and then on the
other side there of course you have your
resources things like carriers a 911
providers taxation services so for those
of you who don't know it free switches
free switch is a sauce which it is it
was written by one of the core
contributors to the Asterix library when
they he proposed that they did a
complete overhaul they decided that they
would part ways after that and he went
ahead and did it on his own and called
it free switch it is architected as
follows with a very strong and black box
score that they maintain and then the
modules around it I'll plug into it with
a very lightweight primitive interface
and the modules themselves I'll enter
communicate with an internal free switch
message bus it's just key value pairs
which makes it very natural to plug in
to something like early so what does mod
kazoo actually do and or mod early event
in the earlier terms so our application
we have something we call the ecomm edge
of the early in call manager and its job
is to connect into the free switch
servers themselves and it is the
low-level driver that actually
translates an abstraction of for
instance call logic into free switch
specific terms and it also maintains the
state and information about the calls
and where they are in which servers and
it also provides both load balancing and
redundancy by inter connecting amongst
all the free switch servers we've also
used it as message buses to move
internal states between free switch
servers for things like channel recovery
when you want to move a call from one to
the other you can move that information
to the other server and get it to pick
up that call
so how does it work this is the diagram
of mod early event modeling event was
already in free switches sourcetree when
we came to it and we decided to use it
because it was a natural fit of course
of tying erlang into free switch it was
originally written by Andrew and the
basic idea was you would connect to the
cenote via distributed orland using
cookies and everything else just as if
it was a regular erling node and it
would receive the data coming in on that
socket in a loop that would then look to
see if it was a command it would issue
an execute to run that command it would
then look into an internal queue to see
if any events that were coming through
the free switch internal bus had been
queued up and waiting to go out that
distributed socket and if there were
some it would send them down the socket
otherwise they would loop back around
and block so what it looked like is this
I've stripped it out a little bit to
make it a little clearer but at the very
top there that eix receive timeout is
where it would actually block one of the
interesting things we tried to do
originally was tweaked that last number
which is how long to timeout for or the
length of time out so that we could get
down to the bottom here to send messages
out quickly but we found we would
negatively impact things like the tix
the heartbeats which was an interesting
finding and we can go over a little bit
about that in a minute but we would try
to receive a message off the socket we
get into these URLs and switch commands
which would actually perform a blocking
operation thereby inhibiting the ability
to send out events now that was an
interesting side effect of the way that
this was implemented because there are
some commands and free switch that
require you to participate in order for
them to continue so one example would be
if you spin up a conference free switch
will ask for the XML for how that
conference should be configured and that
XML of course is intended to go down
this
pipe but it's blocked on this handle
message which is where you're asked it
to actually execute the conference so
you end up with this where you're
blocking yourself condition and because
of the timeouts you're not dead locking
but it's pretty close the way that
Andrew had solved this is there was a in
addition to the API command to execute a
command there was a background API and
the background API would spin up a
thread to handle just that command
request which is fine but extremely
expensive especially the more work that
you do on very busy systems you can
clearly see why you don't want to be
doing all those contexts which is and
doing it that way so there was no real
easy way around this in this
implementation and the reason that it
was kind of looked the way that it does
is because it was really designed or at
least I would argue that it was designed
for the other direction we're free
switch would ultimately take control of
the call and then pass the authority of
the call off to a kazoo note rather than
because you know reaching in and
stealing that call control from free
switches internals and you can also see
it was all so it didn't really know what
people would do with it so there were
things like check log Q where you could
actually send all the log lines out and
which we never actually did in mod kazoo
but it was additional step an additional
code that it had to go through which
required additional mutexes as well in
order to get to this because all of this
shared a central state and one of the
funny stories when we first approached
him and told them we were having a bit
of an issue and we connected to e call
managers to one free switch server he
was surprised it actually worked so it
wasn't exactly his intended use case so
we were running into all kinds of
problems throughout the the code just
because we were trying to do something
he hadn't actually anticipated so there
was an impedance mismatch there so the
other side of it is in free switch I'm
sorry and kazoo we're writing earling
that look like something like this this
is actually directly from his example
freeswitch that Earl module and you can
see not only is it Serling but it's not
exactly OTP
it doesn't really provide a whole lot of
guarantees or safeties on it
additionally things like the background
API in this qualified send here with
background common node that actually
means nothing originally they all read
foo uh-huh so they're the cenotes I'd
was pretty much just the bare minimum to
decode the bare minimum to send back and
it was up to the application to resolve
it additionally some of the early
implementations in this didn't even have
these quantifiers on the tuple tags so
if you were in a gen server all your
messages might go missing all of a
sudden or a couple of the very important
ones which took us a bit of time to kind
of figure out where those were going
because we're just calling into his
library to never actually looked into so
you can see not only are we issuing a
background API which is giving a thread
on the other side but we have to spine
here as well so what was the problem
with this well it was less than stable
it stayed up most the time there were
hbu texts in there somewhere that kept
stepping on the internal freeswitch of
hints that we're causing pre switch to
crash in very random places which had a
scratching her head as we went down all
kinds of rabbit holes from the various
core dumps so the solution well if plan
a doesn't work we still have 25 more
letters in the alphabet so let's just go
ahead and it wasn't originally built for
modeling event wasn't originally built
for kazoo so let's copy the file over
call it mod kazoo and rip out anything
we don't need let's simplify it let's go
through find any place where we can take
out mutexes and let's kind of also go at
it with the idea that we'll have more
than one connection in there so maybe
there's some places that we can optimize
some code so that we don't have to have
this shared state and those two guys can
operate independently and separately so
that was our first stab at it was just a
simplification of modern laying event um
it helped but it still had the impedance
mismatch and that it still wasn't ever
really designed for these multiple
connections and these really rapid event
streams going back and forth between the
two because ultimately we're still in
that one socket and the
the commands coming in are still backing
up on the events going back out one of
the interesting things that we tried to
do on version 2.0 I shouldn't have
advanced so fast I was we tried to start
up two threads one to send and one to
receive on the socket now in principle
we should be able to do that but because
the mud because the Erlang interface
library handles all the magic of the
distributed Erling behind the scenes you
can never really know whether or not
it's actually going to respond to a tick
and try to write to the file descriptor
so there were no guarantees unless you
put a mutex around that and there you've
just blocked the other thread so there
wasn't any real benefit to that so that
was when we started to realize that
there really wasn't a good way that we
could just simply tweak this that we
needed a bigger hammer so version 3.0
was when we actually sat down took a
look at it and started bouncing some
ideas around about how can we get more
stuff down this pipe how can we make
this work better with vodka zoo and how
can we drop because the original Mod
kazoo version 2 point 0 of modeling
event had actually maintained backwards
compatibility for the inbound socket
connections and a lot of the API said
well all this AAP I said stay the same
so what we start talking about we start
playing with the idea that well if we
want to use distributed earling then we
can simply register various node names
so maybe we'll have free switch
underscore event at hostname and we'll
have free switch underscore command at
hostname and here we can start to get a
bunch of sockets even though they're all
fundamentally the same see node EPMD
doesn't know or care about that so that
was the first thought that we had and
then we started thinking well do we
really need the distributed Erling
component and the answer was yes we need
that for the persistence and we needed
all the guarantees that it provides the
tick the heartbeat the the link but we
didn't need that on the events there was
no reason to have that overhead on
something that's simply a one-way mass
stream of people answer calls all kinds
of internal free switch events so this
is ultimately kind of what the arc
textures started to look like we still
build our C node and we still connect a
distributed or laying socket to it um
and that is represented by these top two
guys where you kind of have an almost an
RPC requests come in and they're queued
up they go to a series of executors or
workers and then those responses are
queued up and sent back down that pipe
beneath that however is the new event
streams that get spun up and the event
streams are independent threads which
are fed events from the free switch
event bindings and they go down the
socket completely separate from each
other as well which was an interesting
because now all of a sudden the events
could come in in a different order
whereas before they would stack up in
order in the socket now we can actually
receive them in a different order so
there you know you have to give to get
and these were the trade-offs that we
decided we're perfectly viable the other
element to is there's a lot more sockets
to maintain and if you close off say
channel answer you get all kinds of
weird things like calls hung up that you
never even knew about so you know you
have to start to you know code
differently on the other side as well to
kind of take some of these caveats into
account so the other interesting thing
that happened and this was specifically
to me and I know a lot of people going
to say well this is good code practice
that's probably true but um I had
originally dabbled in C and
interestingly it only done a bunch of
picks up into that point so you know for
me when I started going back and looking
at sea after writing Erling for
something like four years solely up to
that point I started to see patterns and
of course free switch being an internal
messaging bus with queues and all of
those things already there that
translated quite nicely into Erling
terms and trying to connect to it from
early of course then hurt so we started
I started to say things like this so we
can start mod kazoo which is our
interface into the free switch library
the main runtime thread opens the
listener socket registers with the EPMD
we can bind kazoo fetch agents
internally free switch when it needs XML
it's not parallel eyes
you have to do some fun stuff with
mutexes there but otherwise the rest of
these guys can be started almost as a
supervisor so of course we don't have
any crash guarantees Ernie restart
capabilities here but kazoo node manages
every incoming kazoo socket of sorry
every incoming kazoo node that is
connected to the system and then spends
up in number of event streams underneath
it in order to fulfill the need of
whatever that because you note is
requesting ah which started to look a
lot more like this so this is the
comparable code and maude kazoo from the
previous one modernly event so the very
first thing is right at the very top we
now have a queue of requests that need
to go back down the distributed erling
pipe for instance we could call that
mailbox we again have our receive
unfortunately that's just the nature of
the thing but all of a sudden we can
drop that time out to something slightly
reasonable so don't consume all the CPU
if we get into a tight loop here there's
yields elsewhere too if we need to but
and then when we receive a message we
don't have to walk anymore we can push
those into our workers mailbox as well
so this starts to look a lot like a gen
server pattern and the more I got into
this the more I started to see that and
what was interesting is the things that
is passing around these structures I
started to see that as my state and when
I started to see that as my state I
started to defend against other things
accessing it without going through the
mailboxes and that started to give me
all kinds of ways to remove mutexes and
all kinds of other locking mechanisms as
well and again you know these kind of
patterns sure you really should be
seeing these things already but coming
again at it from an early perspective
that's where I really learned to hone
hone those patterns and so coming back
to the C code I was able to apply them
and start to make some progress with
getting the system more efficient then
you know why we're at it let's go ahead
and make the kazoo side a lot more OTP
friendly here so this is what the new
requests to the
see note look like Maude kazoo is
actually important the it's registered
as it's the name and we'll check for it
on the other side which also
interestingly lets us expand into other
places so we could have a name processes
and things like that down the road
because kind of names based herself a
little bit there and then the API remain
fairly comparable as far as sendevent
run execute some API command because of
course we're trying to do the same thing
and this is where it wrapped a bit but
this is the code that's responsible for
the event streams and obviously a very
small snippet of it but the important
bit we take out of our mailbox there the
incoming event stream and if we happen
to have a socket then we will encode it
here with the eia commands right there
for the encode switch event and i'll
show you that little bit later on we
then take the high and the low and we
put those into a socket and then we send
down the Erlang so effectively what
we're using the early interface library
for here is simply encoding or link
terms and then pushing them down a raw
TCP socket now one of the important
notes on the bottom here is that you do
for the next bit that i'll show you need
to enable tcp no delay and that turns
off the nagal algorithm which means that
every time we do these switch socket
sense that is a packet so the trade-off
here is now all of a sudden we have
three packets for every event granted to
are very small they're also TCP packets
so we did pick up a bit of overhead
there but overall the efficiency is much
much much higher and there's of course
room for improvement here now we have
knobs we could tweak these could be UDP
streams and all kinds of other
interesting things we could do but on
the other side once again still keeping
with the OTP straight thought this is
now how we receive these events dreams
so we open our IP port back to the
awaiting listener that we commanded to
establish itself via the distributed
erling basically the command is I would
like these events it tells us I'm at
this IP import and then we go ahead and
connect to it we expect it to come in
and bat as binary and
then that packet to is how those event
streams are framed which is where we saw
the high low order bytes going out first
before they even actually went down the
stream so now we're picking up all the
OTP guarantees but none of the overhead
from the distributed early so i'm not
sure if any of you guys have actually
gone and looked at writing your own
cenotes this experience when I first
approached it I was fairly intimidated
it seemed like coming back to see after
all that time writing a c-note to talk
to Erlang decoding are linked turns and
all that seemed pretty daunting at first
so just real quick if you haven't
actually looked into how to do this it's
remarkably easy and the first thing that
you have to do is run this e i connect X
in it and although arm this is just
telling a PMD Here I am here's my name
here's my host here's what I think my
host is anyway doesn't actually have to
be right step 2 you're actually going to
wait for a erling node to connect to you
so there are many flavors of mostly
commands in the library they've done a
pretty good job keeping and consistent
so anytime you see underscore TMO that's
with the timeout and so there's an e I
accept and Annie I accept TMI o our TMO
the library takes care of all the cookie
and all the translation as well if
you're talking across different versions
there's a compatibility mode that you
can engage if you want to go from like
if you compiled with our 16 you're
talking to our 14 or something like that
and then the last step is of course to
communicate once those connections come
in so I is receive message X is simply
the thread safe version of AI and
receive message and this is how you
unpack a Erling term that comes down the
pipe it looks a lot more complicated
than it actually is it's just extremely
robust so you're erling terms if you're
familiar with the binary wire protocol
they always start with the version and
then they go
tags and charities and such depending
those all vary depending on what's after
that so this just simply says decode the
version and this has a running index so
every time you make every time you do
that operation it just advances you
passed that point in the early binary
term so we decode the version then we
look forward this does not advance the
actual index but we look to see forward
what's coming next and if indeed it is
we expect a tuple in this particular
case and if indeed it is a tuple we
actually also picked up that size which
will use later that's arity of the tuple
we can decode that we determine whether
or not we got the arity that we wanted
and if you look at the comments you can
kind of see as it goes through this is
what we expect is three era tupolev 83
then we check to see if the first one is
an atom dollar gen call then we look at
the next element we expect the next
element to be a nested tuple too and we
expect a pit in a rough we expect the
last bit to be a request and then
eventually we get down here too we
expect is underscore off so this is a
gen call with a nested tuple in the
second position with PDF ending with is
off does anybody know what that is no so
what that is is net admin pink and what
you would like to do when you receive in
that Edmund ping is put together a reply
that says yes I am alive and you were
able to connect hints pong so we start a
new buffer we again start building this
up with the Erlang binary version at the
beginning of this buffer we'd specify
that following that will be a tuple of
two elements the first element is the
reference that we extracted from the
initial request and the next one is yes
so we then send that down to the node
and the node now knows that we're live
we're able to connect and that the
cookie is valid so is this good for the
company
um like I said before when I started
going back around and looking at these
things I started to see these guys to me
as my internal state records and when I
started to look at that again I could
start to protect these from being
accessed from the outside world the
important note here with the exception
of the socket which has the mutex none
of those actually have mutexes on them
and I just this particular one
specifically now i know that i am
glossing over some of the finer details
for instance i am defining a queue and
the queue is an abstraction of a PR and
that does indeed have mutexes internally
to it but the point being that this guy
once i start these up I can't change
them so when you start one of the
decisions that's led to is when you
start an event stream well technically I
could very easily come back in and
change that bindings and let you add and
remove bindings from an active event
stream I very specifically disallowed
that because now I don't need to lock
any of this right so there are elements
in here that you know led to the like I
say the influence that Arling had on me
led to some of the design decisions
because because you had no need for that
I could then not provide that feature
because I did actually could that at
first and when I started like I said
when I started to look at these this
different way that's when I realized
well if I remove that feature I don't
need that lock if I don't need that lock
every single event that goes out doesn't
have to lock it state um the next one
and this one again when rap too um well
ignore the fact that that's a global but
this is a pattern that i've been using
quite a lot in hurling and obviously
again it's just good coding but the the
function decomposition has led me to use
quite a lot of something like bind fetch
agents that calls into bind fetch agent
a little bit confusing if you're not
familiar not looking forward we also in
the office have a habit of saying by
agents to make sure that you know what
we're talking about but it translates
quite well in to see i had i wrote very
very very small functions and i found
that all of the functional decomposition
I was
during an erlang just to make very clean
and take advantage of things like
function pattern matching actually
translated really well into this
accepted in pattern match the other big
one for me was especially in freeze
which I don't know if you've ever looked
through the priests which source code
it's actually really really good but
it's also very very big it's no it's not
uncommon to have files that exceed
10,000 lines of code um so when I went
about writing mont kazoo after coming
out of early writing a bunch of modules
each module has to be the same name as
the file you write a bunch of those
files i structured this the same way and
so what i did when i approached the
problem is i thought about how would i
write this in erling and then I just
translated there laying in to see
without actually having written it so
that led to the file structure that
you'll find in mind kazoo now which
while not amazing in complex definitely
led to much cleaner and very well
structured code because each one has a
very clear responsibility well I think
so anyway I can explain what that
responsibility is if you didn't follow
oh so and if you can't read it says
here's where you made your mistake the
our mistake was trying to push
everything down distributed early taking
a library that was of course built to be
a c-note and trying to jam our problem
into that and not really looking well I
mean sure you don't want to bend things
out of shape but you can also use them
in novel ways that are perfectly
acceptable like using the C node library
in order to encode the terms and using
the distributed erling where it's
important so when you you could take
this library and use it for a lot more
well at least you can use it to encode
and decode and not necessarily have to
use it for just the cenote component as
well so you could actually write a
completely isolated in separate system
and use the library to do all the
decoding and encoding although there
might even be better options but there
was just something that I never really
thought about before that it was the
cenote librarian it would make it a
c-note and that would be one socket and
these were the mandates that had to be
met um so this guy is one of the helper
functions it's just one of the
it'll last little things that we had to
do so on the end here binaries don't
come i'm sorry i had to remember which
one this is because there's tula but
binaries don't come in null-terminated
and you have to do a little clean up
with like no extension or you end up
with some interesting crash stumps and
so there's a bit of cleanup that you can
wrap the existing railing library around
the way around so that you know you can
handle those in a easier manner and the
other one is true here for the this one
is the function that takes the key value
pairs that come in on the internal free
switch events and then map them into
propolis that then go out and get that
right one of the interesting things
there is of course you need to know how
big it is before you send it because you
have to in the early again in the early
binary term it's the version what it is
and then how big is it and you don't
really know if you're doing it down here
so we have to loop over the list twice
not a huge deal but anyway there was a
little bit of a pain in butt and then
this pretty Swift specific i forgot
about the body and that was oops that
does add a bit of space to it as well so
i have a habit of hitting my sights very
quickly so i have a feeling there might
be some questions here though with this
particular audience so i open the floor
let's start with james
yes sorry indeed yeah well so I thought
that would be a little too much kazoo
specific I was trying to keep it more
c-notes but one of the efficiencies that
we gained is internally in free switch
it has a massive keyvaluepair list it's
pretty much everything you ever wanted
to know about the colon anything that's
ever touched it has added to that so it
gets quite big and you can imagine most
calls have you you IDs and that uuid is
then replicated umpteen times in that
particular payload and domain names can
quick cut big ipv6 headers the point
being one of the efficiencies that we
found was kazoo doesn't need all of that
information so before we send it down
the event stream we actually pass it
through a filter that removes well we
only collect the headers that because he
was actually interested in sending down
and of course that made a huge
improvement in the overall bandwidth as
well as the processing load on the other
side is so the other component of that
is because this is pretty much because
if you were to take this mod kazoo which
of course doesn't have to connect to the
kazoo this is called mod kazoo so you
can connect any erling to it and you can
look at the free Twitter Lin our project
and you'll see it's just in server call
and you can see the API but it's very
similar to the previous API so if you're
familiar with that it should almost work
as a direct plug in mostly the events
though will be filtered and you can
specify that filter in the configuration
the XML configuration one of the
upcoming while we're on that topic one
of the upcoming optimizations that I
hope to make is we also bind for certain
event types which is the most granular
that you can within free switch so for
instance i can say i want all channel
answer but i can't say a better example
I want all channel execute but i can't
say i want channel execute for
conference and bridge and something else
because there's a lot of channel execute
and within kazoo we need channel execute
to know in a fact start
when a conference starts but not for
anything else and you get one every time
you issue a command or set a variable so
that's a lot of overhead just to fulfill
those two needs now unfortunately up
until recently there wasn't a good way
around that so as a matter of fact
Louise here has probably already fixed
the issue with the facts so that one's
done and we publish conference
participant events so there's very high
probability will be able to remove
channel execute completely from our
message bus which will significantly
reduce it'll half per call the messages
on that bus the other big improvement
that I hope to make and one of the ones
that was very helpful for kazoos
performance was the fetch handler that I
kind of glossed over because again that
was very specific to kazoo that one is
pretty switch will request configuration
XML and it does that in a blocking
manner internally in free switch and
then of course we have to do that
asynchronously on the distributor lame
message but well we don't have to but we
do so before it would go to both or
multiple connected II call managers
right which would block AB which would
significantly block the previous
versions but it was also result in two
requests to process that call so lots of
hits to the database those messages now
round robin and they have well since two
points something the next element that i
want to add is an event binding that you
can build that will round robin the
events that are bound to it so for
example channel answer create and
destroy or right now duplicate it
because all events go to all connected
kazoo it well if they asked for it which
we do but those three events in
particular would be very useful to
single phi quote unquote and the best
place to single fire or to dee doop
those would be at the free switch level
because we can do failure recovery there
and that's where the call is so if the
call goes down and the free switch goes
down where we're d duping it it doesn't
matter because we can't control
anyway so that would be the next big
optimization so as far as filters and
features go is that's where we're going
with that are there other questions yeah
yeah no problem just out of curiosity
are you doing inbound or outbound so
your dial playing hands off control or
do you have a connected socket
mm-hmm I catch it absolutely so I don't
suspect you'll have an issue well at
least not a significant one because you
would have known it by now for sure our
issue was it would crash free switch
servers pretty regularly so and like I
say the core dumps that we got we never
actually truly found the final place we
got that down the number crashes down to
a low count but you know in a clustered
environment it's dropping calls which
sucks but at least the cluster was up
but the the the crash dumps seem to
indicate that it wasn't necessarily
crashing in the modeling event but
modeling event was blocking because when
you bind into those event streams
internally in free switch you actually
are surly bound with all the other event
stream guys and we figured that it was
either stopping on it or it was blocking
for a longer operation than another
module expected and so those events
would then come in later trigger some
thing over in mod Sofia because it kept
moving it just I was over in mod Sophie
and then it moved over to a playback and
then it was up over here so that was
what you would see
I'm sorry the wedges which config file
the config file for oh so that is
actually I'm sorry the subscriptions are
done when you connect through the
distributed Erling you make the request
so it's an API and so you would connect
you would connect your erling whatever
to the cenote and you would say hey I
want channel answer events and the reply
that you get back as a gin call is going
to be the IP import that you connect to
and so you can dynamically create any
events right yeah yeah exactly in the
free switch that RL it's the derivative
of the original so it's similar but
internally it's completely refactored
and I think like I say there's no reason
you need it it was obviously originally
also just the example that everyone used
so you can actually just do Jin server
calls directly from wherever you want
it's got all the same OTP interfaces
that you would normally have does that
make sense
yeah please do now I will say this is
currently on our repo listed here github
26 is it you'll find a whole bunch of
repose there for the kazoo projects a
lots of components several components
you can pull my kazoo directly out of
this just the folder and drop it in a
native vanilla free switch the only
thing I think is missing in the native
free switches we have they use APR the
Apache portability runtime library and
there's one function they didn't wrap
and expose and it's a direct expose the
os os socket put oro a socket get one of
them is not in there but it should have
gone upstream and this is intended to go
upstream so let me also tell you all of
this and our entire repo was originally
just a temporary dev place and we have
met with them several times and as a
matter of fact our very own Darren
Schreiber has commit access and we keep
thinking keep we keep threatening to
commit this back upstream and they say
please do and then we find out that one
patch really can't go upstream until we
wrap it in a you know a config option
because that'll just damage everybody
else you know in the other not using mod
kazoo and then well we'll do that a
little later it would be a little bit so
there's nothing here that's dangerous or
we'll break free switch this is all the
only changes to our free switch just so
you're aware is we've added additional
events and we've written mahad kazoo we
wrote another one called mod channel
move but they're completely isolated so
all of that can be pulled into a native
or vanilla free switch if you want to
take a pile natively we also have the
latest stable 1.42 if you depending what
version you're running so you might be
able to just to pull it down and that's
mangled slightly in that it's got our
changes on it so you'll get a lot more
events for when you do set and export
but otherwise it'll work just fine no
code is removed just more events
internally
any other questions comments concerns
all right I appreciate it guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
