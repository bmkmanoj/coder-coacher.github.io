let's look at joke there but I played
chess and so um I with a charge because
I couldn't understand what I was put a
few polish friends and I was trying to
find out really difficult to pronounce
them and i am one of them to just
hunched butcher park execute pronounce
model anyway digressions and my name is
sandra minovsky and i am the founder
what would the co-founder of bucket
games digital furnace games which is
both actually complicated terms were
saying the same game company and and we
develop a game called Tony kita and I'm
also one of the founders of game cracked
foundation which is a foundation I'm a
profit that we do gain jumps everywhere
and particularly in Europe game jams are
like hackathons but for games so if
you're here you probably are interested
in games then you should go and make one
yeah and you can go to a draft or
whatever else and it's really fun to
make a thing and so yes our game is
called a Oh tequila's I'm saying is
available on Steam early access what
that means is basically you're flying a
game that's not finished so if you don't
want to do that you can buy the game now
so that you help us finish the game and
also you help us with feedback and stuff
and and you know basically it's
available now since the 7th 14th of
November and what is amazing about this
and why I'm telling you this is because
we have over 20,000 players so some of
the things that all of the things that
I'm going to talk to you about today and
our stuff that we're doing for again so
it's not a magical fairy dust if we
think about is something that we're
doing and peace 20,000 people use the
result of this so I thought that was
kind of cool and our people may be too I
don't know and the thing is and so this
coat this talk is called the tools the
staples and that was the title that's
why you're in here remember when you
were walking
so so the reason why I was talking about
tools it's because everything that we
you know us developers the way we use
tools and the tools we choose shape our
thinking so if you choose to use F sharp
C sharp D HP monkeys whatever brain
and that's that's how you shape your
sinking right sit on okay oh well weapon
and so and where was I oh yeah to shape
up thinking so basically I'm showing you
here these tools because i think they
are you know they help you think easier
big helpings of the problem faster
because you are thinking that way but
the things like one of the first tools
that will have us develop versus our
language right and even when you kind of
met on that you kind of start thinking
about what paradigm is the right one and
i'm not so long ago i was talk and
someone mentioned this paper called out
of the carpet right and there's a
picture that does it that is a carpet
and i didn't find any better picture
that was for non-commercial so i'm sorry
that is ugly and this paper actually the
picture is quite fitting because these
paper talks about complexity and the
sources of those complexities and i mean
actually you'll have this problem that
you're working on something you start
everything's good you put to work happy
and everything's free as the time goes
on suddenly one day you wake up and you
wake up at five in the morning or
whatever time that is too early thinking
because you have some problem and it's
hard to fix because it's a mess a mess
of complexity so this papers analyzes
the source of that complexity which
could be coming from state and its
interaction the fact that you have a lot
of that going around and flow of control
which means what come you know basically
how does that the moves around and what
changes it and coco lee now of course
I'm
summarizing a paper that's quite long
into three bullet points which is
obviously not complete so I suggest you
go and if you're interested about and
the sources of complexity you should go
check out this paper and because invoice
you end up like this cut right now
because its complexity it's very painful
and we don't want to have to be able to
basically the paper kind of winds up
with this one sentence that making a
reading something that looks or that is
simple it is actually quite hard and
what I found is did you wind up getting
to something simple after a good
iteration so you know anyway this paper
basically proposes that and functional
programming helps you and writes in
purple and this is why I started looking
at functional programming more seriously
I've been hearing about it or not but
then this is what made me think okay I
really have to go and try this thing
because it just sounds too good to be
true and so we try to sharp and and so
the thing is I'm a bird I'm a c-sharp
death for a good few years I don't
really want to think how many cuz it
scares me and then one would obviously a
sharp eyes developed initially by
Microsoft but now it's an open source
project that runs in all products and
runs particularly well on on macs and
its production in Linux for someone that
was asking in some more talk and
definitely runs on dotnet and its thing
to rock this amazing and if
so beautiful thanks its type system of
any fun so on here one okay you
will be very happy with that with that
goes f sharp is very accomplished and so
and the best thing about it is that
particularly for a statically checked
and languages you find it tell me they
are a little bit scary to get to get
started and and I like to call the
f-sharp learning curve divine learning
curve and some people look at me as if I
had like 50 eyes I was pressed like a
monkey's like divine what all right and
what I'm talking about is that even
though the first time if you try sharp
with something like perhaps the F sharp
combs you know those little exercise you
can do they you know you kind of a like
if you come from a job of C sharp but
maybe will ruin you go try on a garota
know this you have to think about what
you're doing ah flip tables and but the
thing is you in two days of doing a few
hours you'll actually get quite
comfortable you know getting around the
compiler and then the thing is like you
can do this with the incremental steps
on learning functional without having to
cut out going normal that just to print
hello world which is suddenly what
happens when we try to learn Haskell
high school is a beautiful language but
it can be quite daunting to try to lose
something to actually finish something
against in my penis that's on a half and
so you know I told you how awesome after
our face might as well show you some
right and so in here we have a list
comprehension this injured i'm showing
you this in have you ever seen a sharp
everybody seen a sharp okay so i don't
know some of you
some of you know I got this so and so
that's all I'm sure that the ones of you
that didn't see any of sure before and
read this and actually more or less
guess what it's going to do and and that
that's a good thing right I this also
happens when you Reaper at least never
happen to me right so and what we have
here is a list comprehension we have
function composition here we have some
more function composition here and we
have bindings so here we're finding this
a function that has a parameter it in
first type if for those of you in hostel
this is Han Lee Miller or wise it means
that you can just do very nice type
inference and you can defy height so
this is a record definition again one
line that language is quite concise if
there any questions about this anything
great vc something call it oh my god
what is not anything like that i'll take
that as no okay next time I'm gonna ask
you difficult questions and so yes you
might be wondering why I should okay so
I'm trying to show you the language and
say okay this is what we have and for
how do we use it in a game right and so
basically the way we use this in a game
is we have an editor like this this is
called to a low key it's very similar to
unity you ever done anything like that
and and basically you have a scene with
the game objects yes so anything that is
inside the scene you'll have it in the
scene view and so this one's our game
subjects and we have components which is
basically where everything runs the rest
is just rated and I'm obstructing just
to not stay there forever remember right
so basically we can read scripts in
c-sharp or a chart or seizure we use
Ruslan and forever we used African
boiler physics so what will write this
little square
that are maybe two three hundred pages
Langstrom and say they'll be a little
bit too long that little book 300 pages
and so so what we do is in those experts
we have to enter open up with very dirty
code from C sharp so para matching seems
quite natural and this is a para match
okay and so in here we are trying to
write a few one at you and this is a
nice function that is recursive and the
n is an end is inferred by this we're
matching if it's zero return 0 if it's
one written one anything else gets
underscore will call recursively and the
it will calculate it nicely again simple
concise and so that's that's nice how do
we use it in our game oh ok so in here
we have we have to unlock an achievement
so in here we say with us a game object
and we have what is the achievement they
won we're doing this part that I came up
to the nth component we're talking to a
c-sharp API and we're getting that back
because they say sharp it can't be no
and so with with smooth with them we
don't throw exceptions in it again
because your voice the game will never
run and we'll just kind of fail silently
with something fails and hope that
everything is fine it's not too really a
lie actually and third if you we do find
something then we can do the and if the
character is not on the ground then
unlock the achievement and then we say
get rid of this game object and that's
good and this this means that so what
you're trying to do here is that your
own looking and achievement for
something that happens when you're
jumping perhaps the first kill you
haven't the game or have something else
right so you played out you won't play a
game in your life good okay so it's just
checking hey you know maybe someone look
in a book code for few years
and the so there's our bar much is we
have this is different scripts okay I'm
just trying to give you an idea of how
we can use it ok so in here we're
receiving a message which is actually
just a type that has a different
messages have different things there so
when in general you just have like some
sort of spring message by default this
is a thing to check if this message is
of type actor died message then you bind
it to this name died message and you are
local achievement and you say oh it's an
airfield so it was I throw that you
unlock the achievement when you're
flying yay it's somewhat if I wake and
so um so that's kind of cool I mean this
is really this is game code that is live
in the game that is here pause for you
to play if you want to maybe and so
that's Tyra matching so what you're
doing what you when your parenting is
basically and matching to a dire shape
right and are you okay with para
marching I'm gonna assume yes because we
were under days but I never know and
they are very safe than sorry so after
Paris is a thing that basically and the
the thing that it the definition of it
is that you're able to name the
expression so in here we're matching on
an expression and that's all well and
good however sometimes you need to have
slightly more complex expressions are
you need to combine expressions so you
can name it and this is a nice pattern
see the way and more complex pattern so
they won't actually this is specific to
the game engine that I'm using which
means that what you're gonna do is and
you know you want that one state for
this script component they game object
you're going to dispose the frame after
your from this so you basically that
method all it does is put this game
object in a connection that would be
this post on their next frame but but it
ugliness comes from C sharp or you know
ugliness and basically you have no there
are ways to do this and hopefully we'll
get to writing an FRP wrapper around
this but the state is real okay is that
the servants are you question is cool so
I wouldn't want it at the party some
really nice examples of this and it's
one of these were naming this pattern
they started parents whiskey and we're
naming this epic parent a single case
called hold 100 milliseconds again we're
talking about real and can cope it's not
actually this we didn't put on the on
the game I put on a little games and
game director basically what you want to
do is to either you know the way most
platforming games you have a jump and a
double jump so you jump for a little bit
longer so in here you're combining those
two and if anybody comes and reach this
is storied land 79 you can totally tell
okay in the second case you're saying
that space keys is true and you're
holding for over 100 milliseconds then
it's going to do the double jump if you
wrote the sooner you know if and else
it's going to be slightly more
convoluted so I'm looks like this and
you know rocket science but it is again
always about incremental improvements at
least it is for me and you can also do
smarter sense and to multi case active
power and in this case what is happening
is that you might they 12 the app code
keyboard it returns a type called
keyboard input I know it's a little bit
confusing but that's why I put the name
they're the type name also we can
service it doesn't file and and when you
do this much the compiler goes in search
for an active parenteral half this type
and it will match against this so
the you know it's I think it's a
valuable example of multi case and and
so we're doing this which is kind of
hope so then you might be wondering
right and this is something on a
platform what about the interim you know
sometimes people tell you yeah
interrupts just fine then you go and do
it and it's an idler and like for
example when you have to compile a
library a see library from 1983 and
64-bit and turns off that there's half
of the dependencies of that are missing
this is a true story and so you know
what interrupt works for real it's
actually quite nice and so how does it
work if we're on the C sharp side of
things and if we want to consume F sharp
go from C sharp and it's very easy you
have two projects again if you are not
in the.net platform in it sounds like
I'm sort of crazy please asking i assume
that you understand what I'm talking
about but maybe your Ruby or something
it doesn't make any sense I don't know
and it's just because they don't know
how Ruby products are structure sorry
then I just don't want to find people by
mistake I don't know and so anyway you
have you can have two projects one with
see sharks deaths one would have sharp
stuff and you can say the sea sure
project will depend on the extra project
and then you just call this is
calculator which is the name of this
namespace mocking this to this you're
saying it's morgan up and you add this
method is called up and you can
basically just posted very simple it
nearly you could just say uh it's very
little in c-sharp code that's because it
kind of could be if we've compiled to
the same vehicle so it can rise and when
you're consuming C and C sharp code from
a sure you have the same thing
and in here we're running a test because
the test framework is in c-sharp so
we're saying hey this works and as I
said it really truly just works and so
at the moment in a sharp has a really
nice rapid that comes for free in in
visual studio and you can even include a
nice run rebel and do all that kind of
stuff and it spits there you can do
stuff like that and 22 what's or
probably oh ok sorry I did something
stupid good Haley's for please before oh
so it you know it's like you can do this
kind of live interaction which you
filled what why would you need to send
your project where you know we're using
an engine and the engine has and a very
big surface API sometimes you need to
check something soon and actually
running the game is time consuming and
at least a little bit slower than just
running something in there and you can
do this cool thing when you have
something you can right-click and it
will do send reference to F sharp it
interactive so you can easily just use
everything from there which is nice and
so in a world of our tools and we were
talking about to step we use now and
who's familiar with quick check or FS
check also so those of you that are not
this is gonna this won't be like wow I
hope this changes your world and like
close your mind like it did mine so what
FS check does is generate your test for
you who likes maintaining tests exactly
see what I mean it was a good question
the sort of you either are sleeping on
you hate writing tests are really boring
right so um well my ethics what FS check
does for you is you give it a property
and if the property is true then it will
tell you ok I tried this with like a
hundred random values and it worked so
you might be thinking
okay what's a property and the property
is something like this you're saying
something you're trying to prove
something so think that too much stuff
maybe i did when i was looking at this
episode ah ok so you're saying x plus x
equals 2 x's and that is true for
integers that is true for hoops all her
miracle types is this true for springs
letter thinks I'm actually that too
might actually just constrain it to be
an end right and I don't know so how is
this endless check for no work but
anyway we'll just focus on water
property right what's a property so if
you have a collection and less for
example the reverse of the reverse of a
list will likely be the original less
bright and instead of this uncertainty
you have you would be able to prove this
with coke that someone else generates
for you so that makes sense cool okay
someone's look that's that's a test I'll
keep asking and see and so quit jthe
started in about 2000 2002 I think the
original paper is by these two guys
clason and huges and if you want to know
more about it and you can there's a few
articles on f sharp for fun and profit
and if you're in c-sharp poor baby you
can use this from from those languages
if you want and it's a very small
library so that there was something
called text in in the.net the side of
the world and that's really good for
this avoid the heavy it's hard to run a
CI this just works because it uses it
can use em unit or x unit or it can run
on it health and the integration for
both are pretty good and so how does it
look instead of writing your test test
test in a public boy name of the test
and your test case and assert you write
your property so you set up whatever it
is that you need to set up you whatever
you want to narrate
it will be passed as a parameter and
then you verify that and and quick check
sorry FS check will go and generate
hundreds of low values by default they
will generate a hundred wellness and it
will tell you if everything else ok if
it goes wrong this is the coolest part
of them all if it does go wrong it finds
it does a shrinkage process that means
that it finds the simplest possible case
for the failure I'm going to think about
that so instead of giving you our just
tried a million against tree and you're
like okay but what does tell me and but
it kinda if it's like or negative
numbers actually don't work okay see if
it's minus one it's probably all
negative numbers so it gives you when
you find the book good actors check it
gives you a place to start on what you
did wrong which is every time f is check
isn't every time you arrive at interface
check best you find and that at least
three books this is this has been my
experience i right to like three pairs
nine bucks potential box did at put a
company that i never thought about it's
bringing really amazing
so you might be wondering okay this
sounds kind of like a good hardcore for
a game yeah I mean aren't games supposed
to be easy and you know chaotic I'll
tell you a secret it's not a secret and
creative work is incredibly Chaotix the
I mean is absolute chaos working with a
game it's basically you think you're
gonna go and build this nice thing with
a dragon in it and there's gonna be this
guy that jumps and breaks the ground in
here and it's going to be amazing but
you have it's like hey we need to finish
that pregnancy tomorrow and so you
actually have to speak tomorrow the side
effect of that mess is that first
whatever you have in mind generally
changes every time so all her nice plans
for organized software goes to somewhere
so what you have to do with any systems
for games I found is you have to make
them easy to change whatever really
really needs to hold you you make sure
it's like hard somewhere like a test and
whatever it doesn't need to be changed
you need to get rid of it wicking I
found the deepest trick is a great tool
for that because you can do something
like this example so this health
component it's very simple again you're
Mario or some sort of platform in
character or you can be 0 from this
awesome game called an Akira and and and
the you know it turns out that when you
get health back you can get help a
little bit you through some multi
practice that a bit strange it could be
that if a guy hits you you lose more and
then when you get more health it works
in a weird way there's it's actually
kind of a weird system what I definitely
want to know is that you never ever get
more help than the maximum help you can
ever get because that will unbalance the
game or someone can try to do cheats for
the name so I wrote a property and this
this little metal goes and generate the
two recreates a
an instance of health component and we
assign a max code that is generated by
FF check and amber saying you can
increase help I again a number generated
by ethics check in this line number
eight nobody see that so the simpsons
okay give there's a simpsons episode
when Homer is hanging out with joke
owner and she's he says number eight and
he burps it's number eight it's very
funny I ate when I said that I really
thought someone who's gonna do that and
so I am I'm sorry and so in here you
were trying to say and we're increasing
the help we're setting the max health
and this is this is a precondition FS
check will avoid it so basically we're
saying and that max health would always
be bigger than 0 so whatever strip will
do is it will generate simple samples
will generate zero and cream and because
the free condition is met it would try
to assert on the property but if you put
58 and minus two it will get here and
just discard that value so not only you
know you have all these extra stuff that
comes with a first-rate like this thing
that allows you to do really really and
kind of a breath of test of the system
by just a few lines which i think is
pretty good and this is I'm showing here
the test runner and worn it discards the
value 1 is 0 or a minus 19 or minus 34
and then is 5 and so when it's five it
moves see this is the wrong number 55
and then when it's finally a value panic
number it turns to 56 which is what you
would expect and I think this is amazing
I mean you should don't be like wow we
just changed my life I know it may be to
saying that you're just not showing it
you're shy
careful to be no way no I mean yeah of
course if you don't know about this is
that useful yes okay thank you I give
stroke mind if my generate values for
one faster on a test run they don't you
okay so it's like you're basically
talking about it it's like you're saying
because they randomly generated you
could have like crazy values making me
em see me I thought that won't happen I
think there's I don't have a good answer
to that it hasn't happened in a way that
it has affected me yes every time we run
test it it's used as a random generator
yes boy wait 11 or time he was first
sorry checks your cases okay and because
you can't if there is it bad that you
can have it's based on the logic distro
not you will create kind of state agent
sessions asshole I don't know how it
works in HR but probably on fine i'm
also checks the case with cases other
mention this guy's like it's not the
help of all these arbitrary marks who
cross the game just decided
yeah also when I think the if you get
one of those edge cases scenario you
probably and you want to make sure that
doesn't happen and you can always just
great and a unit test or an intervention
tested covers that Pacific side cases
and happy days by the way and fs check
when work when you're using it it
doesn't mean that you suddenly replace
your whole test suite to be just
property testing but it means that you
kind of have way less test that all of
the repetitive kind that you would
normally have before you use properly
tested at least again that's what
happened and I know a awesome tool that
we use is a little called fake and as if
F sharp make and and what if if you like
me or aunt and if thats that's good for
you and whatever Apple a certified gives
you is a types on top of that and a very
very nice to yourself that is a proven
for over four years and so that means
you can have a nice build system for
your daughter projects that is works
cross-platform and that em you don't
really need to know who I sharper to
users but if you're learning a sharp it
can be a good way to add a sharp to your
work you know know where it's going to
fake hey I really am dying to write the
the bill too it's very well I I've never
seen that except maybe me but I'm kind
of sad away and
and so I fake is really cool and it's
used in a bunch of open source projects
the good thing is because they're open
source you can see their example scripts
and and you get intelligence and
everything from from visual studio and
you well you can go see in github how
they use it and you can build your
solutions you can run minute test you
can deploy a newly packages you can sip
whatever is your assemblies are doing
and that's pretty cool and what it does
is you create a bunch of targets and
once you are you know basically you
define the targets and then you order
which ways you want to run them in this
case you have foo and bar and you're
saying bar foo so basically fool will
run first and then bar and if you have
our stuff and our effect of that is that
you can comment out something out of
that and just run the target that you're
testing so as your it's a very iterative
process so and that's very nice again if
you've ever done bills before this is
not coming clean up this is not
necessarily the case and testing builds
are staring slow because you're gonna go
like okay I have to test the whole thing
and that's not no fun and so that's fake
and there is tools for building in every
language I think this one is
particularly good so and we're getting
to compiler services so I remember I was
showing you there that in our game we
have the scripts and they run and so
compiler services this cool library and
that the one of the things that it does
is it saying hope you can host the
compiler so this is an open source
project as well and so hosting the
compiler is probably the simplest thing
you can do and we're doing that but you
can also host an interactive session and
graph the AST and do crazy things get
all the information from your project
and do project analysis
and a bunch of other stuff that's super
cool the good thing is like if you go
here to compile our services and just
click on one of these things like that
one and it gives you sample code and how
to run it and it's a few lines of code
for anything you want to do so totally
worth it and so what I'm going to show
you here is and the way the way the
compiler services works for us it's and
we have the game engine has a file
watcher in a particular directory and
when there is a change to laugh and the
engine can go to oh you should do
something so it grabs this new file or
the change file it compiles it with
compiler services and creates an
assembly puts it in an another special
directory and the game rentals a bold
new stuff look into the abdomen and
basically becomes immediately available
to the entry which is cool right a
school that's cool so that means that
you don't have to work on file the whole
game just to do what scripting change
which is cool so instead of and talking
about stuff because total is boring
right and we're gonna we're gonna do
something so I created a scene here one
where you can complain the board look is
here
and so in here we have a mash-up script
called lambda legs because that's where
we are and if we go here to the silicon
I have a kind of ready because I thought
hey you know what maybe work that way so
what we're doing here is if we don't
find this game object remember work done
fine with her matching and it's going to
print the on the look or always it's
gonna turn the Sun but what I'm gonna do
is change this now so that it doesn't
find it so yeah Oh what I can tell you
that it actually when you're testing the
game you need to you need to actually
play the game fast so you need to have a
all the health and damage the enemies
just so but we don't ship that so don't
worry it won't be there we have a good
good process because we expect and we
remove all the stuff that doesn't need
to be there and so in here right and
you're you would have the game engine
here and I know you probably can't see
it but in here once I change that it we
push this assembly know that I first
grabbed it by the block that means that
if there's a problem I can go and find
it so and that happened to stare 15
39-36 so when I do this nothing's gonna
happen we're saying hello lambda days so
it's getting fun so hello long delays
just I should have done that so if we
change this so it finds it so in here
we're saying in the current scene find
the game object called new logo and it
could be non active so in here we have a
new logo at game object and has a sprite
renderer and our stuff and it's not
active so if we do that and can oh no
but sorry I para que to not have to
change the correct product this cousin
compile or digits let's try
just ok so there it is and see I was
waiting for that soup open and now it
shows area here I so all day all been
scripted is say if it finds it turn it
on and add 50 true this is a mutable
think so because we're dealing with tea
shop so you know it's the you know
imagine the feet babe the feedback loop
on doing this it's quite fast no Joe
Biden forever general you write a little
bit more clothes than active truth but
this kind of proves the point on how
fast they durations and okay that was in
case stuff doesn't work because if
you're showing it to people it always
breaks any other times just pray and so
any questions about the compiler senses
oh and i think that to know well the
problem is that when you are you know
the program is to ality when it has if
the way you build that it basically will
restart after restart the entered takes
about five or six seconds you don't want
to do that because you don't have that
flow this is like maybe one second
compared to restarting the whole editor
or maybe it loses some focus that your
hand or whatever well one of the plugins
so they architecture of it is that in
this in here in the game there is a
directory called plugins and one of them
is called duality zurich scripting
plugin and that is what hostess hostess
they're sharp compiler services so um
yes so you don't know that all if you
want to learn a trap obviously and you
might wonder why and I'm sorry we're so
you can go to any
they are really good resources and if
you are already very very in andover
using C sharp alot or Java or whatever
object oriented language you use an
extra proponent profit is really good
ever at and onboarding people learn to
laugh until F sharp or functional
programming in general actually and if
you like doing stuff as opposed to
reading stuff community for F sharp has
a a bunch of dojos that you can follow
they can be about machine learning about
the compiler services there's just doing
after and it's really cool and I sharp
the road you have a supply of sharp
total you can do it in your machine
which is nice if you're more of the book
type I really like this this particular
two books and there's more books but
this is the ones I like and and if you
like attending conferences you can go to
London and their 17th of effort and that
would be a whole day of F sharp and and
then always you can go to and practiced
in parts and you might have noticed I
like cuts maybe and so we have a group
called functional cuts and we do
functional it's a cross functional
programming user group we learn loads by
a tree doing extra inter user group
stuff and basically that's all that I
have to share with you thank
so usually when people compare
functional languages with erotic ones
that they complain about the performance
you know Ganga is known for very high
performance requirements I mean do you
profile it and sometimes start using
ibaraki type of programming dinner sharp
switch to spas okay you just don't care
this posture I don't care no no that's
that's a really good question and I
probably I probably should say that in
in the talk and so performance in our
way performance they want you to
performance analysis in this type of
project which is long-lived and whatever
is basically you get to a full feature
set of some sort and then you start
doing making it early basically which
you know you always have to either
pretty and performance or freedom so and
dost and what so far we've found it and
because we're you think I'm sure if the
ship part of the product it has a sharp
is actually maybe ten percent or maybe
even less so we don't have such a big
impact but even when the bits that you
do because it's scripting and you you
know I'm not great we're not really
creating such a mass overhead we
basically hasn't been so bad so far and
when we hit the point where it is we
would have to deal with it and but yeah
I am kind of concerned when they plan
for for for us is to build some sort of
wrapper around therapy so that is it
allows you to do either either frp or at
least an answer FB instead of checking
for most of the time that kind of stuff
and so we'll see what happens then Bobby
right
performance put this up on stage yes as
you see we are not really being mutable
what I'm trying to show in this talk is
that you can you have steps this is the
steps will going through to go from a
fully object-oriented c-sharp only shop
or whatever to hate these are the steps
that we've taken and then have work so
far and which is a I think it's a nice
story to hear cuz it's you know it's
been hard to know how to go about it so
it's not perfect but there is a pot and
I think you can write pretty performance
at sharp too and in some cases that
there's there's this guy called Jack
papas who writes about Effra performance
and he actually achieved a slightly
better performance and some stuff on a
shirt and just because he's really good
at he's a performance from me and so if
you want to read about it if they'd like
to check it any other questions
your song yeah i just did angel yeah
sure hey cutter you can also practice I
kind of sorry you look good you notice
more on this and no but if you want to
pay a stand ground for support it no
problem it's funny we want to go to my
run no no I'm grandeur which is the most
expensive but okay thanks it seems like
the program would going like we're a
small company with six people and you
know 14 is very expensive from a resort
near time and time is not free but I
want the languages and the libraries
will use in earth but that doesn't mean
that for example content doesn't just
work in like you have what the you know
when when people say see mono and donuts
are the same and they're generally like
you can't just grab the project and it
will build it's very strange that that
happens and because there's a book same
model there is a certain things that are
done differently great when that is true
I'll get right it's just not that's not
you know maybe some parts are not using
a you know cross-platform patch like
there's all these little things that you
just have to go do it and when you do it
you find out how you screwed up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
