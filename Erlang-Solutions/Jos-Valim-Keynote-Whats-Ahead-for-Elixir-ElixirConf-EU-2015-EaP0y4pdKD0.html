coming through the first unser
conference here in Europe the second
paddock circumference in the whole world
I want to thank specially Jean for our
land event and everyone there they
solutions office really that helped this
event being true we come true to me this
event it's really it's really special
occasion having Alex your conference
here in Krakow because I've made a
commitment about five years ago and I
got married and I moved and I believe
here in Krakow a four or five years so a
lot of my career development career in a
lot of fancier it was buted happen here
in Krakow so for example about five
years ago I was in this exact room in
this exact stage giving a talk at a
rugaru 2010 was anyone had event by the
chance cool yeah so I was here at the
stage and I was giving my first my first
talk at the event in English for the
first time the talk at the time was DSLR
no DSL and if you are pronated like very
quick digest at the talking no DSL okay
and I hope I won't have to give this
talk even annex or conference even two
years or three okay so
remind that remember that girl right
there and the first
comité weddings fear happened while I
was living here in Krakow I'd like to
say that actually the meeting in crak
was also one of the secrets for me
for that div because when it's winter I
don't leave home I have those three
wealth stuff like really I'm not living
homes that can do a bunch of interesting
stuff it's the job but it's also true
because if you look you need to go at
the github graphs and for simple one the
first commute 22 it wasn't okay so and
you know and it was also here but that I
made another commitment though I'm not
married to all these people
those are my co-workers that Papa from
attack and it was I was living here and
then it was over Skype session and it
told the story at the first Tyler
conference in Austin that at some point
when I kinda Canadian had had an idea of
what I wanted answered to be I may
describe with my partners at platform
that and saying hey you know I need I
think we can create this language and we
can create something really interesting
and exciting and and they obviously they
bought the idea right and I think one of
the reasons that we're all really happy
to you know for having a chance of maybe
causing a positive impact in the
programming community and that I think
was a lot of doing the reason in the
drive the drive behind the scene yes or
invest corollary work manager part-time
that was this with the topic of that of
that discussion of that call but the
thing is that we are to a company right
we had to to have some plan like of
using items in the future right I mean
his idea of contributing is great but as
a company what what are the plans hardly
to that exceeded which is early to
invest on it and what I was meeting
right the commitment was that I was
eventually going to do two things
okay so the first one was that your need
to work money theory of what I think
this could be the ideas I had and one
day eventually and I missed like I gave
like estimates and I missed them by two
years but I did that one day I was way
to reach a luxurious serum and after we
got that we work on the web
infrastructure in the sense that but a
firm attack we are in a web company
right we think that run on top of a TCP
socket and you then that is what was
going to be our use case but I also knew
that it does make sense to make a
language that is focused on the web
right the the language needs to be
general purpose and that was actually
why since the beginning of the language
I'd focus on accessibility because in
order to create a language there was
general purpose but it would allow me or
my company or whoever would do this work
to get the same image and extended
naturally okay to allow us to build this
web infrastructure okay so that was one
of the one of the ideas behind being
accessible and it's really exciting to
say that be extensible paid off because
we are starting to see a lot of
interesting use cases for some embedded
systems so I just tweeted a video from
interviews that we are we did a turning
factor in San Francisco and one of the
interviews that
going to call is exactly developers they
weren't able to get even during p.m. and
then exceed into any valid system and
everything put into seconds and that's
the product right there shipping that
and they and they are selling that they
are running that so that's really
exciting
I also heard of cases of people using an
exterior intention and you know
platforms like you're doing training and
well it's quite different from what we
do what their lab research for that home
or working with you and Chloe on the
code and decoding on the fly and also
some interesting working or happening
within the area of graphical user
interfaces true so this one is really
exciting because for me being from the
Ruby community right and when Richard
Scott has a lot of us is from there so
this work for me is like the most
exciting work that's happening right now
because it's going to really allow us to
broaden our horizons and bring in a lot
of interesting new ideas a lot of new
interesting thoughts
okay and I think it's we to be really
excited to see everything back together
so so talking about accessibility right
and came from this commitment and I have
the different I mean I have committed to
two things right and one of those was
already delivered which is Alex 0 0 and
X 0 0 came out in September 2014 and it
was much bigger than I could ever have
imagined right by the time it came out
early had 180 computers is huge
ok so takes everyone for contributing
not only with cold right but reporting
birds or
in UPS trying to convince awards to have
a look of you then he tried everything
Maddox is not only the contributors in
the code and by the times it's really
one up okay mom we already had three
books all that were kind of being
developed through the language okay so
that was pretty fantastic and we had
before even the first version we had the
first time user conference happening
mostly so this is really really great
and I again positively surprised by
everything that should happen even
though every structure also because I
don't want to have this mindset that you
know I made this commitment and if
nobody does it I will have to go and
eventually to it so I joke with Eric a
lot which is he's behind the hacks
package manager right that I'm really
thankful that he did because I really
didn't want to do that but I know that
if nobody did it I would eventually have
to do it so thanks a lot Eric and the
things happening to our infrastructure
so Eric again and he's going to talk
about it tomorrow
did we talk about act oh he started to
tackle this database side right of the
web commercial in stock databases and
acto is the one of the projects that can
do it Chris he had this fantastic idea
of channels and brought them into
Phoenix and it was nice that he invited
me to be part of the framework issue so
we could build the rest of this stuff
together
I've heard that there are books coming
out soon exactly these general web
infrastructure so that's really good
news and that's because those doing this
to linear right here you're getting
close to and oh okay so there is a good
shot at tiny things under here and it
means that p.m. can encode right to get
those two things that I preferred to
deliver them and this
sighing and so on because it's the
biggest project of that I ever involved
from you know from the beginning have an
idea billion proposal in the working see
that proposal it has been three and a
half years right so it's a huge project
and it has been the biggest project I
have ever been volved so it's really
nice to get to this point is that I
can't is done but what excites me the
most about things is that when those
things are delivered I can't go back to
an expiry and focus on the next three
full time again and think you know what
is coming next so if you're it is so if
you saw my talk and the percentage of
conference or our air lean factory I
always like to policy some ideas around
trying to get feedback talking to people
and that's why I want to show for this
talk okay so what is coming for the
future of adding to what we can expect
so I be passing those ideas around and
it means at this point I already have a
working concrete plan a lot of those
things are going to be and that's way to
be this song okay so let's get started
with where we are right now okay so
right now it's nine zero zero and we had
an experiment cereal at four we are
indeed on the zero branch so the one
that cereals for was released still this
models but not long ago and it was a
plastic like maintenance for the
environment
and but we we actually went to release
these we decided based on feedback that
we got with the community we decided to
back port some some some things that
were implemented for the upcoming 1.1
version but we got a lot of it back
inside the back part and those things
are and I'm going to into details okay
so once this new version right with
wallet sir does bar we do automatic
power consolidation we had two new
options one called building that in the
other start permanent and one you what
we also added is that this version runs
on the latest air link and also the
release candidate for anything so the
left well this year is run to learning
1705 and 1800 degrees candidate one and
i'm going to go through those training
points here just to having it your one
changing room i know matters so before I
talk about protocol consolidation we
need to talk about protocol dispatch so
imagine we wrote this code okay and you
find that Jason Birk oh and I signed a
contract right like if you want to
return in spark or they'd implement they
call the function and what Alex is doing
here behind the scenes is that this code
here it's going to become this code okay
so the protocol is actually a module and
each function that we defined for the
protocol we define implementation
implementation at this point is really
straightforward so they called functions
we call JSON the cold as an item we need
to find the implementation of the
protocol for this item and then we call
in code implementation pass to the item
again so that's that's literally the
translation that happens at this point
and and and that's because the bulk of
the logic is that
the implementation for function so if we
got next apply is implementation for
functions way to have a bunch of clauses
so here for example is the clause for
lists so if it happens that my item is
at least I need to find implementation
for this an implementation for this is
the name of the perk is never the per
call concatenated to least okay so
that's going to give me James notley's
and because we can load code anytime in
the render time machine and even more
development I need to check if the cold
for this implementation for this module
if it's actually available so if we have
the code I'm going to return it
otherwise I want to fail that there's
the implementation on its feet okay
and the trouble if these and there is
many more accommodations because if you
are calling a protocol this is a good
amount of overhead right for something
that we can potentially call a lot and
why this is fine for development because
its development it's not they're not
good for production you look a
professional to run as fast as it can we
don't to be spending CPU cycles
concatenating marginese or checking
intercepts is loaded and that's and
that's usually how it happens okay so
what we do is that the order to be
faster Pradesh we have this thing called
protocol consolidation because when you
deploy to production you are no longer
loading code dynamically right what what
what are going to deploy your call your
system is complete so what we do is that
for with protocol information we look at
all your code and we look at all the
protocols and all implementations and we
generate much cleaner coal furnace ok so
here at the preneur consolidation which
had that implementation of the item for
list if it's a list because we saw that
there was a jail is
Asian we just 330 directly write all
that overhead we've just solved gone
disappeared okay and then always one
implemented
Jason use the right go to the
implementation of the Jason particle or
a user destruct BAM it's here right
there's no over hand there's no checking
areas don't forget to nation and then
they would have a bunch of those clauses
and then for everything else they were
not implemented so we just Braley's okay
so this much clearer is going to be much
faster so our accommodation is not the
new feature
okay it's there things before we go but
the issue we have to be is that the
protocol consolidation was done manually
you have to call if one parent
foundation that had to call mixed up our
protocols right and if it's the family
basically let's have somebody walk okay
so what we do with this release is to
automatically consolidate protocols is
the beauty Madden option is true okay so
I recommend everyone if you're not
running add on the latest an exterior go
because this feature our lives always
already worth it
okay so and you're going to see that you
can create a new application the beauty
bad option is going to be true if your
environment is production so that's the
behavior that you want cool not only
that during bad it automatically does
for oxidation but my positive is that it
puts everything into a package right so
when Beauty bad is false what happens
then
sorry technical pyrolytic organize your
project we generate in underscore beauty
directory fair environment so long for
that or forecast
evolution and all of our code is there
but we're but when you have a
development department we use a lot of
ceilings because we don't want to be
copying like big files or artifacts all
the time right so just you see it and
that's going to be faster but again for
production you don't care about the
ceilings right you don't want to go
through ceiling to go to go through
homes
so what building method true does that
it's going to get rid of the ceilings
right in embed everything into the
future already that's why it's only
valid so when the building that is true
Riesling enables more consolidation but
not only that it packages your whole
tradition into the others part builder
authority and there are no sleeves and
so on okay and this is the first step of
eventually having releases a more
integrated part of Alex here
all right so if our goal is already all
in one place we can start playing more
and more at those ideas so that's what's
the other option right building batted
and you want it to be true for
production and the final option which
again you want to be true wanting to be
set to true for production is start
permanent so I start permanent is the
easiest to explain of all of them is
that it shifts the build down if our
Ganesh impressions so if if you have our
application running and for example
supervision tree crashes and some a good
amount of times the the application is
going to shut down rightly you're going
on vacation but if we don't set start
permanent to true the application will
shut down but the early growth will
continue running which meant that your
operating system wouldn't notice and
wouldn't restart it unless you are
checking on a port or doing something
specific they start permanent just be
sure that when it's true and your
application crashes the dogs way to
crash true so whatever using for
monitoring
can can see that and again we just
wanted to be true for production right
because if you're testing your code and
your application crashes you don't shut
down the know but you still want the
test to finish and give you a nice
typography so that's the current state
okay and I hope that this was the last
and it's released under the moniker
bridge if we teach it to another
releases our problem the release process
is really straightforward things like 10
15 minutes to do it all but I really
want to focus on that 0.14 and that
extra look one is really well develop
already have two interesting things
there so the biggest one is that the
access protocol is gone okay so what is
that is birkoff every time we use the
syntax like you have an options and do a
bracket and the key behind the scenes is
calling access protocol so just to be
clear they see that's still going to
work right or not not changing these are
not moving this just that behind things
to use the access protocol but we have
now changed it to only two tickets flute
cop is dead and there is no process that
I said that the protocol dispatch is
usually okay for development but we
found out that not be the case for gas
or a call because this syntax is really
calm so we ended up calling the protocol
just too many times and we should
remember in that slide right we had the
I can go back here we had the coalition
loaded every time we call this it goes
through a process called code server and
it could become a bottleneck have like
multiple processes calling access
protocol so if all of these to be true
to be an issue just ask us for a comedy
parkings investing your son everything
else was fine okay
so that's why the we are changing the
inner behavior and we are articles
mostly suppose not being attacked by
that all that this is going to call
their accident each module beside
instead of going for the access protocol
okay so that's one of the change that is
coming and it's basically to ensure
you're not going to have slowdowns in
development or test in production it
doesn't matter we're consolidating fix
way to be faster test anyway okay
the other dummy that's coming before one
is that we have many more intuitive
functions in them indeed so for example
we have random in down okay you keep it
incorporated and potions for the access
protocol we had ways of lazily gaining
values so there are some nice
improvements here one very nice feature
and it was contributed by Alexey that's
here is maps at so director we have sets
and one of the implementation of steps
called hash tag but are they introducing
the seventy version introduced new maps
and with the new version early
eighteenth and coming this year we have
like maps can also work like hundreds of
thousands of miles so we decided to try
a map staff accommodation which is
basically effect using a hash behind the
scenes and maps acts like much faster
than hashes that so that's really good
news I think that you know if you get
our code we need to replace hash tag but
upset and it's going to just work anyway
to be faster so it's really going
forward to get better performance and
the last one is better weeks and require
integration so if you depend to have a
reporter than the serial command click
allow it
but not that any theory started to gain
a lot of traction even the garden
community community but it started to
happen is that we have rebar packages
right that they also have instructions
to be home power with mix so if that's
the case mixes with respect that so even
if you have a rebar dependency if if
that dependency seems like he able to be
poop out with mix and use the headings
or delete it's going to work and that
means it's way too weary to have faster
population than that so it's it's a good
change this'll do
so that's kind of like good skeleton of
what is common connection or not one but
all the seams here they were not
planning they came with the keep from
feedback and from developers with your
beauty we have actually just one thing
planned projects around oblong which is
to improve our kinds and these parents
it was one of the themes of drawing is
pockets I like any I wanted to do this
feelings kind of Clerke and then in my
reply the one that he didn't have it he
and I said you know this finger plan
different accents really okay so so what
is this feature so in an experience so
this versus day we have the idea of
archives and archives are compiled code
then you can but your machine they are
global and every time you run means this
code is there is available so that's how
hats is installed on your machine it
uses archives okay what I want to do
with you Alex your version is to make it
easier to install as archives Phoenix
you for example now it's an archive so
to make it easy so if you want to stay
here multi strand archive from this
hacks package or this hack tax package
with this version that's going to be
supported in and X 0.1 and the same from
a git repository right in front a
starter car
oh sorry it's going to do that and what
is going to do that it's ready to fetch
the project for whatever you do to it
it's going to compile it it's going to
peel their kind it's going to stall into
your machine okay so that that's good
that's what makes up workflows much
easier but archives are not ideal
because every time you run mix those
archives are loaded and it means that
furthermore you can't put Phoenix or
acto as an archive because the diversity
the archive is going to conflict with
the version your project so it's
archives narrators who just as like
one-off project okay if you want to
collect Phoenix or hacks that's for
remote extend the mix by adding new
tasks that it matters only to you those
are good use cases for archives but to
support those other use cases we want to
allow in scripts and they be scraped you
actually get your so are one with
archives are compounded code and you
distribute kind in the same file with a
script you get all our code and we can
actually put on something that can be is
acute it right as in the script and we
are looking bad and it's you you're into
that as much as we can so that's one
more to bring the same features to a
script if I want to install the script
or from p1 for max package or a star
from gate will be able to do that so for
example in this case for this is we
could you could have acto as an e script
and then you can run your vibrations
from the
a script you don't need to have mix or
not release or something like that and
so those are the planning programs and
and that's pretty much it production of
one and I think week I think
July 2015 this year is July this year is
a good as
for having out I didn't want to put
dates but I knew it was going to be the
first question so I think it's a good
testimony first working okay
and extracts our loved one we are going
to have I think two basic math and there
isn't much planned for anything without
you what we want to do events or
lectures that you just want to bring it
up to date with early eighteenth so
right now we are running our software on
the early 17th right and but there any
of us fairly eighteen then it has a
bunch of nice improvements and antics
either one of two is about catching up
with those improvements and there is
when you're doing that I was discussing
with Eric to see if that's really a good
thing they will also get back it's
because what I want to say is that if or
if you depend on your project because
you can say which extraversion you
depend if you say hey I want to use an
external antenna Linux or not one that's
going to mean that the support earning
seventeen and her name 18 plus okay this
be seventy plus so if you're say that
you support is reversion you're not
supposed to use any of the drilling
features because that's her contract and
if you say I depend on external not true
that means you want to run on early
eighteenth and later and there is worth
doing that's because we believe that
this is easier than having people depend
on two things and having people saying
hey we Chinese your personal running is
it you wanted on so you need to use one
up one with this and then oh if it's 102
is eighty money so in order to reduce
this problem saying well so if you want
to go 70 Plus use an external at one and
then if you want to use
learning you should dependent NXT luxury
so there's a butch plan and that's to
make easier right you're kind of taking
the de Bourbon so you can compete in
your process you to specify the next
version and you don't really worry about
the Java version okay and what's what
happened is that adding fear when
applying sure that sure they are
probably two axes for a good while at
the same time so you need to do a new
micro release or tiny release of a
one-up one will probably do the same or
will not choose the same issue applies
and you'll be able to pick whatever
you're running introduction to what a
process so the only things that repeat
to add wave heading to a lot true are
the things that exist only in our
guillotine so for example this is a very
small issue but I definitely love it is
we're going to have a function called
Jen servers stop with this means that
you know Morgan need to be defining
clauses in roarton circles to make it
stop and and so on so this motion will
be there it will be able to stop in the
server we are going to have a visual
support for March Maps so if what you're
doing is so if you want to use maps and
but hundreds of thousands of elements of
it that's not going to work in our name
seventeen
okay so if you want to use access to our
general infrastructure and put a lot of
stuff in there then you should be
families without you and that's why
we're going to option support large maps
okay so and that's the problem will
start changing annex you to use those
maps and so on only implement all the
internal things are it's not going to
affect everything in say here is
supposed to the thing backwards
compatibility okay and then a that will
prove that will deprecated the that has
to be - things because now there's no
reason to use it more naturally to be
fast and they solve all these cases or
elegantly we have teramachi
it's faster and so on and we sought the
perk enemies
you know remove them from the guides we
don't need people already to talk about
them we are going to play them down the
recommendations and so on so they exist
there behind the scenes for going to be
compatible and in the future but
actually to all comes out totally know
cheer is it going to be for the TARDIS
tree okay so from the table T hash they
can be that has begun and so that's
something we have problem too and the
other ones that we finally have our a
good maps so today to have a very equal
like key and you want to create a map
and then because if you see taxes on
work today okay but we've got you you
can create maps like that dynamically
and I think one morph later and into a
loved one it's a fair it's a fair
commitment because you just need to pass
bar for those genes and we want those
things Texas at the same time so you can
chart beat what makes more what makes
more sense for our position setup and so
this should come right together okay so
far so good so everything is that so far
it's kind of like you know I hopefully
got I'm confident because I'm told it
because it has been planned for our
certain point for why we have thinking
about it and just not we starting to go
more other your orders okay but like
again an exactly happy thinking about
those issues for a long time and we are
going to perform against this release in
whatever way to show that there let have
prototypes and try to get a lot of more
feedback so if you have been following
what I'm talking usually in advance I'm
talking a lot about collections okay I
think the idea of collections manager
it's one of the most important ideas
image okay so here's some cold
we have widgets and when we're talking
about collections it means that I can
filter those widgets I can map so I have
to travel to get there which is just
with the caller rad and then I want to
map getting the title and the height of
the widget and then they want to put
everything into a map right into the
cube and so what they say about
collections is because we don't really
care what those equations are all right
it can be a set they can be half sad
upset they can be leashed okay we don't
really really really care and all this
is going to work right and we don't care
about it and when we're talking about
collections if you go to the literature
we say that here at the top of the
widgets they are our source
okay that's fee that we have in the
beginning we are going to transform it
and in that experience Marceline's and
it implements the normal protocol and
here they need to at the end this is our
sink this is where the data after which
was formed right this is where the data
comes to right and it needs to Clemente
collectible protocol in because we have
this protocols right like what's
happened is that we can replace our
source and our sink here we can replace
for as a power source by a CSP parser
that is parsing the widgets for me and
again have as a think my standard upload
that's just going to print whatever I
mounted here before okay and this goes
just like to work right because the
source can be anything that
that's that purple and the anything that
is not purple so this is good but this
is not ideal
what is the issue in this code these are
this code is that we are doing
everything in big chunks right so what
we do here is that we are first going to
parse the whole CSV file and then after
requires will the host has to be found
to the memory with the widgets we are
going to Pewter right and that's the
whole goes for the whole collection okay
and then that's a refute the Ricoh again
for the whole CSV that we parse from the
witness that we filtered okay and we map
and then we just started drinking it
after all the steps are done okay which
means that if I have a large CSV file
like to chew the vines and to joke about
stuff you memory when they become backs
right and then we first future doing
that then just after a while we started
seeing those results with the one it's
okay so these are those are collections
so I'm going to do is that we want kind
of like as soon as I take the first
column from the sesame file I want in to
go downstream and be filtered and bitmap
and printed okay and we already have
this today and to do that we just need
to do true changes right the first one
is just we take in the out and we
replaced by string okay so the zip code
just replace amount by string and the D
string with legacy right some creative
computation is just expressing those
computations or source formations what
to do at the end we need to run hard
straight okay or convert one string to a
list or something here in just running
because I'm interested on the side
effects so as we're talking with this
code it's much better right because as
soon as I get the first yes the Lions
first density indirect parts and we're
going to say they should I figure it if
not and if I'm retaining them
keeping it I moved to map it and then
I'm going to already print a standard
output and then we're going to see the
data coming to my screen heads it is
processed and they're never going to
load this home to to go by extinct into
memory ok so this is really nice good
knife it's already there today we can
already use it so what we're talking
about collections replace the story
streams patty laziness we were talking
about the scene a little bit of
background which basis will be called
Haskell authorities in the next one
30:13 gives to us exactly that our
sources and our scenes they can be
emember collections and resources like I
know right so we we had and I will start
could be event so it could be we can
have a stream of data call me from a jet
event or you are connected to form a
foundational training you can connect to
something that is emitting stock values
right and that can be your source and
then you are getting this data and
processing it and Buddy it elsewhere
ok so we can do that to me what however
one we can't do is that all the
transformations that we have so far when
you look at stream filter mat take those
are also formations they are pretty
functional and why me better is that
they will use estate that they don't
polymer processes they are purely
functional right there is no sign of
that happening there everything is
seeing everything is happening as as it
comes right so this is good because if
our code does not have side effects our
code is a spirit
easier to understand and so on easier to
be done but it's limited so so far this
limitation of everything being release
function is good because we be sure that
our abstraction is good and it's
expressive we can express a bunch of
computations
he was this limitation for what to do
with adding some of the trees that move
leave these self-imposed limitations
what is me that we're able to start to
add the synchrony in two hours three
functions server to have these functions
that has they that have Isabella secret
so what does it mean give me an example
of such function stream merge
okay so let's treat merged is that it
can have two sources okay
for example one is agenda that stream
that events being the imagine event and
another star could be whatever is going
for my external input and I can merge
them and what is that it's going to look
at the not good way of doing is that it
would be masking right hey source one
who have something new so give it to me
he starts to you have something you give
it to me right so it's going to get data
from those two sources and it meet as
one source at the end okay but that's
the hard way to do it right you're not
going to be he to be pulling but what
what is that one has something that as
soon as this source has some data it's
going to push to something right to to a
process that don't want to for these
home so you're going to go into more
details okay about this and how it
worked so something that helps a lot
understand love those social zoom there
is a project that came from a man called
the RX project and it has those
fantastic graphics that explain what
what those operations could do so what
word does that resemble here we have two
sources okay so here we have a source
that is emitting those events and then
we here we have another source that is
meeting those events and after you merge
you can a single source
okay so and merge what we do is that it
let's do it
merges right so suppose we have the
first event here we can see that it's
going to be a meet
and then right for through our final
source and then we have another one the
other one now I get the first event from
this one and then we have just closed
ourselves
so how these kids can can can use for it
for example I may just give the example
from a foundational training it's over
you can have data coming from different
markets and you want to merge this data
come from different markets and put into
a simple source and process them as they
come ok so that's one very simple
example another example of functions we
could add that have to take the AMA
synchrony ok is M so we'll have
attendance is that it has presently this
case it has three different sources and
as soon as one sports emits an event I'm
going to pick that source as my single
source ok so you have 8 responses okay
one immediate twenty once time is twenty
another one with one animal zero but we
look here the first one to emit an event
was the one in the middle so what we do
is that from now we are just going to
emit events from our source in the
middle and we discard the events on the
other one
so how would it be useful you imagine
for example you want to you need to
communicate with two services those two
sources they give exactly the same data
but you always trying to elicit two
sources for liability for services
daemul to get the service from the other
this or you know what the one that is
fastest this is allowed to do exactly
that right and what you're most
connected to certain same the first one
to send the data is the one one because
the thing is duplicated I don't care
about the others so the first one that
starts leaving the data is the one I
care about instead what I want to use
okay so in there are other functions own
for know that things is that you can
check the our next project and they
from festive graphs you can actually
play your relative even move the marbles
around so long so it's fruity nice so we
saw a couple more examples right so
let's go back to our stream merge so
here we have the source one and we have
another source and want to merge them
together how will implement this merge
okay remember that those things are
sources okay so I already know how to
take values from from this first one so
I think of do is that I could say I will
create a new process to take the
patterns out from the source quality I
will create another process to take the
values from the Stars tube and then I'll
have a process here at the one that's
doing the merge just waiting for those
events to come from those two processes
so here's how this color to look like
very silikal just have any air so I have
the first function and then I need to
get the name of the current the current
process right so I'm going to start a
task for each source so here is a path
for the source mode and what I do is
that they just eat the events from the
source one and then I send to the parent
which is the one that's going to be
waiting for those events here in the
body so I know that some of you cannot
see it above this line so what we have
here the body just received that is
waiting for defense so for each source I
will start a test it meet the events to
the parent right and either parent and
receiving the scenes and then we start
emitting them what it looks like at the
end of the day is this okay so here is
our initial source we have a source
quality event the other ones they own we
are going to spawn paths that's going to
be getting the day events from those
sources okay and healthy in order to
work
in our process okay but if you look at
it we say this is not it's not very
efficient right because gender that is a
process it already knows how to send
events around okay why I'm making it go
through this task that then sends it to
merge okay it doesn't it's like
something's off
so what we are going to add we have this
business for all of our readiness to
have a new protocol called the
connectable protocol and what the
context of a protocol does is that it
tells it tells how one source can send
you fake consent events to another
source so in this case gentlemen if
you'd implements the connectable
protocol it knows like oh we want me to
send message to their parent okay I'm
going to do that for you you don't need
to create something internet eh for me
okay but if for some reason it doesn't
recommend a protocol then they're going
to have the intermediary task and we
need the task for the prefer working
with in-memory collections are they
don't know how to send messages so
sometimes you need the tasks but if
you'd implements the connect over call
we can start connecting those processes
and we start to see events flowing
around or flowing on our system right
when we can start reacting to those and
work on those so and we do yes sir
you're getting there so what is the
connector protocol I tell how to connect
processes and it specifies the
underlying messages for communication so
when we define the connection protocol
we are defined how processes they meet
the key change messages between them to
have this data flowing for system and
this is Lidia's into interaction where
we can start to design systems that are
more or more explicitly event-driven and
needed reason right
have data Kamini we're good to have good
abstractions for both right they can
that future them which already dude but
I can also no worse than send them to
different sources they are going to be
much more expressive when we are
thinking about data or reacting to
events that are going to our system to
leave for our season sergeant can you so
if you change her so actually if first
of all the legal the lack of application
right it's maybe has a sensor that is
emitting it has a facility being events
you can so start those things into
events right in there just that's the
source you just connect to it and say
hey I want to send this event now to
this gentleman to process or to this
thing that is going to you could have
one process is just get it before having
images you can get those images
processing them and save it to the
operating system
there's nothing here either you have
events control system and you're it had
very good very expressive framework for
composing work with those events right
and so the type of protocol tell how
processes they can connect each other is
going to define exactly how this
communication should happen and as we
saw if our process doesn't know about
international protocol it's going to
step on a task frame so everything is
going to be connected out-of-the-box
so and that's what we can do but the
most exciting and is not that but is
after we define how processes they
should communicate to each other to have
this information flow moving it allows
us to do a lot of inter system for
example it enables us to do pipeline
parallelism or it enables
to do easier LT of events for Agra sees
them those are the last sorry
it also enables Ravi and those are the
last two things for me to to to talk
about you know these these these idea
that are having private share of luxury
okay so let's stop while pipeline
parallelism it's all of my favorite
features on this whole we started okay
so we saw this gold right
we have CSV bars and we have coop tour a
map you need to and run and this is
called a trellis design one editor
process so there's one prospect read
takes the first density line and then we
filter and no math and they were print
but let's suppose that of this whole
pipeline here of of computations just be
parsed by far the day's Louis area
wouldn't it be nice if I could say I
want one process just to parse this as
if you fire and as soon as it get the
first line it's going to send a message
to this other and exit process that can
then filter map and print that's what I
won't be able to do and to do that we
just it won't change so we have this
code in order to start running the CSV
Park into another process we're just
going to add stream async okay and what
is really think that's going to get all
the motivations behind it right in which
this case is just discuss a few parts
and it's going to learn some other
process and because we have to learn how
those process completely I can have this
process through necessity parsing and
then send the data elsewhere that's
going to do the rest of the computation
okay so in this case with one stream is
think I have now two processes is
securing this pipeline and if Chesley
part is really slowest part we are going
to read the system
it's our they are going to run faster
this has to be parsley in three things
we do professor
but not only that if you have a large
pipeline right we can assert extremists
in every time and every time we deserted
whatever was before the up to the
beginning or between the pipelines it's
going to happen in some process so in
that we face okay we have like this
entity person start to then we as soon
as the first item is available we send
it to this process and this process
starts to include the second I think
while here's our the first and then when
this is done it sends to the next to the
next next one okay so keep because they
have this define this whole foundation
and other they're going to develop all
the details this is this is the gold
chest and oregano right when we start to
be able to do this kind of stuff
and to say he ain't can just say I'm
very used to be guilty all brothers and
then they can have they know flowing
from the system they can start to
explore more of powerfulness okay so
this is really cool so that was one
thing T is infinity is then I can also
start to become our altars okay and here
is even prouder so what I could do is
that oh I have those events coming and I
know the message right so what I can do
for them is that when it gets to the
altar they're always going to take some
specific action on it which action for
example it could broadcast for everyone
so if here we have the events one to
entry and the router knows how to
broadcast what it does that is just
going to send the event one to everyone
the event to those 21 to and the event
three goes revolution that's a
broadcaster out there but if you want
you can also do a round robin right so
it's a rather nice way to send the first
event today is the second to these that
turn to leave the parties and then we
start at the top again
and you go okay you could also do
charting okay this
maybe you are receiving the data and you
want data that has some particular they
or for a particular time you want it to
go to a particular processing process
right those are all processors so it's
loading to Charlotte you can look at the
event they're all I can look at them and
say hey this this event I know that you
want to send to this process so that was
one another the second comes here oops
the third is to the same again and the
fourth and so on
or it could be good forever right right
now let's just randomize and have the
next going everywhere and the way we're
going to do this is exactly this be
called general turn and the general is
going to be you know only P because it's
not really know be people's good to be
like any of the others or to be
behaviors well it's this Phi's we have
all the classical callback so I'm going
to be are the ones that we have just
serve and everything else it has three
callbacks handle up which is every time
you get a new connection there officer
Hanson says they run fairly interesting
new stuff very to call him the one every
time someone disconnects week we call
handle down and then we have handle
dispatch which helps backs what it does
that every time we receive an event
hello dispatch should say to to which
process this event should go so how it
works at hand of the specs will trigger
a list of promises that the event should
go for broadcast is the easiest one I
forgot radical form for our for
broadcast but if there's not
academically perfect in the beginning
just to have an idea but what what is
going to do is that is just all the
behind these that there are those you
just return them and you're going to be
able to send a
everyone before the sharding defenders
who can look at the event look at some
property and say hey for this property I
want to look at this other one and
they're all taken also and their plans
to shoot with major alters so we
relationship with our author that
already does broadcast because we don't
ever want to be reimplemented all the
time we are like the shipping was wrong
robbing but it also want to ship robbers
that are based on probes so for example
instead of using and of the peanuts out
here I want to send the message to the
process that has the the smaller message
queue right because they're only work if
I don't which is the one that's less
busy that's the one where I want to
Center I want the route to send the
event to write and eventually pled for
overloaded if I mean if I want to be
with if I can able to be able to say all
the processes are busy okay so don't
don't mind sent and data overload and
then we can you can either feed off
bring back pressure and making the time
fail or just discard the data right
because we whether we're talking about
overload need to choose between or imply
back pressure or start to throw the data
otherwise Isis is going to be forever
and overload and start to draw but
they're all going to be a pattern that's
really going to enable us to do this
okay so what is the path forward right I
said all the schemes are ready even so I
guess what I wanted to show here at some
point I know it became very specific was
the design process you start for the
foundations and then here at the end
it's hard to see what are the benefits
that we started to rewrite we can it
come with a a grounding abstraction that
can be variable we can start talking
about pipeline parallelism another
interesting stuff so we start with
collections okay and at some point we
added business okay and it's very hot
right now so he said let's start any
hurry because if secretly will make us
think about how those process they need
to communicate in fact each other and
then these theories already useful right
the stream words and stream and and all
those other functions very useful their
own and we can find interesting these
cases for them but then the bar
department starts to get really excited
we start saying he not have pipeline
parallelism and this is kind of our
focus for a 1-up tree but it doesn't
stop here because naturally pipeline
partly we can think about data colonies
okay like I have the data and I want to
send is there and spin around in more
interesting ways basically in itself we
can start talking about a distribution
what if I have so much you need to come
into my system then to start sharing it
between machines okay so it's it's it's
a little broom but if you hear me to
have a lot of fun in the process
okay so so I think that was what I
wanted to do to share the plants so just
protecting everyone that's right an
exterior goal tomorrow to look for we
have one up walk and we'll let you
coming out it's already well define we
have a good idea feedbacks is to
optimizes it's well defined what its
student changebase a feedback so let us
know about anything there and then with
one country we want to start to go into
this direction I could not have done
this talker could not have done any of
this research if it was a car company
other contacts I'm really thankful that
we decided to do do this decision three
and a half years ago of creating an
exterior and working one of the things
that and this year we're starting to be
even more active as a company with the
whole community so the it also needs and
we launched an accelerator so if you
haven't signed up that this is a
newsletter that tells our is
in a community and we want to launch a
jobs section soon so if you want to hire
a little developers let us know please
send me an email or just being powerful
attack get in touch okay and let us know
and we can discuss because good start
shipping with some higher anything
developers who is so we can give that
the ability to because there are a lot
of developers innocent in being even
more active in a committed itself that's
it Thank You word adventure
how far you comedy you on the work this
one really wants is directed part so how
far are the work it's a lot of Google
Documents not so good prototypes that's
the stage we are right now so I don't
have anything to show and to allow
people to play me but the planets
obviously to be kept there before an
allow the community to terminate right
it's not going to be surprised I carry
it's there now there is going to be a
good period first get feedback and
people to run it into production to and
running your system because that's the
most important part in to also get
production feedback into this stuff
the authorities and this reminds me of
Matthews and doin it away so yes it so
one of the things it comes back to
MapReduce are probably going to have
MapReduce related operations at some
point and it doesn't get a lot from the
top because the loop is its own base but
here I am you're looking a lot at what
sparked us and what start us and
bringing ideas from there one of the the
biggest challenge that I didn't enter
into detail here but can you go back to
this one of the biggest challenge all
this and it's mostly what is holding
this back is how to do back pressure
okay so remember when I said that when
we have that first pipeline then the
role that work okay okay so we're gonna
set this whole pipeline that we never
load the whole says b5 into memory we
have one by one okay imagine that what
we thought was wrong that the CSV parts
not a slow part this has to be is
actually fast so if you have this weak
parse in SSB file and sending data
faster than this other part can consume
what is going to happen at at some point
if this is first loop we're going to end
up holding again the whole sensitive
file into memory okay and so we need to
think a lot about that pressure and how
big do to have this stuff are we would
say hey slow down or they start throwing
some data out because I cannot handle
this and a lot of inspirations come
exactly from projects that were born
kind of Auto to run Hadoop group bright
lights forms spark this one yeah very
good question take more questions I
think the Bible system
know the rules so given what you've just
said about the backpressure what's the
other end of doing that so why would you
not want to make that a default value
rather than something explicitly
required if so what is the overheads so
if if you can do it really really fast
to you your would have this overhead of
passing messages around and creating
processes and then they don't want it
right so so a lot of these requirements
fermenting and finally not where is the
place that is worth splitting if you
have like a small collection if you have
a CSV file is 10k you don't need to
spawn this pipeline and pouches shorter
events so that's one of the things right
if I have just something small just
right the goal will be produced any of
this complexity because it's not working
but at the minute you start to have
large beads or if seem to be afraid
because if you're receiving data from
the
the stock market that's infinite right
they're going to you know if there are
the earth and everything around for
centuries and if you're already higher
than the medics if you're also going to
earn for centuries and it's never going
to stop so you will also want start
taking herbal teas because it's data
coming on the time and this is vargas
work so it's kind of it's as I showed
the progression is the next step so we
start with collections if that's fine
good then you go to laziness that's fine
sorry you started collections that's
fine stained collections don't even
service business but then introduced
laziness and that's fine stand places we
say we they that's not enough then you
start going down and then a that's one
of the exciting things because the Attic
Syria in the air they perform is one of
the few where we can start for the
collections and go step by step to
eventually catch distribution right and
it's the same cool purchased your coat
is growing a little bit with you as your
your local girls or Arabic Asian girls
so that's nice
yeah
so there is a skeletal project that was
in research project and so it's the part
I didn't talk in his talk because their
third they had a little bit of pipeline
parties but they're in focus was data
parallelism and we have an entrance
there but there is a whole other set of
features in discussion where you're
saying I have this data what is the best
way to practice data around and compute
something really fast so we can probably
borrow a lot of the ideas I don't think
we can use their implementation in any
way that because they don't have
protocols they're going to be talking to
connectible things so the question is
when distribution comes on this path and
it's not shown here the purpose
convinced me it's down the line right
will eventually get there so what you
get is a day when the coast is tribution
want to start doing things across limits
you can do what we do today we've you
know because you can have a deserver and
running across little to send messages
all right that's two words these those
are like higher than abstractions the
low level abstractions already there and
what that experience is that we also
have the best supervisors so you just
won't put on some fee you can check
elimination we already have this way to
say here will deter on this path in his
honor machine and that's what we are and
yes so that's a very good question I
mean II think there should be a very
good example because we can just be
connected to several military
republishing can handle you know
hundreds of thousands of connections are
we in some connections right so we can
recall this face and apartment when he
asked about the lab level iterate is an
idea so what is coming from if you want
to contribute on those devices right as
actually as a event stream right the our
offense enter into your system and
there's a chance that likely want to
merge all of them right into into a
single main right and you can be like oh
and at some point I want to route have
different sources so from this data
coming I want to send to one process
that's going to log statistics about of
data because I want to know however when
the device are compacting after days and
stuff but is eventually to go and so
somewhere that is maybe the device these
are applying in some input so it needs
to go to other stuff so I mean it fits
well as idea
you know have many things have a bunch
of sources of data coming to the system
and if it works well the complaints are
placed on the
yeah so that's that's a very point that
I think the the products as far as far
they are exporting as actually this part
like if you can send less data wrong or
look even at how you can find because
sometimes there's no maybe you need to
send a neuron so how you can find the
best apology for a system that minimizes
data going around because the times that
we want to be - that even locally right
if you can have everything running so
you have dating one core if you can
minimize the data going for different
cars and you can use the local patch so
that's that's definitely at some point
in to tackle that right because
otherwise we want to be competitive
right people do be able to do they will
go elsewhere they we're going to find
solutions that are faster and so on but
it is one of the part that again it's
it's kind of a hat we will eventually
need to do to think how to do it one of
the complications and is that if how
much of our link goes it's easy to send
later we can send the code around if
they have a like the same version and
that's one of the publications that can
have this set up it would be really good
if it was easier to you know to say hey
I stomp this know and those are the
communications are we to do and I could
send the competition when the dog starts
because as I said the competition is
super lightweight compared to the data
and and then we can send the data and
have all send another application and
make it easier to to to send stuff round
so that maybe explore that it's
somewhere down the line my biggest focus
here we're thinking about this stuff but
the biggest focus here is to get the PI
point
because yar when we first need to start
using the cars before we go to the next
step high price politics perfect design
not when there's nothing but there's no
that's a very question
so right now so the one I want is remove
is getting out which of the access
protocol and you cannot think of
anything right now
so yeah so there was that are going out
I kind of said in the talk because as a
stat I'm probably as all of us here
we're really excited when or removing
coats so we find removing coat or a
clothespin to remove any worse that's me
to talk about it so that the stop we
said about the SS protocol it's going to
be slowly phased out again respecting
that parts of ability as stash stickers
it's also going out all the validations
Maps but I think those are didn't chew
these words we were yeah Eric can you
