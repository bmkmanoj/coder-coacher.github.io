as the headline of the talk so before I
started maybe a question has anybody
here running into this situation in the
past where he felt like okay acid would
it be really nice now like all right
thanks so it's quite some people
understand immediately why acid
especially in a time when we hear a lot
about no sequel and everybody probably
has tried some no sequel then all of a
sudden can be something that we were
used to in the past but now it's not a
given anymore so that whole project that
i'm talking about al vault is also on
github you could check it out and play
with clay around with it on the side
while i'm introducing the concepts that
are behind it and I want to dedicate the
talk to Gustav who is not here now who's
a great colleague and would love to be
here I guess so for me the discovery of
Volta via actually was happening on a
quest to looking for the perfect game
server I had worked on a pretty
audacious MMO project we had
successfully implemented a lot of
interesting stuff and had Java as a back
end and that Java server was talking to
a very vanilla my sequel set up extended
with some memcache t caching operation
that if you thought through it was just
not sane it kind of worked kind of saved
the day but after that experience I went
on a research to find out what could be
proper solution to the stuff that we had
encountered and yeah that's as as he
already heard was the beginning of that
journey that I'm now in
and doing for the fourth year and
thinking and also working as a lead
software engineer at summit where we're
doing a payment stack for credit card
payment and using along there for
another type of high security high
reliability situation and to understand
how to create the driver for volta be
for Ellen I also became the maintainer
of e my sequel for a certain time until
somebody much better than me took over
and just to be very clear al vault is
simply the name for the native along
volte be driver that I programmed
throughout the last few years and it's
open source it's part of the official
distribution of faulty be and it's also
used in production successfully at
companies that are what I'm hearing
quite happy about it in my view volte be
an airline who I kind of found
independently of each other are a scale
dream team and I would like to try to
explain how they are special how multi
be special when working together with
Ellen how does it actually look how can
how can you how does the source look and
answer the question if it is for you and
meets the use cases that you might have
so talking about ball to be it started
with a great idea certainly and part of
al valle was programmed on a tropical
island at least that was the plan and
some source codes also actually were
created there and that's actually not
the creamier although it looks like it
but I think it also looks very much like
treasure island and in the end we even
discovered it was apparent I Pirate
Island actually of course there are many
other things you could do you can hike
and you can bath and it's that's pretty
warm it's pretty sunny and at some point
I started to to create this cartoon
which summed up my dilemma that tropical
island and you can do that on cm x ì
óù
and I'm sure you all know XKCD and I
send that over to the vault eb guys and
especially the CTO ryan he just loved it
because both TB of cause was also
founded on a great idea and when they
started out it was probably a given that
it should be a database that is doing
the best that's possible with horizontal
partitioning and that was just said out
at the start and then they had something
there that was single threat execution
that for airline we all know very well
how to work with that just working on
the fact that a single thread cannot
race itself and on top of that they had
a very beautiful idea about a kind of
rhythmic distribution of task around the
nodes so that they would have a kind of
heartbeat that would make sure that the
individual threads that are working on
different nodes on the horizontally
partition tables would not step on each
other's toes the man who drove that
invention was Mike Stonebreaker and he's
a very outspoken guy he's on the
database business since a very long time
he's the guy who was behind ingress he
also created post grace girl and at some
point he said it's time for a complete
rewrite and one size doesn't fit all
anymore so what resulted from that were
were Vertica and vol TV and vertica is a
vertically partitioned database and volt
ibiza horizontally partitioned database
there's a very good paper that i can
only recommend to read and the link is
down there called h stored PDF that's
the research where it originally came
from so what is faulty be in a nutshell
i'd like to describe it as red as plus
sequel plus scaling
sorry and the beauty of it is it's in
memory and that means it's incredibly
fast but it keeps sequel and it even
keys acid which can be very important
and because of the way that it uses a
cluster of course it has the expectable
ways of replication and meanwhile in
version four it also has a elasticity so
you can add additional power while it's
running if you're online you can you can
actually try elbow out pretty fast this
is how you could just clone volte be
clone al gold compile them and let them
run and i also created it just lets down
there the URL if you want to note that
where you can read the instruction on
how to play around while i'm going into
details what you would do with you what
you would see if you try that out is
simply at a certain point vault eb
starts then you would see a benchmark
that i will explain a little more in
detail later executed and in the end you
would see your local results for what
well to be can do on your computer using
it as one node so what are the use cases
for balti beam from a business
perspective vol TB is positioned where
big data like really big data has to be
a queried for answers as fast as
possible where data coming comes in and
you want to be able to say within
seconds of what the current status is of
course this is a way to avoid my sequel
clusters that are just not saying or
other constructs that might for example
be great to have a map reduced stuff but
isn't as fast and his ins from the
architecture as well suited there is
also the strategic flexibility that
comes with ball to be because it is not
in a way
fixed in the architecture like you have
it if you are deciding for a no sequel
set up where you have to make very
far-reaching decisions very early on now
from the production perspective it
mainly takes the takes the pain out of
scaling and that's really what's
happening and scaling and credibly well
you have the speed of in memory which is
80 times faster than for example my
sequel and you have the good parts of
sequel still although it has a lot of
features that you would usually find in
no sequels where they positioning
themselves and this is a graphic from
volte B is at that spot where the data
is really fresh the idea here with this
graph is from the left to the right you
have increased age of data and from the
button to the top the value of the data
increases so if data comes in you can
have situations and discharge where you
say okay the pressure the data is and
the faster I can make a analysis of the
data the higher the value and that makes
vaults interesting for situations where
you have necessity to have answers
within milliseconds or hundreds of
seconds and it's not necessary that I
the right choice if you have minutes or
hours to have the results of your
statistics then you might want to use
other tools so that is the complete
landscape where you can see Hadoop on
the right side you see traditional RDBMS
on in the middle at the bottom and you
see both to be there in the corner where
velocity in high skoo pud would be at
home so the use case is definitely high
throughput it's fast operations on
high-value data and it's also resilience
to failure when using very normal
commodity hardware both TB itself and
that's also a parallel to a long may be
here ltb itself is a hundred percent
acute oriole open source project
we're just driven by volte being and
that's that's also good I mean because
you have the chance to have high value
support it is really moving forward
there are no gaps in development because
somebody has no time or so and it is
absolutely made for oltp like we just
said online transactions fast and cheap
rights high throughput that's where it's
at home if you look at cap and or
getting oriented about where it's in
that category it's probably on the ca
side although stone breakers arguing
that Kappas may be misleading here and
well TBH is really all three if you have
other advantages that i'll come to this
there's also one thing that will t be in
my views even more sequel than sequel
because it's cleaner than it allows more
cleanliness and separation of the data
compared to if you for example use my
sequel the parallels between erlangen
volta PF i'm very interesting because
they're coming from a very similar
corner so to say they both made for a
concrete need they're both made for
distribution they made for multi-core
and there are truly different approaches
to what has been there before they are
based on hardware parallelism they're
not like many other products now
stumbling into an environment where all
of a sudden you have hardware that is
not getting faster / cpu anymore but
just gets more and more cores and as a
result they're really substantial
improvements above what other products
can give you what is also may be
interesting is that vol TB is not so
well known but people that I talk to
that actually have the problem that ball
TB is good for solving usually know it
and that's very similar to Alan where I
can still run into people who are fresh
from the University who never heard
about airline but those who are in fact
working on problems that are close to
the heart of Ellen are usually knowing
it ball TB has quite a lot of customers
meanwhile also in the gaming sector as I
said and I would like to go into the
individual features again in memory we
had that ball TB does deliver the same
speed in a way that in-memory databases
like writers can deliver but at the same
time it's fully replicated it's fully
disk assistant who knows about the
details knows that in the end you even
have to have the right hardware
controller the artist controller to be
really fully disk persistence since the
first version ball TV hasn't improved a
lot on that angle talking about sequel
maybe not anymore now but 22 years ago
so sequel started to be a real dirty
word and the thing that has to be kept
in mind is that sequence may be flawed
and how its syntax is but its extent
essentially it's math and whatever you
use to formulate certain relationships
and data what it boils down to
semantically is always going to be very
close to what sequel office you what I
started to mention before that well do
is actually more sequel than sequel
sometimes that's because if you optimize
stuff sometimes you would for example
have an array that you know it's always
going to be in the joint so I can make
it a dictionary and have it in memory
and it's going to be so much faster and
I don't have to put it in all the
queries and then you end up having a
faster application but it's also harder
to maintain because then when the data
structure changes then you have to
change it into areas somebody else who
needs to learn it has to understand
about the heck that you put into your
application and with well to be
what they are doing is so fast at any
rate that you can just leave it in the
joint you cannot even optimize it that
way and therefore I realized that we
were actually designing tables for wal
TV some of the heck's that you almost
automatically tend to do with Volta me
don't make any sense and you can just
leave it as it is and what results is a
cleaner interface between the cleaner
separation of concerns between your
application server say in the database I
was too with cap I mentioned that
Stonebraker argues it can be very
misleading because certain kind of
catastrophic events are not so relevant
anymore networks are now highly
consistent and Otto brewer came back to
captain 2012 and restated some of his
earlier proposals about the the
distributed choice you have to make
which in cap means you have usually this
side that you only take two out of three
with acid that is something that I think
was for me the most important thing to
really look deeper into vol to be when I
realized that much of what I can find
and other products is base or eventual
consistency and that has a lot to do
with your problem domain if your problem
that you have to solve has some shape
like double bookkeeping you probably
need acid and something that does not
usually have that is for example if you
serving websites our just tracking
individual users they don't have
anything to do with each other they have
no real interchange maybe for a certain
constellation of a website and then you
have total parallel T so to say if data
is completely separate and you might not
need acid in fact and if somebody does
something strange with its own shopping
cart and just fires
lots of commands from separate browsers
that are all open on his account you
don't care then he just might lose some
books that are in the shopping cart
because he's he's just playing around
but coming back to games again if you
have something where one player is
giving another player something and you
cannot have the situation that all of a
sudden that sword that the one player
gives the other player exists twice and
your system or is getting lost or they
have bought virtual items that can also
not be duplicated by an arrow and the
software or shouldn't at least then you
have something like double bookkeeping
and if you have that requirement then
what you need is really acid and that's
really hard to emulate with a database
that does eventual consistency so that
for me was definitely a point where
volte be became so much more attractive
what is really going on how can what we
do this what I'm just introducing yours
features so looking at four different
main architectural decisions they made
first of all as I said ball TB is
horizontally petitioning the data that
means the tables are stored on a vigil e
different machines and they are simply
hashed on their primary key so that one
entry goes on that server when other
entry goes on that machine another entry
goes on that machine and that is also
used for what they call case safety
that's replication of the data so that
it doesn't only go here but there's a
replica also going there so that if that
server goes down there's also a separate
copy on another server what they are
using for making it work to have tables
being horizontally divided is the fact
that many real use cases turn out to be
snowflake structures and the data if you
take a simple example if you have
customers and
those customers have addresses and
orders and invoices and coworkers you
always have the primary key of the
customer in the center of the snowflake
and the snowflake can branch out and you
can have other items of orders that are
then again dependent so to say on that
one customer but in the end they're all
really sensibly grouped to that one
customer so that a central PK has to be
identified and then you design your
entire database in a way that you say
okay everything that belongs to that
snowflake should end up on the same
server and then there's some data that
is not really part of that snowflake for
example it could be your product because
they are so to say in a different
dimension they are not dependent on the
PK of the customer and you have maybe
100 or a million products that live on
different tables that cannot be grouped
to that snowflake and that's fine and
what happens then is that vault eb
partitions everything it can everything
that is dependent on that main primary
key into the individual machines using a
hash and the data that is not part of
the snowflake is replicated across every
server and the beauty of that is that if
you think it's true very often in real
examples something for example like the
product numbers or the product entries
in a database it makes a lot of sense to
replicate them across all service
because they are usually changing very
infrequently compared to customer data
or order data and when they change well
TBH takes over the job to synchronize
the change across all individual service
that's completely transparent that's
architecture allows it to make
transactions on individual snowflakes
usually within one machine and that's
really the goal if you have a
horizontally partitioned database what
you want to achieve is that you can
complete an entire transaction on one
machine another way that volta v
achieves very high speed is using baked
in store procedures and for that ball TB
I am tending to say unfortunately uses
Java so a stored procedure involved abhi
is something that's not quite as cheap
as for example my sequel but you have to
wrap it in a little bit of Java this is
all it's not very much it's also pretty
simple and the reasons obvious I mean in
the end they are using these procedures
and compiling them into the server you
can also shoot at hoc queries and bypass
this but to really have high speed and
high velocity you would have to be able
to know what queries you will need and
formulate them like this in a Java class
and then compile them into the server
what you have then is a server that
ideally has baked in very fast native
transactions so to say and execute them
and a single thread having ideally all
data that it needs available on one
machine and that is something that is a
usual Allen technique I would say that
if you have a resource that is
potentially the victim of race you
usually use one process to use it as a
funnel to govern that resource and every
other process has to go through that
process to be able to access it and
that's very much the same philosophy
that ball to be users here where they
have one thread per petition
and they try to separate the workload in
a way that on each individual
transaction it's one thread that is
doing the nth interaction and one goal
and that's very very different from
what's going on in usual sequels that
are created to have one thread Oh to
have one transaction being executed with
yielding to other transactions in the
meantime and then coming back x and
continuing the execution because it
might have to wait for the hottest will
respond or there's some other reason
that it first has to gather all the data
that it needs to complete and that's one
of the main differences where vol TB has
been designed in a way that's absolutely
different from what was there before
what they can do through that is
throwing away as they say seventy-five
percent of what a usual dbm usually does
because they are putting away with
locking and latching and buffer
management and they just stay with that
paradigm that they try to share that
they try to intelligently share the work
on the individual machines in a way that
they can be executed in one so that was
another steak finger I discovered these
and I didn't really understand how to
how to change the figures so I started
to combine stick figures and XKCD style
so to say with dinosaur comics and that
that was one result here and actually
it's when I asked Joe I'm strong if he
would review a vault he said yeah you
can do that and the little later I came
back and he was like oh I get
sidetracked I sorry I programmed my on
my time management program so I sent
that to ryan too and he didn't think it
was funny so I have a question who here
has programmed his own time management
program nobody no that's funny so Ryan
said it's not funny because everybody
does
so using it using a volte be with a lang
this is how it looks if you call a
procedure in this case that insert there
is not the sequel insert but it's the
java class insert for this example it's
just to be very clear here it's not that
you write sequel there in parentheses
but you call java classes that you have
programmed as I earlier showed this
select class but nevertheless what
happens then on the alongside is just
this it's very very short and this is a
complete example where you initiate the
connection to the database then you call
a stored procedure in this case it's
called select in the middle there and
then you get the table and you get a row
and you get a string out of that row
there's no concept of having streamed
results because in OTP you'd usually a
very short rights and very short reads
and in the end this type of very short
writes and reads is also what I use for
a benchmark that I will come to you in a
minute if you look at wal TV if you look
at Al vault you'll find more examples in
the examples folders folder and you find
the benchmark source in the bench eral
in the bench directory so at a certain
point I did a benchmark trying to find
out how fast this driver is the drivers
native there's no see in it and I had
earlier done a benchmark for nodejs that
had that is in part in program than has
been programmed in c so i was very
excited to see that the allen drivers
actually as fast as the nodejs driver
and i can only guess but i think that
probably the very nice syntax of the
airline office and bit pausing and
protocol pausing which is a lot what of
what a driver actually
just bits and by its highly compressed
coming from the server going to the
server are that Ellen is very good at
optimizing that and it can actually be
even faster than what you do with see so
the benchmark itself is using a staple
of a ball TB that is in almost every
benchmark they are using and it's a TV
contest voter example the ideas you have
millions of colors they're all calling
in at the same time in a very small time
window there's a very small set of
candidates that they can vote on and
essentially you just have to have make
sure that everybody just votes once and
doesn't phone in dozen times and every
caller caller can of course be
identified by his telephone number so I
tried that using Amazon ec2 cluster
instances that makes it something that
everybody can pretty much try out
himself in this case my results was 877
transactions per second because those
transactions are even four or even six
operations depending on how you count it
that makes three point five operations
per second in a way the more interesting
number in this case may be that I had
26,500 sections per second per cpu core
as this gives you some idea how much
hardware you might need for a given task
it was pretty nice to say to see that
Alan of course kept stable under
overload even things didn't crash and
when the overload was diminished again
it just kept going for this benchmark
these are the tables pretty simple you
have a constant that is who you can vote
for you have individual votes they are
identified by the phone number and then
you have area codes for
individual states to make it a little
more interesting and add another look up
to show how fast well DB really is the
four operations that you have our this
every transaction such that every vote
goes through this for things you look at
the consciousness number you see if it's
a valid number then you look at whether
it has already voted this telefonom has
already voted before then you check the
area code that the water comes from and
if everything is okay then you record a
vote the sequel statements that vault eb
offers are not the entire sequel range
there are the usual suspects so to say
you can delete you can injure it you can
select you can update you can create
indexes tables and views which is quite
interesting because for example that
benchmark was using a materialized view
to be able to have immediate results so
that whenever you wrote the materials
view was updated immediately so you
always could query the status there are
sequel functions that you can use in my
and volte we are like this what is
missing and it's quite clear why our
ranges in where queries because of the
way that you have to go across the
entire cluster so to say to find ranges
that's something that will to be is not
good at then what we add extensions to
sequel and they are for creating
procedures and they are for managing the
partitions to make procedures local tour
petition or using multiple partitions
and the same is true for tables so
wrapping up here are resources this
flight is going to be these slides will
be on the internet hopefully
in a format that your computer will be
able to read you have here the downloads
where you can find all vault itself
faulty be and also a more detailed
description about the benchmark where
you have pretty much everything you need
to try it yourself there are also more
examples and there's the file that I
quoted earlier about the philosophy that
originally kicked off the development of
faulty be if you have any questions I'll
be happy to take them now but also don't
hesitate to write to me please and
follow me on twitter I'll be talking
more about what we are using for this
for which is the game server stack which
is quite interesting consolation also
using Lua to program the game logic in
and faulty be has a forum that's worth
checking out if you try stuff the vaulty
big guys are really really nice we're
really cool check out the forum and ask
your questions there if you would like
to so are there any questions please
sorry can you speak up I said can t you
sorry do you have a microphone for the
question no so maybe just come up please
very cool things
thank you I just wondering speak to like
blowing this cluster as far as you
should use right it's not as easy to use
as my sequel you have to do some
planning because you have to identify
which is your main primary key which how
is your snowflake actually looking it
doesn't take very long though and it's
also quite informative quite interesting
because you understand your data better
and it helps the abstraction as I said
what we found it's even cleaning up your
design at some point where you I found
it's it's almost a habit that you should
start to optimize stuff even before you
write it down cleanly in database design
so then you have to write those wrappers
in Java which you have to do well to be
is offering a tool though that you can
translate existing my sequel tables with
to vol TV tables I have never tried that
I have to say but they are obviously
working there they also have a command
line tool that's very much working like
my sequel command line tool to be able
to access your data and play around with
it and initially volta viewers that was
very inflexible how you could access
your data but meanwhile they have
understood that customers want it to be
agile and be able to shoot queries
whatever with whatever comes to mind
which in my view is very important
especially when you're developing thanks
other questions
anything comes to mind sure I heard the
first part in not the second there's
there are multiple steps there i would
like to initially well TBH the guys and
sister to be in memory and that's it you
know like google is a memory basically
so they never saw that stuff its
replicated if a server goes down there's
another replication there so you don't
have to store it on disk and people
really didn't like that and i think it's
also for developing it's really hard to
use then i think they were I believe
they were lucky because they discovered
that there's this rhythmic scheduling of
the transactions that I mentioned
earlier always gave them a time gap that
was excellently suited for writing away
the current memory into on disk so they
found that they had created a time
window there that they had to use at any
rate for the scheduler that was just
excellent to to create disk resistance
and then they worked on that to the
point that now what I understand it's a
hundred percent dispositions and you can
of course you have to have the right
disk controllers is that really give you
the okay only after its persistent and
it does cost you a little bit of
velocity if you insist on having that ok
back instead of just the okay of that it
is stored in memory but essentially the
trick is that there is this gap at any
rate and they use that to write stuff to
disk and that's why it can be incredibly
fast and still disk persistent
stairway on the client side to specify
that I am interested in to success
responds only after the deities where we
persisted yes there is you can switch
that more questions
I'll be happy to answer them okay yeah
so once you've gone to the exercise of
figured after snowflake and letting
cluster
you mean the part where your data
structure evolves or where you add more
hardware ok so i ask i start with you a
question the hard way with multi before
now you can net service on the fly that
means that the hashing is not quite as
simple as anymore as it was it used to
be a real static hash and that's it
which was quite elegant that doesn't
work for elastic scaling so that has
become a little more sophisticated there
but now you can add hardware on the fly
and answering the first the this thing
with the snowflakes and yes it's it's
parallel to another fact that it seems
that people found that real data like
real warehousing data is in the area of
two gigabytes as a magnitude that means
that since some time now and only since
sometimes but we are now at a point
where all data can be kept in run and
that was not so before because the
requirements of actual business didn't
really change so much during the last
like the essence of what's happening on
the business side didn't really change
as much as hardware capabilities
increased and with the snowflake it's a
similar thing that's not maybe something
that comes up first if you think about
your data structure but even if your
data evolves as I said there is always
data that's not part of the snowflake
but the likeliness that it is in the
snowflake is probably very high and the
likeliness that you business all of a
sudden does not have the customer as
main snowflake primary key anymore is
pretty low
