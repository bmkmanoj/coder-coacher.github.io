fledge talk the last one to follow
dining talks we have this this topic so
we went we want to talk about you what
is a charge to local paper journey and
originally the Sidious back from talk
between us because we are running the
local user group in Hamburg that we
should do a talk about that and then I
saw the papers this conference and I was
just putting this stuff together then as
someone who goes to conference on a
regular basis to tend to forget about it
and then I got this example the guide
idea what do you don't remember how are
we good particles oh yeah so no here the
slides are still still born from
yesterday but the talk we repaired it
pretty well I hope you will take at
least meadow my name is Mona vecheras
let's do er again we are from Hamburg we
brought a few or having us here so yeah
that's it happiness searching and you
can find us on Twitter which is probably
the best way to reach us tweet city
pictures of us doing silly enhancements
all right all right so enough about us
about you right who he is running user
running one hand too awesome ok we
appreciate them who here is attending
user groups in your local skaters
awesome it's almost everyone that's
great pretty good to see and the one
who's know at the moment and then the
techniques take away without an
attending
there is not we hope we have something
finish right and even if your which is
not at authorizing maybe ourselves
something for you because of me step up
as an organizer and approve your local
so to start the story I have to jump
back we're getting up 2015 it was in
Sandusky Ohio it was kind of warm ish we
had 22 degrees Fahrenheit which is for
that area at that time and it wasn't
cold a great conference in the US it's
really putting lots of that blog on that
there in the Midwest also I saw hardwood
elixir this was the first kind of salt
I'll get in touch with that with that
community of the language and really
hooked me up so I decided that I want to
learn so what it did was at the event
the we was jumping in at the
getting started tutorial and then
learning more question through it but I
would consider myself a user could you
back so i decided that i do not want to
do it like all my own right I knew right
we can aim that I want to
to share my learning right the community
where I can go so we're going to have
the city questions why can I do you know
all of this this stuff and talk about
hammer that's really one one confession
i have to make and one thing I have to
share I know how many of you have been
there how many of you have been like
into the tech community there and I
think the tech of reading a book sucks
relief that is almost I know there's
almost nothing and the crew people we
have they tend to go for Berlin ready
are they leave for us what I need for
Simmons is gold and the lead for all the
complexities and they do not tend to
stay number and I want to change that I
love the city my wife is there my
family's hermano que decir and I don't
want to leave but I still want to live
in the city which has a tech community
which is a vibrant tech community right
I know I can make American Francisco
just with the flip of her fingers but at
least I can make it a bit more quite a
bit more about I wonder what I wanted to
be like so I had the idea of finding on
farming creating the elixir user group
in hammer because we didn't happen there
was a beam user group much I don't want
you to expect there who keep you reread
but they didn't have something going on
for a few months at least removing half
a year and I was like a coaching game if
we want to have my forces or revive it
or whatever and he did not ask her in
two days and I requirements so i was so
excited
stuff that just kicked it off it just
did it Asif one of the basic user group
right away when farming means i created
media that was like really the epiphone
so so i knew two things about you and
there was not much but I know that I
didn't want to make it like small
conferences because I hit that really a
lot of people expect when they go to a
user group that they have like a
full-fledged agenda with red star fox
you know famous speakers which present
and also topic under here and I don't
want to know like lives I think user
groups showed me something from users of
an end drama queen recording it's not me
we have like this where we can do a
conference sing but this is not a good
break and I think it's okay to
distinguish and the other thing I knew
from from experience I have a gift for
that was i was attending the first
combing of a napper and they had around
100 people showing up and the guy who
was run again he was a really nice guy
but he was not you know he wasn't
program like us he was not it was not a
video that was something he didn't
really know like expect 100 people shout
out so basically happen like he was
asking the wrong was done some go before
and there were like three hands 100
people and they said oh I show you some
girl and he went out to snap door and
opened up the night night the tutorial
he was problem programming from hundred
people what happened is like after
spends almost everyone i dropped out of
committee because it did not happen with
me and i know i did not understand thing
it was a horrible experience and I think
it's not his hole but I show the user
group like after that it took them like
it hot a year or six eight months to
recover so the next one else I had like
five people which was probably do anyone
showing hands because they knew it so it
exists new and we will see a lot of
people who have never done it before but
people who are actually and what
interest in doing it so we cannot do
move the typical things the Rubies
removed us for example right so when you
share with you and Ruby user group it's
it's known that everyone who is their
nose all right or at least like good
bunch and maybe using it works and this
is not something we do not expect it for
the Dixie so this two ideas of my I knew
that I cannot work because I don't know
myself you know I was not good at
organizing I am really bad at speaking
in front of people which is where to now
I mean you get the one right it's a
different thing organization group so i
can live here in New York leah is not a
premiere I think it's okay to say that
she's
she's an HR coach at she has people
intervals I think that's great um I
thought we can make like this can be the
wood fire for the years ago right she
could be the one who's like giving the
youth group this pin I wanted to have so
I was pitching the idea to her and yeah
and for me it was totally different
because the HR community in her work is
going really great it's kind of small
siren noises about each other there are
a lot of good people in there and we
know the other people they like to talk
don't have to do business there so it's
always interactive and so had a lot of
my dears said sure I do know that so
firm it was ok let's get the next you
things start again for me it's more like
he has so much of years and two guinea
pigs prefer to try something council was
really good measure so we started our
first or personal person tough and we
didn't know what to expect we had
something like
I don't know people would be horrible
and on the other hand is maybe we are
sitting there we go to the big rooms so
we create something or a shotgun method
that will work with every every wrong
people at the other people showing up on
the first wall and we had a lot of
movies that were what about next year
and some people who believe work with it
already and it was really nice nice next
March and what we did we asked people
what they expect of the meter why did
they come I like to know and the sunset
yeah we'll get to that this kind of
immigrant entertainment and mr. doing us
it's mostly starting an alright examples
will be petitioning and but we also have
this attacked part and we have a lot of
big bang for that and like to show you
some of the methods we use here's the
first one we don't cut us maybe know
that small exercises that are
really not an easy tool to solve other
so in compliance and the main idea here
is that there are people who can teach
and maybe improve the teaching skills
and at the other end they're working you
like to learn and the great opportunity
for them to really get into it it's also
slightly so they always have small
groups of people sit around packing
stuff and what we never saw so far
someone sitting in a corner and do
nothing or just portugal's believe it's
really great to see them yeah so we do
it I like the preparation of this it's
been it's been more than doing you know
regular is a good way not going to talk
so what we're doing is we are preparing
the good puncher ready so we do not only
have the problem with due to the fact
that we have a lot of beginners as I
mentioned we have the whole scaffold set
up so we don't expect the Chinese to do
all the mix duel and breakfast so they
have a repository and one cutters
maza tori in vodka and we will talk
about the head of opposition to redo all
of this theory but there's one reporter
cut out different you can just go in and
then they have runny set up ready so
they just have to do big steps cabin and
then they can run the tests and this has
obviously failing and even have we even
provide and functionally what's today so
you know it's not like to complain about
the test obviously so this is ahead
attendees and the present everyone so
it's not only me everyone is asked to
submit something we have an issue in the
closet or you can just some little
cutout and then there's something do you
think and then you can't win Toria run
your yoga in a medium and then what we
go for renewing after everyone work on
any groups what we used to read you is
we ask people to serve a recording
that's because this is something
everyone knows right that's not that's
not something new to them it's like a
regular workflow that you know ready so
we don't ask them to notice you for for
dealing with the car
presenter so they open up or request and
then we are going to prepare to browse
all of us together because the get our
editor the code review book is quite
sufficient to review catalyst that's
right and isn't it a trick so i can
really encourage you to have continuous
integration complains because the pull
request turn rather green depending in
the solutions is driving this really
cool to see so you can execute the code
and see if people like we're successful
without having the plug in their own
laptop in their own code in that
terminal and all this weird stuff but
it's something which has the same
interface and yeah this work out people
also we might all everyone who submitted
a budapest walk upstage run through the
solution another thing we have is bring
young you want to start that yeah so I
was fired from the television that's a
method used from social workers like
or it's forums and its a math there ever
they can ask questions and solve or get
input from the others in their group and
their children to get a call tomorrow
small problems and we use this method
and we change the limits of interest
Tony we did here and what we do is
someone has a problem or the stocking
code or whatever is not happy but
without and she's presenting their
there's nothing the pink can ask
questions to understand what's going on
and in the end there the audience is
coming around to the groups of feel for
people and discussing their they angle
all their solutions there are many
questions or whatever and yeah so after
eight ten minutes and they have made it
here own advice and then they turn
around and give their advice to personal
question and in the end words with that
but the realm of the question has their
hand would like to try this or I like to
use this one have a moment I really like
that so the people who give feedback get
feedback for that you pay and you know I
manage a bushel and peck and this is
something that's really awesome that
again to know how this doesn't receive
their sleep I think this is followed
which is really received well because if
you're like Coney lon and elixir or
elaborate you're going on in whatever
language you're facing a lot of you know
the small nations not like I'm making a
shitload of money out of code but more
like how do i structure how do I handle
the coach will in this particular case
this is something we're bringing our
problem really adds a lot of benefit
because you have this five to ten
minutes to present it to the group of
like-minded people and then you can just
run out get some fresh ideas and what I
really like about the foreman as some
presents a problem you're not you're not
committing to a certain solution hearing
you just get that input then well thanks
and that's it right you don't have to
say you don't have to come into
something and do it in a particular way
maybe you can just walk away well I just
a little my way and then there's a lot
of a web
even F thighs as if you're doing this
and you know promised law to argue right
so just bring up because he makes we
could spend the whole like night that's
question it's really happy it's it's
important not only necessary that you
have some liquid young place so you
really need a break you want someone to
stop the top people talking you know
that's always you always said every
Google's have allowed the ones with this
strong opinion once they're on everyone
right so it's really important that they
can stop that it were quiet people also
get a voice and if you're not getting
access to a professional like we not
only have get like daughter do it
yourself and get a little bit better at
this because I think this is super
important and if you let someone like
this just robbed the experiences read
that right so this release that's
involved with flourish and also has a
nice nice way of the more everyone so if
you're hiring of that appearance tonight
you can talk two three or four team and
that's been easier than talking funny so
it's really really creative steady to
get it killed another point use is our
boss together project and that we are
still open will
here because I believe makes me so we
hope that this would be awesome so ended
up with yet and also maybe it's not the
right way the ideas will to really do
start working light bulb give something
back to the community service projects
or maybe you're a musical and then we
can contribute to helping the people
getting over this in all those really
take the status mechanical swing maybe
not that good but I can convince
something like this after you altogether
yeah so what we do is we invite popular
open-source maintainer so for example
next week we have an instrument
to you the schedule library our
submitting tool pretty well done and he
brings this project like into the youth
group and he starts a relative action
like how this Tool Works how it's may be
designed and what serve design assists
out the clothes are all the stuff and
then the maintainer also breaks a
special label just for the user groups
of us handle DX which is the shotgun or
group which is especially an area just
for this special beginner label just for
this event so it should be something
which can be smoke within half an hour
and it is something really easy for
start right it may be remain rename
method or having an argument somewhere
this kind of stuff no it's not totally
night changing the software
architectures this is not of this
especially this arm and then with this
begin enables we hope that we can help
people to get their feet wet on a
certain project especially with the
maintainer and when there are questions
about the the whole project they can
this is not only cool class because it's
against your feet wet with coconut sauce
diary which is I think cool thing itself
but also have some interior because the
second recruitment thing for you
maintenance too though and again we did
not do it yet but finding next week
after excited that you see and then I
can tell you it works or if you just it
just drive over from hammer and join us
sing this is one of the biggest bdubs
rihanna's yet which sounds like 300
people look so we have 30 of setting
strangers now which was after the
marriage response the biggest in numbers
we have planned yet and I'm really
looking forward to this thing this is
really going to be fun and yeah 3 again
doing it's it's something against rules
right it's not very beautiful thing and
this is why I and then we have another
format it's kind of obvious thing it's
September's so obviously in July the yen
I we were talking about him to do over
here and we had the idea that we want to
do something which is not getting to
accompany
ass out no coding but emphasized the
social aspect of a bit more and we
figured that we we were driving up in
August we were all out of country than
September because we're looking back
from the be too cool to do about purity
cannot be truthful I yeah well all the
year except me but yeah so we excited to
just go in reverse I think that's very
very common thing for her nurse even
though it's a cliche but yeah they
haven't had probably the house was
really cool things so it was about to
have fun together you know get get out
get up get out of your comfort zone get
out of my baby talk about coding and
then we talked about putting a lot of
diamond but we broke the scenery right
and then we just leave it open to the
techies to do whatever and what I think
was interesting that there were a few
new people I thought when we are
authorizing this only the people who
come to every double but we had at this
special media we had three newcomers I
think that's correct well they might
have a pretty pretty very American group
so that's this yeah it's always that's a
real group well
our Rebecca what did the squareness us
mindtap so we also went and there's a
maternity I can you identify who is
excited to get five years of everyone as
a kind of please show our fee so if
you're been tough of yours and come to
the meter will get fabulous back so that
we are rather the real number to book a
table that's very hot because lonely you
have chatting people or reduce our page
but only in terms of 10 are there and if
it's only five a bad further for the
venue progression yeah so in the end
that we've had to make a new commands
from some the office endurance and onion
a everyone of that and yeah variety was
first ok we can pay with the factories
it was zero prince
can we kind of horrible the first
because the never was paying half of it
and you're making the other proc so we
decided to give fabulous of your boots
back so everyone's there then they fit
here to try to thank you the work out
pretty well yeah so what is it important
like this that's a little bit more
signing off so first thing I want to
empathize this like pocket table as in
really good view not just pretending but
with your irritating might have caught
some int like book a table like actually
putting them in our eyes the table at a
certain place at a certain point in time
well we're going on and it turned out
that the extra kind of do not take
reservations but there were like gap it
will be fine just show up which strongly
does this I was pretty nervous about it
it worked out very well so I didn't want
to talk about that but if you want to
sleep better than 94 better day before
the meetup just like you know go to bed
you agree like actual terms 15 and then
what I think is also pretty helpful is
if you want to give the 50 bills back
take as an organizer first get a lot of
renewables but your bank will
that was not a big mature and that also
bring an attendee list with pictures
right because that's many people
especially some company cars even though
it reaches the sometimes are because
people have anything like literally
everything is dead all right but it has
at least four sixty percent of the
Chinese to figure out how to and just
cross it off this and yeah I mean you
can also live in a meetup for numbers of
attendees this is a concern for you for
our it's so so so small and then yeah
paypal actually charm is goofy so we are
needed already washed off and we can get
it create one person tasha and this
basically cover with you so we're not
here about that it's friggin and it's
just one person out of rock 15 i guess
so we have to find another method to be
envisioned yeah let's say goggles so 0 X
next the next one is really good news
it's about here so tomorrow story we
always order a fear of attention to us
they have this year I google thinking in
the end so when you get
the company that was the event they also
spawned out here and audience at the end
so after two talks and maybe a little
break in between and after that all the
family pre our persons have to go home
and we didn't like that so we skip the
last part and move it to the middle so
we have first our first action may be
small talk or the first couple together
then we have a big big break middle
where all the giving and get to know
each other and drinking alcohol and
whatever you like and after that we have
to say part and yeah it's really nice to
create this kind of community healing
and to get more each other also
important to offer something not iconic
right nonlinear my part this is
something we just talked to a mind so
many companies before it is such basic
right they are all have kogan fits I
don't know where is yeah but when I had
already five quemada the company I work
for you know I don't want to have six
for me yeah I don't think all right so
the last thing we want to want to talk
last action we have what we did already
is thing we call show you later freshman
we just did it once but I think it's
very it was very soon so a hammer as its
together twice we don't know so we have
two companies so yeah so yeah so we have
to come these actually having a bigger
electorate production thing and if the
fact that lecture is not regular regular
language and regular thing framer the
use cases in the Attic right our most
people interesting then go i created an
e-commerce site or oh we created another
CMS site so the apps they built in the
provinces of mostly more interesting so
there was an opportunity underneath you
to show what they were they everything
right and also there was a lot of
questions around that often the problem
when I go I don't know why is your
traffic shaping this former boy so those
it was really interesting to see to see
it all of that and because we have a lot
of awesome people that have big nozzle
the end so we have together our fuzzy
feeling it's great to join get more so
then I didn't
imaginable and here's a big list of
eggnog all things we write on future I
was so nice here and doing some projects
together it's like oh I just make water
bevakasha so it should be done yet eat
up it's like they kick off or something
that we can work together and the recipe
month and maybe come together when I see
how much all happens so the point where
this originated from is there's project
column to me which I always flows which
is an AI game basically where your
programming AI four per game which is
very nicely visualized website and I
wrote it we can project the lake set up
for you and that's a people from diverse
group saw me tweeting about and said
well we can do this in user group yeah
this could work this could be
interesting but then you know writing it
a good AI takes more than that you would
more time and have it regular meetup
right so that is going to be king of
something where we write something very
basic at the media something which are
no running back forth we're very very
simple but to get everyone starting in
the
vironment and maybe even give the people
in idea about what's important when
you're right very right in and I and
then have like one-on-one months
hustling and then after no months it's a
next meetup we show up and gather again
and then showing us this kind of project
so long in terms another term steps we
could also think of doing something
officers together not in helping
something existing out we're creating so
if you know cnrp they have a lot of in
the Ruby community they provide a lot of
open source tool they have it in there
is a group of rebel and this is
something i could see with how the X as
well but this is not something we have
if there's something coming up with this
idea it's really happy to support it
another idea is something called already
know if see that's the European
this to people at monica's with with
everyone and uh yeah so here the main
ideas to the talk to you in order to get
on something and maybe give zero
programming can be two people so that
they can take it and using the data and
thus again as I hope so I like something
like this face more connection on
occasion so again I think this could be
pretty interesting to create a space for
people to try something out they might
be not able to try that in the web
that's right then they tried using they
might walk back out to the bosses today
we tried this weather
do it and sharing and pitching something
you have done is the control different
pitch something you just heard right so
we have the idea of giving the space I'm
doing an engine because we have you know
we have their location we have the
people and you just have to bring the
prop the product yeah sure it's off to
work haha that's negative oh no no we
won't right however i think as i
mentioned we're getting a one heart go a
little bit how we're running when we
were training it or what i would think
about you're doing in youth group i know
they don't want to be a woman showing
new it's not i don't want to be done
with your gun maybe i am now especially
now giving talk boy but it's it's not a
little water to be morning I wanted to
be the big community so now I'm to
achieve that what the freak thing we did
and we even did it in first before we
had the first video we do everything in
public there's nothing happening between
behind closed doors so everything we do
everything we discussed and everything
we decide we do it in public on github
here you see the planning issue we did
for this for this one meter as you can
see we do everything in there so we
discussed menu for example if you can
read people
also when does the memo me to a big
thing and people who think that together
so I can just mention them and practices
and check they have developing for this
one so I could just stretch gentlemen I
can drag our guests in right I think can
drag up one either make the decision
there also to my status right sir so I'm
still may be there it's on body at doing
it right and organizing it but everyone
had done it if you have an idea you can
just wanna get have our essence everyone
can join discussion and you know how we
can commit your your company to host it
as a venue but we also have a big back
up again enjoy your own course we have
been back out before to organize the
talks all our methods we going to do and
here for example that's how all the
talks that we have where someone had an
ID here to do something and we are data
we can go
as a possible thing to start and
connected with a more effective
connected with video with the winter and
then BAM everyone knows museums are and
yeah if there should be a bus we're
sitting in it's going down someone else
take a look sorry we encourage the
lesson we color almost every bit of them
that people can participate with this we
really want people to join you guys are
crazy still experimental and we do not
see that everyone jumping in but a good
to see that we have people jumping it's
not as we have a group of handful people
who participated in this crisis again
due to the fact that I do I don't want
to have much work with still doing it we
have everything contaminant so
everything looks the same which is not
bad I guess so the issues we have issues
pre-planned monthly issues there's a
template of that so I mean when I have a
run I just creating 10 in an interim and
they all hold the same steps like having
a checklist of things to do and all of
this is again in github in co so if you
have a if you have an idea of footmen or
if you
something be done differently you can
just opening up a pull request on the
way of how we are these things and I
think that's the supreme we also have
this templates for mediacom so how to
how to set the settings we have come so
that everyone it's not just me because I
did it like 12 times but everyone can do
it i hope that i described most
checkboxes to be claimed in bending in
the camel toe i also have the template
for the description what tactics have
parents electric pen in all of this is
done in code right and again it's all
coming so if you want to write if you
want to run something if you want to get
inspired if you want to do a similar
thing right you can do it for him yeah
for me please absolutely encourage i
would also have from william methods
description of how are great so like to
take it over and steal we can just go
home please do that and if you have
passion so we can yeah oppa navigation
so there's is there something on your
question on how we're on it there's also
we have this planet ripple and
approaching snuggling somewhere next
paychecks i h8 next session planet you
can just go
opening and filing of an issue i also
want to talk a little bit about chat
from so on this w is gone but get us
only for our dancers or people who are
interested in organizing or want to
contribute to it if you want to attend
if it this is like this is what you want
to do with your not going to plan this
is totally fine cause there's no need
for you to jump it up just going to meet
up at home side of their genre group and
you will get the always you need for
crew for attending you would you again
and why we choose be done on this pretty
easy because I think they do one thing
pretty model which is email marketing
right so they send a lot of emails and I
know this can be annoying but in order
to grow the you through this is pretty
helpful for us so i just created me down
then they sent out an email to everyone
to all the tennis everyone could be
interested in joining us and inviting
there's nothing have to go myself I just
kidding but this is really easy that's
why it works a lot when people like John
me never come and they say they live in
hamburg on the move they get a 1 million
syndrome suggested because maybe they
were also part of the Berlin or
thickness think this house plot and what
we also do is Twitter it in this place
big Charlotte reduces he's ready to
Twitter Cal when you appreciate that
because we don't like I don't have tents
other side I'm sure are you going to me
know what we try to do is and I think
maybe achieve at least that you may have
one announced between para para shoe and
this is something we mentioned tweeters
we are going to take pictures so there
were not so many just from themselves
these two pictures yeah that's true I
think and we r cartridges animals before
we go but again some of the rail and
about people we have somewhere between
10 10 so it's not not the JavaScript
it's just so talking about achievements
right whatever you she first of all talk
about a Jesus there's no one that's up
this it is not the most rewarding work
but I think it is very rewarding and it
did it tell us a bit to the to the
community does its bit too to make the
the language community better animal and
helps a zymogen beginning trigger o the
local community into
your local tech see what we also
cheapest and this again magic ever get
interview and we created the first year
of cocktail it was another one of the
summer only dust and everyone had to get
drunk because I was practicing my and of
course is when you today pastor court
thursday and we can't possibly night
session we had a lot of trying their
owners to create to getting the right
color but it irritates so but also at
the Sun get up so we have your own my
name is pardonable whatsoever it's tasty
it has like a moment and and one of the
five features
six pictures and what we repeal sativa
that's something that gives me a promise
to connect people that spark my job and
my dad oh how we saw our son Joseph
itches and imagine years off and they
they connected on the relativity so it
was really really nice to see that
someone is you know get into channels
making people happy at work and to see
that happens here that's going to be
nice I mean it was very obvious right so
there I don't know two three companies
that have a right in the elixir project
and being the village of elixir
developers so where should they go if
not to help me now right and then what
they were having to be I was people will
care about language I in web traffic
management and then more we have while
doing it we have four legs are great if
we get people who catch that interested
in the language like more excited about
the language or maybe even the platform
and they will they would go back to the
bosses and they will go back to the word
and move the next project they start it
will be a richer because they learn that
much they they could more excited at all
you unless we create more work places
using the language software creating
more jobs in a lecture and thus we get
generating all these developers if you
go time there's yeah right totally do it
man make it looks great
truly sorry i'll be great we need have
all right so this brings us back to you
we did this thing for for a year now on
Bravo's years we started in February
solids in mentioning it to think about
interior so that was a union think we
have our 11th edition yeah 11th edition
this this week next week initiatives I I
don't want to be this about us right I
want to be this punchy when I want you
to charge your loving community so I
want you to improve your local community
care for your organization's for
theaters loneliness we want you to build
the local community using the tools you
already know like it happen close and if
you want to move it move it baby so just
do it that's the only thing to do that's
all I got
this is a public work might have a few
questions if you have any questions we
have been too far always was we got
something awkward some people that had
00 expertise in developing do together
before in the loser and if yes how do
you manage picture like a functional
memory I guess that was I'm one of them
now and why I asked so I don't know
anything vice to teach me a little bit
just because them someone said okay I
tried to explain to you and then we'll
really lonely so eager to teach and I
really get get answers that may get the
something covered I mean pretending
you're a mystery my only thoughts are
there was a starting point and to figure
out something that was awesome and we in
the end and we test for me she I like to
return the number def def calculate too
much yeah but was really tall so first
the first Depression was there and what
we do is we ask a was it means was
already broken and then
experienced person who resonated through
special and it's going to mixing fixing
though the people who are together I
mean it's but just don't throw the quad
don't throw the task of the people and
then even like that or lean over the
taxable it's really encourage them to
start it and encourage them really
something people have a lot of this was
something I did not mention always at
least the people who created the kind of
should one around especially yes with an
extra we have in language with a lot of
concepts youtube other people and
they're like recursion from question we
get most right oh I i have this two
elements about this how do we do it the
loops so that's probably thing we
expendables and we just we have the
experience people run around it really
helps to that the palace are there the
past few days of those evenings so if
you put them on code orang blazer
the school will going to be trying to
fail horribly for this thing know at
what point they fail to greatness of it
so many quality unprepared but they are
slightly mr. very belated isn't right
and what's always there's you have the
solutions online guitar solo if you're
not clear if you cannot attend you can
make them at home boosting enemy and
then compare the answers and show you
answering get interesting so this is
something we saw which raised the price
mean we had a lot of people who took the
cut out there was even our it was a
meditation I go can you explain the
result and put across something company
because I didn't know at home and I have
this mess up so people really look at
this so if you a future if you are
interested in that again you can just
check out our record we have about five
hours and three of them we did already
we were trying to learn
we asked what we faced with that people
were changing the people that were
coming with us so on the first workshop
we get something and on the second one
because people were am you completed on
the next one again
it was hard to find common ground
so we switch Allah I think of the
biggest the biggest difference we go
there is that this again we did 11
editions now and we did three times to
cut all right so it's not that we repeat
a lot we have also we have a lot of
course this might be not that here this
in this topic we usually have one talk
as an s an action still earnest as
something and Amina so we usually have
at all and then the one something else
cicadas go giving you different stuff
and like economics before the have an
addition we what we see is there we
ought to be a lot of new people and
especially you once might know might not
show that frequently but we also have we
have four we have car set of people at
around one of eight or ten and you're
easy on the other hand I mean we created
it to two more free people and to get
connecting people who design so normally
develop this kind of pretend to do so
when we try to look to take them with us
and take a center move them bring their
work Kristoff's father
I have the best have you identified some
what are the rough parts of a let's hear
when you're introducing new people when
they are learning or good which are the
parts that you see that people get stuck
or have problems from complain that it's
hard or rigor so the cleansing yeah hey
that's ours as all of the Youkilis when
they try to set up the tooling or the
heaters or well this is something
beautiful already so we have all the
projects careful we have running tests
so all they have to brain is running an
extra compiler and nowadays when like
most people running back it's politics
so I would say it's a recursion from the
programming point of view because occurs
and it also depends of the category we
had some binary house and into the way
although they trim the line handlers
binaries almost everyone who has not
experienced this particular problem
rough time starting so do you document
your experiences for a if someone is
done from what you might reduce specs to
the river is the best place Oh is he
home yeah so we don't know what we do
and power to it so that you can take as
a recipe and
for questions y'all walking out they
don't have something
and whatever you want into classic
images you're very welcome to take all
the materials we have all the plan just
like use it from forked copy it protects
your own whatever if you make it any
bigger you make it better appreciated if
we can pay or a little bit of that with
heaven creating this in the public we're
very help we are very happy already or
if you have any questions maybe
afterwards or if you're running your
media for the first time in a while
showing up something we are weird aticle
you could just meet us and we do our
best you to support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
