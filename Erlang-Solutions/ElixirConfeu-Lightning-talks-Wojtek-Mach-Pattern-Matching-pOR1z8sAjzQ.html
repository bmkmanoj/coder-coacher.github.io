matching in Eric's here since this is
one of my favorite features I'm employed
by the way and i work for starters and
so as an example of butter much ink i
want to show you a game of cards a
simple game of cards so this is ace of
spades and we can yeah so that we can
represent that as a string we can get
out fancy since all Alex with strings
are you there big strings just can
actually work as well but it's not very
useful representation so this is how you
want represent that as a couple you know
the card in the program so we have a
total of two elements the first one is
the rank it's ace and then the second
one is the suit which is space with this
we can have out well it kind of fits we
can have our another data structure
which is a hand in this case it's a hand
from Texas Hold'em so we have two pairs
we have aces and sixes and you can
represent that as a couple of cards it's
a couple of doubles in texas holdem we
have nine different trials that a hand
can be some kind things like full house
flash strange to Paris and so on and now
we want to improve to program to have a
program to figure out the right for a
given hand in imperative programming
languages you can have those
bunch of conditionals you know in first
well nine percent of audience should
recognize this code you can of course
move this out two methods but it's
essentially the same thing and i want to
show you how we can solve the same
problem with pattern matching so you all
know that that's a case expression we
cut the pattern on the left and then the
result on the right of the pattern so in
our example we we match the hand against
these patterns these patterns are the
five calls doubles sometimes we may not
care about particular cards so we can
just put an underscore underscore is
going to match any car dental particular
slot so 20 and then in fact our magic
you can go kind of further and subdue
dynamic your data structure so we can
decompose or de structure each card into
the run and the suit part of it so with
all of these sort of theory behind this
this is how you can actually get this to
work so in this case we have a double
and we match the first four cards and we
say that oh the run of all of these four
cards must be the same the suit doesn't
matter and then the fifth card doesn't
matter if your hand matches this pattern
you have a full of a kind another
example is full house so the first three
cars must have the same rank and then
the second the last two cows must also
have the same rank but these are kind of
two different ranks right and so we're
full house you have something like basis
Wolfgang's so three aces and two kings
and then finally we have an example of a
flush so in flood flashes like any five
cards the drug can be anything as long
as the suit is the same and so yeah I
mean to me that I find this
more readable I can sort of visualize I
can see the shape of the data and to me
I can just look at it and see that is
correct it's also more powerful so we
can this kind of bind bindings on the
under life you can use them on the right
so it's more powerful you can have more
expressive expressive and star so there
is one caveat with this is that straight
which is like five consecutive cards are
really tricky to do and I actually don't
know how to do that so give me up later
but I'm in any case that's all I got</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
