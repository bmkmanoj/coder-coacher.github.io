maverick of ski and we want to give a
talk about racing of large scale active
systems you can follow slides on
tinyurl.com slash lamda 2018 racing and
a little about us I've graduated at HGH
university of science technology just
last year and have my degree at computer
science I work as an engineer at
evidence prime where I work on
healthcare decision tools and after work
I am play World of Warcraft very often
so yeah I mean computer science
apprentice I also got an education at
age eight University of Science and
Technology and currently I'm gathering
experience at Allegro a commerce company
where I'm working on advertisement
platform and after work yeah I like to
read paper about the serratus system so
if you want to talk about that later
okay okay okay okay so who has heard
about okto systems okay okay so we are
thinking whether to include a slide or
not it so if there is any possibility
that someone haven't heard about that
now it's probably not the best moment to
say that out loud but to make sure we're
on the same page I will go for it very
quickly so actor model is a mathematical
model concurrent computation actor is
treated as a computation primitive it
can it process stuff locally you can has
an isolated state which could be mutated
by messages yes so actor can talk with
each other only by sending messages as
synchronously there is no G connection
there is no shared memory also actors
can create other actors and form some
kind of supervision hierarchy delegate
work and get the results they can also
change their behavior and decide how to
respond to the next message so
motivation for this model was to run on
highly parallel machines and high speed
with high speed network so everything
fits together perfectly
okay so let's dive in into this scenario
let's suppose that we have an HTTP
server that is actually modeled with
actors and let's suppose that the user
here sends an HTTP request to change
some user privileges to one of the users
of the application so the socket Handler
you know reads from the TCP the route
request and passes it to the request
parser which parses the request and
sends it to the router well someone who
was implementing the router did
something wrong and it escaped that test
so unfortunately this request is a bit
malformed and when it's passed to the
user service which sends them a query
with Malcolm beta to the user DB service
and because it is malformed during the
query execution the database rejects
this request and it manifests as an
exception on the user DB service actor
but the real cause of the problem was
because the router implementation was
not well done and how can we detect the
real cause of such errors so our
solution is to collect traces so what
are these traces we can think of them as
flow of messages two actors here on the
right side you can see one possible
visualization of that and what this
visual visualization the Peaks so
vertices the Peaks actors which happen
to communicate then arrows show allows
between vertices show communication
channel message passing one actor to
another and also we have arrows from
nowhere so for example HTTP requests
incoming to your system is generated
outside so the first actor servicing the
request received message and we also
want to collect that message so
basically a trace
track responses of the system to
incoming messages so we've designed
Scala library which enables us to trace
messages in akka toolkit and the over
our library architecture well the
library is split into three main parts
the tracing library core which contains
many classes to parse the configuration
and to just set up the library and as a
p3 plug-in which enables us to generate
an aspect which then instruments the
code of our library and the collector
which collects the messages passed
between actors and saves them to a
database in this case it is CouchDB and
we have some very very simple
visualization tool which enabled us to
just see the traces and it's quite
working so okay so next light show
so very high level about how it works so
okay this be Clyde's round the big light
blue rounded rectangle is our test
application and there are also actors
that we want that we want to trace so
the first thing we have to do is to
define config at dependencies and for
example define credential that database
is stuff like this second one we don't
have to do this manually the SBT
plug-ins run on compile phase so it's
gen generating aspect that is that is
added to our our our source code then
aspect aspect at one instruction to our
send message interest actors that passes
messages to collectors so every have a
message that is that that actor is
processing is passed to the collector
and how it's how it's possible we have
we have additional trade that is mixed
to the actors that we want to trace and
this you use idea of correlation IDs so
we want to join these traces and put
them into into collector all right
it was simple when we have one node but
when we move to a distributed
environment it was there was a problem
how to collect the data from all the
different nodes in this system so we
could see the whole trace and not just
some part of it that is from one node
and not another so the idea was very
simple we have local instances of
databases on each node of the of the
factor system that we are tracing and
this database the database that was
chosen was couchdb because it's
efficient replication protocol and the
fact that the CouchDB replicates data
only in one way and this is exactly what
we want to achieve that there so we have
the central database it can be also
clustered but for the simplicity of this
picture we just showed it as one node
and we replicate all the data from local
instances to due to this central
database okay so as the title of the
presentation was tracing of large scale
actor systems we wanted to prove that
this solution is scalable and as a test
application that we traced which was a
traffic simulation the basic idea is
that city is divided into areas and
every actor processes traffic inside of
such area and communication happens only
between neighbors so you can see the
city speed as a great so only between
the nearest neighbors there is a
communication and
we send messages about incoming outgoing
traffic and free space on the road and
the very important reason why this was
this application was chosen it was
because it generates very large amount
of messages and also worth noting that
it is an example of microscopic
simulations of his car is simulated on
its own okay so the first set of tests
we wanted to assess whether whether what
is the scalability of the library so it
measured the impact of the library on
the test assistant performance it
occurred that the average library
overhead so the loss of the FPS of the
simulation was was about 40 percent the
overhead is quite high but the tests
showed that despite the FPS loss that
the library has still proved to be
scalable with the amount of nodes in the
system so you can see on the on the
graph that the trend lines are nearly
parallel so it also means that the
tracing library is not affecting the
scalability of the application it's that
it's being traced and it's a very
important thing okay we also perform a
second set of tests which checked
whether the library is coping well when
the number of messages were increasing
we achieved it with something so at
first we said the probability if whether
the message was going to be collected or
not and we increase it from 0% 100 and
as you can see it is nearly linear
scaling between 0% and about 90% but at
100% the probably when this probability
was set 100% there
high increase of the overhead we suspect
that it is something connected with
CouchDB that were reaching some limit of
this database but we are not quite sure
what really is causing the dis problems
and of course overheads were measured in
percentage stages of FPS loss okay so
what we have done we have created Scala
s color library for collecting turkeys
in Acapulco we have tested the
performance of that on a real
application it was a traffic simulation
the average performance loss was about
39 to 45 percentages in frames per
second and we've proven at least more or
less the solution is scalable when no
number of nodes who are increasing we
tested it to about 50 nodes and it
nearly proved that the solution is
scalable with then when the number of
messages are increasing and what is very
important there's that we haven't seen
any impact on scalability of the test
simulation of course I don't mean that
we haven't seen that the performance of
such simulation was worse because as a
twitch audio it was worse but it didn't
affect the scalability of it
so future work so future directions I
think ok so initial phase was to show
how this tool works so we needed to
create visualization tool and it was
very simple and it works on a local
database so I we think that it's good to
have nice visualization tool that can
handle a great amount of messages and
choices other thing that we that
probably is good good to have it's
additional additional statistics to
allow to track more precisely overhead
so for example latency processing time
it has to create for example more
sophisticated Mahon is like turning of
the
collecting when the cluster is our
beloved it also how we can use this
collector tester because choices are
good but what for so for example length
of paths when choice is suddenly
becoming significantly shorter or longer
it could indicate the problem depends on
the situation it could be useful to do
for example tricking and other to the
admin or kind of a sorcery team that
something bad could be happening to the
system also vertices degree we can
provide insights about potential
bottlenecks in the system so for example
actor generate amount of load did a
specific specific message and for
example you can now try to optimize that
also histogram of numerical values from
messages distribution of messages type
we can think of that as unique
fingerprint of the of the health status
of the system so yeah we can do
something on that information and also
another tools that we can use our choice
for example data mining machine netting
yeah okay so thank you very much for
your attention
and the library is released on github as
an open source you can do it by
following this link but we haven't
finished the documentation part so we're
sorry very very much about that but it
will happen soon so I guess that you can
visit it and anytime thank you very much
thank you
so did you look at the causes of the
performance overhead of your library
what exactly do you mean Hey
no I mean that 30 or 40 percent of the
overhead did you did you look did you
check what what caused it well because
the message messages that are being
passed between actors are purchased
twice because first it is processed by
our collector which checks if it is
should be you know put into database we
mention there something and then it's
you know it's being processed by the
collector to to you know serialize it
etc etc this is one of the thing that
this is causing some overhead and well
and then it is processed by the actor
system normally how it would be and the
second one we think that there is
something not quite right with the way
that CouchDB saves the saves this on to
disk room to disk I don't know what is
exactly causing this problem but I
suspect that this is the the cause we
will check it change database to
something us and and check if I'm
correct maybe I did something wrong with
implementation but I suspect CouchDB is
causing much of the problems but I
suspect it thank you thank you
I wanted to ask about that as BT plug-in
you use for creating aspect you routed
by yourself or use something existing we
were out at our satellite for aspect and
this aspect of our culture to the chase
application it is written in the manage
source and it is done compiled by the
hospital
thank you for questions
so on this visualization tool that you
have how do you represent time like do
you do that or because I have only seen
actors as nodes right and messages as
edges first time we don't have on and
death on this tool we don't visualize
when these messages were either received
or sent so we don't have this feature on
it but it is saved to the database so
this you know the information is in
these traces but it is not on the
visualization do you mean that you
record time but you do not visualize yes
because I would suggest to have you know
the usual straight lines just sending
messages then passing time so this is
trace and we can measure the time but we
wanted to specifically focus on for
example messages fast and how how long
is the part and actors are so yeah I
mean but but this is basically just
recording information on the relation
between actors writers like effusion the
message then you are related since you
had time if you send only one messages
or thousand then you will have the same
right yes
unless unless your visualization works
overtime then we mentioned that it is a
one of the future work that we should
work on the better visualization to and
I think that your suggestions are very
welcome in you know a thank you thank
you can you dynamically switched it on
and off or for example trace messages
originating only from one specific actor
without turning off the system yeah
no right now right now no but but you
can configure it
you can configure it to capture messages
only from specific actors so it is it is
possible but not without restarting the
actor system
