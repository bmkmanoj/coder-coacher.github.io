so we both work at singularity which is
the company which originally created the
play framework so suppose you know it so
we are we are a consulting company and
me now we mostly build web services rest
web services for our customers and we
came here to share with you some of our
experience in building such web AP ice
well harder we'll be talking about Jason
protocols and and documentation but it's
not our goal is not just to have a
success story hi I will house that's how
we did it isn't it cool instead we'd
like to share you also some of the
deeper insight in the ideas behind it
and some useful patterns which we hope
you could also use in your own projects
so based on the context of of Jason
codex okay so so the context is that we
have web services now who doesn't which
obviously consume and produce Jason to
communicate with each other so we need
to be able to marshal the data to
sterilize and visceral eyes the data but
we also need some kind of documentation
are either user documentation which we
can publish on the HTML site or some
machine readable documentation which we
can use in truly rest ap is so for
example if we consider is a simple
common like this to buy an article we
might need to be able to encode it in
Jason so I don't know how much how much
of you have a scalable ground perhaps
all right how many of you write in
Erlang perhaps cool how many people know
what the tie clasp is cool that should
be fine so well in Scala which we could
have a syntax like this to given a by
article command to encoded it in an iced
tea a JSON AST you can also have the
code method
okay which well as we can see it gets
quite complicated and if you want the
code one field we have to decode both
for them and then if everything is right
we can all only create the data if
something's wrong you might like to
accumulate errors so of course nobody
does it like this very CE pattern in
Manning in many libraries which will be
new can you just explain what is the
return type yes so the written time will
be the some type of either get a
decoding error right porting the coding
errors or we'll get the by article
command yeah so if we sterilize it that
might be the representation will get in
Jason okay I thought about documentation
here's a citation I've seen recently I
think it may also apply to rest api's
many people say they do erased ap is but
actually rest is not only about HTML and
Jason like many our customers think well
I won't be good allowing it to death at
one of the one of the fundamentals is
also to be able to have some national
schema of all the data we are exposing
so for example with our a by article
command we may want to have a shimmer
documentation like this so this is only
a simple example in practice you might
be using some technologies like json-ld
or other ones but this could be enough
for our case so we know what the type
what the fields of our object of our
JSON objects are what their type is and
perhaps what are the constraints okay
but the problem is that we have codex
which which are programs in order to
serialize in the serialized data and
also have documentation and the question
is how to keep both in sync so some
people start with documentation with a
specification and try to implement an
endpoint some other will just first
implement and then produce some
documentation or not in both cases we
need to keep both in sync so a change to
one of them has to report it to the
other so have a big Chris this is
usually manual and error-prone so we'd
like to to avoid it okay so what's a
approach the pattern we want is to show
is how to use a common model to be able
to build derive the implementation of
our colleagues but also derive some
documentation so actually well the deep
but the deeper insight is that we want
to use functional programming to
separate a program description from its
interpretation or its evaluation so what
we'll be talking about now is well first
we have a quick overview of what is the
shape of of Jason libraries in Scala and
so how we can avoid the cameras own code
we have shown some this before then
we'll show you how we can combine in the
description of other codec with its
documentation then if time shall we
perhaps show an alternative bartosh this
morning should talk a bit about about
generating boilerplate free code using
skyler naturals will show you how can
this be done with with type level
programming using shapeless and finally
we do try to look at the deeper pattern
which is common in what we will be
talking today and how to extend it adds
additional interpretations of an
interesting description of an existing
model ok so the many libraries there in
the play framework or a set of it well
we won't be speaking about any of them
in particular but we can assume that we
have trace similar to this one so
basically the trade is a traitor is it
parameterised by input and an output and
we want to be able to encode one type it
to the other and the other way it's
obviously when we encode things can only
go well however when we decode the input
into the
put well we might have some parsing
errors and validation errors and back
business rules so in either case we need
the type to express the possibility and
this is either so either we get the
coding error or we get the output type
okay so that's how we could write a
codec which is able to to serialize and
DC realize an integer into Jason so for
example we might assuming we already
have some abstract syntax tree for Jason
we could check if mr. Jason number and
then try to pass it is usually that will
be a bigdecimal so we try to cast it to
end otherwise we can accumulate the
different errors if you want to encode
it in its is fairly easy and similarly
have other basic codecs like building
blocks so we could have a string codec
to encoded it got a jackass drink we
might have a codec which actually
produces JSON objects so nested three
structures we feel we might also be able
to express some constraints for example
we might want to say that an integer is
has a minimum value and we can also
Express this as a codec transformation
from int to int which may produce an
error at the decoding level which would
then carry the business rule okay then
we can have combinators which is our we
can take several existing colleagues and
try to produce new ends for example we
might want to chain colleagues so I want
to apply first 11 transformation then
another so it's a bit like a pipe women
also want to just transform the output
type so we might have a method a map
right which takes the output and sable
to to transform it into something else
okay and then using this basic building
blocks and the combinators we are able
to describe more complex structures for
example might say that in order to in
order to hit a codec which extracts the
article ID from our rejection we first
look for a field article ID and then we
change the result with a string codec
with quantity we may do the same at
added an additional constraint the vets
much clearer and the code we sell at the
beginning and it still carries the same
amount of information and that's exactly
the same thing okay so we might use also
some object oriented techniques while to
space to specialized the Codex we want
to do for example might have an object
codec where the output I this is a JSON
object so I may have a more specialized
field Combinator which creates with the
right codec to encode and decode a field
in a JSON object we might also zip to
object codex so we might want to try to
decode one codec and then they code the
other and if everything is right we
combine the results however if there is
an error either in the first on in the
or in the second then we accumulate the
errors so I think everyone familiar with
thai places we recognize the pattern
here alright so finally we can use all
these Combinator's well as a dsl so a
domain-specific language to actually
describe the structure of the data we
want to to have so we can say that i buy
art you could call the favor by article
is this consists of first zipping two
fields with some constraints and then e
mapping the couple into some case class
change the type yes
sure well actually you could you could
use you could have different
Combinator's which express alternatives
so I might want to first try to decode
one representation of if its size I can
move to to another 1 etcetera sure can
do that you could do that okay so
essentially all will call Jason
libraries or XML libraries in scar look
pretty much like this so we have some
basic building blocks and then you have
a DSL Combinator's in order to construct
more more complex programs so codecs are
transferable composable actually we
could think of them as a program written
in that domain specific language okay so
without documentation to keep things
simple we might consider an abstract an
algebraic data type like this where
things can even be a scholar an object
composed of fields or a constraint like
mean value or perhaps changing several
operations so using such an algebraic
data tab so we could also define some
basic building blocks for example an
integer a string or a date with specific
format and then we could combine them a
little bit to list to describe with the
documentation of obvious by article
command right so actually the data we
want to to to have in our web endpoint
is an object with two fields of a given
type satisfying some constraints and
perhaps with some human readable
documentation description okay so now we
have so we have these two two different
ways of expressing basically the same
thing so first we have a codec which
which expresses how to encode in the
code s color object into an adjacent
object and then we also have a second
description which is Kara are the
structure of this object so we can you
can see that various very parallel
between them but
structure is very similar and we're kind
of repeating the same things so the idea
now is to try to unify those two
descriptions into a single one yes okay
are there any questions so far on codex
and documentation because all the
remaining of the Turk will build another
sink on top of that it seems ok so we
want to aggregate together the feature
of having a codec and having a
documentation so let's just define a
trade for that a trade which is
parameterize by the input type and the
output type we call that a protocol and
this protocol has a codec and a
documentation so now we want to define
an API that will allow developers to
define their JSON protocols so we have
to think about what we want or what we
need to be able to express to define
such protocols so for instance what one
thing what we that we want is to be able
to transform the output of JSON protocol
into another data type which is maybe
easier to work with so for that we need
an operation that transforms a protocol
from A to B into a protocol from A to C
and we will be able to do that with two
functions that map's the b2c and the
other side and I name this method a map
by reference to an abstract structure
named environment or which is very
abstract and theoretical and
inaccessible but we will see
why I do so another thing we want to do
with our protocols is to be able to
chain them so that the output of the
former protocol is the input of the
latter and to do that we we define an
operation and then which takes a
protocol from A to B and when from bit
we see and produces a protocol from a to
c this operation is named and then by
reference to an herbal structure which
is again an abstract and inaccessible
thing so a bad point you might be
wondering okay why bother with this
abstract an inaccessible theoretical
thing and that's a very interesting
point and indeed for users it's not
needed at all to be aware of these
things but I think and for the record
this is this work that we are showing to
you we we built it for a project a
real-world project and the people who
are using our dsl are just regular
developers who don't have a PhD in
computer science and who are just
focused to to do to get things done in a
practical way and and they are totally
able to to and I ha they are happy to
work with our dsl even though they don't
know the underlying thorough checks
theory but for dsl designers i think
it's important to be aware of of that at
least what reasons the first one is
consistency so that if the wrong they
sell designers want to express the same
kinds of operations it's better if they
are named the the same way so that
people can get easier an intuition of
what these names means
and also for reasoning about the
expressive power of a DSL for example I
can just say okay a protocol is an arrow
and then another long wait designer will
understand okay so so we can chain two
protocols within with and then ok and
now so I've shown how to define JSON
protocols and now I want to specialize
our concept of protocol for the case of
object of JSON object so I just
specialized my protocol trade into
object protocol and in that
specialization I first the codec to be
an object codec and the documentation to
be an object documentation and this new
object protocol has different properties
has new properties compared to just
protocol for instance it has this zip
method that allows us to define a knob
ject protocol in terms of the protocols
of each field of a JSON object ok so
again this method refers to an abstract
theoretical structure named Cartesian
which has just one operation zip that
that takes a protocol of something and a
protocol of another thing and produces a
protocol that yields a triple at Apple
of the two things maybe you have heard
of Manhattan another are very sexy in
functional programming so maybe you're
wondering is a protocol am an ad that's
a legitimate question and it turns out
that a protocol is not a manada and
actually it turns out that we do not
want at a protocol to be a monad because
we want to be able to statically reason
about not statically reason but to
statically describe document a protocol
a JSON protocol if we try to implement
this fat map operation which is the
essence of man add if we try to
implement it for object protocol we
wouldn't be able to supply this a value
in the case of documentation because
documentation doesn't produce values so
we would not able to produce this F of B
value and we will not be able to to to
get the full documentation of a JSON
protocol so we don't want it to be a
minute so so far I've explained how we
can combine protocols together but we we
first need actually building blocks to
be combined together so in the same way
we were able to define primitive basic
codex we can define basic protocols for
example a protocol that encode and
decode JSON to string values we just use
the string codec and the string
documentation and similarly we can
define protocols for in values and for
constraint and so on the field
building block has a new parameter
that's the description of the field
which is needed to to populate the
description of the field in the
documentation ok but that's basically
the same idea of the field codec that we
have seen earlier ok so that's enough
material for now let's see how we can
use it so this cut above is the
unification of the two cut examples that
we have seen just a few slides ago so
here we are again singing the saying the
same thing that by article JSON object
has two fields article ID and quantity
so first one the string and it even has
a description and the second one is an
integral value which must be greater or
equal than one and it has a description
and finally we transform the values of
the two fields into a nice case class
which is easier to work with so you
might think ok we can unify the codex
and the documentation but still thus the
syntax is a bit hard to use and a bit
cumbersome but hopefully we can improve
that and we can define for example in
figs operators to make things easier to
read and to write for instance we can do
that for and then so we can define this
kind of operators and we can also define
a more convenient syntax for the
combination of zip and a map that would
give the following syntax for example
that
example of what is possible to do so
here we say that we have to these two
fields and we combine them together to
to return a by article and finally we
can even have the this kind of nice
friant dsl that reads even better and
actually that really close to what we we
are using in production let's give
another example of how to use that so
consider the above the following
definition of the by article Jason
protocol we can define an instance of a
command like the like the above and then
if we encode it in JSON using our
protocol and if we dickered the
resulting JSON hopefully we will get
back the initial value if we try to
decode an invalid Jason we get back an
error here and we can encode a given
command and we get this JSON value and
finally we can also print just the JSON
structure of by article and it gives
just exactly the same result as we have
shown in the first slide okay what time
is it okay I think it will go a bit fast
and this section but so so far we have
seen how how to define JSON protocols
for our data types and when we are just
working and when we need to deliver fast
our software it can be seen as a
cumbersome task to define both a data
type and it's jason protocol so we also
set up a system to to build instances
instances of JSON protocols for data
types in a type directed way that is by
reading the type the nature of the type
of our data we are able to define a
corresponding JSON structure so we just
do a mapping between the type data type
field names and JSON field names so to
do that we need to be able to abstract
over the data type the algebraic data
types structure so we need to remember
that an algebraic data type is defined
in terms of some types which are sums of
product types and we will work on this
abstract representation of algebraic
data types to define our process that
builds JSON protocols according to the
structure of an algebraic data type I
won't go into the details of the process
because I think we have known we don't
have enough time I just want to notice
that this kind of very generic
programming is not supported yet by the
Scala compiler so we are required to use
a library to do that and this library is
named shapeless
so I will just keep that
okay so and
so what have we done we have shown how
we can define models of JSON protocols
using plain skala code so it's important
to notice that we can use all the scalar
linguistic features to define our JSON
protocols we can use value definitions
and reuse the result of a Val definition
at several place we can use a functional
abstraction to define a proto cars in in
a modular way and this scale akkad so
represent a definition of a JSON
protocol and then we can have several
semantics for this JSON protocol which
are the doc user codec and the
documentation okay and yes we were able
to reason about the expressive power of
this embedded language that allows us to
define JSON protocols by using
well-known type classes so now one
problem remains that's the fact that
both the our protocol tightly coupled
the fact that a protocol has a codec and
documentation and both are tightly
coupled and you might want to wring if
it's possible to to define the semantics
independently of each other and that's a
pickup so next part I suggest okay so
from one side we've achieved to unify a
codec and the documentation however at
the same time we've also tightly coupled
one with the other for example what if
if we need to change anything
in the algebraic data tab which
represents the documentation what models
must also go in the code which which
implements the Codex if if you if you'd
like to introduce a new interpretation
of a protocol for example we will might
want not only to have a codec but also
have a JSON the documentation perhaps an
HTML documentation and perhaps a class
diagram of the same data and then let's
go again in the protocol and add more
and more structure inside also like like
like Julian said before a different
interpretation may need different
expressive power for example in the case
of documentation we we can't have
monitors and it's also quite hard to
reason with recursion for example
however with codecs that shouldn't be a
problem so really it would be nice if we
could still have a common model but be
able to have different semantics so
different interpretation of the same of
the same program written in a single DSL
so how to do that there are several
approaches among which three applicative
object object algebras and finally
tagged a less general our eyes algebraic
data types and these are several
approaches and techniques which make it
possible to define a model separately
from its interpretation and I'll show it
on the example of object algebra which
most of you must know from under a
different name I think everyone knows of
abstract factory design pattern from the
Gang of Four book so basically we have
several types of products and an an
abstract factory simply defines several
operations which if the produces
products of the corresponding type or
thus some operations on them right and I
concrete a concrete implementation a
concrete factory will simply refine and
provide implementation for our different
products and also bind all these
implementations to a common type family
so basically that can then be used by a
client right so I clients can be able to
define what it wants to do independently
of the factory which is provided so it
might want to first create a first
product and create a second product and
assemble them and the same code works
whether this is a factory for bikes or a
factory for carcel or airplanes so
actually object algebras can be thought
of as abstract factories in the sense
that all the basic blocks all the basic
operations we might want to have in the
dsl it's like the products of an
abstract factory and all our
Combinator's these are operations
another way of looking at it is it
looking well actually the L in dsl
stands for language so we might consider
the grammar of a DSL and we get exactly
the same thing absolute factories object
algebras and also the grammar with
terminals and productions these are all
is a morphic so well when I think of a
keynote of yesterday he knows perhaps
we're really discovering something
instead of inventing is if we have so
abjectly oriented patterns functional
oriented patterns and also a formal
language theory which all provides us
with something very similar so the idea
is if we define an algebra so this dsl
in terms of such terminal symbol write
an integer and string and also have
operation in up and zip so whatever the
actual semantics is right so here we
capture with semantic as a type
constructor f we can write a program
using such an algebra if only we have an
algebra whatever the exact semantic six
are we are able to use the dsl to
construct a structure which is a program
indeed in that case we take an integer
we take a string and we leave them
together thanks but the advantage is
that we can decompose the different
features of algebras we might want to
have
so for example we can have some some
basic terminals common for different for
different algebras right with integer
strings and other basic types so we
might have other algebras which provide
the semantics of an IMAP operation
however we might also want a narrow
algebra and you can remarked that the RR
Djerba has different constraints right
our algebra requires semantics with type
of structure with it takes two argument
because we need to if you want to change
an F of a B with an F of BC well
obviously we need two types parameters
so we are able to to combine the
semantics to describe algebras of
different expressive power so we may
have a weaker algebra which only has
some terminals and some and the
production of the productions of of an
invariant fact functor or we may have a
stronger large a brow if which has
bigger stronger constraints on the
semantics right Express as a type
construction in the form of a type of
structure but also allows different
operations to be made so how could we
implement such a zebras then well for
example we could have a codec algebra
right this is the the question mark
there is it's not native Scala there is
a plug-in compiler plugin which allows
you to set lambdas that way so now in
other words we take the codec which is a
type constructor with two to type
arguments we fix the first type but we
leave a hole in the type so when we end
up with a type of structure which takes
only one type argument and that's
exactly what for example needed what we
needed from what our protocol algebra
needed for us to have an IMAP operation
and then we can have for example several
implementations one for Jason and
everyone for XML and all they need to
have all they need to do is to provide
the basic building blocks to decode
primitives but you can reuse exactly the
same operations we have on comics
dependently of input type or
we might also this define an algebra
implementation for documentation right
so here you can see that well the doc
trade was not the type of structure but
we can add a phantom type right so a
type which is erase at runtime and
doesn't really do anything in runtime
that I'll ask the reason at compile time
so we all we have to do is well defined
with the basic building blocks and
implement with combinators and you can
see that by the way we we've gained some
statically typed documentation which may
be may be useful okay so finally our
implementation of a by article protocol
remains almost exactly the same all we
need to do is pass it an algebra and
given with algebra using the
Combinator's and the terminals of the
dial jira we express exactly what we
want to do either we can also use some
scalar magic within places to have
something tactic sugar and we also get
exactly the same the same dsl as before
however we can parameterize the
semantics of what we want to express so
for example we may first have only two
implementations just like before an
algebra Forgione codex and I'll cheer up
for documentation and we can reduce
exactly the same function exactly the
same definition to either derive a codec
for by article or to derive a
documentation and the day we need it all
we have to do is implement a graph
algebra or a business jira if you want
to have some great visualization or some
codec for business okay so well to
conclude with we have seen how we can
use embedded dsl's to describe a program
to describe the structure of of data and
the action of validating off of
marshaling data and this dsl provides
basic building blocks which we can
express as an algebra reason about it
reasonable the type classes well chair
represents and combine those semantics
to have interpretation we want either
some documentation or a codec or
something something else okay so that'll
be it you have any questions yeah yeah
you built a very
complexity
all
or a representation if you want to
extract some information and how much
added value does it have to say
use the standards
to get my swagger well the other yes the
question whether the we implemented
something quite complex and what's
further value for example compared to
standard play framework communities and
mattress well the others value of
shapeless and type level programming
compared to macros or from the user end
point of view it's is equivalent however
well the valid value is that we have
almost the same syntax as we like play
rates however first the play well the
play API there is an API for codex Jason
colors in the Play Framework other
problem is is that the entry type is
fight this fixed it's always a Jason so
for example you can't have the arrow
semantics you can actually chain codecs
together you can't add constraints
rights of a constraints are not possible
in in this dsl so first the first added
value is what you can have constraints
another one is that we can use exactly
this well that extended dsl used like
the ESL of the play codex but we can
also automatically derive a json schema
for the data the codec represents so for
example we are able to generate some
some types typescript visualizers on on
the front side we are able to use this
schema to have smarter front
applications for example which know
which fields are required which are
other constraints we can reason about it
also in the front side application and
on the back side we didn't have to do
anything anything you we just use a more
a more expressive a more powerful dsl
just like we would have used the dsl of
of play comics yes so what 80 sometimes
what to do in the DSM is observed share
equal to the camp like imagine that it
is adjacent wrapping is used
places you might want to document it
once and then revert that yes sir sure
well the question is whether we can
document some piece of Jason's I'm some
object some data type once and and reuse
it in different places well let's
precisely the idea as you use plain
scholar to describe a structure a data
structure for example if i go back to to
this code right so what here if we've
we've said that by article r is a field
article ID which is a string and I feel
quantity which is an integer right and
well we have a function by article so
right now for example we might have a
composite comment what the first field
is by article and we reuse exactly the
same the same function my question is
not that my questions with even generate
documentation in which every time you
use a bible school it just refers them
one part what is the generation
documentation rather than repeating the
documentation by article each time it
occurs I'm not sure information to give
so if I the articles appear in 15 places
yes in the documentation you're
generating will each place say it's a
piece of Jason with an article ID and
quantity or can you generate the
documentation of my article once so that
at the other occurrences of John says
and this is a peyote yeah I think I say
well precisely or the question is
whether we can reuse the same the same
interpretation of the documentation in
several places each we move if you refer
to to an article several times well it
depends of implementation of the
documentation of algebra which can be
very naive for example repeat the
structure every time it it says it and
then for example we have a problem with
recursive data types however might also
have a more more sophisticated algebra
with state knowledge which would for
example record all the types which okay
it has already seen and accumulate is
this information and reuse it and for
example that could allow us to have
two recursive data types this from an
api user point of view i was the natural
that she was the output like the HTML
whatever api documentation that is
produced by all this okay is that like
an iPod talk yeah this may be this this
is an example of what you could get yes
yes but oh this is a JSON fragment that
may be the result of a description of an
HTTP endpoint so we will rest web
services where each endpoint is
self-descriptive so from the root HTTP
endpoint you can know which are the
other HTTP end points that are available
and then you can know which is a
structure of the expected JSON payload
29 displayed I just don't see the whole
picture because I think this is only the
detail of that particular thing is not
the actual documentation on the endpoint
there's not the user documentation
that's what with me this is a national
readable documentation but using exactly
the same pattern instead of outputting
Jason but you can see that I did by
article dot dot dot to Jason okay so I
met a head at to HTML which takes
exactly the same structure exactly the
same algebraic data type and produces
some pretty pretty HTML with we fancy
stuff so this is just a machine-readable
schema but that's that's equivalent just
a different way to print the same the
same information the point is that apart
from building our encoder right which is
just an exit a piece of software we can
execute we've also captured the
semantics at the same time using dsl
that's your question I would like to ask
you about the performance I mean let's
say we talked with Jason with the
interface which processes a lot of data
what's the overhead a presumption in
checking of using such protocol yeah
well basically it's all compiled time
actually once once you use an algebra
right you've got some you can you reuse
the same object the same for example the
same Jason protocol or the same
documentation object and upper end so
you don't have to go through all of this
construction and the construction every
time however well when you decode data
obviously you have to go through all the
stages but that's that's the same
performance as other API other libraries
for person for parsing JSON because it's
that does exactly the same in the same
way okay thank you sorry we have no time
to for more questions so let's move the
discussion afterwards and thank you
