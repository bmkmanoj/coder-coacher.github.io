then I moved to Alexis because I was
working mainly with website and but I
didn't have a special support for media
tight so it was quite hard to make
everything right and they were a perfect
solution for that so that's how I came
to Exeter and it was really smooth to
change from Alex - Alex earth because
the others are all the same in both
languages so on the beam right so the
top of the litter our regular market
analysts earn month and only someone
familiar with what the talk is so give
me a little something so living friends
of the circles that in conflict we are
using elixir on one note most of them is
even though venture is usually marketed
for big scale beeping of success with
stateful information and stuff like that
we're using it with those boring find
out shelters and so on the crude
application and this shows that editor
is perfect for that - and I think we
need more soccer stories in those
domains even for small projects more
common project because I think the words
they're the same movie or even better
and that was the motivation for your
talk you want to encourage people film
or smaller applications is actually
exactly so so they don't reach for
editor only when you have this affinity
problem you can reach for it even for
your
small project if you don't think you
need to grow any time in the future
interesting division in which companies
before yeah I will you're comparing lot
here and I really enjoy that food what
are some things that you might see is
that you saw that this lots of comments
are pretty such a compromise so the most
important thing is meeting all the
people for the time between talk with uh
something crazy just because you can
learn so magic change the knowledge and
very often for company and when I say
what I'm doing they come up with five
years or two new libraries I haven't
found yet and stuff like that so it's
really important just to just a network
and to know who is doing what with
elixir what's something that you wish
you some more I would like to see more
about nurse
project I very much like those talks
about and that it's systems it it's
simply amazing with exceed that I didn't
think a person can be used so number of
devices
it looks like it's a perfect match for
Apple devices
yeah that was amazing course I would
like more of that in the future now one
question I usually ask people here's
what is you could have known one thing
before getting to lipstick something
they use that you would want to tell
other people who are interested in
elixir what would that be something
hmm sure about that'll be coming from
airline background yes I already knew
most of the difficult OTP stops and
things like that but I think that what I
already said is that you should try ring
current Phoenix for your small projects
get your functional programming is great
for modeling business domain and not
only for those really hard problems that
maybe you will never pay you're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
