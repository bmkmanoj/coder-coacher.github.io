talk is called fear and i added a fear
to my list this weekend actually I'm
from Texas and in Texas we have spicy
food we actually have painfully spicy
food and I went to an indian place last
night and you have my family with me and
I about killed my daughter the waiter
said oh no you don't want to try that
it's spicy and when we hear spicy in a
place like in a place like Stockholm we
here in Texas what we would call whitey
hot which is you know not very spicy so
I said oh it's okay she can do spicy and
so the waiter smiled and my wife took
that is oh it's going to be okay I took
that is Oh No I've made him mad and he
made me a spicy dish that was beyond
whitey hot and it hurt and I have one
more fear to add to my list thank you
for the introduction I I did write the
book seven languages in seven weeks I
was the editor for the book seven
databases in seven weeks and seven
concurrency models in seven weeks are
you here Paul Paul butcher in the back a
great book that's coming out in the next
couple of weeks that talks about
concurrency models and and as you would
imagine Erlang is right in the middle of
it so this is an interesting talk
because I had planned to do more
technical talks for this conference and
Francesco came to me and he said what
was the talk you wrote last snake-bitten
I liked that talk well I want more talks
like that one I said darn because these
talks take a lot more research and a lot
more polished but but I hope you agree
that the result is worth it so up until
about a couple of months ago I didn't
know quite where i was going for this
talk and I took a kayaking trip where I
chi act along the length the whole
length of a lake in Texas and you might
think hey that's Texas they don't have
much water this is Lake Travis and it's
normally 64 miles long what's that
40-something kilometers and 42 miles
were accessible the rest we're in
drought the rest was pretty dry oh right
right right going the wrong direction so
but anyway I had a lot of time to think
about fear one of the things that we
were going to do in this kayaking
expedition is to pull over to the side
of the bank and camp and a lot of the
banks are like this one there a little
bit rocky and in Texas we have
rattlesnakes and scorpions and they like
the water and they like the night
exactly when would be pulling over to
camp and I was a little worried but I
thought a lot about fear and I wanted to
think about the concept of fear away
from the concept of languages and I
thought you know there are effects of
fear that even change the way that our
world is marked and you can even see
fear from space the Great Wall of China
and then I thought a little bit more
about fear and I thought you know
language creation is like exploration an
exploration is really in conflict with
fear does that make sense because you
have to overcome your fear to explore
and to do new things and that's very
much like the creation of language so I
thought you know maybe this wasn't such
a great idea for a talk fear and
language creation but then I started
looking around about fear and the
creative process and there's all kinds
of information out there I'm a writer
and fear manifests itself in the form of
writer's block and the same thing
happens with artists all different kinds
of ours my mother was an artist and
sometimes I thought that I was the
canvas that she was working on
she was actually a better artist with
with the canvas and paint that she was
in real life but so I thought maybe the
idea of raw of thinking about fear and
language creation is a bad idea but the
concept of talking about fear and
language adoption is very much front and
center in fact a number of years ago
actually in 1991 that's what 23 years
ago there was a book called crossing the
chasm I'm sure a number of you have seen
it how many of you have heard of this
book okay good good what's that must
read yes yes it's a fantastic book for
technology people especially technology
marketing people in Sweden you have
secrets that you don't like to talk
about that the world needs but the
concepts behind crossing the chasm are
that more people adopt a technology in
in the center of so if this axis is time
more people have adopted the technology
and in the middle then at the beginning
and at the beginning there are these
innovators and then early adopters and
then there's an early majority in the
late majority and then the laggards at
the end and language adoption tends to
work in the same way in fact it works
the same way many many times over the
course of our careers in fact it happens
for every new language that that we
adopt you'll see lots of little cycles
and this has nice even cycles but we
know that that's not true sometimes
languages come in in a hurry and
sometimes they take a little longer
sometimes these waves come in one after
another sometimes they overlap all of us
use many languages at the same time
during the course of our jobs if you're
an Internet program
member you're using HTML and probably
some SQL and probably some JavaScript
and hopefully some Erlang and maybe soon
some elixir and then there's a longer
harder cycle to overcome and the
emergence of programming paradigms how
many of you were at UC last year for the
keynote on snape Eden ok good number of
you so one of my premises was that these
well while the waves the language
adoption waves for individual
programming languages are uneven with
unequal sizes and and overlapping these
are very very regular if you look at the
major the major paradigm programming
paradigm that's prevalent at the time
these happen every 20 years or so and
you can almost set your watch by it it's
almost like the sweetest trains they
just come with a pretty amazing oh hey
I've been to Italy and I know okay but
there is a gap in this curve that's
called the chasm and the gap is what
we've all experienced when you've got
this great new technology when I was a
kid I have that the 8-track tape did
anybody else have an 8-track tape oh I'm
kind of dating myself as if anyone else
would but so there are technologies that
make it and a lot of technologies that
don't there are more technologies that
don't make it than do and there's been a
lot of discussion in the marketing world
about what it takes to get a technology
across the chasm so basically when you
look when you look at this particular
concept you might say who cares in fact
in the Erlang community this is such a
wonderful beautiful thing you might
think we don't want anymore you
we don't want our language to cross the
chasm at all so but what we're really
looking for is the community that
happens on the other side of the chasm
and you might have a question how much
community is enough don't we have enough
community can we stop reaching out can
we stop growing and keep things where
they are well what tends to happen if
you stagnate is that there is a brain
drain and that most of the interesting
people move on and and the results
aren't good for a language or community
I can say it another way that with
crossing the chasm comes things that are
interesting to us sure there are more
people but there are also more jobs and
tools there are frameworks to do more of
the work available for free more of us
to share the load of working on them
there are more conferences like this one
where you can go out and enjoy and learn
and more training that's available and
if that's not enough for you how many of
you enjoy your time at the EUC I think
that this is an almost magical community
and I don't think that many of you
appreciate how special this is and more
of this can come with crossing the chasm
so this is about where in this talk
Jeffrey more ends in the crossing the
chasm theory ends and the well research
well thought out basically the good part
of the talk has ended and now we're
going to move into the the brew state
part of the talk where I will talk about
my theories of language evolution mostly
from observing what's happened over the
last 25 years or some so it's my theory
that there are two major fears that are
involved in crossing the chasm there's a
paralyzing or stabilizing fear that
tends to make the chasm bigger and
there's a motivating fear that
to push things across so these type of
fear types of fears are in conflict so
the paralyzing fear increases the size
of the chasm and we all know what some
of these fears look like what are some
of the objections that you people in
this room have heard when you've told
your boss I want to adopt Erlang what
has made your boss say no yes who else
is using this right so that's that's
really what this is all about and why
does a boss won't care who else is used
in the language they've got to get tools
and support and things like this what
else what are some of the other
objections that you've had to crossing
the chasms i yes where do I get staff to
where do I get staff to help me with it
what else all right these are all the
types of things that happen every time
we try it across the chasm with the new
language and remember this gets bigger
much bigger and much larger and by not
quite an order of magnitude but almost
when you cross the chasm with the
language and a programming paradigm and
that's what we're up against today so
these fears are pretty massive in the
eyes of a manager these are actually the
things that good managers see the types
of risk that good managers seek to
mitigate so that the chasm stops looking
like something like this and starts
looking like this and if you are
interested in new programming languages
then this is also where the new where
the programming language graveyard
happens right and you can see it in your
head right you can see these these new
languages being written and and got some
trying to build this new community for
buzz for this language called buzz and
this and I'm trying to build up the
excitement and oh I've gotta write
documentation and
it's all on me right so a programming
language is a programming language isn't
really built for the computer it's built
for the people so I'm really trying to
gather enough critical mass to to draw
actually the second person into buzz and
then maybe it never gets beyond that
maybe I grow it up to 10 or maybe I grow
it up to something that's used in just
my university but it's a very difficult
thing to move from this side of the
chasm to the other side of the chasm and
it gets harder and harder and harder as
you approach the the end of one paradigm
and the beginning of the next and so
what's happened until the last couple
years is that we've had very few very
large technologies or languages that
have cross the chasm right and that one
if you throw in c-sharp looks pretty big
right now in fact it looks really big
right now and I'm not sure that anybody
could ever overcome that type of
momentum and again it's not just that
gasm that we need to cross right now we
have a bigger cycle for paradigm
adoption with big orgasms okay so that's
the scary fear that's the skier that's
the fear that stabilizes things and
won't thing let things move on but then
there's the the motivating fear and that
should be the exciting fear in this room
right now because right now Erlang is
almost uniquely positioned to to solve
the challenge the challenges that are in
front of us those are the things that
are going to push the language or the
basically the next the next language or
languages that are broadly popular
across the chasm and when this happens
it happens very very quickly
so the last time that we did this was
with Java and C++ and we talked a little
bit about this and the snake bit and
talk but this was in an important chasm
crossing because this plus plus looks
like object-oriented features C++ was
not really an object-oriented language
as we all used it it was more of a
bridging language most people that use
C++ wrote procedural code with it so it
was a C++ minus minus okay so but what
actually happens here is at some point
the paralyzing fears now there's too
much to learn we're to proprietary we're
on old hardware and all this is is
really in this case we were looking at a
Microsoft monopoly and we had to
overcome this at the same time is we had
to overcome everything else to cross the
chasm and at some point the motivating
fear grows beyond the size of the
paralyzing fear and then we we tip so in
this case we made the paralyzing fears
smaller right there's too much to learn
so we have we adopt a C++ syntax its
proprietary so we instead instead of
deploying a new language we deploy a
browser and then everything can run in
the browser and instead of worrying
about portability we build a portability
layer on multiple systems and then run
things on top of that right but the big
thing that tipped java was the business
problem and this is always true so when
you look for language adoption don't
look at cool language features look at
the business drivers right so the people
that are most successful with relating
the business problems of the day are
going to be the length going to be the
people that control the language and
have their language tip right so for
Java the problem was a deployment
problem raise anybody remember this I
was actually one of the guys with with
roller skates and diskettes and you know
mine wasn't Windows mine was os/2 and
there weren't ten desk
that's there were 16 and I know because
I was the one that had to come in on
weekends and actually do some of the
installation this was as late as gosh I
did this maybe in 94 and you know we
started to automate that a little bit
shortly after that maybe a little bit
before if you were one of the lucky few
but it really wasn't this was it really
it was every system in your data center
and every data center in your company
and this kind of grew and and it wasn't
just this set of challenges it was more
like this right we had more than one
vendor to worry about so now it just
wasn't that you were running this
version of OS to with this database
manager with this land manager with this
communication manager and they all have
to work together and then you love
another vendor in there with with a load
of set of products right remember lotus
123 and lotus notes and all that stuff
and then you chunked in fragile
programming techniques because we the
glasshouse the people that control the
architecture we were pushing our
programming languages but because we had
to deal with all these challenges we had
a backlog so there was all this backlog
and the line of business people said
okay that's great but I can't wait so
they were starting to build their own
applications and spreadsheets and macros
and visual basic and IT the IT houses
got crushed beneath the weight and
that's why Java tipped right it was not
a cool reason it was not a cool feature
of the java programming language it was
because Java saw the business problem of
the day no part of it was portability
but most of it was being able to deploy
on the internet because when you can
deploy a business when you can deploy a
a browser one time on whatever operating
system that you choose the whole game
changes and that's the type of tip
that's the type of business problem that
we need to be looking for today that's
exactly the type of business problem
that's facing us today with multi-core
so Java crosses the chasm and now we
have a big ol elephant part right on the
edge of the chasm and what we do and
what is changing fast enough to move
that big ol elephant off the end of the
chasm this isn't just Java this is the
Java family of languages we could throw
in the C sharp we could also throw in
the object-oriented paradigm right and
all of the little languages that are
popping up that are trying to fix things
in Java that stink right Ruby's we're
trading we're trading in this is not
very productive i'm coding ruby because
i think it's more productive than this
was but i know that i'm adopting a
single-threaded you know this i'm
building software for distributed world
and essentially a single process single
thread per process language we don't
have green threads we don't have threats
to speak of right so in parked up behind
Java are all these potential languages
fact that need to cross and one of the
questions that we have to ask is it is
which language is going to get across
the second question that we need to ask
is it just going to be one language this
time which i think is a valid question
if we're sometimes jaded when i say we
you and the Erlang community or not but
the rest of the world sometimes looks at
the world as you'll one true ring that
in the darkness binds them right one
true model for the whole world and some
things are changing where I don't think
it necessarily needs to be that way so
here we are today and we're looking at a
set
of paralyzing fears and they're mostly
related to how hard it is to learn
functional programming and functional
languages I thought that Katie did a
marvelous job yesterday morning when she
started talking about you know riding
her program and that's the way that we
look to the rest of the world but I
think that these fears are going to
become increasingly irrelevant they will
get solved because they must get solved
because the world needs what we have on
this side of the chasm what we the early
adopters have the world has to basically
can't function without so I want to talk
a little bit about the paralyzing fears
and I want to specifically ask the
question what's the best way to eat an
elephant we got to eat that whole
elephant to cross the chasm one bite at
a time right it doesn't have to all
happen at once this time because
building communities is easier if you
think about it where was our lane built
you guys know the story erickson a
little lab with with Joe and Robert and
and the crew and and it was it all
happened in one place write it all
happened around one business problem it
all happened in really one company you
could really make the same argument for
sun with the the oak that turned in the
oak project that turned into the java
project and was really kind of boiled
and cooked in one place if i look at the
language that I'm involved in now and
that's the Ruby community that's Ruby on
Rails so the guy who wrote the language
where was he born Japan and where was
David hunter Meyer Hanson born denmark
and there are people in the core team
you know one of the guys that the guy
that wrote elixir i'm joe say valium
he's born in brazil and lives in cracow
poland
and has their core team members in that
have lived in New Zealand and United
States and all continents but I think
too and so that's a very different thing
and if we look at the elixir language
that's evolving in is still different
way you have Joe say with with his his
company that split across Brazil and in
Poland you've got Dave Thomas he's
working within my marketing marketing
the language I've I've contributed Eric
who is are you here Eric part of the
elixir core team who is going to be
speaking this afternoon at four o'clock
is contributed in the language it's a
worldwide thing so we are gathering very
rapidly the critical mass for this
language to grow so when you look at
this big fat elephant sitting on the
edge of the chasm and you say I have to
move that whole elephant you know maybe
you don't maybe you don't so the other
thing that's happening is that if you
remember from the snake bitten talk last
year every time that you cross the chasm
with the programming paradigm that
doesn't happen in one shot there have to
be bridging languages and bridging
concepts that expose people to the ideas
that you're using and if you look at
programming languages now
object-oriented languages have many
functional concepts for example Java has
even added the closure I mean it's a
little crazy it took them this long but
Java has added the closure and when I
left Oslo I was giving the same talk and
venkat super manyam has a book called
functional programming in Java and he's
teaching classes across Norway about how
to code functionally in object-oriented
languages and impact the classes are
packed why because we need a bridge
people have to be exposed to the bridge
to relate the old with the new
right that isn't relevant to the way
that you code in this room but it's
relevant to bringing more of the world
that will make the Erlang products and
languages and virtual machine much more
sustainable right so the other thing
that's happening is that we're starting
to see deployment options that are much
richer and easy to take advantage of and
this was absolutely not true the last
time across remember the deployment
deployment problems they took a while to
solve now pretty much the the second
that a language a functional language
really steps steps across the chasm and
makes it in the mainstream they'll have
deployment options that are already
relatively mature the next thing is that
interfaces are cleaner and you don't
have to basically rebuild all of your
corporate infrastructure at once you can
take the the problem apart and and there
are service-oriented architectures that
many of us have already adopted that
will make it easy to move to move your
system a little piece at a time so I
work at a company called I can make it
better and our first foray into the
Erlang Erlang ecosystem will be with the
elixir language and we'll be doing that
one piece at a time we'll be taking more
most of our back-end delay tests and
we'll be breaking those into a lick sir
and then we'll be taking the longest
running the things that will benefit the
most the things that Ruby just can't do
into a lick sir and then we'll move more
we don't have to move all of our
infrastructure at once we can do it we
can cut it up and eat that big elephant
a bite at a time okay and so I want to
talk a little bit about motivating peers
and then I want to save some time for
questions so always the top fear on the
list should be code complexity
every time that we attack a new type new
classification of problems and Gus we're
saying a new classification of problems
that becomes the norm for the for all
the problems that we solve every every
three or four years now basically we're
trying to solve this problems with
smaller core developers and we're not
giving the developers more time the
schedules are still shrinking so the
things that has to take up the slack has
to be the programming language the
programming language has to be able to
deal to scale up to handle more
complexity and you all know what the
benefits of Erlang are with with its
ability to handle a distributed message
passing and specifically the error
propagation and nobody else on the
planet gets this right like our lane
does but there's also another element of
complexity there's the ability to roll
up more concepts into a single line of
code and here's an example from my book
this is seven more languages in seven
weeks and I never really thought that
I'd be writing this this book these
these books are hard and it's kind of
like that eating all those bites of
spicy food that I had to eat because now
you I'd brag to the waiter right but but
in this case the excitement of all the
languages that are happening now was
just too much to overcome there's this
Elm that's happening on the browser that
we'll look at in a second there's Idris
and and dependent typing this happening
elixir is very exciting to me but this
is basically I'm writing some code
that's a state machine and the state
machine is has the vocabulary and a
semantics that aren't really included in
the language but I can build I can
rapidly whip up to a domain-specific
language that lets me represent just the
core of a state machine with with the
minimum possible syntax and then the
usage becomes
really clean and simple so for example i
can have callbacks built-in i can have
specific calls so each one of these
states actually does you know codes many
more functions that that i can actually
put to work so the second challenge this
is this to me is the big challenge
that's going to push this across this
chasm you heard it in the keynote this
morning you heard it in five talks
yesterday with just about every talk in
the room talking about the complex the
complexity of this kind of application
the rest of the world doesn't know how
to write this kind of application the
people in this room do and when you add
the the capability of macros to describe
these things that I could build a chat
room that looks like this completely OTP
packed all of the goodness of Erlang
cooked in behind it that hides this that
hides that macro key right that 126 line
or how big is it now I don't know you
know the OTP key that you have a little
sticker on the keyboard that says press
me for OTP right well with macros you
can cook those concepts down and just
into a very few lines and it's it's
really most programmers today are
getting better by by improving their
skills and getting better at the rules
of the game some people change the rules
of the game and that's what's happening
with the languages that support macros
okay and by the way the dsl was written
by dave thomas don't know if it's going
to be part of a look sir and the example
was from Peter Minton I'm I think it's a
pretty cool way to to think about a lick
sir so the next the next motivator i
think is browser complexity this is one
this
kind of sneaking up on us if you look at
applications like Google Maps and in
kayak com and things like that all of
these things are building on a
programming model that that that is
broken and we know it's broken the the
JavaScript type model is broken the
execution I've been with with is joe
armstrong here so I've been with Joe for
a couple of days now and I think that he
has said that I've heard four different
rants on running to completion in know
DJ s right but we know this is broken
but this is a much cleaner way to
express this is the little excerpt from
a game that I have where I basically
code a function called display and then
we're display also has to build in has
to move the paddle across the bottom of
the screen like a game of pong and then
I pass it in the window dimensions in
the male sex position and these are
functions now so this is straight
functional composition and and when I
embed this code it just it simply works
there's no callbacks it's just a clean
and simple model so this is what it's
going to take the browser complexity the
multi-core and distribution the code
complexity cleaner interfaces deployment
deployment options FP features and
building communities all of these are
are the things that have to happen for
Erlang to cross the chasm right and when
this happens it doesn't have to happen
all at once right it can happen in
little pieces now one bite at a time
so I'm going to stop now for questions
or comments I know it was controversial
I know I know some of you are mad and
let's hear it now yeah the browser that
was in a language called Elm it's a
brilliant language by a guy named Evan
licky I think and he has recently joined
Prezi where he spends half his days in
San Francisco and the rest and in hungry
I believe in Budapest yeah and he
presented this language the first time a
couple years ago at strange loop in st.
Louis and it's been having a lot of buzz
lately I mean you can read about it in
seven more languages and I'm sure in a
lot of different places coming up very
soon oh also I'm mostly they're lying
yep yep that's a great introduction to
to Elm more questions or comments yeah
yes so that's Paul butcher and he wrote
seven concurrency models in seven weeks
a book that I edited that I didn't have
to do too much to you at all but the
question is why are we going to see more
than one language across the chasm this
time what's different this time around I
think the difference is the ability to
rapidly build a community that's
distributed I think that that's an
absolute game change so eric is one of
the members of the elixir core team and
I dropped a note to Joe's a saying I got
to hang out with Eric yesterday and Joe
say he said yes well then you've met him
before I did which is kind of a cool
thing they've been collaborating on a
new language that's that's gotten quite
a bit of buzz in and not just this
community but also in the Ruby community
that I come from and the two of the core
collaborators have never never met now I
think this is happening over and over
and you heard a hint of it with Katie or
you in the room Katie so okay yes and
the lambda ladies you were able to build
that community rapidly even though they
were across the world where you started
with five and now it's grown to over 200
that's absolutely different than
anything we faced before more questions
or comments yes
so I showed an example two examples in
elixir and one and elm do i think the
erlang will be across the chasm it's
only because of my familiarity with with
elixir I think that Erlang in some form
will absolutely cross the chasm you know
I think you saw the excite the reasons
for the excitement and the keynote this
morning this is really a revolutionary
time and you guys are right in the
middle of it yes you could be so so the
question the comment was how do we know
that we haven't already crossed the
chasm and with with 400 people in the
room here and with the activity in the
Erlang it's my impression that languages
like Erlang in Scala are as we speak
crossing the chasm but sometimes our
managers don't like to hear that and
sometimes talks like this can help us
with the language to convince our
management that that these types of
types of things are happening that's why
I'm giving language adoption talks in
conferences like this one great point
yes oh let's stop a crazy talk now so
the comment is well so yes yes yes
so the the question in the comment was
that you know fear not only can help you
motivate across the chasm they can also
push back and these are the stabilizing
fears that I mentioned and so what's
your name and John we've never we've
never met face-to-face but it's it's a
it's a pleasure to be in the same room
with you you're kind of one of my one of
my programming idols actually but the
comment was that fear makes languages
push back and so the sales machine in
our industry is absolutely loaded with
with fear and their names for you know
there are who i was surfing around on
wikipedia and i was finding the old
acronyms what a spud mean it means fear
uncertainty and doubt right so that's an
acronym that's that's about a sales and
a debating strategy called gosh what
fear I can't remember I can't remember
the name but there's there's a whole
branch of psychology about this this
type of about this type of motivation
and this this type of sales technique
where you know if we can spread enough
fear we can make that chasm far enough
far enough and wide enough that nothing
else can possibly cross it yeah great
point other comments yeah
okay so this is a great question the
question is how pure will the next will
the next paradigm be helped here will
the next language be and this was
basically what I talked about last year
with the snake bites concept and that
that basically the choices that we make
are basically made for business reasons
and sometimes if we're not careful we
can make the we can make the wrong
choice for the wrong motivations and as
John pointed out their marketing forces
that are happy to help us make those
those decisions so if you look at so
right now I see maybe five players that
are that are on the edge of the chasm
right now and some of those are more
pure than others one of the ones that's
the Leigh spear is JavaScript we're
starting to see a big push for
JavaScript and functional light concepts
in the JavaScript language and that's
absolutely a contender it has a lot of
the the same characteristics as the last
what 20 30 years of languages in the c++
syntax and you know some some weak spots
in the topping model that we haven't
seen or that we've seen for the last 20
years and then there's also the scholar
language that has some beautiful clean
concepts in it but there's also a lot
that's been left in the language and so
part of what's coming along with the
scala community is some internal strife
within that debt culture so it's not
just the dirty bits of the language that
are difficult but but some of the
toxicity in the community from the
object-oriented own twon't to let go and
the functional people that want to push
to be more clean so that's absolutely a
risk and my point to you is that you can
help make this decision that you get a
vote now you have a voice
if you talk about your concerns in a
more public way then we'll have a better
chance of more of the right languages
crossing the chasm okay so I think we're
out of time but thank you very much for
inviting me again
