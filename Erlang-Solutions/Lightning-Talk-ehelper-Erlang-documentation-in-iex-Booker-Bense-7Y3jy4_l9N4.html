old friend IEX and when I first started
out programming elixir one of the things
I really loved what you could just tab
your way into documentation all right
and it would tell you and you could
explore the entire elixir document space
just by hitting tab and you'll get this
great documentation and as you do enough
elixir eventually you need to use some
Erlang libraries and one of the tenants
of elixir is if there's a workable
Erlang implementation for something
where we whoever we are we're not just
going to write a stupid wrapper around
it right that's that doesn't help
anybody that just hides the fact that
you're running on the beam and and you
need to know Erlang so I thought well
yeah that's a great idea so I need to I
need to get a hash of a file and well
it's okay and then I got what I can't
spell oh well that's do code because
it's already loaded but that's one of
the if you don't know this trick about
IEX yet it won't it won't do tab
completion unless the module is already
loaded into the beam and one of the ways
you load and whenever you type something
into the H command it goes out and loads
that module into the beam so anyway so
we'll look at the tab we'll look at code
right oh cool we can that's cool and
then we price tab again look at all
those methods of not methods sorry
functions and now we're sad we have to
go type into Google or if we're lucky we
know the Earl mankind command but this
always bugged me and I went on the
internet and start talking to people and
and they told me well you know it's just
not possible to do this within IEX
because of the way the erlang
documentation it isn't you know part of
the beat the part of the the module and
then I thought well let's see how far I
can get on doing something impossible
and this is what I came up with oh ah
yes live demos okay all right and
essentially what my code does thank you
is it goes out and finds out where the
man pages are by guessing and then it
actually parses the n/r off in the man
pages and turns that into the output of
code get docs yeah
III know it's all in XML not for me no I
seriously I did I did looking at parsing
the XML and it it just didn't quite work
for I got more information out of the
end Rob somehow yeah I know it is but I
know it does but that's what I wrote so
and as you saw before it actually has
some limitations it can't find that I
can't I can't parse every function
because there's slightly different
variations of the man pages and I
haven't captured all the edge cases but
so now I have two commands for looking
up documentation and that's kind of dumb
so let's see if it works for the old
stuff and it does and the way that I did
this is I sort of reverse engineered the
how the h command works and I put a set
of pluggable document finder modules
behind my version of the well originally
I wanted to get this into a lecture
itself but that didn't work out for
whatever reason so i put document
finders behind the e command so there's
a pluggable a set of pluggable modules
back there that has a very standard
behavior and you can use that to
interface to any document system you
want
and I'll show you a quick
and essentially you what when you set
this up you you create a list of helpers
and the first one knows how to look up a
lick sir documentation and the second
one knows how to try and parse Erlang
documentation from the man pages and
there are other helpers I've written
I've written one set will interface with
dash you can also get URLs for hex web
pages and so forth and escape Oh go up
here all this code is available on
github what it'sit's in this little
organization i created just because i
wanted to learn how github organizations
work not because i'm actually ambitious
enough to run an organization so it's
it's all there it's gotten it acquires a
tiny bit of hacking Ritu get it to the e
command to work nicely you essentially
have to set you have to you have to set
the the path to search for beam files as
part of the IEX startup command and you
could do that with an environment
variable and it's all documented in
there and I hope it proves useful and
that's all I had to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
