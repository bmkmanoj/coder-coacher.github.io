and I would talk about
acta programming for natural user
interface so because time constrained
the original talk was like two hours and
something so i will focus in a main
topic which is effort p they found the
natural interface will be touch anyways
are going to use leap motion we're going
to describe put it is in a cup of slide
and you could have a code sample using
this device and i will introduce a
little bit here however all the material
get up they complete the food slide and
call the sample on github if you want to
go further down and check the rest of
the material so the this presentation
really I Jordan my experience that I had
building no one but few libraries
implementing functionality programming
in f-sharp so before start any Haskell
programmer here all right let's good
actually so I'm going to see coming the
idea actually came from the Haskell
world right and I get all my research
from that side and I brought it from in
the into F sharp so the agenda we're
going to cover of course what it is and
I will talk about the difference between
ratty programming and functionality
program there is a be a confusion
between these two terms the foundation
motivation behind a functionality
programming and then we're going to
cover two different lamentation right
one from the original paper and one from
the more modern paper of effort p and it
it will be more clear in the NL
following slides so the idea will cover
try to to keep day today the
presentation like fifty percent
theoretical okay and then jump in a code
and insist on some some code sample this
is the body slide about me i'm reaching
from italy but i spent the last 10 years
in in US where I run the local F sharp
user group
recently a switch company working for
stack views as a start-up in San
Francisco we do sport sadistic analogy
provide some natural language interfaces
all in f-sharp and currently I altering
a book about how apply functional
programming for building scalable
application and yes I do love pugs so
just to give you a high level before
start the day the main topic we're going
to use lip for the code sample but it's
going to be the last part and leap
anybody familiar with leap motion ok
cool a few of you good is a 3d motion
device right a user condition coordinate
is a plan with x y&amp;amp;z right and is able
to detect up to 100 frames per second
and really use a simple model that
detect the movement of your hand your
your fingertip your velocity your
stability and send up to to a controller
series over of the frame to an event
right you just handle the event and we
did you can actually apply some logic to
detect some gesture like swear you know
or you know circle and so on so it's a
pretty cool device is a not super
expensive things like seven sixty
seventy dollars it's a nice place 12 and
did the code and the game we're going to
play with when I will play but you can
come in after talking with is a the
paddle game that the inspiration come
from the ask all school expression book
which is a pretty nice simple read like
240 pages is a is a nice book I
recommended but what the interesting
about this book and there is the one
chapter the cover the functional
relative animation right and this
chapter is talk about how implement
offer p and they build this game and
they claim actually building 29 was code
so i was able to implement it using the
library in f-sharp I mean any guess you
know many lines 37
I know but we might tap classes in
f-sharp right anyway so let's start with
functionality programming right so what
is functional tpod I mean this is not
really an easy answer because there are
two sides of the spectrum where are an
academic part of the industry with you
know going to going to tell you that frp
is a values they change over time and
then there is another side within just
industry that is going to tell you that
functionality program is really like an
umbrella or said two different kinds of
terms right a definition and the problem
is that if you think about it here we
have three words right but if you
combine these three words you have
different kind of meaning right we have
functional programming first right and I
know like this kinda audience probably
cannot sell a great definition but you
know it's a paradigm the truth no
computation as well as an expression
they try to avoid Oh Troy avoid the
mutational state and also have very
important properties you know such as
you know composition which is my
favorite and the creative style and so
on but then you play again with these
three words and you get reality
programming right so in relatively mean
you know responsive to stimulus but
these days become really big with us
right if you if you build any kind of
Legation where you need a real time
component you are exposed to too graphic
techniques right and this has been a lot
of confusion between people because they
think that if you can apply i order
operation against the event such as you
know filter Map Reduce you're doing
functional programming this is not true
whether there is a very close relation
between ratty programming a functional
programming due to the fact that ratty
programming use functional constructor
to achieve composable event abstraction
so this is a F sharp briefly this event
Combinator's right you just combine a
composed event Combinator's to apply
high order
against event use the pipe operator just
to chain is a serious operation right so
this is a ratty programming but then we
have all the three words put together
which is the topic of today and this is
a talk about a paper of Kona alien and
polluted abroad 20 days ago and is about
composable dynamically involving values
over time right which mean you get
values divided over time avoid the
mutation estate-related idea of
functionality program is integrate time
flow a compositional event in in
functional programming so this
additional paper of frp that was written
in 97 and which described the first
implementation rate of functionality
programming and they use Haskell and
using an used implement front as
function right animation a library to
interact to interact with two
dimensional two dimensional images right
and Fran is based on an ocean of two
polymorphic data types that are
behaviors an event that will cover very
well in the comments lies in the cover
they devalue the change in continuous
and discrete times in this concept are
still used to do today modern
implementation by the way if you have
any question just yelling me you know
emiram a bit once so this is a sum of
the domain where functionality
programming aspire or all being used
right and really the idea of functional
programming is a provide this way to
express computation and avoid you know
the complexity compared to traditional
way so you can see note the relation to
tour with a graphical user interface at
the front end right and lately has been
heavily utilizing in virtual reality and
games
and it's becoming mainstream right
evolve really indifferent current
direction these days and with different
kind of implementation but you can see
again how this little bacon jas react to
GS or english on all their their own
implementation of effort p and we're
familiar with this library guess right I
mean at least you are about it but again
you can see how very there is this
relation of effort p with the front end
or anyways you I programming to me the
more interesting is helm because
different to the other is not only is a
framework right but what it does is
provide in a new language to make a
Fermi frp more digestible to programmers
right so what is our 4p so it is a
paradigm for building reactive system
right and provide these composable
abstraction for dynamics values in this
value have a very precise denotational
semantics and we cover them to show
semantically I guess in one slide or two
but it's a very simple concept is a
mathematical model and but the DRL is
used in effort p or should be using any
ways to build a very elegant vocabulary
around your AP is so there are too many
ideas the shape ever p right one I think
you know CEO probably right is that the
narrative which means that they use a
precise compositional semantics and
really specify the meaning or each time
and in building block and then we have
the temporal continuous which focus more
on the compositional aspect of effort be
right and user describe how compose in
this building block
so the notational semantics right is a
is a mathematical expression show the
formal meaning of your program or your
programming language right is a like
freezes it provides a mathematical
interpretation for your program
construct right so for instance when you
can use math to prove the correctness of
your program and so free so the notion
semantics is no interest to to express
the meaning your program showing what
the program does when you run right but
really II try to convert your program
for your native language to a more
mathematical expression right to a more
mathematical representation so in this
slide here we have a high schoo right
which language you're very strong
denotational semantics and you can see
here we have an expression right one to
n which pretty clear what it does get
all the number 1 to N and then with the
product which is pretty clear I is a
function that equivalent number the
product of the expression 1 12 so this
is a factorial function is pretty clear
intention right is that it's a factorial
function from a math text well this is a
the same right Brittany see right so
it's quite it's quite clear which way to
language ever strong denotational
semantics and what is important about
the notation semantics is the
compositional aspect right is out you
can compose and construct the different
denotational part of your program so the
benefit and motivation really fit quite
well in enthalpy and connor elliott is a
very strong opinion regarding limitation
semantics in this paper and really as i
mentioned early is a great mechanism
for building an elegant vocabulary
around your API but mostly really what
is either invention is paper the
attentional semantic lead to a simple
design right and we dead simple design
are easier to reason about right and
allowed us to provide us the opportunity
to reasoning the further down more
deeply to build a more complete
elaborated library API so really the the
goal here are an elegant semantic balls
reusable abstraction plus you alright so
let's start finally to build our domain
right so I 4p is implemented by
different data types and the first one
is the time which is a cover today they
denote the domain of the real numbers
which in f-sharp is float so and the
reason the choice of continuous time is
because provide a more composable a
modular programming model I compared
with the one they use discrete time and
I'm going to cover discrete and
continuous time in the next slide
briefly but really modularity is about
modeling right and effort team achieve
modeling through continuous time so I
talked about a bit continuous time the
middle screen time so just give a
definition of three different time here
I to calif I the confusion but
continuous time well think about your
clock right you check that your clock
you get a value and take a look later on
you'll get a different value because
always the time continue to flow under
the scene right discrete-time well this
particular right is like think about the
mouse right continuous time is the
motion the mouse continuous move but
when you click them out this is discrete
right so you know when this happened
just
according when they the user click the
mouse and then we have virtual time this
is more interesting because real time is
used from by libraries such as rattle
extension or other more relative
programming libraries and beautiful time
really the idea can switch the
concurrency model at any time the
computation to run I or the operation
regardless the time ask aspect right
which means that you can rerun this
torical data and rerun or other you know
I operation regardless if the x term is
ten years ago you can run today any
questions so far all right and dice
bring it to the probably the most
important block right so this is the
central data types of frp which is which
is behavior and some time is called
signal right in modern plement ation
like Elm is it's not true behavior but
sort of and behavior is a polymorpha
data type which evolves you know over
time which means that it every single
time you get a different values right so
semantically behavior is just a function
from time to value and as I mention like
notated the mouse movement the motion is
continuous right that's so well we have
an example later so with these simple
types now we can define already few
function I web the time behavior which
is you know time to time which is the
identity function okay then we have the
behavior always return the same value
which is a constant behavior and then we
have a behavior that increase of this
type of 2.5 as an increase of 7.5 the
speed right and this is nice because now
I can describe or did the speed on an
object with a function
so this is a ni can build my first
implementation of my API and actually
this come from the idea of the first
original paper right and that my my
first F sharp a library is implemented
using these this idea we're going to
cover later in a code sample and them
but with this API can also rewrite my my
function right so I can use the lift one
just to provide you know the function
include speed 7.5 right so the lift
function just you know take a value and
just you know lift in a new world and
just bring in a box of the behavior type
but so behavior continuous right but
sometime behavior need something right
we need something to react to behavior
so when something to react so behavior
can change can be created or can be
updated right so that's why we need
event an event is a polymorphic type
that can have a value or not in this
discrete and either represented as a
time ordered sequence of time value
pairs and the time is monotonically
non-decreasing because of course the
time is continuous right so for each
value there is a specific time stamp
right which represent the time when the
event occur a nearly just can represent
an event that like for instance fire of
a three-second and increase the time of
2.5 dispute so briefly here how can we
buy time here okay so super fast here
and think about the mouse right so if
you want to check if the mouse inside a
rectangle right with a classic event
view the event are represented as a
discrete the position are in there is a
discrete right vent which is not only
true frp it should be continuous so with
the true effort p
the position is a behavior so my mouse
position is a function time to position
okay in this case so I create a
rectangle which is a two-state behavior
through false pass into argument which
is are not to a stream of a rectangle
and that I check the coolant position
you see I use the parentheses because I
sample the behavior to check to get the
current position and return true or
false the state of the bowels inside so
keep in mind how this implemented
because then we're going to see how you
cannot implement it using the more
modern implementation all right so the
cool part to me is that the review this
association or behavior of a value in
time right so here the mouse the move is
not a classic representation on the
coordinate X Y it'll be a function of
time to value right so I to sample that
and they the circle here just when you
click the mouse and this is just
discreet alright this is so cool right
so but how you play mental yourself
because I will discuss about the theory
right but so according with the color
halyard I'll put the link there and you
can you know check online your answer in
Stack Overflow I swear it said you know
I for peace so easy you can ferment it
yourself well sort of right mean to me I
mean I get involved in at 4p and I get
more and more excited the modern make my
research about 4p is to me is a very
fascinating topic right so we have
beautiful Semantic Web behavior they're
only time to function time to value you
can express program you know with with
equation reasoning and n and with event
but still you know is not simple so
there to summarize pretty much what we
saw so far and how we answer this stack
overflow question these are the four
main point to implement you know the
effort p which is in a temporary
modeling which
the behavior aspid which is first class
then we have event which covered the
discrete side and our first class value
the decorative activity it covered the
fact that behavior are expressed in term
or reaction to event right because
behavior can change or update according
to some event in the polymorphic media
just we're going to see later are just
all the set of Combinator's that you can
use to combine these two data types so
great but it was until I read this paper
probably for my fourth time right and
this I this is one of my favorite paper
because I associated with good memories
I might wake a time right you know when
you read the paper and actually funny
you gather you feel smart for once so I
was struggling implementing my first
library and then I was reading his paper
and actually a pretty much will tell me
the answer or how to overcome my
problems right so this paper this is the
link and I recommend is a is a nice read
it covers and how we implement the old
paper from a more modern perspective
right introduced concept that weren't
there in originally 97 like Mona dan
duplicative founders but what really
opened my mind and really make me
understand was the fact how he was able
to revert from the pooling to the
pushing right because the first original
paper to get the value from a behavioral
right to ask for a ride to sample but
there are some problem with that right
think about if they behavior constant
why should was for the same value over
time or maybe if a behavior depend upon
some event an event didn't fire didn't
happen why it was for the same value
right so anyways it was able to revert
from bully to pushing that a thinker by
knows who is way better their reactivity
so this is the the new behavior data
types the modern one which have the
notion of reactive values right
I am the compulsive behavior in two
components right which is racket values
this which are independent of time and
then we have the time function which are
dependent on a vent so we have relative
values and no reactive time function so
really the idea here is a considering
behaviors a chain of phases right
because now you can see that the
behavior is calling itself right and
every time an event happen a new
behavior phase materialized right so
maybe a new behavior is created or a
behavior is updated and in these phases
are themself phase right so really the
dr really is that behavior is followed
by the new behavior right with a time
when when when you make the change so
this is the cool part right we have to
function like the identity function at a
time time to time or the pure function
but the cool part here look at it this
is f sharp keyword wreck when you have a
recursive function right well why is
that because if you see now with the
other activity aspect of the behavior
now the behavior eventually call himself
in a potato himself right
I'm no I'm not sure if this is correct
this is it works but it's still working
process this is the so the first library
was for a real project that is is
working I left the company now but
nobody called me this is a more approval
concept the second library but it seems
working to this is poor like an
interpretation so as I mentioned now
with a modern implementation that they
did it was written 2007 now we can
compose behavior and create you know a
different kind of pie so now behavior
are an applicative right so leave the
pure function just take a behavior and
bring in a behavior word and then so we
can leverage the fact that what we
already know about applicative right
with all the laws and in the dispersal
occasion the comforter with that so if
you remember this is the same function
when I calculate the position of the
mouse inside the rectangle now we can
rewrite the same using this different
API and the most important function is
the apply operator right which applies a
time varying function to a tiny violin
value at each point in time right I
think this is pretty cool event this day
event epi you're going to see in a code
sample but event that never happened the
second one is in infix operator by just
emerged take to event to the same type
it on the event and other few operate
for the herb this is still come from
interpretation of the push and pull
paper right this is a I going to try to
go quick into the next tues line in time
jump in a code
this is a the behavior the only one that
I want to point out here that I think is
a more useful is the accumulator because
sometime I'm going to see most of our
operational system of libraries provide
in no event is so discrete event instead
there's continuous time something like
position right there should be behavior
so there's a trick sometime use
accumulator they take an initial value
right and in an event and producer
behavior now the event easily become a
producer a producer right so and it keep
updating the value of the behavior so
sometime use this trick to convert an
event to a behavior the switch operator
and also this is interesting because it
take up I behavior in event with a
behavior right so you take you start
with the state okay and when they went
fire what happen is which behavior but
now the cool part is that you can use a
recursively right you keep switching
between behavior okay now let's talk
about code right any question about this
part all right so let's jump in a code
so I have a what time is finished here 3
40 point quarter to four so I have 15
minutes okay alright so I gonna run
through the first implementation which
is the boring one so we're going to
spend no more than two minutes so I did
to code sample one the body one which is
the bank account because I want spend
more time there we choose the first
implementation and I'm going to play
with it with wheel with the game so the
idea here the bank account you create
the event we know and we can have a
deposit and get some cash a we drove you
can merge the two event using the merge
operator right mirchi to event together
now this is the example you accuse the
accumulator right so I have the event
you have an initial value which is the
initial initial balance which is passing
a constructor here going to be zero and
pass my function that keep updating the
initial value for the value than coming
right in f-sharp everything is a
function so that put the plus infinity Z
is a function but this is the same that
right you know fern be equal I mean
function a plus B it worked the same
okay to put it and now you can see here
as a first implementation when i change
my balance account I to sample right
they did the new value in the trick here
I just pass using the same function a
new value to the event and when I get
some cash I just passed the event they
mean that every day they the amount with
a negative value pretty simple so again
this is nothing sexy I just have some
value here I just run it so just to
prove that it works right you start with
some Miss Holly 10 pull hundred-dollar
take some money out and this is all
happening donita using a venti behavior
which are implemented
this library now this is the library the
tub in working production and thinking
but so this was a build the first time
to interrupt with a imperative language
so the behavior follow the same
signature but is passed through a
constructor which means that the
majority of the function here belong to
the instance of the constructor like
like for instance the map function here
belong to the instance of construction I
hear the signal till you can see a to b
and return behavior be where the
behavior head is actually the current
object however in f-sharp in a sharp I
can create a module to extract all this
function and expose in a more functional
manner right I'm not going to going to
tell how this is library is implemented
download the code and in play this is no
is a is a probably like 400 Linus code
but let's go to the game engine right so
let's run the code here so okay so as I
mentioned it motion here this comes from
the inspiration day you know ask of
school expression book and the idea here
is that is all I behavior in a vent so
we have the ball actually that travel
with a velocity and direction which are
behaviors never change until some event
happen maybe a collision right hit the
wall or the Palo now even the game as a
state right which is now is game on but
it can happen that you know if the boat
doesn't hit the Palo well the state of
the game also change the behavior switch
in this game over right so how this is
implemented this follow more the rule of
the first implementation right so i
define my type here using the reactivity
version
right web behavior and we have event but
the cool part how this is implemented
are going to call the leap motion
leather here going to go here it is part
here the idea really where to me a for
purely come a super powerful that you
really build all your behavior like they
represent your domain your game right
the behavior the ball that you know the
velocity or the position and then the
event that can change the speed and then
you just compose them together right so
for instance you start with the
conditional position right which is a
predicate behavior the check if the ball
right now is between positive one
negative one which are they did the two
wall of my window game okay and if he's
inside is true condition why the same
this is a more tricky because a to cover
also did the bottom one because that's
where the game over behavior happened
right now I put a signature here in the
comment just to be clear but so the
conditional game over here is a behavior
they take a float and return the bullet
right well when the position why on my
ball is negative one right is which the
behavior to false which means game over
so I start to build all this component
of the block and then in their hand are
going to compose them together the leap
motion well this is just a class that I
mean a function is I used to get the
current position of my lip motion right
my hand briefly finger here so give to
party to right 22 against leap motion
one is the controller which endo pretty
much all the the
in the event and then the listener which
they wanted to build to handle event now
for the listener the more important
event there are several but is the own
frame right which happened when i
detectin frame like a movement the
problem with that char mean dated with
on frame in the lip is not trade safe I
don't know why they build this way but
you know if you handle like 100 frame
per second it would be careful right so
the good thing about F sharp I can
leverage you know some primitive
building in language like the agent
right so I can every time there is an
event on the frame receive I can push my
frame to my agent I can send here do
some calculation this case I just remove
the y and z because I just need X you
know less the right movement and keep
recursively the state on my calculation
right so every time that I need a value
I going to ask my aging without get oh
my god this doesn't play well doesn't
that bother you that in Windows is up
down the track ball in in mac is they
were they so use the get message to the
agent to get the last calculation you
have I always keep the last so you have
trade safety and every time you ask for
a value you get always the latest that
you need and here is this post like with
the leap motion function pretty simple
so this is where I was telling about the
bed approach and good approach right the
bed approach is that unfortunately I
even leap motion you give you the
dataframe in the position as discrete
right instead to be like to be a
continuous over time so a trick is to
create your event and they use the
accumulator with initial value that
their tuna behavior right and the event
just keep producing new value updating
behavior a better approach with their
activity
implementational behavior you know you
can just pass the value of the lip
position at a crucial we call insult it
just updated myself okay now i have the
behavior i can build the behavior of my
lip motion position which i had to make
the trick because now I have the
x-coordinate which is a point right I
just have to add the size of my paddle
which is I use the applied wada to
compose the two behavior and that's it
now I start to build the rest of my
behavior with the coordinate of the ball
the conditional event bounce event as
the name implies happy when the ball hit
the wall right so it start the one's
behavior is a function they take is a
predicate behavior right so when they
behavior satisfy then you sorry when the
event satisfied is the D behavior is
trigger and updated right and they be
here in the update it only take the
first event the value of an eternity new
event so in this case I just compose now
the velocity ball behavior with the
bounce event okay i use accumulator i
have the initial value 03 because if you
remember when you start the game the
ball slightly go left to right okay and
just start to compose all these d
behavior together now the same thing
with a why you know the velocity for the
vertical velocity
and now I update my coordinator I my
velocity my position the ball behavior
and now i just updated together now in a
book there is this a integrative which
is a conventional name which is said in
the book when you one apply some extra I
know a semester phone functionality but
math to change the value D behavior I
during the process right in here to
apply some some physic when you do the
speed because you know some gravity when
you go up them down so on but it's just
conventional this is often related so
now I've depa dated of the coordinator
to my ball x the same for the Y and
that's it now I've created all my
behavior and just compose them together
right I create my conditional exit which
is fire when the ball go negative one
okay which is a predicate and just
switch the behavior right so in this
case is a practical ones behavior so
start with one behavior which is game on
time over five minutes okay yeah I one
down here so I've the game state and the
conditional exit is so now i use my is a
cute behavior until is which right so
now the game is on and keep playing
until the conditional excellent which is
when the ball is negative 1 fire and it
switch it to behavior which is game over
okay so i know is are a lot of code to
go through in a short time but generally
the beauty to me is that it's very
simple you have in your mind you're a
behavior i gave a ball yeah just you
know you go x and y you build your
your-your-your coordinated your speed
you just compose them and then you're
just the behavior when the game is
on a little in on and over and you just
compose them all right so I show you the
boarding example about the bank account
I think I can just we are pretty much
over time so I just conclude here so
give you the link where you can download
the code right value to summarize to me
frp very exciting topic right especially
think in the future how or virtual
reality you're going to I think heat the
industry in an in-game I think that it's
something that you want to take a look
build your own is fun trust me you know
it's a proof of concept read the papers
is a it's not that complex like in a
couple weeks you come out with with a
very nice solution and really going to
start understand the domain so that's
all I have question and here's the link
where you can download the code in this
light but to think i give you the slide
in a secretary okay any question
do we have any questions f sharp sorry
do kind of problem
strange seas so I think that they did
the great part about sharp is the
expressiveness i express the domain
right and then is a functional language
so a lot of positive aspect from there
right it just works but really i think
that is succinct so I before I come from
like six here in c-sharp and then I move
in f-sharp for four years right and then
before that I will be experienced in a
high school and I like to preview
language in general too but really what
I like about a sharp is that you just
build you your domain you express your
data types and then your functional
regular types and really it is very
productive you just able to come out
with a prototype or a working program in
a very way in a very short time
comparing to other imperative language
like Java C sharp any more questions
okay i think is it right let's thank our
