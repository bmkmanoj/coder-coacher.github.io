coming we're going to be talking about
some really cool topics so while the
cool kids don't use airline oh let me
wrap the track host is not available so
let me introduce myself I'm Garrett
Smith programmer cloudBees you might
know some of the videos I've done during
the movie part 2 the sequel of course
that the sequel not the original MongoDB
is web-scale so that's my side project
I'd like to use Earling I use Erlang so
much as I can on a daily basis I think
it's a great language and I'm a fanboy I
mean I'm the most rabid that you'll see
but I want to try to breathe some
sobriety into my own enthusiasm here so
I'm just going to kind of calm down
we're going to talk sort of rationally
today so incidentally throwing tomatoes
and other things is fun but do it on
Twitter it's even more fun when you do
it on Twitter so use the hashtag EUC
2014 and that's me
look forward to the Buse okay so the
cool kids that's an indirection of an
indirection the first interaction comes
from and I don't know if this is sort of
worldwide but in the u.s. there's sort
of this niche kora clique called the
cool kids the cool kids are the kids in
the nape and the playground they're
always dressed cool and they have you
know the best girlfriends and boyfriends
and those are the cool kids and you know
I was never a cool kid so you like to
make fun of the cool kid see you know
you study hard and learn our land do
other things and you make fun of the
cool kids so that's the first in
direction the second in direction is the
video called all the cool kids use Ruby
and this is of course me making fun of
sort of technology fashion fashionistas
technologists so-called
who allow aesthetics or a sense of
beauty but in a sort of capricious weird
arbitrary sense rather than physics
rather than hard engineering problems so
this is right for fun now if you haven't
seen the video you can now and
afterwards you'll know what the heck I'm
talking about here but as it applies to
today oh let me go through yeah good
back up a second does it applies today
the Earling is is probably
you can appreciate that in this room
Erlang is very popular fair or you see
and it's in Stockholm so I think it's
safe to say that Erlang is very very
popular here but in general erling is
not that popular okay so here we have
two-dimensional plot of languages the
bottom axis here is popularity rank on
github and popularity rank on
stackoverflow every we can see that fine
I'm a can barely see it here so so let
me point out where lling is there are a
couple of a few neighborhoods here I'm
going to point these out Earling is up
here and there are two neighborhoods
that I can kind of spot there's the
super this is really the popular group
this is popularity up here this is kind
of another neighborhood
we've got Scala Haskell closure Lua or
line CoffeeScript go ActionScript GUI
erling is over here up here we have Java
JavaScript PHP c-sharp Ruby sepal you've
heard of these you publish to the CSS
you for the CSS so Earling is not in the
top and here's another view and this
kind of shows you this is a lang pop
this is an index generated by weighting
of other particular sources and in this
case is an even weight of github Google
files
Olo Craigslist and Google search so it's
a different view but we have a similar
neighborhood so here we have Erlang
grouped again with this new usual
suspect Scala Lua oughta ADA sorry
Pascal Haskell list closure Erlang there
it is right of a Fortran excellent so so
I mean you know I don't know if it's
controversial for me to say that the
cool kids don't use Erlang I'm pretty
sure it's not I'm not here but in
general so so what's the basis of i why
am I even doing this thing this is
motivated by what I call the bike shed
thread in the other lying user questions
list and this happened a couple months
ago and it was very interesting because
not much actually happens that sort of
passionate and emotional in the Erlang
list and people like that somehow I get
bored there I'm like well what some
excitement so we had somebody from the
Java community come in and we had some
people from 0 mq community come in and
they were new and they were interested
in learning more about Erlang and there
was a one thread that was started and it
had it started with this topic of OTP
and reading
OTP and it sort of went into a whole
bunch of other things and it seemed to
to Center at least from my point of view
on topics of usability and grok ability
understanding darling that was my
interpretation so of course this is a
really interesting topic to me I'm
passionate about usability grok ability
teaching adoption getting people onto
the planta using her lang and solving
great problems with this tool so I was
just being being yeah okay great that's
a great question so and I would get
pinged literally offline private
messages on email from my friend saying
stop feeding the trolls don't do that
don't you're ruining everything this is
terrible and I'm like I just like what
are you talking about I mean we're
having I thought a reasoned discussion
about you know these different topics
and and it's like what so so okay fine
you're getting emotional this is unusual
you're directing at me okay that's fine
what is the problem here so the problem
seemed to be this topic of bike shedding
so a bike shedding I had never heard
this before I'd tried to look it up so
with Wikipedia I Wikipedia it and here
we go there's a really really good
descriptive term it comes from a story
from C Parkinson back in 1957 or so and
was talking about a atomic energy
facility reactor and the discussion was
brought up about a very technical
technical problem and very few people
even understood the problem and so very
few people contributed to the discussion
but then the agenda moved to the color
of the bike shed and everyone could
understand the color of the bike shed
and everyone had an opinion so the
debate was roaring and and very robust
and and and so there's this descriptor
to describe what happens in a list or in
a community or discussion around
something that people consider to be
trivial well you know it's trivial but
really what it is is it's easily
understood and a topic of what you name
something what you call something
everybody can sort of intuitively
understand and everyone has an opinion
and so we had this rallying of opinions
about how to understand something and
how to describe something and how to
think and I'm just like yes this is
really really important stuff but there
was a huge element a huge element I mean
there's people like what happened to the
they're laying list I'm resigning I
this is terrible let's fork the entire
thing and and the issue here is very
reasonable it is a bike shedding dynamic
where there are a lot of people on the
list who are very concerned about hard
problems and that's why people like
Erlang it's why people like the list
it's while people like the community
brilliant community brilliant people
discussing very very difficult problems
and so when it seemed it felt like we
are now moving into territory which was
the color of the bike shed oh my
goodness what what could possibly be
worse for for for Erlang so I handle
emotions you know I try to like buckle
down and get really rational so I'm like
well what's going on here it seems to me
a dichotomy you've got you know on the
one hand people who just don't think
adoption usability will you name
something the learning process it cetera
is that important because really at the
end of the day if you have a hard enough
problem you'll power through that stuff
and we do that if we have a hard enough
problem we will push through all the
barriers to adoption and we'll adopt it
so they've done it I've done it you've
done it we've all done it so when
somebody comes in and just like look if
your problem isn't hard enough or
challenging enough to solve with Erlang
to justify your investment in reading
study etc etc etc then maybe would be
more at home someplace else and you know
respectfully respectfully except to me
offline so what I want to do in this
case is I actually want to measure this
so what's important to you it's
important to me what's you know there is
no absolute standard but we can do is
ask and we can do some you know some
science maybe it's a mature science but
we can nonetheless do science and we can
say what is important you know what is
the problem
you know what you know what it cetera
you know and then collect this and
measure it so what this is is data so
I'm providing data now again as a sort
of scientific you know data scientist
statistician this is probably this is
probably not this is the material for a
thesis so if those are you want to poke
holes in methodology etc that's fine I
accept that but it is some observation
and I'm going to try to you know do as
good elaborate what the methodology is
and and
how things are computed etc so you can
poke holes in it but what for me this is
is simply an observation and when you
have data it changes the way you think
maybe for good or for bad
it lets you - it lets you think
differently and then it informs your
next decision that's my expectation here
this is not to go measure and come up
with a bunch of firm conclusions not at
all I have some speculative questions
some some possible things to think about
but this is really about measurement and
so I'm not going to try to push them
past that okay so let's talk about the
survey methodology so what I want to do
is talk about what the survey is so you
have an idea of what I was asked of
curiosity how many people filled the
survey and this is the Erlang survey
100k this five thank you that's right on
in so this is a big community we got a
lot of results and I deliberately went
outside the community in within the
community outside and we have the data
on you know sort of different collectors
how the original messages went out and
we can differentiate that so if you want
to dive in the data sets are available
the summarized data sets are available
so they're anonymized if something wants
to go do more harder science on this
it's available but the methodology in
general is really simple I didn't want
to prescribe a bunch of I didn't want to
make this difficult so I just said type
this in so the questions that are
freeform questions so the content that
we're going to look at today is is
freeform apart from demographics I
wanted this to be completed in five
minutes or less I didn't want to burden
people I wanted enough people to get
into this and provide input so that we
would have something it was significant
in size so I have demographics as I said
for control I tried to create questions
that I felt were a minimal set so
basically every question was was was you
know the answers could theoretically be
useful so I didn't want to ask something
that was was not useful okay so here are
freeform questions very simply what is
your general impression of Erlang so
this allows somebody it's just to type
but there's no there's no prescription
good or bad what's your impression some
people said great and other people wrote
you know for pairs for detail paragraphs
so that was the goal
whatever's on your mind tell me for what
situation is the second question for
what situations would you consider using
your way so it was interested to
understand how people perceived our land
so yes a general impression but more
specifically how would you apply this so
what problems do you see Erlang as being
useful for and that would sort of inform
you know helped me to understand helped
us to understand where folks are coming
from when they look at our line so
what's the messaging and what's the
perception about how you'd use this
thing what challenges do you see in
adopting or lying for a project and this
is this is a very interesting question
it's a softly put question I you know
it's just challenges I don't want to say
what problems you have I say you know in
adopting Erlang these are carefully I've
thought about these and I just the goal
is look just tell me what's our
challenges you kind of ease into it and
we got everything from from very strong
you know borderline emotional responses
to I have no idea why you know actually
what the other one would be to you know
no challenges at all absolutely none no
barriers so a wide range of responses
well languages or frameworks would you
consider as alternatives to airline so
interested in what other people are
looking at I think this is useful this
could help us to look at those
communities those languages to you know
consider how those are structured
functionally technically as well as
culturally incidentally this is not
necessarily an alternative to airline
well it is an alternative generally
that's exactly what the question said
many people didn't many people said well
I would use it use something in addition
to it so but that's what that's in the
text what about Erlang or its ecosystem
libraries community governance etc would
you change so this is the you know if
you can wave a magic wand how would you
how would you make things different okay
so these are the demographics so those
are the qualitative questions of those
are all text-based this is the
demographics how many years have you
been working with software I'm going to
kind of move through this because it's
not bad interesting it's more used for
control it was interested in like you
know narrowing a field this is available
less than five years between five and
ten and more than 15 basically I want to
get an idea are you are you new to
software are you experienced over
fifteen ten years are you someplace in
the middle well look at the results in a
minute how many programmers do you work
with on a regular basis
by myself between one and five and more
than five so this is my sort of split
easily dropped are you working
individually on a small team or a large
you know I consider more than five to be
quite large today historically that is
certainly not the case but I think the
results are okay what is your role in
choosing a language for a project so
this is sort of influenced alas I have
no implement not much input I provide
some input but ultimately someone else
decides I consider an input from others
but usually have the final word and
which one of these roles you plan your
organization are you a programmer sort
of a designer or an architect or are you
in the business side and people could
answer more than one of these all right
okay so I had 100 anyone responses and
then just four were skipped because they
were they didn't either fill information
in or their roles or it's just for
though so it wasn't bad okay
how many years this is a demographic so
the question here is who answered this
so this going to give you an idea of who
participated and I think the result of
this will just show us that this is an
informed group of people so very few you
know very new to software and those who
had between 15 years in over 15 years
roughly split so he has this is an
experienced group of developers how many
programs do you work with on a regular
basis see a relatively small amount by
themselves and then between small team
what roughly about a third and then more
than five so I would consider a large
team about half and then what is the
role that you use not much influence I
have some input ultimately in the final
word you can see that by and large
people either have some influence or
they are quite you know they're the
decision-maker ultimately so we're
talking we're talking about an audience
that can make things happen and finally
which of these roles you play in the
organization program or architect
designer and that's the layout so what's
the conclusion here of this demographic
I think it's reasonable to conclude
these things they're very experienced
working teams
highly influential highly technical
articulate one of the things that
impressed me by reading through these
one you know almost 180 surveys people
are very very articulate and respectful
and thoughtful I can't believe the
quality of these I was it was stunning
to see what the community has produced
ok so that's some background there
let me talk about the free form so this
is the methodology avoid biasing with
predefined options we talked about that
manually summarize the text fields into
lists and this took a while so what I
did is if somebody took the time to - I
read everyone and I summarized everyone
somebody took the time to type something
I took the time to write it I also took
the time to think fairly hard about what
they were saying and map their points
into tags and the tags represent sort of
a representation of an idea and I'll
show you some examples of that so this
is a way that I can quantify this
qualitative result so the goal again was
to get people to input and then I want
to build a measure it so this is a
fairly labor-intensive process but I
think it's worth it so then count the
tags for question and then represent
these using a tag cloud and we'll see
what that looks like in a minute and
then finally in the tag cloud you look
at some some things had some big
outliers and I was interested to see
what things look like when you pluck the
outliers out sometimes that's that's
just as interesting as the is the first
result okay here is a sample answer and
tag list and this is representative of a
quality of the response I'll just read
it
relying on guess though is what about
the Erlang and it's eco system would you
change so this is sort of hey you can
have some constructive criticism here
relying on github is the de facto go-to
location for Erlang libraries is a bit
of a weakness having a non-commercial
foundation supported master location
which can be mirrored for packages would
be a major plus an additional concern is
the way EEPs are managed and published
there's no real status progress
indicators etc documentation could be
more friendly for users the official
documentation structures a bit difficult
to navigate and makes absolutely no
sense when approached when approaching
Erlang as a new user
I believe relaxed calm is easier to
navigate I believe etc so now what I
took this I said okay you talked about
package management here so I have
packaged under manager this is an
earlier link term I'll show you the full
term in a second so of course I wanted
to store the data as they're laying
terms why wouldn't I
package repository mentioned that eep
process and so I went through and sort
of made these up and then I'd normalize
them so that would be consistency across
them it's not perfect I'm sure that
there are bugs I'm sure that there are
mistakes but I think for practical
applications and certainly our
discussion it's it's going to be
effective this is the the result and
this data the the summarized data the
are available
on a github project and I'll reference
that at the end but this is an example
of going from the raw text to a
summarized version so this is an early
term this is an ID so the collector
means where it came from this is the
impression loved it bad string support
application didn't mention anything here
challenges finding developers
alternatives occupy thon to change etc
okay so with that I can easily run a
nice Erlang program in a script which is
also available to count these to
generate word word lists so we can graph
them in a clock tag that make sense
who's interested in the actual results
here anyone you guys want me to talk
about methodology I can go on about
methodology who wants more messin I'm
just kidding okay the results okay what
is your general impression of airline
this is the first tag Klaus who prepare
your eyes so again as you're looking at
this and absorbing it this is reflecting
the number of counts of a particular
word the words themselves are normalized
so if somebody said I loved it I said
love or just loved it so there's some
there's some you know combinations here
and it's not perfect but for the most
part we can see that Erlang loves things
that are hard to learn that's
interesting no don't interpret it that
way this is tempting to think that that
airline developers or this community is
masochistic it's not the case these are
simultaneous things they exist in
parallel I love this thing but also it's
hard to learn these things jump out that
is a big result passionate passionate
passionate love I mean you've got other
things like brilliant fantastic
life-changing is probably in there
someplace
really overwhelming positive response
but also really overwhelming impression
that this thing is a to learn all right
so let me take these two outliers out
these are outliers so I want to take
these out of the cloud the tag cloud and
then review it and let that sort of make
it
impact so what do we see when I remove
love and remove hard to learn what it
look like Joe Joe's message has
apparently gotten across to people it is
a concurrency oriented letter you
thought I was asking you questions it's
confused like why are you talking to me
and why are you giving a presentation
talking to me Joe's book has on there
you know a concurrency or for
programming for a concurrent world
concurrency oriented language this has
gotten across people view it as a
concurrent language I think that's
accurate I think that's good but this is
another outlier so what's the next wave
here now this is gets a little bit more
interesting and things start to become a
little bit more balanced but you know
simple good yeah that's not bad it's not
love but it's good Oh bad syntax that
kind of jumps out there functional fault
tolerant you know bad documentation
scalable so you know the general
impression you get a feel of the results
here remember it's data I'll do some
interpreting shortly yeah interpreting
so for what situations would you
consider using airline again this is to
understand do people what people think
of this in terms of the application and
lo and behold servers really pops up and
servers could be referenced as
long-running demons demons services
backends so I sort of lump these
together as servers it just means
software that runs on a server someplace
it's unattended so we see some other
things but let's pluck servers out
because it's such an outlier we have a
more balanced view here and this is
generally the mantra right when you talk
about Erling when your friends ask you
so what's the thing with Erlang looks so
great well it's fault tolerant or its
fault fault tolerant concurrent reliable
these are the types of applications are
the types of problems people view Erlang
as being good for and web shows up here
as an interestingly large representation
so it is I don't think tell coach you
know telco may show up someplace but
it's very small so we did not pull
Ericsson Erlang programmers or
necessarily people from this community I
think five people raised their hand so
the people at the community at large
shows web web is a central you know
people have understood
that Erlang as a concurrent language is
a nice server-based language is good for
web applications that's you know will
behold what challenges do you see in
adopting Erlang for a project so you
might have a hard time seeing this
because it's buried in the middle but if
you look where I'm pointing you see this
little thing here it's finding
developers when I read through this
I knew maybe 1/3 of the way that this
was going to be a huge outlier I just
knew it because there's just like
finding developers finding developers
finding developers by Oh find really
finding developers is a problem it's
tempting I think right now to think
that's great I'm an ER laying developer
and obviously there are in super high
demand this is actually not what this is
saying let's go to the next time we're
moving I'm removing the outlier right
I'm going to route so we're gonna look
at it with the outliner remove so what
is this I believe and this is a bit of
an interpretation but it's based on this
this is a summary of the results that
are that are in from this it isn't
because there's this huge demand for
Erlang programmers and a limited supply
it's because there's a very small non
volatile market furling programmers it's
non-volatile meaning there aren't a lot
of transactions going on people hiring
and we may think it is because we live
in a fairly small insulated community
when somebody gets a job like wow that's
great there's a great deal it's this is
this is this is the general complaint
hard to learn remember that one it's
hard to learn that means it's difficult
to get people to become there's friction
there's barriers there adoption if
there's a problem people will look at
early and say it's not adopted right so
that represents risk so there aren't a
lot of jobs as a result so there aren't
a lot of Erling programmers manager
buy-in very very commonly cited as a
barrier you know how do I get this sold
to my boss when nobody's using it there
aren't any programmers so it's a bit of
a vicious cycle when you don't have a
robust market you don't have a robust
market it's two sides supply and demand
though it's difficult to see the demand
when you have a limited supply
it's limb
to see to supply when you have limited
demand and this show this shows up quite
a bit in the survey and then finally
I've removed hard to learn here just to
see what you can see the same thing
developer knowledge manager Byun pops
out adoption pops out but then you see
some of these you know sort of insulator
or tertiary results documentation
library completeness commonly commonly
cited package management build tools
complexity type systems etc this is a
good slide I think you take the first
two outliers out and this sort of gives
you a good reflection of sort of the
second or third tertiary challenges that
people have what languages or frameworks
would you consider as alternatives this
is sort of an interesting point very
interesting in that in the popularity
indexes this was the neighborhood for
the most part go came up a lot Scala and
closure came up a lot haskell came up a
lot interestingly not surprisingly none
came up a lot Python or Earling is quite
different and you would expect that
people understand that it is unique in
there is no replacement so that came up
quite a bit
python elixir etc elixir is i think it's
this yeah acha acha by the way in scala
or we're tied in so that these results
are some cases I left out Scala here so
Scala could have been a little bit
bigger but anyway it gives you a feel
for what people are looking at as
alternatives to airline
what about Erlang or ecosystem libraries
communities governments would you change
and the opinions here doesn't matter
here these are the results all right so
there's an outlier here again buried
actually there are a few here that pop
out but this one is quite big
documentation it is cited in a huge
percentage of the results problems with
documentation and in particular when we
talking about documentation it's the
idea of how do I get started how do I do
something very few complaints about
reference guides almost all of them had
to do with getting started how do I do
something tutorials how do I solve a
particular problem with Erlang there
this I can speak to my personal
experience this is you know lacking I
think this is difficult and it's
certainly reflected in the results here
let's take documentation out what do we
see this is really very good
representation this my intuitive
impression had
read this is consistent here this shows
up package management package repository
the problem people have one of the big
problems is how do I get software for my
form you know how do I get a JSON
library github duh well is like six of
them out there well obviously you've got
to try six of them and figure out where
you read the history and you ask in the
list it's not that hard but for people
who are used to you know Ruby or Python
where it's just like boom it's done I
moved on to my next actually interesting
problem no I don't really care that much
about parsing JSON that mindset gets
frustrated there that is a you know it
adds up it's not just JSON it's the next
library the next database library etc it
becomes a recurring theme in the
objections these things what would I
what I'd prove so the package repository
is just weird where can I find something
the package manager is how do i download
something how do i grab something it
shows up and library consistency all
over the place i don't think that
anybody would would would argue this one
inbuilt tools so that's the result okay
so with that here's my interpretation
now I'm very careful here I know so I've
done econometrics and statistics I know
how fickle statistics are they're very
fickle it's very easy to mislead it's
very easy to change a small thing and
get a different result this is simply
these are some observations user
intuition intuitively I agree with this
I've experienced all of this so this to
me is a confirmation of things that make
sense if you have a different experience
you can be skeptical but the data is
available the results are available the
summarized results and at some point if
I can successfully anonymize the other
data the other to the upstream source is
that maybe maybe maybe available I'm
sensitive to privacy so I've committed
to keeping people anonymous in this so
but the summarize data which is
completely anonymous is available on
github so this is my interpretation but
it's simply some thinking here so we'll
see Garrett's general lowercase I
impressions of airline so people
generally understand what Earling is
about no surprise I think the marketing
and the communication that's gone on is
good good good job
it's extremely positive people are
enthusiastic about this language and I
mean really enthusiastic shockingly like
when I say life-changing I'm not
exaggerating there are some fans out
there that are really personally
invested in this technology there is a
general belief that Erlang is hard to
learn and not learner friendly there is
a general belief it's reflected here in
the result there are syntax complaints
persist this does show up this surprised
me a little bit I thought that we would
get a very low turnout I don't I think
syntax the syntax objections are
ridiculous but that's my personal
opinion with respect but they do show up
they show up okay what is really
considered for servers not surprising
that is network services back-end
systems daemons long learning processes
things believed to be concurrent whether
you know what does that mean they use
that word things to be required
scalability reliability fault tolerance
whatever those things meet and
distribute systems so I think that the
general jargon and the marketing
marketing message has gotten across
again one of the apps a bit of a
surprise there this is not the telco in
you know telecom platform this is viewed
as a general-purpose platform for these
things
okay challenges in adopting finding
developers is the outlier people are
concerned about committing to this
technology when they can't find
developers that's reasonable right
you're going to go and bet your company
on something that you you can't execute
on and that's pretty mechanically basic
and so if we're frustrated that there
isn't much of a market for for
programmers this is the concern so think
about this when we think about problems
that we might define here it's
considered hard to learn there's a steep
learning curve it's arcane some somebody
use the term inside baseball which I
liked I'm not exactly sure what that
means but I think it just means it's
it's sort of part of a closed group and
it's difficult to understand short of a
large investment in learning the
concerned over current levels of
adoption so that is why am I going to
bet my company on something that nobody
uses now forget about getting
programmers if nobody's using it this
doesn't not doesn't doesn't work so
reliance of cost risk etc convincing
management is hard to talked about
that and then there's a there's a strong
dissatisfaction with library's
documentation tooling often cited as the
barriers to adoption okay alternatives
jvm languages go haskell non elixir and
actor and messaging library so why do i
show this let me let me make a point
here
i think a lot of people assume that
Erlang is is is just so unique and it is
unique and it's so differentiated it it
it is differentiated there's an
assumption that people aren't they just
can't do anything with anything else
that's just that's where the wealth it
whether it's raw right or wrong people
disagree with you people are trying and
they're investing in other things and as
it turns out you know some of the
problems that erling is really really
really good at our edge cases from for
many people their extreme edge cases
edge cases that they may never reach and
so when we talk about adoption sort of
saying well it early is really really
good for this thing and that thing
doesn't resonate or it resonates but the
the barriers are too high that we've
listed here they don't use it they use
the think of things like this I should
keep keep us up I think competitions not
the but not a bad thing
I think modesty and humility is a good
thing so knowing that there are other
communities solving hard problems
related to servers and concurrency
parallelism we could be heard talk just
in the last session about different
concurrency models and how other
languages are solving these problems in
fact they are and that are attracting
brilliant people to invest time and
energy in that and there's a general
there's a general sort of underlying
theme and the results here at say early
had some things right early on but
there's a lot of catch up that's been
done that's been happening very recently
this problem with the computing
platforms and the need to be concurrent
that need to be parallel to medium
support multi-core lots of investment is
being made in other areas we don't need
to be jealous about that but we should
be mindful of it that you know we can't
rest on the on the laurels of the last
two decades okay implications I'm really
starting to interpret here I'm
speculating I don't know careful here
careful all right
documentation is the outlier right so
primarily this is this is your target
for change so documentation is the
outlier primarily on how to guides and
examples
package dependency management
repositories the things that we could
think about maybe investing some time
and energy and it's not certainly these
aren't new people in fact recently
there's a very long extensive thread on
documentation
and usability and and and you know how
do you get started how and there is
energy out there but interestingly a lot
of people push back I said ah it's fine
just go rolling down org just use that
it's difficult and people who are
starting find that to be a barrier so
let's remove the barrier let's invest in
the let's you know maybe spend some time
and energy thinking about this stuff
alright library consistency build and
release tools improve the community and
development process there multiple
issues associated with this so what I'm
doing here is just targeting based on
the results here I don't think it's
speculative alright these things jump
out so if these are these are
interesting of adoption and growth of
the drilling community getting jobs
having a robust volatile market of
erling employment is important these are
things that we might consider looking at
so these are the this is again a
high-level interpretation this is sort
of be moving a little bit away from the
hard data and giving you what I think is
an intuitive feel people are passionate
about simplicity and not being
complicated and interestingly early has
a rich rich rich tradition of not being
complicated so how do we find ourselves
in a very complicated ecosystem it's
understandable but maybe we should
return back to this idea of beating
beating complexity out of out of the
language the tooling the documentation
etc until it's easy for people simple
for people so I'll problems have
accumulated over the time so library
consistency breath we've been respondent
to a certain customer base and a certain
demand for very very complex and current
systems maybe it is time to be
responsive to the community at large or
the general programmer and allow that
type of profile to drive change so be
responsive to people who are having
difficulty and not to say oh you've got
to push through this to get to the good
stuff because what's going to happen is
they're not going to push through to get
to good the good stuff they're going to
go to go which is very simple and direct
a go-go Lang which is a tremendous
resource for learning the language and
using the language and and others like
it they want this is interesting this
actually surprised me a little
because I don't think about this that
much open transparent growing community
but people who are making bets on
technology look at this today this today
is a selling point
there's your IBM you know that you know
you talk about all this other stuff
today you talk about hey is there a
vibrant community around a technology
that's open and transparent right now I
understand that things are in flux
things are changing things are moving in
a direction I'm highlighting that this
is important to people that's all an
increase adoption so adoption here will
lead to more adoption will lead to more
programmers will lead to a richer
ecosystem so adoption is a bit important
all right I'm going to get I want to get
I'm gonna make sure I have this is
getting a little bit repetitive so let
me I want to get two questions first and
I just want to I want this this is what
I want because I just want to finish
this let me get the questions a lot of
people think who cares right seriously
who cares I can solve my problems my
colleagues can solve their problems so
it's proven so let's move on let's not
talk about the color of the bike shed
let's solve some real problems that's a
legitimate point of view at the same
time the general openness and
accessibility of a platform builds other
things that are new and innovative it
attracts minds it attracts energy
attracts investments of time so maybe
one of the reasons that something isn't
invested in by volunteers is that
historically contributions have not made
it into a certain area
I don't know I'm speculating I've
certainly heard results in heard stories
and the results about difficulties in
getting code from moded and used not a
criticism it's an observation the easier
something it is is to get in those
people will stay around it will improve
something it will lead to another thing
it will lead to more contribution and it
will start to snowball and grow and
develop I'm not an expert in this thing
incidentally my next one of my next
steps is to look into Community
Development how have other communities
successfully solve the problem of
maintaining the culture and integrity of
their ecosystem while being open and
transparent and inviting and easy for
other people to participate very
difficult I'm sure that's a difficult
problem I just don't know anything about
it so I'm gonna I think I would like to
have the next step to go measure that
and talk to talk to and perhaps conduct
some surveys around Community
Development I think
interesting and I might spend some time
on that so yeah yeah I think it's
important that brilliant people not go
elsewhere I think it is important to
explicitly put this way I think it's an
important to attract brilliant people
III agree with Katie Miller that is
important to have diversity for
diversity's sake it's important to have
things to choose from it's important to
have things to reject you can't do that
in closed modernist circles things that
are homogenous and over bred not I mean
that's a bit of a derogatory term to
homogeneous right in an ecosystem organ
from an organism standpoint they tend to
die
you need heterogeneity you need
diversity to live and that's a sort of
principle from nature has anyone seen
the talk on sulfurous biology we're
almost all complex forms of life
reproduce sexually sexual sexual
reproduction is extremely costly
compared to cloning but almost all
complex organisms reproduce sexually
and the payoff there is diversity that
is a fact
that is not disputed if we have more
diversity within the community I think
that will we will continue to improve
and and all of the goodness that we love
so much can be used and grow and maybe
we can get some some more language jobs
out there so with that I'm going to stop
and ask for four questions
oh here the reference is little done yo
questions go ahead yeah no I'm sorry ask
the question I work the Avril I'll
repeat it i we're not using my phone
just i will repeat the question
no they are they are I don't know why I
don't I don't know they are
I mean honestly at some point you can't
you know I mean there are reasons and we
I don't know if we have the time to go
through that I don't even know if I know
I don't honestly don't know I'm not
going to sort of guess but all I know is
it's cited frequently extreme like the
number one outlier yeah sorry yeah
yeah yeah that's right that's true so
just for the for the record the first
question I Paul didn't repeat it was you
know you were just asking why is finding
developer the number one priority and my
answer was I didn't mean to be
you know I truly you know don't I don't
know until you measure so I just know
that this is a big result and then the
follow-up was an observation that you
know managers ultimately make these
decisions and if it's difficult to find
resources it's really a matter of risk
and certainly cost there's risk to the
project if the one or two or three
individuals who are know Erlang go away
puts the project risk and it's also more
expensive to hire and retain Joe so the
question from for mr. Armstrong is is
how does a community like ruby manage to
get away with a single library for
something when in fact there ought to be
multiple alternatives and I didn't get
the impression that people were
complaining about their there being
multiple versions they complained about
inconsistency and not knowing even what
the high performance version would be to
get so it isn't a matter of them wanting
to be limited to in choice it's a matter
of wanting something to be easy to find
and easy to understand and easy to use
yeah absolutely I don't I didn't get any
impression that anyone had an objection
with that none and what says I want to
be limited in what I do that didn't show
up I'm sorry I don't mean to imply this
so we're moving into so the question is
what is sort of what is sort of Howard
yeah what is hard to learn mean in this
case the granularity of this result does
not penetrate that question so I didn't
differentiate between you know is it was
in my experience hard to learn versus it
is sort of a you know esoteric or
exoteric West statement about this is
hard to learn
they're both grouped into this I think
the perception certainly would is you
know either way would would maintain if
something may be speaking on on someone
else's behalf or or themselves so that's
I listed that as hard to learn and to be
clear about this at least from what I've
seen it's really more about how do I get
my job done I could have put that a
little bit differently it's a general
category of hard to learn so it was
learning curve and learning curves
summarize basically you know how you
learning the low-level parts but not so
much that it's more like how do I use
this thing how do I you know I have this
problem how do I use it I've got oh oh
I've got UML I've got all these other
things I've learned in school and I
learned come to Erlang and I've got sort
of these things that I get I understand
it but really using them putting into
practice is a challenge and you have to
really commit and penetrate and ask
questions and that is that seems to be
the heart to learn there
so the Joe's observation is that it has
doesn't have to do with with Erling but
is the the programming model itself it's
the higher level abstractions and the
approach to building software true but
the observations are that the materials
out there really don't address that very
well so the so the joke so the joke was
somebody just asked Joe Armstrong if he
found Erlang hard to learn and Joe said
no well put have you seen the core
libraries have you seen so the question
was if I could elaborate on what
inconsistent libraries meant and then I
made a joke which was have you seen the
libraries ok so so so so for example if
you were if you were to take and I'll
make another joke here and I'm actually
kind of dead serious about this if you
were to take the verb set and you were
to do a synonym on that you might say
put or store or insert the link or
libraries use every one of them it's
true yeah exactly yeah I mean it's
allosaurus this is sort of however you
pronounce that word yeah it is Xterra
sometimes you put the thing being
modified on the front sometimes you put
it on the back now look this isn't
really a criticism in language I mean if
you look at CC plus well every language
has this problem so it isn't to say that
this is necessarily bad it's simply a
point of friction and and for most of us
myself included the cost of of migrating
a library for the sake of consistency is
extremely high I mean look at what the
Python community is done with Python 3
that was a noble attempt to sort of
clean everything up but I don't think
that that went as well as I thought it
would
there's extremely high cost in changing
something for consistency's sake so I'm
not for a minute suggesting that oh it's
just a matter of cleaning up the
libraries I think that's a problem that
we can we can if you go I'll have these
slides I skipped through that in the
interest of time but but cleaning
libraries up is a problem and it there's
a trade-off and it's a reason trade-off
when somebody says well why is it so
inconsistent you can say well you want
consistence here you want stability
would you prefer that your code not work
or would you prefer to have a few
challenges and that's reasonable so I'm
not suggesting it's there's an obvious
this is certainly a problem for people
let me let me get what yeah would I try
to emulate so the question was yeah yeah
incidentally I as being moderator have
to remind myself that I'm out of time
and we have another question so I'm
going to I'm going to finish this up and
one more question I'm on the mic I get
the track so then the next guy can go
over let's do it that way the pallets
the perks of being in control so the
question was you know if the package
manager is listed as a problem what
would I you know think of or proposed as
an alternative I mean there are
certainly attempts have been made to to
write a package manager I think one of
the one of the problems is that you know
people would like these things to be
supported in the core so that something
like as endemic as you know build tools
package dependency dependency managers
package repository that there be some
sense of a central supported
authoritative source rather than a
market of alternatives that might may or
may not surface as being the de facto
adopted standard that works it has
worked we have tools that are generally
a de facto standards but they're not
officially supported and people coming
into the community don't know that so
they have to kind of figure out oh
what's the what's the trick to build is
it a make files a tree bar is that you
know early on m'kay you know what should
I do here and then we've got this
well-reasoned discussion all the
alternatives people don't care about
that they want to go build done let me
solve my problems so that shows up all
over the place all right one more
question Joe what was your question if
well you had something before Kenneth
yes with Kenneth Kenneth gets 10
questions
yeah
yeah so so the question is for folks who
are sort of making the observation that
it's hard to learn and and there are
these sort of challenges to adoption are
they able to do these systems in Java
and C++ I don't have data on that so I'm
just going to I'm going to wing it I'm
going to I'm going to make up an answer
for you I think it's a reasonable answer
so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter there are the problems
that come up in Erickson's ecosystem are
outliers to the rest of the world they
are there people don't build these
systems they don't have this this
complexity problem so the answer is yes
they actually can they can get a well
down the look down the road look at the
success of Ruby on the server side look
at that's proof that people whether they
can or can't they do it and and and and
that's just a fact so a lot of the times
is it doesn't matter they just use it
and then they run into the problems
along the way Ericsson has a very very
different set of background perspective
they understand extraordinarily complex
problems and have a huge history of
solving them so the answer to your
question is no of course not but to most
of the people that are conducting the
survey it's what are you even talking
about I don't know like they don't know
they don't get it
yeah so the observation is that the
productivity gains that I think that you
can get will will will help you outstrip
the investment in learning I think that
it's probably true in a lot of cases but
I would say this is there really a
problem in making something easier is
there really a problem in chipping away
at barriers and friction points what's
the problem there I think all things
equal it'd be easier you go that much
faster right you'd say that much you'd
have that much more influx of people
using the language and contributing and
being feeling like they're part of the
community
one more Joe yep
so Joe Armstrong's observation is that
there's a lifecycle to language
development and we're sort of at the
point where you know we have a basis and
now it's time to start to write higher
level books patterns and we're talking
about some of the other things how to
the domains of concurrent applications
etc I think absolutely to me and I'll
wrap up here so we get on to the next
talk it really is about let's let's
let's be thoughtful about this this is a
form of being thoughtful about this and
if we see something maybe this would
inspire some next steps we can all let
this evolve but let's be rational about
it and and and and let's let's I think
it would be great if we could all agree
that building a rich or more diverse
more open community is something that we
can strive for and things like this
initiatives like this are worthwhile
