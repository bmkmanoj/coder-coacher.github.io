the elixir community for about four
years I've contributed to elixir early
days of Phoenix and as well as like my
own libraries there's a few of them out
there including coyote I work at a
company called in Bala Power Networks
and we built virtual power plants to
manage renewable resources this is
actually a big problem when you think
about the typical power networks they
comes from a Central Station and the
power gets pushed out while all these
are distributed and so they kind of have
to be grouped together and figure out
how to manage problems whether you need
to pull power from the grid or push
power to the grid it creates some very
interesting problems some of them kind
of pushed some of Coyote was you know
we've got distributed assets all over
the place we have tons of data coming in
from these assets because they have to
report in constantly so we know exactly
what their power levels are what they
can do and what they can't do so that we
can actually bid to give that
cost-effective amount you can't actually
push an asset further than it can go and
you can't pull from it any more than it
can give today though I hope to be a
storyteller maybe not a storyteller in
the sense that you guys are used to more
in the Native American tradition see in
the Native American storytellers they're
much more interested in the truth of the
story and as a great storyteller makes
the truth of the story fit the needs of
the content essentially what you could
say is that the truth is based on the
context and for all you developers out
there I'm sure you know the answer to
most programming questions is it depends
yeah everything's situational I mean you
can always say whatever the whatever the
question is well what do you mean what
situation you're using it in how is it
so I can tell you something that's the
truth today you give me different
parameters tomorrow and now that one's
false but another one's true so now this
isn't exactly a success story but it's
also not a failure it's just a story
it's my story and it's really about my
curiosity and how
I tend to indulge my curiosity's and
writing libraries does that mean you
should go run out tomorrow and use
coyote in production yeah no it's on its
way it's stabilized I started working on
coyote mostly talking about it about a
year ago and then slowly over the course
of the last year I've kind of come and
gone from it and it's kind of funny I
know if you've ever worked on a library
that you're trying to do something that
you don't necessarily quite understand
the problem exactly when you set out you
write some code you step back six months
later now later you come back to it and
you're like oh shoot I know more than I
knew then and now I know how to do it
better I'm hoping that as the project
evolves I'll continue doing that so what
is coyote well that's a good question
we're going to get into it but it's
basically something that's evolved over
time and this talk though I'm actually
going to mix in some Native American
folklore I hope that I do it justice I
try not to
I've actually consulted with people that
I know that our Native Americans to make
sure that I'm good with telling these
stories because I am NOT Native American
but I think there's some interesting
things you can get from it now these
stories are going to probably seem out
of place and not necessarily you're
going to be like what why is he telling
this story but don't worry I'll bring it
all back around and and if you can't
find the meaning behind it I'll help you
out
worst case they kind of break up the
talk a little bit so you're not you know
bored that being said it's time for our
first story the story of the clever
coyote now way back once upon a time
there was a horrible beast a horrible
monster that had had a hideout in the
mountains and he grabbed up all the
Buffalo from the plains and took them up
there and he thought I have my food
forever I never need anything else well
nobody else had any food so the coyote
pulled together all the people and he
said we need to get the Buffalo away
from them so we have something to eat
and they're like well we don't know what
to do the coyote said don't worry I've
scouted it out there's a little boy that
lives with the monster in the mountains
the people all immediately said well we
can't
little boy no no but the little boy has
to be lonely living up there in the
mountains all by himself he needs a pet
why don't we send one of the animals up
there we'll send a mouse so they sent a
mouse and of course the monster was
furious and sent the mouse away so they
came together into what are we gonna do
now let's send a bird so they sent the
bird the monster got mad and sent the
bird away coyote got smart he said you
know what I'll go I'll go up there and
see if I can scat it out and then I'll
help free the buffalo perfect well he
gets up there and of course the boy
immediately falls in love with the dog
because what little boy wouldn't fall in
love with the dog but the monster was
furious and sent both of them away the
little boy looked at the coyote and he
said you're probably still hungry and he
started getting sad he loved the coyote
so much and he started to cry well the
coyote started how to comfort the boy
well this made the monster furious but
it also made the buffalo scared
so the Buffalo started running around
and they started getting a little more
active and active when the coyote kept
howling and howling the more the boy
cried the more the coyote howled
eventually one of the buffalos takes off
and of course what happens when a herd
of buffalo takes off they'll take off
and they all scattered out across the
plains and the monster was furious and
he went in he tracked down tried to
track down all the Buffalo but he
couldn't cuz they were spread out so far
while the monster was gone from the cave
the Warriors snuck into the cave and
waited for the monster to come kill the
monster and that's how the Buffalo
spread across the plain
so what did I do
or what did I set out to do first what I
discovered I wanted to do I mentioned
before that I've been an elixir working
with elixir for about four years I also
was one of the first few contributors to
Phoenix but something's always been kind
of eating me about it
you know one of the things that brought
me to elixir in the first place was my
curiosity you know I wanted to learn
more I want to learn more about
functional programming elixir at the
time was very new not Harley any
libraries out there that hex wasn't even
around yet and so it was like this great
new playground where you could build
whatever you wanted to build there was a
curiosity and exploration and don't get
me wrong
Phoenix is great but it kept troubling
me that Phoenix felt like it was the
same patterns we were doing trying to
implement and BC just in a new language
and there's nothing wrong with that and
it actually has done great to bring
people to lick Sur left and right I see
Jim back there hi Jim he does Electra
Phoenix conference and it's what every
year doubles and most of them are coming
for Phoenix there's nothing wrong with
that but it kept troubling me that like
why isn't there another framework that
does something different that treats it
different that treats it more like an
early or something that would be run on
the beam where you're actually just
piping data through it's not necessarily
having to deal with NBC you're not
dealing with controllers you're not
dealing with views and one thing I kept
coming back to is that Phoenix is a
great presentation later my applications
can do what they need to do I just need
something to get it to the web but I
don't always need something to get it to
the web sometimes I just want to
communicate between applications on the
backside so I found that I needed a way
to do distributed community or computing
I wanted to be able to have separate
nodes set up where I could build smaller
applications that do one thing or do one
thing well and the only thing they do is
they sit there and they run and they
know who they can talk to by passing
routes to it and then that lead server
can actually push messages out to them
and get messages back everything runs
the same one thing goes down it notifies
the other and says hey I don't have a
route for that anymore and then you move
on with life if it comes back up then it
starts back up
I think this is makes scaling
applications much easier too if you have
these small little little applications
running on different nodes you can build
a cluster and then run it on there and
you can add more power to this one
particular piece of the application
instead of worrying about all these
other pieces so the big thing is is to
be able to have what a traffic cop time
for the second story so one day the
coyote was walking along and it was a
hot day as he was walking along he said
you know what I need a cloud
give me a cloud so that I can be cool
and a cloud came but it wasn't good
enough so he continued walking he said
no no I need more clouds I need a lot of
clouds they all of a sudden the sky went
black
I'm still hot I need rain it started to
rain he said that's not enough I need a
stream I need a lot of rain I needed
something that can put my feet in so the
water came and he put his feet in but it
wasn't enough and so he got mad and he
said I need more rain I need more water
give me more the river flew well the
coyote got swept up in the waves he got
pushed way down the river and all of a
sudden tumbling and tumbling and
tumbling he finally comes on shore and
then his vultures are circling around
and as they're circling around he yells
at them no I'm not dead and that's how
the Columbia River came trust me I was
there so I embarked on the journey the
first thought was to make coyote work
with cowboy everybody's used cowboy here
right yes we've all used cowboy right
we're all familiar with it Cowboys great
I'm not going to go into too much detail
tabloids I assume that you all know it
so and if you don't it's really easy to
pick up how to use it but remember I
said that I don't necessarily want
things going to the web I want to be
able to use the web but I also want to
be able to use just standalone back-end
services
so what we what I did was I actually
have a routing table as the new
applications come along they use the
coyote client the coyote client allows
those applications to register with a
note or register with the server on a
different node or even on the same node
and then once that happens in the actual
routes are given to that leader server
the leader server can now service
request and pass it off to those
machines it gets a response back or if
you're casting into it you don't care
about a response you can just cast into
it it does how to get to it the routing
table is basically managed in s now I
know in elixir 1.4 there's a registry to
manage processes it isn't confirming
it's not cross nodes right single
machine single node and there's some
other tools out there of course we'll
talk about those later but the idea was
that we had a central server that could
keep track of processes and nodes so if
a process goes down it can get rid of
the route because it can't service that
anymore and if a node goes down if you
get rid of all of the routes for it
until that node comes back up and then
it can start servicing requests again
but remember I didn't want to stop
there's nothing wrong with Phoenix
there's nothing wrong with Maru they're
both based on plug and they do a great
job of passing information onto the web
they can handle all sorts of things like
stuff I don't want to deal with in
coyote CSS JavaScript all that kind of
stuff
rendering to the screen do all that in
in there all I'm concerned about is
connecting applications that can serve
me data back so in this case you can
actually turn off in coyote the ability
to communicate with cowboy directly and
actually use either whatever is coming
in plug whether or not you're using Maru
or Phoenix it'll actually register the
routes itself those routes then get
passed into the the coyote server and
then the coyote server then services out
to the applications messages are backed
you have your data
so really coyote kind of emerged from
being what I thought was going to be a
framework and it's really just a library
to help communicate between nodes
now I'm getting ready to go into some
code slides
everybody loves static code slides right
Oh nobody likes static code signs it's
it's boring
excuse my language but it is don't worry
we're going to get through this real
quick most of you know elixir most of
you know Erlang okay so we're going to
get through these pretty quick just so
you kind of have an idea the system and
then we're going to get to the good
shape we're going to run some demos now
we're going to see what we can do with
it so the first thing that we needed to
do was we need to actually get these
routes from it we need to have our
client be able to give us the route and
get it over to our server so that it
knows how to communicate with it so what
I did was I just implemented a simple
macro to say we'll get to the second but
in the client you use this macro put the
routes in there it'll send over how is
it going to send it over so there's
actually a coyote client that uses the
using macro in the using macro you
actually imp or import the coyote router
and that gives you the routes function
now the cool little bit that I did which
is and I can't remember who told me
about this it might have been James was
the beam in Erlang gives you the power
to load in modules in the memory and
then you can send them to another node
and then recompile them on that other
node so basically what happens on the
client side is the client takes that
module and you can actually give it a
function you don't even have to use that
particular macro you can actually just
give it a function through the config to
say hey this is where my routes are and
it will call that but it basically
packages it up and sends it over if you
look down online I can see better on
this screen then I can see on this
screen so bear with me line 86 we have a
git code function we get the object code
for that module we package that up and
we ship it off to the node that's that
it services now with this you can
actually have multiple nodes so say you
have for leader servers 5-liter servers
10 leader servers you can send it off to
whoever you want and then that code will
actually be able to be run on the server
side it'll know the routes and it can
register but that's not good enough
right what happens if it goes down well
we actually have a server watch so when
it goes down we actually tell tell the
client application hey this node is down
you need to start watching for it as
soon as it comes back up send another
message to re-register and it just waits
until the node comes back up now of
course the node might never come back up
but it'll just keep waiting and
eventually it will or it won't now on
the kind of Coyote server side here's
where we actually register the routes
and that's where we call on line 30 code
load binary we read in that code that
was sent over from the other node we
basically compiled it into memory and
then we run the code and we pull the
routes we execute the routes function
and then update a routing table with the
process ID that it came from and the the
actual request route that it has let's
see now
here's where it got really interesting
when I was first doing this everything
seemed fine I was testing it on my own I
was just running a little website and
everything like that everything was good
no problem what happens when you start
having a hundred thousand things trying
to go across here you start doing a lot
of back pressure now I think it's come
up a few times at least I know today gem
stage and I went back and forth on
whether or not to implement gem stage in
part cause like I said I've been working
on this for the past year and Jen stage
was in sort of a state of flux when I
first started working on it so it was
kind of one of the last things that I
implemented I wasn't even sure if I
necessarily wanted to and really when I
went to implement it the first thing I
noticed is it was slower well of course
it was slower it's doing more work it's
not just servicing one request it's
actually trying to queue up the request
and it's actually trying to mitigate
more larger requests so if you have a
hundred thousand requests coming in
which we'll see in a second it keeps
your server going the
you tried that without the gem stage I
don't think it would work now you
probably come up with another way to do
it don't get me wrong I'm not saying the
gin stage is the only way it's just the
way that I went now I chose to use the
the consumer supervisor model basically
what happens is I have a producer relay
process that runs that when inbound
requests come in it actually starts up
the consumer supervisor starts up a
single consumer for each request and it
manages those requests so it doesn't
matter how many I come in or how many
come in the actual the relay itself
handles that back pressure and only
sends enough that it can handle and then
it kind of queues through you get new
processes for each one and each one is
handled individually so if one dies one
dies there's no big deal well hopefully
I haven't tested that photo yet so we'll
just not worry about that right so
here's our consumer supervisor and it's
really easy to set up so basically we
have we subscribe to that coyote relay
so we know that any messages that
produce we're going to actually go ahead
and start up a new process that process
is going to manage it was going to
handle calling in to our other
application getting the information and
then we also pass it the caller's pit so
that we can get that information back to
whoever sent it which would be the
leader server here's our request handler
I know that's a big chunk of code
basically what it's doing is it's going
and checking the the route Brit or the
route bridge which has all the routes it
goes and it finds it when it finds one
it actually that has the pit for that
which has been updated or maintained by
the by the route table itself and then
it sends the message over to it and then
the response comes back and it's
delivered back to the whoever sent the
message originally so in this case it
would be the leader server would
actually go get the message and come
back now like I said all this is
configurable but it's configurable in
two ways so the first way is by just
using the config file you can set up
leader nodes and if you don't set up any
leader nodes it just uses the default
node assuming
you're running in a single node you can
get it any number ones so this
application that we're that I wrote that
we're going to look at here in a second
called Deadwood actually you're going to
kind of see a theme and like all these
applications if you know anything about
the Wild West
we have cripple creek we have Dodge City
the whole things in an umbrella project
called tombstone no Wild West fans come
on come on you're killing me all right
so here's our simple application in our
simple application we have our routes
macro what we're going to say we're
going to handle this get route and it's
anytime you get a request for just slash
route it to I know how to handle it send
a message to me and then we have our
function on 26 which actually handles it
you can also pass in params at params
come in they get passed in honestly
underneath the covers all this stuff is
basically just a gem server that you
could do without the coyote client but
the coyote client kind of handle some of
that boilerplate stuff that you have to
setup and then it relays a message back
now remember I told you I don't care
about what this stuff looks like hitting
the web all I care about is the data
coming back and in most cases because I
deal with a lot of back-end stuff all
I'm worried about is sending Java or
JSON back I'm not worried about sending
HTML I don't really care what it looks
like if you want to make it look pretty
put it in your presentation layer and
that's where it belongs
I'm not opinionated as a whole by the
way all right so here's our client other
client application where we actually
have one called menu for Deadwood
- Deadwood was a saloon - so we have our
menu and in here we're going to get a
list of items if you notice here I
changed up intentionally those atoms in
the beginning so to show you that it
doesn't have to be get it just has to be
something to be unique so when we pass
that or when we pass get items slaughter
and slash food we're going to get a list
of items now please don't hold me to
combo for this code between lines 24 and
30 a little bit more than 33 basically I
was just trying to do something that
would take a little bit of time I wasn't
trying to like Reno launches spatial or
anything like that I just wanted to do
some code so we build a response and
what you'll see is on our debt items we
just return the list of items in memory
that's all sort in an agent I didn't use
a database no I didn't use a database
it's all stored in an agent and then if
you put items in there it basically puts
them in R in the agent and then returns
the list including the params that you
sent in and a little bit of extra
superficial data the average cost of the
items on the menu then total number of
menu items and stuff like that
now finally that's done we all ready to
actually see a demo of this all right
bear with me for a second because oh by
the way real quick like my laptop
funny story real quick I promise there's
only a couple of these at least one more
so on the way here I flew through I flew
through Frankfurt it was an overnight
flight please bear with me I set my
laptop down next morning I go collect
all my stuff get it all going I walk
outside go out of security come back in
security I open up my bag go to grab my
laptop out no laptop left it on the
plane immediately freaked out scrambled
over to a lost and found and everything
like that guess what they didn't have it
they didn't know where was that and what
ended up happening was yesterday
afternoon around three o'clock I got
alert from iCloud that they found my
laptop it's sitting in a suburb in
Frankfurt right now by the way it's been
erased I'm probably never going to see
that one again so guess whose laptop
this is I travel with my wife and kids
it's my wife's laptop I love my wife I
love my wife to death I love her more
than anything she does not know how to
update her Mac and when you're trying to
get your talk to put together because
you have to load up a lick Cerner laying
and everything like that doesn't have
brew doesn't have anything
let's just say I'm it's what much last
few days so we need the mirror here all
right can you all see that kinda I'll
try to bump it up some okay so what we
have here I've got actually three leader
servers that we're going to run and I've
got one that Deadwood application it's
just a back-end application some of the
routes are serviced by the so by the
coyote server itself which is coming
through cowboy will see that and some of
the routes are coming through Phoenix I
actually did pretty those ones up so
they look kind of nice the other one is
an API which we're going to see through
postman where it only services a part of
the app which is the menu part we'll see
that so first thing we're going to do
I'm going to stop all this stuff - so
we're going to go ahead and start
all right so
as you can see here's our Phoenix one it
looks a lot better than the tabloid one
because the cowboy one doesn't have
anything any styles or anything like
that I did that intentionally so that
you could see that there was a
difference in the two and also here is
the API one as you can see we have items
in the API if we go through let's change
this to a post and prove that here's the
body what else do you do in Sweden
Swedish meatballs and you can see the
response we got the params that we sent
we got the items that we sent and that
was all going to the other way now we're
going to actually stop this real quick
and get them over here let's add two
three this is our dead one
and you can see our test123 here that
worked so we can actually if you notice
what happened we did not restart the API
servers all we did was restarted the
application server and actually if we
take this down if we restart this you'll
see no matching routes this is our
cowboy one it's been notified that there
is no application to match those routes
so it just sends a response no matching
routes
I didn't pretty that up on here though
so you just get a nasty message now
let's start this to the backup would
come back up if you noticed I didn't
touch the two leader servers just comes
up now that's all fine and dandy but
remember we put Jen stage in for a
reason anybody can hit a site and get a
response back fairly decently so let's
do this so can you all see that probably
not I've got two we're going to try here
one we basically take a list from one to
ten we cycle over that we make this call
I'll show you the function real quick
basically all we do is grab a random
number between 1 and what did I set it
to 10,000 and then we generate a list
and then sum that list and send it over
needless to say that does produce a lot
of numbers so we're really high enough
set a number so here we go with the
let's do 10 first just to show that it's
working quickly all right so we got our
numbers back so Jen fades yes the ten of
them wasn't too bad this came back
pretty quick but
this one is a hundred thousand all right
so that'll be you in a while so let's
come over here now I'll just refresh it
still up still being able to service
requests so I'm actually that's the
server that is actually running on
that's why I'm showing you the cowboy
one so everything stays up and running
it's able to still continue doing all
that calculations in the backend Jen the
stage is really what I was able to use
this for because each one of those
starts up a separate process that
manages inbound requests and services it
back using a send back to the process
that called it it makes it so that the
site stays up I can still hit other our
other requests on that site and keep
moving forward
it did finish by the way so
you
the suspense is killing me guess what
time for another story you guys liking
the stories or not nice it's a good way
to break up the talk right I mean come
on we didn't sit up here look at code
all day or we can tell stories about
coyotes so the coyote and the skunk now
one day the coyote was walking it was
very hungry and he saw a skunk over
there and he said oh brother
I'm hungry how are you doing are you
hungry too and the skunk said yes of
course he said well there's some prairie
dogs over over there and they're all
playing around not paying attention how
much you work with me and we'll get us a
bunch of parrot or a bunch of prairie
dogs to eat tonight
scum says ok I'm in I'll do it what do
you need me to do he said just go over
there and play dead I'll take care of
the rest
so there's got skunk goes over closer to
the prairie dogs and lays down and plays
dead the coyote walks over and all the
pair dogs immediately looked up and kind
of freaked out okay says no no don't
worry
look our enemy is dead he's laying over
there on the ground we should all dance
and celebrate but don't look at it
because you'll die too and so they said
ok and so they all started dancing he
said you must keep your eyes closed or
something bad will happen and so they
all are dancing around eyes closed so
the coyote walks up and kills one they
all open their eyes and see the dead
prairie dog and the coyote says I told
y'all not to open your eyes see what
happened you better dance and close your
eyes so that all the prairie dogs
started dancing and closing their eyes
and he killed another and then another
and then another until he killed all the
prairie dogs so the sky are the skunk
and the coyote gathered up all the
prairie dogs and decided to take him
back and roast them well as the roast
him the coyote got clever
he said he's really hungry so what he
did was he said how about this scum how
about we race we race to the bottom of
the hill if I beat you then I get to
pick the best of the prairie dogs if you
win you get to pick the best the skunk's
not stupid the song says coyote you're
much faster than I am there's no way I
can beat you down there the coyote says
I got it I'll tie a rock around my leg
and so that I run slower and then that
way we can even it out a little bit and
the skunk says well if you
hi big enough rock around I'll do it so
the coyote starts to tie round and he
says while I'm tying this you go ahead
and run on and get a head start it all
gives you a head start so as skunk runs
away down the hill the coyote ties on
the rock and starts running down the
hill
well the skunk gets kind of far ahead
and decided he sees some bushes and so
he ducks into the bushes and waits for
the coyote passes by now as the Coyotes
passing by of course he's trying to run
as hard as he can and he's got this rock
tied to his leg eventually the rock
shakes off and he kind of takes off well
the skunk goes back to the fire where
the prairie dogs are roasting knowing
that the coyote was going to try to get
the best of them and he takes the best
ones for himself and leaves only two
nasty little bony prairie dogs and he
puts them in the fire and cuts off the
tails and goes back to the bushes and
starts eating them start seeing the
prairie dogs
well coyote eventually comes back around
and sees the fire but no skunk and he's
looking in the fire and he sees the the
tails and he pulls them out he says
where did awesome company he starts
getting suspicious thinking somebody's
come and stolen the prairie dogs coyotes
not always the sharpest guy but in any
case so he's hiding - of what what's
going on well then the skunk appears at
the top of the hill and throws the
prairie dogs bones on him and says you
tried to trick me and I ate all of them
and he said you didn't save me any me
said there's the two in the fire eat
those and the coyote was just put out
that he did not get anything so the
skunk actually outwitted the coyote
that's the end of that story now how did
those stories kind of tie in well if you
kind of notice there was a little bit of
a transition in them but one of the
things that cut the Coyotes known for is
the coyote is similar to what I guess
the norwegians loking he's kind of a
trickster with people he's a trickster
with other animals he usually tries to
use his cleverness to get what he wants
but sometimes he lacks wisdom to do what
he needs to do and so he kind of always
runs into problems
now of course across the different
Native American nations different cat
different coyote folklore is different
some means a little more helpful like in
our first story some you know some in
like the last story he just tries to get
the better of people and when he does it
usually falls flat on his face so be
careful in your cleverness I think I
talked about this on the show quite a
bit where it's like when I'm working I
don't want to be clever but when I'm
exploring I do when I'm trying to find
new things I'm trying to push the
boundaries little things like reading
code in four modules is is really
something I want to do in my production
application but if I have if I'm
building a library or testing some
functionality it's great see how that
works push the boundaries see what you
can do I've never been a believer of hey
we already have X why are you doing that
I think actually I saw the tweet I wish
I did it grabbed it and included in the
talk where somebody said I'm about at
the end of seeing or what was it the the
talks about how to build your own Heroku
stop right there
I use Heroku so I don't have to build it
why I'm not saying you gotta go use it
in production but help teach me how to
build my own Heroku teach me all the
things that I need to know because that
way when you go to use something like
Heroku and something goes wrong you have
some background knowledge you can
actually figure it out now I don't want
to it was a tweet so I'm not peeking on
Heroku specifically just it was a tweet
but there are some downfalls downfall to
do it yourself for one you're on your
own if you need support chances are yes
the community will try to help you but
you've gone on your own direction and
chances are you've put a bunch of code
in there that may or may not be good but
there's also a lot of upside you can
learn a lot you can learn about the
systems that you're working on the one
thing that I found in the four years
that I've been working with the lecture
in Erlang is it it's pretty deep and
there's a lot to learn I think the only
comparison that I can have is like when
I was doing c-sharp and net development
where it's like you could spend forever
learning about dotnet and the inner
workings of it and how it all works and
the different pieces of it and different
aspects of the languages and things like
that and you can write code for years
and never use chunks of it Erlang feels
very similar to that
now of course you could solve similar
problems that coyotes trying to solve
with something out of the box like
rabbitmq that would work perfectly like
I said if you're out in a single box in
a single node and you want to use
registry that you could kind of work a
solution that kind of works at the same
so there are options but sometimes you
get more out of exploring than you can
out of using that out of box solution
like I said things that I encountered
like code code loading managing my node
my nodes and process processes and just
getting involved in gem stage Jen's days
is one of the things I'd been hearing
about it for a while but I never really
had a chance to get to it so it didn't
have a need for it but I got to use it
in here and I enjoyed it that being said
I do plan on continuing Coyote and
pushing it to be able to be a viable
library that can be used in production
so you can check all that out check all
that out on github keep one to look back
there new rugger Neuberger 708 column
this slide new retro 7 on github coyote
is the library I also put the link for
under elixir Lang for gem stage I think
the big takeaway though from this is you
know challenge your thoughts on
application development just because
there's something out there already
doesn't mean you can't try to build
something different doesn't necessarily
mean anybody's going to use it but
you're going to learn a lot from doing
it and only be clever when you're
learning check out coyote thank you
thank you very much
any questions about the deeper meaning
of the Kyoto stories or something else
yeah no my supporting non-colored a
related question so what happens if I
register more than one like server with
the same endpoint yeah it right now its
first in so whichever one comes in if
you put another one in there it's going
to start sending together an application
that's something that I'm looking at
doing either sending a message back
saying that there's Aria are already a
route registered to that or hey you want
to register and for all I know you're
trying to send it somewhere else but
yeah that is that is a part of it
if actually if it's the exact same it
just ignores it and uses the one that's
there it assumes that you made a mistake
basically and it doesn't it doesn't add
it to the routing table if it's
different at all like if any part of its
changed then it will add a new one so
whole question
not and let's thank the speaker again
