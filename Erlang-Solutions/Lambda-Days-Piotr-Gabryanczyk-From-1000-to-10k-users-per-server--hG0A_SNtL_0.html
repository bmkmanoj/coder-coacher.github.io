love getting common so this opportunity
about Scylla I got into fantasy so if
you don't want to hear about it now
start around the way
okay so first thing that we talked today
should be how to improve your
performance of your system and so I'm
going to improve performance all the
example system two times so by having
percentage without losing hopefully
without losing us simplicity keep
killing as simple as it was before and
then I'm going to show you how to
improve the throughput of your system by
ten times using a synchronous i/o
combined with massive una silla para la
programming and then eventually i'll try
to show you practical example workers
are kafirs so is the worthless company
zeros zeros is a social television
platform and it has concept of a user
and the user has fries so what you would
too many user signs in or signs up we
will go to facebook from here and even
faster friends so tell you obviously
with merging together sing to the
database and then send invitations to
New York friends that they can now
communicate with you or physics so this
is how we go to the back time for this
procedure put it update price so first
we believe is freshly visible layers are
internal database then we go to Facebook
and Twitter page graphs merge it and
save the user and send notifications so
this procedure would actually as an
example generating number of
modifications so other users and what we
would do at least we in fact that the
result this menu plan
right we all know that unnecessary
exceptions which is going I see you know
rapid using try so this method actually
runs within inside of some sort of a sea
container so HTTP bread I would go and
pull it the coldest function painting
with block and wait until it finishes
suddenly i'm using red power or our gear
on purpose because blocking is really
bad so let's see why so the durations
other iterations of various operations
the safe and fetch user from internal
database up from a relatively fast 6 56
seconds and 12 milliseconds the bad guys
here are the futures of how the facebook
and twitter ideas on average they take
two seconds sometimes we have outliers
of like 30 seconds or dining out so but
average is 2 seconds and then
notification sending notifications to
France around one second each for
removed a lot of friends so we talk
about six seconds and on machines we
were hosting our service we were able to
spawn maximum thousand dress so if you
take thousand rats and each request s
takes two seconds that gives you a
triple of 166 requests per second this
sounds good if you're running a small
website for your local community but one
day the CEO of our company came to me
and said look we can have an effort
during the Super Bowl in us so we
imagined he was scared we do something
about this okay before we go any further
I phone
see this nice stable coursera of course
it was actually used by every man
married his personal react of course it
was originally put together by Peter
Logan this is just the table showing how
long is the operations take on modern
machine so once if you instruction will
be one nanosecond meeting one megabyte
forum would be 250,000 on seconds and
send me packet from u.s. to Europe and
back be 150 million nanoseconds so this
units are fairly abstract so that's why
I remain king with a trick when he where
he actually replaced nanosecond a second
then converted this gracious into more
meaningful human human iteration so now
CPU instructions one second and then
reading 10 micron would be three days
and sent me back at the US and back be
five years so that means shows the
orders of magnitude that really shows
how you know blocking stuff and how huge
is development are five seconds versus
one second you know for running on CBS
right so let's all take our function
with this human dance right so now you
can clearly see that the core of our
function which is merging seemingly the
most complex part of our a procedure
that sees hours and then API posted
we're in facebook 55 years I don't have
to comment on that right so in toco we
got 170 years six months and six hours
so we clearly benefit from some sort of
organization here because lots of this
means and
avelina Bentley so let's start undoing
organization using futures so futures
originally I come from I mean I know
there are different varieties of futures
available for skala but the ones I'm
talking I'm going to be talking about
come from Makkah now they are valuable
see scholar 210 denier viable just
standard as part of something library so
some other features we just have a you
know way of running computations in
parallel so let's say we we wanted to
produce an apple in order to produce an
apple up with a plan to trade for 35
years and then we eat there so that's X
why not we went to run in parallel you
can practically the future and graces
and that will never run in parallel that
will return the future object and now
let the future completes you'll be nice
to get some sort of notification so we
can use some complete method to register
call backs and cold eggs which is
functions from awful to nothing so
whether future finishes it will call
this is methods receptions and they
clearly have to decided that infection
because they don't produce anything so
sometimes it's useful also to convert
our future so saying as a function from
Apple to arrange when we can do is use
my own your own future and that will
produce a future of oranges so let's say
we have really hard calculation which
produces the double because it's hard
rockland in the future so I will see
that it is a future of level and then we
want to before we
you know retire that we want to convert
it to strength to wrap the string so
that's why is a malfunction and what
Mark function does it converts the
future TT future strength using that
press you know equals way to the result
is forever so that will give us a future
strength now we can register go back and
print it out so what this code is going
to do is it's going to freak out and
down here hope you see because that will
happen much earlier than the future
finishes and then it will print out
success of of that strength so actually
what I didn't say yes who leaves
actually when it calls the callback it
actually doesn't pass the upper body top
perhaps it with the drive so in case
some computation from an exception it
will return a failure object with the
exception if it succeeded it will just
give us a success object with the bottom
so okay so let's stop right now I think
our power of the friends so first thing
I did isn't it affects user and I
wrapped it through the future so now
it's not normal walking and it means
returns the future and then what I did
is I used math to pass the value of
future when it's finishes to the rest of
the program so you can consider the rest
of the program is a continuation to the
future so once the future sorry once the
user we you know come back to the
database this program will run and that
will produce a future of type int
because that in a dog returns number of
modified other than new friends now one
would change I done to this metal is our
product and market Faren parameter
co-sponsor so HTTP thread passes the
response object this matter and this is
useful because what we can do is
register callback which when when when
the whole best work when the whole
column operation finishes is going to
write a rev Li to the response so that
way our function and how big France is
no longer blocking what we do is
function we just spawn the part of the
computation and you register on complete
um have a callback which is going to
write the response when when it's ready
so that way HTTP bread is free to handle
a lot of requests so that's a that's a
huge thing obviously we have a paralyzed
not much you just make things as simple
as but but when we managed to free the
HTTP threats well just do you know so
you can do a very positive things so the
next logical thing to do would be to
paralyze the API calls to Twitter and
Facebook but we try and do this we'll
have a problem because that that that
call if we convert convert it to some
English sudan's future will give us a
future future so we need to find a way
of combining those features lucky star
futures are not eat so they have this
flat map coordinator which helps us to
do exactly that so if you have a future
of huggle and then we have a function
which based on the apple produces future
of orange let me convert it to future of
orange or if you want more meaningful
example let's say we we were back and
what we want to do is we want to produce
an account balance for the user so first
thing we do is actually use a record
from the database and then once we get
user record we can fetch their account
balance but both reading the record
number of the user and reading the
balance our futures so now we can
combine with you
and as a result we can get a future of
double so if we say pass the future to
some further programs they don't have to
know how we obtained that account
balance they just scared about the fact
that they've got a future of bubble of
bank account so it's great so let's go
back to our really hard combination
example now I decided that I want to
render HTML you know after I'm sorry
obtained by my body double so I've got
this render HTML and this is so some
with a rocket to the future as well so
so we got this X tutor which is a future
bubble now what we can do is you can
just pop up that with render HTML and
that will give us good restraint and
then once we've got a future of Swing
you can do the usual logistical Les Deux
my call it whatever you want so let's
apply that to do our public friends so I
make it the effectuation of France of
synchronous as well rubbing into the
future and now I'm my exactly the same
trick as before to the offense Frenchman
sorry Facebook French because French
president friends will produce a future
of Facebook friends then we mark the
rest of the program to get the future
event and then um we've got this two
futures now right we've got this inner
and outer future so in order to compose
them which is going to fold flat map so
before we're going fetch you with math
now we're going flat klappa so I can I
think the further and then I can
fertilize all this synchronous calls
like fish with your friends au marriage
will be safe later on
patience but that would produce a very
very nice instructor so this is not what
we want to do luckily Scala has for
comprehension which understands one on
extractors and which lets us rewrite
flat map the series of flat maps
followed by by map using for prevention
so how the for comprehension works so it
takes to violent contained by some sort
of container in our case in the future
and extractive and sets the powerball on
the left so so what's going to happen is
future one so what it's going to do is
it's going to extract 1 and 7 horrible a
temporary valid lower leg up to one so
then in the next line it's going to use
that okay and it's going to produce the
future of 1 plus 5 at six it's going to
extract it value set the x 6 and then
I'm actually able to call yelled which
is sort of equivalent to map in our
changing flat maps and it will use that
value to produce the display so now we
look at the fragment repeating again
using for comprehension so personalized
specular extract the use of digital
horrible in fact facebook friends have
started facebook friends wearable and
then we can use those variables inside
of the continuation which which is in
the yelled expression now i'm going to
rewrite the whole program to actually be
valley a synchronous and using for
comprehension so what I did is I I took
all these methods which are synchronous
and then wrap them with futures and
wrote it using photogrammetry now one
thing they taste like here is the
underscores so safe user notify and
hopeful advice they don't they don't
produce any bugs they are
side affecting so this is a way of thank
former Angela we ignored the value of
the of the container right so that's why
I'm the restaurants casa now if I will
be entirely obvious that these two
sections the top and bottom sections are
not parallel if you think about it they
translated to change flat maps and the
white flag works is it only creates a
new future the inner future if the
previous teacher finished so so this is
not parallel this is synchronous but no
power but luckily there is a way so I
highlighted these two sections because
in extortion in each section I'm totally
independent so fetching user fat chick
Facebook friends facebook and twitter
friends are it's totally independent so
you can write it in parallel there is a
Combinator in scala theatres explodes if
so if you have two futures to start with
features and just called Satan 1 plus
the other it will produce a future which
will return a top of results and it will
only return when both of them compete so
using that zip code Combinator we can
use the Combinator which doesn't for
arbitrary number of futures so that's
what I did and I just I just holds it
and possible these three features they
start immediately and they will finish
the whole future naming the top of three
items will finish with the last of this
uterus finishes okay so let's take a
look at durations now so the first
section will take two seconds because
each of the longest calls takes two
seconds of maximum the longest feature
takes
seconds and they run in parallel
obviously that's assuming that we've got
enough computing power to do that the
bottom section will take one second
because indications take each take one
second so they can be running parallel
now so that the whole thing now takes
three seconds so that's great we we just
managed to cut in half the duration of
of the whole request so bad what is even
nicer is that we actually when you look
at this program it's not far from the
original program it's sort of the same
program purchase without balls and maybe
a zip made it slightly different but
it's still the same really good proper
and when you get used to that protection
it just it just feels good so now the
question remains what does would have
done well you know hasn't any influence
on the tribute of our system remember
that it was 166 requests per second what
would do you think does it improve the
trouble is it going to go down is it
going to go up any ideas
upward are you okay let's have a look so
let's imagine we had 500 requests which
hit our server at the same time what we
need to do is we would kiss me running
things in parallel we need father
impressed go to Twitter 500 drugs to go
to Facebook and finally going meeting
fetching the user from the database if
it's relatively fast so we need one or
two dressed just fetch all this 500 user
accounts in the meantime so we already
use thousand threads just go to you know
to Twitter and Facebook then we would
manage it just will be really brief like
fraction of a millisecond again we would
be 500 francs for this and then
eventually we would have to send them to
vacation so 500 dress that removed users
500 other users and vacations again I'm
going safe say user because it would be
made 24 plus this time so we've used all
thousand dress but what now we've got
we've got 500 requests in three seconds
which means that we can do thousand
requests in six seconds so actually if
you're good stays the same why why so
well the problem here is that our
address whenever they call external API
they are blocking and this is bad and
let's see how bad it is so in human
terms this is this is the world
dreadlocks actually human terms
civilization of requests takes three
hours then bread waits for 55 years and
then the response comes back and it
takes two hours this year Eliza so hope
you see is 55 years into an
so now if we instead use a single API so
after serializing the request will just
say schedule that will request that the
right synchronous right our threatened
could handle 100,000 similar requests in
the meantime before the response came
back so that is that is so significant
so that's let's have a look at our
function let's assume that we are using
soon as I oh so fresh section first
three requests then they are after three
but will decline by six hours so we're
still in human terms talking in human
terms let's 18 hours the bottom section
will be around 30 days the way I family
is assumed there would be I 25 new
friends in 25 year old friends obviously
it may be not very realistic scenario
but it's let's take this so that in
total gives us 14 days and if you think
about it before it was 170 years now
we've got 14 days of actual cpu usage or
actual threat time everything else was
just waiting so now a little bit averted
back to normal times that will be around
1.2 milliseconds that means then we can
do 830 requests per second on one more
obviously I'm very optimistic here
because that would assume that we are
using hundred percent of the CPU of time
but we're talking about the maximum here
and using a two course that'd be sixteen
hundred and sixty which is exactly ten
times and I say I didn't make it to look
like that was accidentally happened
actually all these generations I need is
on the back of an envelope so you need
to take it with a pinch of salt but the
order of magnitudes are are correct here
so now we improve their trip with ten
times by combining the string
is programming and racked programming
this a synchronous i/o ok let's talk
about a factors so what are our actors
actors are just objects just regular
objects but with one difference and the
only way you need to communicate the
external world is your synchronous
measures so this is the example of an
actor system I think toward with my life
because it's he comes from the telecom
domain so let's say you've got a phone
connection after this is heavily inside
of your phone phone connection after
that phone connection actor gets
messages from microphone actor and then
does a little bit of noise counseling
and all that stuff producing feedback in
it would would send it to rain regular
would send it to the person you talked
to then when they speak back that's
where you would send some messages back
to the connection actor that direction
actor will do a little bit of smart
stuff and then it would send it messages
to speaker they will then go to be a
keyboard rocker which would react what
are using the keyword in sand into
connection after now actors are no
tracks so what does it mean well after
such as objects which have a queue of
pending messages I like to think about
actors us more like puppets in a mature
you need an animator daddy make after
and this role of an animator is late by
dispatcher threat the threat has an
ulcer dispatcher has a pool of price and
what districts do is they look for
records which have any messages and once
they find such after they they take a
message of that of the queue of the
actor and then they animate the actor by
Colleen has received method now when
opens with the messages person by the
actor this thread goes and finds another
actor takes a message of the queue and
person
animate well that's in theory in
practice what happens is to avoid
context switching probably one redwood
versus more than one message for a
particular actor but the reason of link
between thread and an actor because what
can happen is that same factor can be
animated by multiple drugs and the same
threat and animate multiple actors so
the thing that's useful method for a
curse of puppets without pratts they
just dead how that would look like after
in a car just needs to implement the
active threat and he needs to provide a
receipt method which in turn is a
partial function and this function
function defines how afternoon reacts
the messages so how a simple actor what
it does extracts a and B from the
message except ask them and then sense
the response time actually I didn't tell
the whole / when I said how this
patchwork will explain how special
comments the messages actually
dispatcher before it calls received
methyl it sets couple of fields on the
knocker object and one of them is Sandra
so then after and send a message back to
the sender and the ! is just it's just a
method called it's just the name of the
method leaves that you can use tell that
means send a message to an actor and
this is obviously not working a
synchronous call this is just an cueing
the message in queue of the center actor
so now I'm how to create an anchor and a
co-sleeping microsystems so we need to
create a consistent first and then we
just call an actor of methods office for
the system and this scenario we just
don't give give it a name of the acronym
name the glass Sofia in section so once
once we've got the art of reference you
can send a message straight and in this
example actually the simple actor will
happen nobody to be response dude
because we your manliness in Minecraft
not within the actor context so so
simple like a response to our ad message
that message gets will get lost but it
will be sent to the dead-letter queue
but there is actually a way of getting
responses from from actors so there is
think old pass by an aspirin adds
texture method extra methods to a carafe
and in particular the ? matter what ?
method does it creates a temporary actor
actors are very cheap to create by the
way super Jeep you can millions of them
so it would create a Deborah wrapper and
it would send a message to do our simple
actor and then it would return us a
future and that future will only
complete when I'm the simple our
response to our message so once we've
got the response future will get into
the usual stuff with it we can do one
complete come down and pass it on map
flatmap whatever we want to do now we
want is still absolutely a practical
example of martyrs and I chose an
example which is very close to me it's
wrapping the cygnus cygnus resource with
the synchronous adi it's it's often the
case that when you start writing the
single assistance you hit this roadblock
that your drivers or you just database
driver so HTTP API will be sink this so
this is i'm going to show you like a
universal way how you can deal with
resources which are seen this so on the
left-hand side we've got a blind on the
right-hand side we get resource I pick
legolas and there is a connection so
you'll probably meet more than one click
what we going to do is you're going to
wrap those connections with actors so
each connection will be will have one
actor so one actor will wrap one
connection let me univ sad occur because
we don't want I client to know about all
the details behind the scenes we just
wanted to talk to this as a director and
the selector will talk to the rotor
rotor will know how to route the
messages and it will use oops oh this is
fully what happens when you use too much
delicious um so we got roota boota will
learn and release load balancer to the
load balancer messages between numbers
and it will use supervisor and to deal
with error situations and I think Tobin
mentioned some sort of supervision stuff
there hello and I have very similar
stuff actually our guys read Basin Ella
and ok and the last actor we can have
here is in one in corrector so our
connection actors well talk to the
modern director and tell you about its
status so if the connection goes down it
goes up what the director wants to know
about it and it will aggregate it's
eight of the resource and we'll send it
back side after so that as a liability
act accordingly ok let's have a look
what happens when the clients and sends
a message so we see it sends it to the
south after so our roots it to forwards
into the rotor rooter uses to the
balancer to send it to the one of the
connection occurs and that gets
obviously executed against the resource
now if everything is fine the return the
result message is going to be sent
directly to the client bypassing all the
the other stuff but what is more
interesting is what's going
failure so whether it's a good thing
first thing we have to do is it would
send a message back to the client to
tell if something went wrong then it
will send a message to Molly director to
tell 80 my connection is in danger it's
down and then that message that every
message will get propagated this
supervisor and what supervisor will do
it will kill the Aqua yeah so we want to
fight fail fast we wanna hear
potentially in a corrupt state of a
connection because we have no way to
tell what goes here whether they can
actually still in a consistent safe so
it's easier just to kill the anchor and
next thing happens is when we haven't
see is the supervisor spin the new actor
and replace the old actor within you and
it sends a okay message to the new
actress sends a message to the mornin
tracker that I hope okay I've got one
more connection working so stick quickly
look at what send over wires and that
message is actually a function it's a
function for resource result so research
can be database connection to this
connection can be JMS session or some
sort of object representing the
connection with the resource and the
result is anything you want to live free
time I just created a command type 2
assassin alius and now the wallet or
solid object vasai dr. Michael darkest
hour art or database in this case we
could just do something like that you
could just use house cutter and just
send some sort of command do it
extensively with an action actor so
first thing connection after does is it
opens a connection to the resource and
then when it will be successful it
immediately sends in a message to the
monitor the connection is up now when
you look at the receipt method of our
connection actor it only responds to
messages which are tacos over the
command and deadlines we are using
deadline here it is sometimes gets
situation where there is there's a lot
of messages which pile up while the
connection is so or down like that and
it might happen that there are some
messages in our queue which nobody waits
for any more so there is no point
calling the database it normally works
for the response anyway so we throw this
message is immediately away so actually
their message before a command is not
find out what we're going to do this we
just because it's remember it's just a
function which takes a resource and
produces something just going to call it
and we're going to pass our resources to
it I think we sent a response back to
the sender and as I mentioned previously
if something goes wrong this dream cell
death gets caught and first thing we do
is we send a message to the center we
send money monitor connection de is done
message and then it goes the research
let's have a look at the facade actor
sofas Iraq and festival it doesn't race
in Mali director and then what is more
interesting it creates a good time and a
way to create a brooder in in Scala and
sounds very very simple what you do is
you just say okay I want this connection
actor to be wrapped by the hotel and
here is the load balancing policy we're
going to use smallest mailbox rotor and
by the way this load balancing policy
with will use X number of actors with
spawn the next number of factors in our
case experiment surprised by connections
marble so let's say we want to have five
connections and then the next thing we
do is we just say okay with supervisors
strategy and in this example it's very
simple supervisor 7g no matter what
exception is going to happen inside of
the a / just to start it um just a
question how much time left ok ok as
there is one more thing which is very
interesting here is the dispatcher I
actually puts us in this configuration I
say with this margin and the president's
budget I said that there is echo echo
system has a dispatcher and its partner
is a pool of friends but in fact we can
have more than one day started with an
active system and Su Su close situations
like exactly like like this one because
imagine that we had 5000 I pool and we
had five connections to the database now
if all these connections were blocking
and waiting for database to respond to
us that active system will be frozen
nothing else in this actor system could
happen because all the threads will be
used for dealing with dangerous
connections so that's why we can create
a separate the structure dedicate a
number of threads police dispatcher and
have to dispatchers these two red bulls
and that way all the actors all other
actors in our active system can still
work fine ok let's look at
receive medical facade Parker actually I
said that you can define the behavior of
the actor by defining their seed method
but in fact what we can do is during the
weather director is live you can swap
that the figure and what what it gives
us is our actor can have like an
internal state machine so what I do is I
start some setups a doctor in a safe I
pulled it resources up so when you look
at the resources up it's just a partial
function and what it does is when when
we get the command it will just you know
forward that come on to the looter but
when it gets the resources down message
from the Hollinger what it's going to do
is going to use the context of the actor
to swap the behavior of the Opera so
it's in swap it to resources down so now
we are a new resource is done as state
and when any command keeps us what
you're going to do is see we immediately
respond this resource is that burning of
why I handle viable so we fail fast
let's reading us and obviously when you
get the resource up message again from
the monitor when one of the connections
starts successfully we flip back to the
resource website and last but not least
is the monitor our turn the monitor
record says in inactive say and when the
connection actors starts coming up sat
coming up and laying send connection up
message to the tournament director so
that when will sleep there in from
inactive to active one then active to
defeat the number represents how many
connections there is obviously when we
get a connection is reducing from active
k plus one elective k so eventually when
we hit when we are in active while and
we
the message connection is that we go
back to inactive say and what's
interesting about inactive saying when
we entered inactive say we immediately
schedule a message to itself um the
message i called it inactive for a long
time and when the message after a delay
in say five seconds hits them on
interactor and it's still in active site
that moves it to inactive for a long
time and when after won't record enters
this ad immediately sent a message
through to the selector resources down
because it was down for too long we
waited for a moment for the connections
to come up but now there is a little
prices here so i better tell the facade
actor so we can react accordingly and
obviously when we get a connection up
from an action actor we go back to
active one state and we send a message
resources out okay i hope i hope you
enjoyed the part about futures and how
to make the euro your system or parallel
without losing the simplicity and i hope
that you're going to use more
synchronous i/o when you heat the
throughput problems in your systems and
i hope that an example of factors will
inherit you to experiment with accuracy
near systems this is all i had today
thank you very much and not as bad for
questions
so the question is what's going to
happen when this batch of threat calls
received negative and actor in our two
blocks inside of that I it looks the
track that's the answer so there is no
magic bullet yeah yeah this is what you
have the game is that it's separated so
if you have dedicated to fret sorry then
this self tracks for it the booking only
happens in ethnic food and if you want
bday you want to use Cygnus I there is a
code book and good good going hope he
will inform this pattern at it should
spell another graph because talking and
he can see you
that's right the reefs in cyber virus as
another collaborator is a functional
block e so if you wrap your expression
with this correctly because there is
there is a solution for situations like
that actually what i would suggest in
this particular example for you can use
the dispatcher which has it spins
dispatcher which means that you actually
dedicate thread director this is against
the actor model but in certain scenarios
like like this one where you have thread
local staff or 4i on where it actually
doesn't pay off to do the context
switching you you know you will own well
it makes sense at one breath connection
anyway even used as so-called into
dysfunction
not to all this fabric but only move the
last three operations into several
actors and inspired by the user
community would it put it this simple
option so let's have a look that's of it
so you saying that first read operations
are dependent I would say he aren't
fetching Selfridge facebook friends and
fish leader first the arm and the only
reason okay here right I could return
just after the match because I've got
all the information to return that's
right but something will be still job to
do so I could pretend from HDD western
make sense absolutely I difference-maker
HTP request pasa obviously this is just
an example right so you know but in your
system so you probably have situations
when you can't whether you will do I
have to wait until the whole thing
finished do you have any other questions
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
