background fun well that you found her
way better or nothing that I have French
bet yes well I guess it wasn't program
oh yeah - the viola is something like
that and then it became game developer
and then I became a functional
programmer and so you're how many pairs
for ginger right what what kind of
things they do that what motivates you
to come to those your comments so we who
are the Americas no 1 and terminal exit
and we make for the celebration and the
automotive industry
and there is not here we have a talk
about making a graphical ID eating a
biscuit which is more intense kind of
things that probably thirsting for any
50 for the business end to life quite a
bit yeah they do
why why specifically literature
conference why not data
maybe her little comfort ah we were
invited I was invited
prestigious I always said well you've
got an interesting perspective
considering that you're not necessarily
of an illiterate background what you're
hearing lipstick on so from that
perspective what do you like that you
see around us commerce Judy Gardiner
went very cheerful community everyone's
very happy really nice and everything is
quite about making things nice and nice
quick kinda present world even though I
thought I can't relate to my talk
because they're not
I've been collecting for myself in my
own side but they ever really use it for
anything production understand and going
to an oyster conference motivated you to
possibly try and learn and observe what
is done is more
well yes but probably they don't really
ever use case now see how the kind of
acting for using from just write your
entire ID in one three
yes such as everything I used to hear
the game developer work like their early
exact WX tools which is OpenGL assist
women being completely monster flying
through lobbies on you offended cooking
problems which I was talking to the guy
in just moments ago yes yes about game
development in with fun Charlie which is
so it's a problem in general but it
specifically interesting in Manila fear
because it's got this amazing ability to
do things for currency currently and
they are how to use that in jail you
will just figure it out you know people
are using it for the backend and that
make sense that it's a normal way to do
things for News Service
if I show yes but if you want to do it
for the front end or the rendering and
then like the entity component systems
are sort of stuff then you will need to
think about it and I think reading the
some of that he has a about
synchronizing components of properties
in for thinking of game development back
in code much of the succeeding so I
always need to go back and say that
interfere
at the other sound like that first time
I just uh give me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
