key left and he weather remember our ten
years ago he from Bobeck Universal back
until you finally get under his doing
any sense
maybe absolutely lightning talk to them
she might trying even know
then he such a decently odd he staged a
good company in South America but they
are going international here until a
competition area here which is called
few lines most importantly I wanted to
be here so she was into all because if
you take a twenty or twenty call
overpriced to be here at least right
like a pure ago okay picture so everyone
I believe a picture slide and I hope my
English is going to be okay because of
juices are let's start again
for my next Omega J I'm from Trent I am
the co-founder and CTO of a company
called shoe line and I'll explain a bit
later what we do make a key and we don't
have a website yet although we have two
years of experience but we do manager an
open source library so I guess so if you
want to find us online there is
something with our name and the I'm a
teacher at first
I'm also an architect of ATI first
systems I'm also a developer of Jews
even if it's not Maya the only activity
that that I am and I will develop a part
in because oh I started Roger
15 years ago I was happy and I will
enjoy over so you're understand why I'm
talking a lot about it yet another my
project sources I used to be a teacher
of the level it coding bootcamp internal
language and we teach creative people
without any technical
skills how to develop and it is done
with rudy' event and also widely spoken
in part about fruity so I do believe
it's a city in northern France
it's a ninety day and we are basically
at the heart of our Western Europe so we
are just like two hours away from any
major city by train and we do not appear
like we have a lot of beer it is so if
you end up around leave some time you
have to tell them and this is our
national dish it's going to wedge it has
nothing to do with the Welsh people we
don't even know why it's called the
Welsh and basically just the bread beer
and cheese cheddar is quite goodness
okay so what about you like my
convention we provide tech education we
do that for invective people so they can
grasp a little little bit better with
this digital description that everyone
is talking about is really about but we
also teach some developers subcision
developers that used to work with other
technologies like Java C++ etc we are
kind of but being able to speak with any
clear and and music colleges that we lot
and we especially love in India
we've also got the community so we are
involved in a rhythm which is Gaurav SP
SP for functional programming is the
biggest French dependent on functional
programming we are around 50 under deal
and we do this every two months and I
also started a delimiter it's one of the
biggest that it's not that hard we have
not not that many terminals in France we
have a rough sort Japanese and we try to
do it properly but it's not always the
case so why this talk because we are the
reverse first at my company and we are
also teachers so it's a big thing for us
to be able to transmit our education our
knowledge of a euro for any language it
for the matter to other developers and
we do that to beginners
we never programmed before but also to
season the reverse as well so people
that are you know 40 or 50 years old
that I've always worked with the same
technology and that want to learn a new
one such as XM and we used to do this to
the history with Rudy before and so
there's a disclaimer that comes because
we are still that movie we are just no
longer doing it anymore so we have a
program speckle especially in Alex your
community with so much the reverse
coming from Ruby because we are seeing a
lot and lot of this kind of thing so I'm
voluntour I broke what was say about the
person who was saying that because the
goal is not to form that anyone but just
to introduce and that to us a seer is
not just Julio sterling it's way more so
if we just felt that workers can then
have a very good time with the
researchers by learning Ruby and that
it's going to be easy
we think it's not and we also have the
same kind of things with some libraries
on little once again the goal is here is
not to point at anyone just to say that
we are the church as comparing any
library that we they agree with
something like device I don't know if
you guys know device it's a very real
practical library for doing on education
with realms but we think that nothing to
do with the way and we set up our main
so if Excel go kind of mad to see that
kind of things because the only thing
that would be an ABC are in common is
these guys that you know basically so it
photos we don't
this is versatility is the treasurer of
the language addictive and used to be a
former rails core team member and so the
sort is all about our journey as
developers from object-oriented
to functional programming especially
from Ruby to Olivia and we see that it
is not as simple as going from one
parenting to another one it's way more
complicated than that because the user
is not Ruby
once again obviously because even if
processes and messages could be seen as
the best implementation of rattle until
I didn't mind at the time this is a
little trolley I know that I wanted to
do it a different modules function that
for plastic is in its ability I'm going
to go quickly on those because you
obviously know this stuff guys
there's also pattern matching which is
good not only for ok ok if closes but
it's also very good for the construction
structure we have protocol and we have
macros so we have way more stuff than
Ruby does on this point so yeah we could
say okay Eddy series functional nice so
this is a useful again so we functions
that on functional regions efforts with
our developers so we learned really
about functional about using function as
the primary is that the abstraction that
we had in our programs about
commutativity of data even though young
developers are asking us why we can
rebuy variables in genetics here so we
have to extend them how it works with
expression the overstatement because
after all it's always better when you
have a return value each time and the
famous referential transparency so we
cannot design our output versus input
and purity stuff so this helped a lot
but only for the lower level abstraction
of our program because in fact at the
type we were using settings a lot you
guys know finish with an experiment so
before the white one three versions
that's coming up at the time I am
speaking and we have said
this is going in the good direction but
before that extend for rental we were
not really happy where our up we're
looking at the time because it looked a
lot like like that and this is me not
happy at all about what I was building
because we did everything by the book
and I mean by the books because we read
a lot of those and we said that like we
were just doing the same old
model-view-controller stuff that we used
to do before so yes our code was
functional there were no more if in our
current sense and took when we look at
it it will still like the big old
memories so we weren't at the ethyl so
yet it's very functional but we realized
that this didn't make us feel any better
our apps were not that much better if we
were just focusing on the lessons and we
heard a lot about positive practices so
we really wanted to fit the super well
but we didn't fill them and the
superpowers I'm missing guys the things
that you guys know is that concurrency
distribution fault tolerance in every
databases all code reloading and really
even everything that we see about this
technology that we that we want so much
so yeah we want those things so how do
we do we started with realizing that
okay very serious functional it's not
ugly functional and maybe we should
focus more on the fact that it's about
the autistic patterns that we have to
learn so we looked for a look to try to
understand and to learn more about this
positive pattern because remember we are
Ruby developers and at the beginning and
we found one so I'm going to do some
advertising although this other book
so it's okay if this wasn't a terrific
synergy together by auditioning and way
out I hope I'm not mature in his name
right now and this group was really good
because it helped us a lot
create a program that we started
teaching our developers and ourselves
together better hand at concurrency so
without the bad processes about
predators about supervisors but
especially we learned about implementing
all those deaths sub processes
monitoring provider we learn to do it by
ourselves by em em especially
implementing a work camp or even if it
was hard it was really really
challenging and we learn a lot by doing
some Andrea Clemente a knife version of
transferor was also really really really
enough digital a lot so we got the
concurrency part quite easily with this
book and by doing all those things
manually by ourselves
so it was good but what about
distribution because those distribution
aspects we were we were still trying to
understand how we could really really
leverage on the distribution power of
elixir so it kind of work because what
we saw about distribution was working
somehow but just on one not medically
just on our machine so we were not
really really happy with this so how we
will distribute the state across several
not that's the question that we are a
lot at many conferences and we have
people around us and so they told us
when he released testing if you don't
need distribution so we were like we
really do need
in this case because I didn't talk about
the players that we had but medically in
northern France we have a lot of
retailers and for retailers the main
aspect is that there's millions of users
of duty and they also have really need
for online offline strategies like a we
taught in the into presentation just
before we disconnect what happens when a
store or lost its connection the
business obviously needs to run again so
we need to still be able to accept
payments etc so we are not going to stop
that for when the network comes again
how do we we can cite the stuff that was
done offline with your landscape so it
is a question we needed an answer for
with the system that we were building
with any medium and we felt kind of lost
really at the time because we didn't
know how to tackle this distribution
aspect with Alex here and we didn't find
that in your articles online about how
to do it easy be our and not a lot of
books either so I deployed if
Francesco's in here because we did find
one and this is the one from San
Francisco generally wrote especially the
last part that we finished until just
recently or when the book went out so we
really want to thank him and there's a
video at the biology of conference where
he explained really how in how we could
do distribution with Alex here so if we
find a solution for distribution with a
lecture we did don't really find one in
fact we found three of them so I don't
know which one is the best I'm not even
sure that and I'm pretty sure that there
is more than those three one so the
first one is the one that we like the
most there is
using a sphere and participate only
because this way we wouldn't have an
emergency on our system so it's a fully
meshed topology everybody's name based
on the application that it executes so
if we have let's say a business part of
the of the application it will be named
like this if this is the second one and
if we are cached with the esight it is
the fourth one like that and if it's a
proxy one it will be named like that and
then we can tell exactly which nerd to
connect in case there are in case we
need to execute something and we just we
just do a random go to the node we need
to connect so this is an OTP only
version there the second one is the
cloud she tweaked elliptical medically
is almost the same as the first one but
this one this time we have a dependency
to to evaluate to another cloud provider
for the matter
and so we tie each one of the instances
that execute the application with a tag
name like a default cash business or
property and has not sorted we we read
ad about us back then register does not
put set to a customer district for which
we do to get this data across the cancer
and each time that we need to do go to
injure server we just click it randomly
and we can recall it for business it
works the same way as the one that I
presented before that that relied only
on our budget and if we receive because
it depends a lot on not down SH we
remove the dot from the registry and it
kind of works
and the third solution that we have is
the residential duration so we have you
dependence in the fact that we don't
really like this solution but it's
really easy because it works just as is
like we push that attribute to right
thank you and we use chest age to enter
the incoming data from Remington queuing
distribution is working just by itself
so it's really really easy to do so so
we don't know which one or which is the
best like which one is the best because
we are trying all those three at the
same time so we did not know which one
will keep on but with us to discuss is
about everyone the community and to see
more articles about how to do this kind
of stuff and so with x0 and Aaron we
have an amazing platform with a red
community around so it's really really
we are really happy to have switched to
this technology and we'd like to see
more avoidance of the reveal election
analysis because we think it's not
helping at all it's even more harming
and it's doing best
we'd like to insist on the unique
advantages of ogp way more than what we
see for now and in insisting of the
functional on the functional region of
the language even though they are really
powerful and we also like you to invite
the board upon to try our distributions
try to reemployment
the basic building blocks of OGG like
gem server or the supervision trees etc
because you see how we really got into
into a cheeky with Whidbey and we also
like to see more stuff around about
distributions so it's kind of funny for
me to say political the last oh but what
about distributions but we do think that
this is the killer feature about booty
and we were at the Excel consultants us
jaren in europe here and we didn't see
that much as those about distribution so
we like to see a little more so that
people coming to 2x you could really see
that is the curvature that we like to
hit for for distinguish and thank you
when you say analogies is that you bring
patterns from Ruby to elixir and there
are better ways of doing it in elixir or
wine maybe I didn't have graduate
why'd you denied the analogies because
different doing analogies make it not
but take advantage of the at first we
found that the syntax was really close
and a lot of people in students insist
on that site so we saw a lot of our
students just being very happy with the
indexer cuz they were producing and it
will like just very badly even
object-oriented code without any
object-oriented park they were right it
will be a favorite exactly this was
revealed as with the educators impact
and you could especially with the first
versions of Phoenix you could just write
like MCC code without leveraging any of
your GT buttons like gen server and and
so in the end we find that this is not
really helping to tell people okay you
can go to X here run this this
technology DVD because it's really close
to Ruby and then since yes actually it's
working quite fast and it's it is the
syntactic growth then in the end you are
impression
to that you you are able to write and
clear although you are not doing it like
properly that's why I would say hi
beautiful
with an e because I would weigh 200 GB
world because you give me like a mind of
everyone on 3 version yeah I'm 1.3 in
fact we introduce a new constitution for
the application we no longer have a
folder structure and closed what will be
used to do with rent now you can keep
your application inorganics your way and
the web part of face is just a new
application then comes inside your
project so this is a good way to let you
focus on the implementation of your
education like we do with you would do
sorry with any repetition and then you
have a web later on W and so they also
kill the model part so it's a kind of a
good way of telling people say it is not
your application is just a web layer for
your application for adverse you should
focus on giving an artist actually a
real interpretation so it lets you do a
little bit more into the concurrency
aspects of your application because you
will arrange a little bit more the
processes and that time is done for your
application so I think it is getting in
the in a good way by doing this
so other than in a website what projects
do you think we'll be able act with
example tools are learning addictive in
terms of website know all the neighbors
another weapon Thank You disability but
not with meaning it's not with something
else but will be a good thing to do
I'm sayin occasion that you retrieve
some stuff from an API or locally we are
doing some stuff like that with our
students so we have a very big French
website there's a lot of recipes for
everything that you could make and so we
make them print a 3d version on their
laptop so they could try to query this
website or of the resort and then play
with it on their Channel and so this is
quite a good thing to run because very
easily this very quickly that starts to
create some processes to render the
request more easily and to just
distribute them because they have to
crawl the website so it's kind of a
window into to solve thank you
and it was very interesting here about
that experience you have with Phoenix
and I have mostly the same feeling when
I started like I fell oh this is NBC and
then I cut scene like the servers for
channel and it allows me to do a lot of
things and new things I just want to
take the opportunity to ask you if you
have to start web project today which is
your selected or prefer a stack of
technologies from Berlin today we are no
longer using a Phoenix in height so we
focus on ecto and we are just using
Excel Cabaye and polygon and that's for
the Web API part of it and for the front
end and it's something else but we are
only using react but in fact we found
that just focusing on our business logic
creating elixir apps that just did what
we needed them to do regarding the
business we could easily add a very thin
layer for the web part with protector
and and combine appointment which and
now is are you still with arrow
generally if we are doing just as like a
relational stuff we are using industrial
but now we move to a newer even sourcing
a architecture and we are using catalog
for the world for the other database for
the right and we are using an elastic
search as a kind of cache for the rich
because I can write not really the best
choice when you need to do a lot with
guarantee
and you have questions
