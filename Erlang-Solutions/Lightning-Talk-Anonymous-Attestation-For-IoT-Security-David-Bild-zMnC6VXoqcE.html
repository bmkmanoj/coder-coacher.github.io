couldn't be here today so I'm filling in
from him for him and hopefully we'll do
with his talk justice can everybody hear
me in the back are they perfect thank
you so I'm going to be talking about how
to solve for IOT identity management
using anonymous attestation if the
slides will advance so the arty world is
different from the web world when it
comes to identification the traditional
web world was anonymous in both
directions you connect to a web server
it didn't know who you were you weren't
sure who it was that was extended with
largely one-way authentication TLS HTTPS
where you could validate the web server
was but they weren't authenticating you
if you needed mutual authentication in
the web world you have a user typing in
a password that doesn't work in the IOT
world it's very important there that you
know what device is sending you the data
so you can trust that data and is the
device producing the data you want to
know that who you're sending it to is
actually authorized to get that the same
holds true for control for accessing
location the IOT world is just not the
same as the web world in the web world
there's a user to enter a password for
mutual authentication IOT is autonomous
that's not an option interestingly
there's there's a way we can solve this
and that IOT devices tend to be fungible
if we're gonna scale to billions or even
trillions of devices those devices all
need to come out of the factory
identical we're gonna be producing
hundreds of thousands or millions of
devices that are equivalent and so all
we really need to do for the
authentication step is verify that a
device is part of a particular
authorized group we don't need to know a
particular individual identity for it
initially just that it's authorized as
part of some group so we're going to use
that to enable secure IOT authentication
we could look at trying to use
traditional shared keys PKI is something
that's used in the web world but with
tens of billions of devices doing the
provisioning of all those different keys
before you before distribute in those
devices into the field is just not
scalable we want to be able to take a
device off the factory put it in a box
ship it to its final location and then
turn it on and have it authenticated
without needing to put it in some sort
of secure environment to pre provision a
key first so luckily there is a
technology that's been shipping in Intel
processors since 2008 shipping and arm
TPM chips recently called direct
anonymous attestation that will let us
solve this problem so I'll work through
what direct anonymous attestation is
backwards so the attestation is a device
can prove its membership in a particular
group not prove its individual identity
but just that it's a member of some
group that enables anonymity you don't
know who that specific individual device
is just that it's part of a group its
anonymity set is some some manufacturing
group and then direct there's no need to
trust a third party for validation given
the group public key that's associated
with that group you can validate a
signature from a member of that group
the group key is provisioned at the
device manufacturer or each individual
device that's produced gets its own
private key associated with that group
and the crypto is performed in secure
hardware so these devices can be placed
in the field and the the private key
that send the device is not at risk of
compromised so since that's there let's
use it as I said it's been shipped by
Intel since 2008 by arm it's in the TPM
1.1 and 1.2 and I'm coming 2.0 standards
so that DEA signature can be the root of
secure access for IOT you turn the
device on for the first time
it proves it's or it tests its
membership of a particular group and
from there you can start you can
provision a particular identity for that
device and an additional access key to
prove that
identity so that forms the core of the
company we work at zap them our trusted
transit security solution for the IOT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
