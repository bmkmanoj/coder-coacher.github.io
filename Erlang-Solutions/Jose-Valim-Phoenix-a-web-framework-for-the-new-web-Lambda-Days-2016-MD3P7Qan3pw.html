talk
Phoenix in the sense that you learn how
to use it precisely and we are going to
build an application rather what I think
it's and because this you can find now a
lot of material online to get started
and start you know writing your
application writing your code so what I
want to do here today is to focus on
Phoenix itself and how it works so a
little bit of history and how we were
able to to build things so Alex early
into the arlynn brutal machine a
framework that is both productive and
extremely performant okay so a very
quick glossary we are going to be using
those words a lot so Phoenix is though
is a web framework that was written with
a lecture a programming language and
it's a programming language that runs on
the Erlang Rakhal machine and it was
with the early inverter machine that
everything started so and it started
with one case the whatsapp case which
today is the most you know talked about
and her deployment of large-scale
deployment of Erlang and they got a lot
of attention right because and this was
when Chris McCord the creator of Phoenix
they started to hear more about airline
because whatsapp was acquired by by
Facebook by a huge amount of money and
they were always hoping about the
infrastructure right and they said you
know at the time we had like 10 backends
engineer and we are supporting a huge
amount of traffic right and they would
go and write posts like this that say
you know they had one single machine
running production and that machine will
was able to get 2 million connections ok
so I mean I forgot to say well what is
whatsapp whatsapp is a messaging
application that you store on your phone
right and you can exchange messages with
your friends and you can install
whatever phone you have and you can
create groups and talk to our friends
and so on so and they would wrote like
blog post like this that says you know
they have like 2 million mobile devices
connected to a server and information is
coming and going everywhere
and today they have a really big scale
where they they are handling more
messages than the whole global SMS
system
and so on they have I think at this
point 1 billion users or something like
that so Chris McCord the creator of
Phoenix he heard about this case and
when he was hearing about this he was
working on an application that had to
have some web real time components right
him he needed to connect he needed
clients to connect to the server and he
had information coming going all the
time and the technology that he was
using out that at the time was really
not enough to build what he needed so he
heard this and he thought you know what
it's going to be great if I could use
this technology here right if I could
use the same technology as whatsapp to
build this application hello
so to build this application that I'm
working on right and one of the selling
points here was exactly when you go to
the article and see the machine that
whatsapp was the point of production so
they had a machine with 24 cores then
six gigabytes of RAM to handle those 2
million connections and even though they
were using only 40% of the machine load
so it was like well this thing's going
to scale really well right if I add more
cores to the machine that I'm the point
production that technology is going to
be able to use it is going to be able to
handle even more connections so you know
that's how it started so Chris was he
heard about this his case he got really
excited about Erlang and he found out
about elixir and then he says ok I'm
going to solve this problem right now
I'm going to try to have a good way to
write this application and he created
Phoenix and he started with something
called Phoenix channels ok so at the
beginning there was only the mostly this
Phoenix channels feature and the whole
idea of Phoenix channel is to be an open
communication channel between the client
and the server right so have a client
the clients connected with the server
for long periods of time and information
can go in an interaction anytime you
want and if are talking about the web
the most common client is exactly the
browser ok so you can think that I have
a browser connected to the server and
informations coming going so that's an
example of how this works ok so this is
the little bit of trolling part because
the first code snippet we're going to
see here is JavaScript and so because if
you are talking about the
web right and we're talking about
browsers if a writing client code we we
need to write JavaScript or something
that compiles to JavaScript okay so here
we have some code that's going to run
your browser and there in the first line
the first thing we do is that we start a
socket and when you call socket connect
in the second line there is when you
open the communication between client
and server so now you know the client
open a communication with the server and
that thing is established and now we are
going to say you know we're going to
create channels which is where the
message they are going to be sent there
they always belong to a channel so here
I have the chat lobby channel so if you
think this is the chat application
that's where our users are going to join
they can see who is in the chat right
and then you can say well every time I
receive a message from the server like a
user joined so a user joined somewhere
else in another machine or in the same
machine but from another client we are
going to receive this user joint message
and now we can handle it and we react to
it in our interface right in our browser
now our UI but when someone sends a new
message I can also react to that event
right so the channel on message allows
us to react things that are coming from
the server but you can also say you know
if this particular client if we put
stuff in an input and press ENTER we
want to push something to this channel
and it's going to be sent to the channel
and the channel is going to handle it
okay and after we specify all those
rules you just effectively join the
channel and you're going to get now this
information coming going so that's the
client code okay it's not really a lot
of code and to make this work in the
server we really need two files so the
first one is mirroring the client is
that we need to define a user socket and
here's our first Alex your code right so
this is a very common pattern in alex
here we define a module so in this case
is chat user socket and we say use
Phoenix dot socket to bring the socket
functionality and now I can say you know
if the user is sending messages on this
chat lobby channel I wanted to be
handled by the chat lobby channel module
and then if he's sending messages on the
room channel I want to handle it by this
other module and here is exactly the
player can do things like authentication
and authorization and so on so if the
socket defined we now just need to write
the code for the lab Channel
and the lab channel is just another
module it follows kind of the same
pattern so we define a module we say we
want to use the Phoenix channel
capabilities and we define functions
that they're going to be vocht based on
what happens right on the client so for
example every time the user joins you
we're going to call the DEF join
function and then we're saying oh the
users join the chat lobby and there is a
message and there is a socket which is a
state and when that happens so that's
going to happen every time a new user
joins a lobby we want to broadcast to
everyone right that isn't that Lobby to
let them know that a new user just
joined and that's exactly what we do we
just call broadcast and we say oh I want
to send a user joint message to everyone
that happens to be in this channel and
the user that join has this username and
then we also have handling every time
the client sends a message we can handle
it here and if the client in particular
is sending is Road casting a message to
everyone we just call broadcast again
and that's it that's how Phoenix started
start with this whole channels idea and
you can be looking at this now and say
like okay that's cool that's interesting
but there's nothing really new here
right there are other technologies that
they provide similar solutions to these
kind of problems so where is the
difference what makes Phoenix especial
okay and in order to answer this
question we are going to do two things
they're going to take the outside view
we are going to see how things work from
the outside and they are going to take
the inside view and understand how
everything is working inside the virtual
machine as well so for the outside view
what we have is that then we have the
server okay and we have different
clients connect to the server the first
big difference
the first big advantage that Phoenix
offers is that we say that the channel
Phoenix channels they are transport
agnostic so it doesn't really mean it
doesn't really matter how the client is
connect to the channel we can support
different transport mechanisms so for
example in this case we're using a
browser that's going to use WebSockets
but you can for example be using a
browser like Internet Explorer that does
not support WebSockets and then you need
to fall back to another communication
mechanism but not only that sometimes
they are building mobile applications
that have specific requirements and you
need specifics realization protocol you
can just go and bring your own transport
and or even more interesting right
embedded devices embedded devices we are
talking a lot about Internet of Things
and we're seeing a lot on this area
happening the Elector community and you
know you sometimes we have custom
protocols for embedded device like co-op
or give some messages systems and you
can just bring those in as well so
that's the first difference the second
difference is that Phoenix is going to
scale very well
both vertically and horizontally so
vertically we saw we kind of got an idea
of the whatsapp case right they had they
had a very powerful machine so vertical
is when you start to buy more and more
powerful machines so they had a very
powerful machine of twenty four cars and
it was able to spread and to use all the
machines resource efficiently so that's
good but phoenix is also going to scale
horizontally right by adding more
machines to your deployment right
transparently because we rely on
something called the Erlang distribution
so let's let suppose you're dissin air
like you wrote your application you put
into production and then you're starting
to have more and more clients the first
thing you can do is that you can say
okay I'm just going to bump and get a
more powerful machine but at some point
say okay I cannot handle all the traffic
in one machine anymore or you want to
have more machines for you know fault
tolerance reasons so what you can do is
that you can just put another machine
your cluster you have a one line
configuration file that tells you know I
have one other machine running here and
that's it right everything is going to
work so now for example imagine that you
put another machine into production and
then you have the browser it disconnects
from this machine and when it reconnect
it can reconnect to the other server and
everything is going to continue working
as before if this browser sends a
message it's going to go to that server
the server is going to send to this
server that's going to broadcast to our
clients and this versa
okay so you can scale in both directions
and it's going to be really
straightforward to without external
dependencies we're about to rely on the
database Radice or or not so those are
already two big differences right
they're talking about being able to
bring whatever you want to play into
phoenix and we are talking about the
scaling be much more straightforward but
things get much more interesting right
when we take the inside view because
we're going to see the concepts here
that are really going to make us
productive when building phoenix
applications okay
so here too
trade this idea I have the client here
on the on the left side okay and we have
and here is what is going to happen on
the server so we can think that a client
right is going to connect to the server
when we call socket socket not connect
in the client and then what this is
going to create when we connect is going
to create a new process on the server
and from from now on until the end of
the talk every time I say process I
don't mean an operating system process I
mean an airline virtual machine process
which is a very cheap a very lightweight
trial of execution in the whatsapp case
for example didn't they have two million
connections so they had at least two
million processes one per connection
okay so we really created up a bunch of
those processes right we can go ahead
and create a bunch of them so when the
client connects to the server it's going
to create a new process and this process
is the one responsible to handle the
connection to handle the transport okay
and now every time you don't you join a
different channel like chat chat lobby
or a particular room we are going to
create new processes as well and the
reason why this matters is because
processes in the early inverter machine
they are isolated and concurrent this
means that being isolated means imagine
that there is a bug in the chat lobby if
that process crash the one that's run
the chat lobby all the other chat
functionality all the other channels
they will continue working just fine
because they are isolated the connection
is not going to be affected and this
matters a lot in cases like embedded
devices alright we're establishing a
connection can be expensive you didn't
want to do that all the time so the
isolation really gives us guarantees for
us developers to not worry about you
know wait if something goes wrong is
going to bring the whole thing now or
anything wait continue running its way
to continue running just fine because
they are isolated and they are
concurrent which means if one channel
for example is for some reason
processing an image or Radeon an
external API it's not going to to block
right it's not going to block the other
channels they are all concurrent between
them they are all running at the same
time and so those are the guarantees we
have a modeling everything with
processes and then at the end we are
talking about the inside view we also
have a pub sub process which is the one
responsible for exchange information
between
machines right so that's the one if you
send something one machine the reason
why it's going to show up in the other
machines as we saw before right is
because they have a pub/sub system that
is exchanging information qu and the pub
sub system use distributed Erlang by
default so you don't need to worry about
anything you just need to tell where
each node exists but if everyone is
something where you cannot make the
Machine stuck to each other you can rely
on something like Redis for example
Postgres qu and that's how Phoenix
started and it grew up right to be much
more than channels today it's a complete
web framework and you can use it to to
build this web real-time stuff we're
talking about but it can also build
regular html5 applications or api's
distributed systems and so on and the
reason why Phoenix was able to grow so
much and why it got so interesting is
because the Phoenix car team we realized
something
realize the following a lot of the tools
that you use today regarding the web
they kind of give us this false
dichotomy they say you know you have to
choose you have to choose between being
productive or you have to choose between
being performant right they say you know
you can use this particular two or this
particular framework that's going to be
very opinionated
but then you're going to sacrifice
performance which means you're going to
sacrifice also UX because your
application is not as fast as it could
be so you're sacrificing a lot of things
right down the pipe in for sake of
productivity and then you have other
solutions that say you know we're not
going to be super productive here
because we are really offering like
low-level stuff right that runs close to
the bare metal right and then if they
say you need to choose which one you
pick and realize that we Phoenix you
don't have to choose we can have both
right this is this choice you don't need
to make this choice okay so that's what
I want to talk about for the rest of the
talk so we just went through the
introduction with how Phoenix came to be
and for the rest of the talk I want to
focus exactly on those two aspects right
how feelings can be performant and how
it can be productive and what that means
to us so I will start with the
performance thing because we can be a
little bit more analytical about it and
show some numbers and and I and because
talking about channels I want to talk
very quickly about the work we did in
channels performance and which
performance I can expect from it
so you know we talked about whatsapp
case how they had two million
connections and the question is can we
achieve the same with Phoenix and the
truth is that you can so we're doing
some benchmarks on our channel system
and here you can see a graph of here on
the horizontal axis we have time and
then on the vertical one the number of
clients and you can see that we are
pushing new clients to the server at the
rate of 10 K clients per second to 20 K
clients per second so you can see that
we are pushing load and this is a single
Phoenix machine so you're pushing load
to this machine until we get to the
point of having two million clients and
the interesting thing about this
benchmark is that we could go beyond 2
million we were just we were just not
optimistic enough when we were when we
were configuring the machine we set the
limit in the OS level of sockets to be 2
million but if we have be a little bit
more optimistic we would be able to
continue going ok so we do get the the
performance results we're able to expect
and it's really nice because after we
got 2 million connections in if you go
to H stop to see how the cores are being
used because they are just connected
there is not really information coming
and going you can see this is a powerful
machine it has 40 cores you can see all
the cars are idle right and then after
we have got the 2 million connections we
got in Wikipedia article and we
broadcast to everyone and it was able to
broadcast the art coming like three four
seconds to all the two million connected
clients and then you could see all the
security spiking right starting to do
some work so this is really really nice
right and really we're getting the
performance we expected so that's cool
but as I said right it's not only about
the the channel stuff Phoenix is a you
know full-fledged web framework so the
regular HTTP HTTP stack we have it there
and it performs really really well too
so before I move on I'm going to show
some numbers and every time I show
benchmarks number I need to do the
disclaimer right don't trust benchmarks
right use it
you know as a guidance whatever need to
do you should never base our decisions
only our performance numbers per se
otherwise may as well write binary code
right so so there we go and you can go
to this ripple story to find more
information about the numbers but I want
to use those numbers just to give an
idea of what is happening here right so
here at the top and this is a machine if
I remember correctly with 10 or 20 cars
ok so at the top we have plug which is a
very free abstraction Alex around the
web server and you can see that it gets
2000 requests per second ok 200,000
sorry and what is really interesting
about those numbers right is that
Phoenix comes right after an interesting
thing is that Phoenix plugs a very
abstraction and Phoenix is a web
framework and even for being a web
framework and adding things like Flash
session security concerns the the the
impact it has in the fruit put it's only
off 10% right and this is good it means
as you add your own business logic
you're not going to see a huge impact in
the fruit put and then below we can see
things like gene written in gold playing
in Scala and in the bottom half of the
table we see things like next press
clustering no then solutions other
solutions and go in some solutions in
Ruby and another thing that's nice to
highlight in in engels numbers is that
for this whole table only rails play in
Phoenix they are actual frameworks all
the others are like kind of libraries so
you need to assemble everything together
by the fold they are going to do less
things so and we can see here how
Phoenix and playing rails doing a lot
more how they are going to to behave
right so and again so those are numbers
take it with a grain of salt it should
run your own benchmarks I have an idea
what you can build based on your use
case but what is even nicer to explore
in terms of performance than those
numbers is exactly to try to understand
right how can we get such good
performance and to do that in to
understand how that works in the HTTP
regular stack I want to go back to the
client server view right I want to go
back to the inside view so again it
works very similar to ad
sockets in the sense that every time the
client connects to the server we are
going to spawn a new process that
lightweight route of execution to handle
that request and as we have different
clients doing requests right we are
going to have new and more processes
being spawned and again wide using
processes is interesting it's because
processes they are isolated and
concurrent and what this means for
regular HTTP requests is the following
right so first crashes are isolated we
want that right if one request fails it
should not make an unrelated request
fail as well but not only the crashes
are isolated the data is isolated
everything that belongs to a process is
not shared with another process and what
this means is that the garbage collector
it's per process right it's you we don't
have to stop the world garbage relax we
don't have a point where our garbage
collectors won't say hey I need to stop
everything that's running so I can do
garbage collection right that doesn't
happen and this really matters because
if you're using other platforms right
and then this can be anything like Java
Ruby Python node whatever you're using
and if you start measuring your your
system performance you can you can look
at the average and the average would say
oh you have a good average like 15
milliseconds for example for requests
but when you go to the end of the tail
of the the response times of your
performance you're going to see that the
99th percentile right the longest
requests are going to see that there are
users that are waiting like two seconds
three seconds to have a request
fulfilled and that's because those are
the unfortunate users that trigger the
garbage collector and then there's
nothing you can do you just have to wait
you have to wait the garbage collector
to finish running okay and here we don't
have this concern the garbage collectors
per process if you have fast requests
you can even have a request coming
allocating data and then the request is
over the process is gone we don't even
need to garbage collect we can just
reclaim back and all that the process
created and as before we can load
balance on both IO and CPU right so it
doesn't matter if you are waiting on the
back hand or if you're processing some
image we are going to use all of our
machine resources efficiently
cool
so that was performance right and kind
of give an idea on how Phoenix can
perform really really well and now we're
going to the organic to the most
interesting part of the talk which is
where we're going to talk about
productivity and when we talk about
productivity I always like to break
productivity in two parts okay we have
the short term productivity which is
like you know you just saw this talk you
got really excited and you want to try
Phoenix back home right you want to
create a first project and start to get
something going
so how productive you're going to to do
in doing that and there is a lot a lot
of concerns here right because we're not
talking only about a web framework but
very likely you are you have to learn a
new language as well which is Alex here
so here we need to have a very strong
focus on documentation and guides right
getting started material books and so on
but we also need to have a very good
concern in terms of workflows right we
need to have a good workflow that at the
beginning is going to guide you to
whatever you want to build at that
moment and help you get your first steps
out but more important than the
short-term productivity is the long-term
productivity right because you have a
lot of tools that they sacrifice the
long term productivity in terms of the
short one they are tools that it's very
easy for you to get started but as time
passes and you need to maintain whatever
it's running production or continue
evolving the code it gets really really
harder so here in the long term
productivity we have other concerns
right we have for example introspection
because if it's long term productivity
it means that this system is now
actually running production you need to
maintain that thing you need to ensure
it's working out so how well can we
understand the season that's actually
running there so introspection matters a
lot and it's also about montane ability
right you have the system running there
when you need to start evolving changing
the code how well can we do this ok so
that's what we're going to cover for
productivity so let's get started with
productivity we can start with the short
term productivity and as I said the
commentation matters a lot so if you go
to the phoenix website phoenix framework
org and we are going to have guides that
cover from you know getting started
installing installing whatever
dependencies you need
to the point the system to production on
your own on your own cloud or whatever
you use or to something like Heroku and
we also we are really proud to have just
we have written a book called
programming Phoenix I am one of the
authors with Bruce State it's also here
and it just went into production this
week like two two days ago so we're
really proud of that and we hope it's
going to be an excellent resource for
folks that want to learn more about
Phoenix and get started we cover
everything from the basic you know MVC
up to getting up to channels and doing
more of those web real time stuff and
talking about MVC right something that's
going to help a lot folks coming from
other frameworks and sorry Phoenix is
that we use the MVC pattern with a
slight twist okay so if you're already
familiar with that you you have a better
idea of how you can organize your code
and so on and that's going to help you
get started as well and something that
helps a lot is that we also have
generators as learning tools a lot of
tools they have like they have
generators code generators and a lot of
folks think that you're going to use the
code generator to generate pretty much
your application right it's like oh are
you a programmer no I'm a code generator
right I just run the generator and
everything comes out at the end and
that's not the focus we wanted to take
we wanted to have generators as learning
too so for example imagine that you just
installed Phoenix you create a first
application they're like okay I have no
idea what I need to do now I have no
idea how to create a model how to
organize my controller I have no idea
what I should put in the view how I
should render stuff so if you're
building html5 application you can just
run this comment makes Phoenix dodge an
HTML and it's kind of going to lay out
some files we try to minimize the amount
of files we layout with the structure
that it should think about to start
writing something HTML base write
something that's going to receive data
from a form and put that data from the
form into your database and then get
data from the database and show it back
to the user but if you are building an
API you can run the JSON command and
it's going to guide you to that
direction okay any further interested in
the web real time stuff you can try the
channel generator so it's really good
because you can get there around these
commands and kind of having
on how you have to say or from that
moment on and we're talk about
productivity a lot of the tools that you
expect to be available in other
frameworks they exist in Phoenix too so
we are talking about how to get data
from the forms right up to the database
so we have something called form
builders that's going to help with that
if you are building html5 applications
you cannot escape from it you need to
write CSS needs to write JavaScript so
integrate with a build tool that is
going to take care of this and it in
fact uses es6 which is a new version of
javascript and which my own pin is a
huge improvement to the previous version
so you're going to squeeze some extra
productivity from theirs as well we have
something really nice which is called
live reloading and these basically means
like for example if you are changing a a
template right with some HTML or if your
changes CSS file as soon as you save the
file we are going to automatically
reload the page for you we've you know
with the new CSS or didn't if you you
just change it and this is really nice
because we get you get rid of that side
card like we change the file and then
you go to the browser and the new
refresh it and then you change again you
can just see the changes being
propagated as you go and then other
things like prettier pages so if there's
an exception we are going to help you
find out what is wrong and come up and
solve that quickly this one is very
important the first-class concurrent
tasks tools because you know today I
mean it's a thousand six thing everyone
has machines with a couple cars but we
are almost all of us running test Suites
using only one of our cars right that's
not acceptable anymore right for
compiling our code running tests running
our code everything should be using all
the machines resources efficiently as
possible
and that's what you get with Alex series
so we have first-class tests but not
only you know first-class tests but
concurrent tasks we make it easy for you
to run tasks concurrently regardless if
they're talking to the database or not
and we have a package manager called
heck p.m. and it's a community that's
really really growing is a package
manager that started with Alex here and
today it's being adopted by the airline
community too and so on and you know
we're starting to get more and more
packages we already passed the I think
two or three million downloads mark so
it's growing really quickly
so cool this is about short-term
relativity right and it's about you know
do we have resources harder to get
started do we have a good workflow the
basic building blocks that you need to
build applications are they there and we
think they are there right so you can
get started and you start building
whatever you need to or if it's for fun
or it's for our business but as I said
even more importantly the short term
productivity it's the long term
productivity and this part of the talk
it has really two aspects to it about
long term productivity I like to talk
about two things one is the applications
which is what we want to cover and the
other one which I unfortunately won't
have time to go over it is exactly
functional programming and since I'm not
going to go over it I just want to do a
very quick explanation what I mean by
that which is to me I mean functional
programming when you go to different
communities so Alex there is a
functional programming language and when
you go to different communities
different community are going to have
different definitions of what it means
to be a functional programming language
and to me it boils down to you know
functional programming it wants you to
make the complex parts of your system
explicit that's what functional
programming to me is about right a lot
of the decisions that you see happening
functional programming which is like
when you get a haskÃ³ and you split the
side effects and you make them explicit
right why'd they do that because the
side effects the source of complexity so
we want to be explicit about them when
we're talking about immutability where
you cannot mutate the restructures you
need to transform them they are
immutable again if if if your data is
mutable right we are compacting two
things you are complexing they state
with time because the states don't
change with time behind your back right
and then function of program looks at
that and say whoa that's that's complex
that's going to be hard to reason about
so they say okay we're not going to have
things mutable by default we want to
make those things explicit and as you
get more acquainted with Alex and
Phoenix I hope we start to see that you
think about that how it's making you the
complex parts of your system they are
all becoming more explicit which means
that when you look at your code and you
need to reason about it the complex
parts they're going to pop out
immediately and you can focus on
okay so that's one of the circuits I
think for the long term productivity in
Phoenix but the other one is exactly
applications okay and that's the last
part of the talk that I want to explore
so let's get it started in order to do
that we're going to come back to our
famous the inside view right so what is
happening in our server so we have again
the client here on the left side and
when as we said when the client connects
to the server we create a small process
right a small tiny process and then as
we have different clients collecting we
start to have a bunch of those processes
and they're all isolated they are all
running at the same time and what we can
think here is that you know as we have
like multiple processes handing
different connections we have something
like you know a TCP acceptor the thing
that's actually waiting for their
connections to start and it's the entity
that is going to create a process for
every new request we actually get so
that's interesting right so now we have
some processes and then we have like
this process this process here the tcp
acceptor that's kind of managing all of
those connections so those are some
processes that are running our system
right when you're running in Phoenix in
production that's something that's
happening in part of your system but
somewhere else in your system we have as
I talked about before we have like the
pub/sub process which is the process
responsible you know if I send something
on one machine it's going to be
broadcast to all other machines so they
can all send information to the client
and that's the process as well right
it's it's concurrent it's isolated and
so on and when we start writing software
this way right like we have a bunch of
entities that are all running at the
same time we start to wonder wait what's
going to happen if something wrong know
goes wrong with the pub/sub process
right because they're isolated so if
this pub/sub pub/sub process crashes
everything is going to continue running
but on the other hand we don't want our
system to to run like missing half of
its processes right if the pub/sub
system crashes right if the pub/sub
process crashes we want to do something
about it you want to just leave it there
right in that state so what we do is
that we have something called a
supervisor and the whole idea of the
supervisor is that it's supervising
those other processes to see when
something wrong happens and then if they
crash
the supervisor is just going to notice
that for example the pub/sub process
crash it and start a new one it's going
to restart it okay so why is this idea
so important right and in order to
answer that we can we can think about an
almost daily occurrence which is we are
using our computers right and then for
some reason things are not working as
expected
first thing is it just doesn't work what
do we do we'll start the machine right
like oh my god please not working I want
to restarted and then restart the
Machine and then everything is working
just fine right the issue mysteriously
disappeared and why is that it's because
we'll restart right when we restart our
computer it goes back to its initial
state the initial state that we tested
right that's guaranteed to work is the
initially say that manufacturers whoever
built our computer tested a lot because
that cannot fail and that's the same
with with the code here that's the same
idea we are applying to our code so if I
have a process like the pub/sub process
running some particular code and
something goes wrong instead of trying
to handle that I say ok it's it's ok to
let that process die but I'm going to do
that I'm going to start a new one that's
going to go back to that initial State
that's this state we we have tested a
lot right that the initial state our
system started so we define the
supervisors and then we can thing that
disappears the supervisor as well so we
have like a supervisor that sometimes
have supervisors and what we are
building here is what we call a
supervision tree and that's where we
build this tree of processes we're
supervising them we put them into
applications ok so what is an
application at the end of the day so the
applications they tell us how to package
and run your code ok so when you go to
Alex you create a new project and then
everything belongs to an application
right and the applications packaging and
knows exactly how to run the code and
applications that can be started and
stopped as a unit so applications they
have both the startlogic why don't need
to do when you start running that
application why do you need to do when
you want to stop it
and it's important to say at this point
that when you when you have an
electrical system running production you
don't have one application running side
by side you have like
five ten twenty applications they're all
running side by side you can think about
them as components if it makes it easier
right you have a bunch of components
that are running in your system
and another nice thing about
applications that they provide unified
configuration and this is excellent
because it doesn't matter which project
you're using which project you are
working on the way you configure that
project and you start up and running
it's the same right we have a unified
configuration across all elixir
applications and again the applications
they hold the processes and the state in
the supervision tree right so in other
tricks so if we row back here because
this is our application right we have
all of those processes all the process
that are running in my system they
belong to this application they belong
to this tree which means the application
can access those processes and because
of the code and state belongs to process
we can introspect them I could go on and
talk and talk and talk about this but I
think is going to be more productive if
I do a very quick demo of what it means
to design our software like these using
applications and supervision trees okay
so let me just set this up all right so
here I have a Phoenix application I just
created before this talk and what I'm
going to do here is that I'm going to
start ix which is interactive Alex here
and run the application at the same time
okay so now I have my Phoenix
application running so I can do you know
here and I have the terminal running as
well so I can run an elixir command I
want but what I want to do here is that
I want to start a tool called observer
that ships as part of Erlang and the
observer two is going to allow us to
know it's good it's going to allow us to
observe our system right so at least
things are very well named right they'll
observe observe the supervisor
supervises it really helps okay so here
is here's observer / running is this
graphical user interface and it brings
all the information we expect from our
system right so which are link or link
version it's using the runtime version
you know how it was compiled how many
CPUs its allocated to the runtime right
now so I have four cars how much memory
it's using and where this memory is
being allocated so this is a great you
know upfront view of what is happening
right in our system but things got get
even more exciting as we see what is
happening here so in this case there is
not the excess in this application so
those low charts are not going to be
interesting at all but if you had
traffic coming here it could come to the
low charts and see how things are
behaving but my one of my favorites the
other panes here we have like memory
locators and so on but one of my
favorite one is the process okay and in
order to explain why I like this panel
so much we need to go back to the
Phoenix channel case so remember I said
we got two million connections on a
single machine and we had to do some
optimizations to get to that point and
the way we did these optimizations what
is we got the clients to connect to
Phoenix and I think the first version we
got only 30k subscribers right where we
were only able to get 30k connections so
what we did is that we open up observer
in the server and then we came here and
we ordered by message queue and then we
could see of all the processes right all
the code running my system which process
was the one that was behind because the
prosody
the all the information exchange in our
system you exchange by sending messages
so if something is going slowest because
one process is behind it was not able to
catch up to its messages in time so I
came here we ordered then we could see
uh-huh I know which process being slow I
could double click the process it would
open up this other pane right and then I
could see information about the process
and why it's not working why it's as low
so so that's great right and that's and
we did this like three times and then
we're able to get too many connections
right so we fixed the first bottleneck
and they're like okay now we're able to
get to 300,000 subscribers okay and then
we and then but that's a bottleneck then
we came here we try to see where is the
bottleneck and then we're just did these
three times and were able to get to 2
million subscribers great right for
example if you have a memory leak you
can come to this panel right to say wait
which process taking a lot of memory you
order by memory and try to reason about
your system okay so that's one nice way
to have a view of all
cold running our system and gives a lot
of introspection what is happening
production but the most exciting pain of
all is the application pain right
because this one is going to show all
the applications running our system so
here for example you can see that Alex
here is an application itself and you
can see that we have the airline colonel
and the airline standard library so you
can see all those applications running
here right and all listed here on the
left side and you can see that all the
applications they have supervision 3 so
this is the supervision 3 coming from
airline you can see the supervision 3
coming from Alexia right and we can see
the supervision 3 for our application
the application we just started and what
is exciting about this tree is that we
can see exactly how our code is
structured for a Phoenix application so
what we have here as I said before is
that we have a supervisor and we have
the endpoint which is the Finke
responsible for handling web requests
and here you can see the pub/sub system
and so on but we also have here
something that we call the repository
because most of our applications they
need to talk to the database and what we
use this after the database in a phoenix
application is something called the
repository and we can see that there is
a process here this elixir demo repo
that's exactly the process response want
to talk to the database and so let's
let's study here right so we choose this
repository here and the way the
repository works every time or just
after the database what do we do we we
create a bunch of collections of the
deep database to create a pool of
connections and when you need to do a
query you go to the to the repository
and say hey I want to do a query and
when you do that the repository is going
to give you a connection back and then
you can do the query so here we have the
repository here we have the pool and
here we have all the collections of the
database and now that we have all those
things here we can answer that question
right which is what is going to happen
if something goes wrong with the system
imagine that you are talking to the
database and this process here - 6 - it
goes wrong it breaks right we can reason
about this because we can simulate
failures I can come here and say I want
to kill this process so you send it a
queue message and what we expect to
happen because we have a supervisory
expect the supervisor to notice that
that connection crashed and start a new
one on its play
and that's exactly what happened we can
see here that the two six shoe is gone
and it created a new process here that
we can see at the bottom we have a new
PID we've a new identifier right now at
the end and we can do other things right
like for example what if the whole pool
has a bug right so it's going to happen
is that we can kill the poo and it
should bring that whole part of the tree
down okay now we can see that we all got
new pids right there are all new
connections cool so so I hope these give
an idea what our applications right and
in order to sum up applications they
give us a lot of introspection and
monitoring into our system and not only
that it gives us all the visibility of
the application State right we can go to
the tree we can double click processes
and we can know exactly what they're
doing
what are they stick what is they state
they have and so on and not only that
it's easier to break into components
imagine that and this is something we
explore in the book imagine that you are
working on application and that
application keeps on growing because
they're adding code you're adding
features at some point say you know this
is too much we need to break it apart so
what you can do is that you can go to
that application tree and you can select
a sub tree or a branch of that tree
right and just move it to another
application right with its own start and
stop logic so it's very easy for to
reason about your software and break it
apart later on and it gives us also the
reasoning when things go wrong ok so
that's what I want to talk about long
term relativity and I think one of the
secrets for that it has been on the
early inverter machine for decades at
this point right and we are just
leveraging that which is the whole idea
of applications how we can understand
your system we can understand our
software right we can understand how
things are run into production and in
order to sum up this is the talk about
the phoenix web framework if we're
excited about it you want to try it out
how to phoenix framework argh and you be
ready to build your api is back hands
html5 applications web real time
channels and whatever you want to and if
you want to get a more structured look
into Phoenix check out the programming
phoenix book my programmatic programmers
and if you are interested more not only
in the framework but are interesting in
the
and the wrong time you can head out to a
lecture - Lena org we have a fantastic
getting started guide that's going to
guide you for everything you need to
know in terms of language and we also
have advanced guides about building the
systems and the kind of applications we
just talked about the supervision trees
and so on and we also have a bunch of
books on programming Alex here you can
pick the one that goes the the banner
the best with our style and that's it
finally I want to thank my company
plataforma tack for investing in an
exterior in the whole community for four
years at this point and that's my
talking Phoenix that I hope you have
enjoyed it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
