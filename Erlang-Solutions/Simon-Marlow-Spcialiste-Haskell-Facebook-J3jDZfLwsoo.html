your talk so you succeeded in getting
Haskell into facebook what an
achievement like this is a big
achievement i guess for the high school
community how you feel about this all
the experience of getting into something
like facebook with a technology like
very new kind of technology for this
kind of companies like Facebook yes
obviously it's great i'm really excited
we don't have the project in production
at the moment
in production within the next few months
we already have several programmers
working on the project was in high
school full time
everybody's really excited about the
project we have lots of people who want
to join our project that we got now
bring forward to joining I can
unfortunately so there's a lot of
excitement around there
and everything seems to be going really
well
we'll have he's working within a few
months and then we'll have some more
experience yeah why has goal is it about
data structures about my computation
parallelism with what what got facebook
interested in high school at all also we
wanted a purely functional language and
we wanted strong typhoon strong typing
is really important in a particular
scenario because we're inviting cody
gets pushed into production very
prettily so it has to be we have to be
able to catch errors as soon as possible
before it gets pushed into action to
stop typing and really important we
wanted to have a language that we could
build a nice dsl and to solve that
particular problem and has really good
insights
so strong static typing at Facebook
that's nice we have typing in PHP not
happy here Wow oh thank you very much
time I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
