handicapped at all this this desk is a
little bit high Oh in Sweden everything
is how I told on me so that might be in
trouble but anyway my name is Kendrick
stocky and I'm glad very glad to be here
in Stockholm for the first time in my
life I'm originally from Tokyo Japan and
this is my first time at their own user
conference and I like everything in this
conference the atmosphere and the people
and everything okay and actually this is
my ace time to be on the olfactory
series of conferences conferences um I
actually made three presentations on
random numbers at three conference is
sponsored by our installations in
2011-2013 and 15 and this is the first
presentation I hope this would be the
last one because I don't want I don't
want to repeat the same thing many times
but on the topic of the random number
module hand ring you in our OTP so while
I want you to leave the random module
because the mojo is already deprecated
in OTP 19-point Oh when you try to
compile and the module you will see the
error message or better say warning
message and it will be removed from ODP
20 Oh it'll be 20 well say hum they
ought to be 20 will be coming kent said
jun 12 jun 2017 as i remember so i
should say our time is running out and
so that yours start your migration l if
you're planning so let me talk about it
all the history of the random module
code it was originally no its originally
called aes 183 it's derived from the
paper which includes the whole algorithm
it is published in nineteen nineteen
eighty-two and originally designed for
16-bit computers
series 34 years ago and has a relatively
short period of approximately 2 to the
power of 43 it sounds big but on 20 2014
I've shown a proof of concept called in
reading and see I was a single core of
intel core i5 single core not a romantic
multi-core and I succeeded to get
through the cycle on it turn into the
beginning point for less than nine hours
listen nine hours in the modern small
computer so the I have to say that asy
83 is fully exploited this is absolutely
not the safe random number to use but
for the m4 many things this is I have to
say this is our cake and this is a code
in Fortran wife around because the
original code was in Fortran and I'm
surprised to know that it's still on the
Microsoft saw site of explaining Excel
2003's implementation I don't know
whether XL 2xl right now maybe probably
2016 an office suite has this but the
issue is that the code is there is not
much different from the Ln current cold
and if you see the variables of I xio
aiz these are less than 32,000 or 15
bits so the volume space it takes is
very narrow or small and you can find a
similar cold in the random module so let
me summarize the rather module issues it
has three issues the period of algorithm
is simply too short and you need to
express it explicitly give the initial
state or seed to the function I will
repeat the issue in later later
earth wise and otherwise it will always
start from the same default seed value
and this is a this is a big problem when
you try to such a different seed into
different processes and you can't do
that as a default and that's a kind of
big design for and this is really bad
because it gives you predictability also
many people still see the function with
a deprecated earn now function or an l /
0 function and this is also very bad
practice because the seeding value can
be easily guessed from the current time
and Alan actually has a history of
issuing gve common vulnerability in 2011
to accidentally use random modules
function in SSH this was a big favor but
now it's fixed so it's good ok before
getting into the details of the leaving
the lander module there are many
purposes possible purposes of random
number and you need to think about the
purpose of the randomness which you want
some people want it's for security for
generating keys or passwords and for
some people do want it for simulation of
covering the random space with probably
with some Monte Carlo method and if
you're cold need to run either before or
after round module a lot I think lots of
people no not people sorry but lots of
cold have this requirement which should
be run before or after OTP 18 you need
to think about the conditional
implementation or they are selective
implementation within the module ok so
let's get down to the business
well I'm going to read the every title
just for two shoulders to summarize what
i would like to say okay number one chip
to compile time error message of
deprecated functions first of all you
owe you can first of all you can find
out the usage of now deprecated
functions not only but not only random
will part of causing it in include
around the module by compiling the code
and then this on the sly does monster
call OTP internal obsolete which lists
all the obsoleted code duplicated or
removed or whatever so by this code the
compiler exactly show that if you are
using a random module it's lubricated
use ran motor instead so listen to the
compiler listen to the advice first okay
number two if you are going to generate
the passwords use crypto module for
secure secure random number generation
if you need a randomly generated strong
password or key you script module
actually which is a rapper the openssl
ran on the school bites function and I
know there's a lot of people concerned
about openssl bonneville till recently
and open SSL indeed has lots of problems
but it's still better than your code I
can guarantee and so if you don't
believe in all openssl you can you can
choose another option but in most cases
often ssl gives you enough security on
generating random numbers and here i use
a function called crypto strong r and
bites and remember other round bites
function in olin deprecated okay number
three use dev you random for security if
you don't trust openssl you
indirect effects random values from the
operating system interfaces and this is
this is a very trivial way but not so
many people are doing this and a popular
one instead of you random and why I put
the you here is because there are a lot
of arguments within the Linux community
that you you should ever on them or
instead of you random but I I personally
think that their view random is enough
for most users and for the other
operating system like freebsd or OSX i
mean a mac OS those two are the two
implementation on dev random and the
view random exactly the same device so
use their view random if you have if you
don't have any specific other reasons
but the problem you know you had doesn't
want to issue that Debu random is not to
regular device so it's not a file so it
cannot you cannot open a debut random by
file open function on line so you have
to have an all unfold program to fetch
the data the command here um it's always
command no it's it's a very tiny quick
rehab code and this show this shows how
to get the information from their random
but um um generally speaking you need to
have an error recovery called and that's
I'm gonna describe that here but well
described that that is well described in
now footnote a URL of this slide this
slide is already open so you can you can
check it later okay number for use
entropy supplying system calls for
security in some extreme cases like
under the denial of service attacks
where external intruders are trying to
consume every file descriptor so that
you cannot access to the dev for you
random
is a very extreme case even I don't want
to imagine but for even those even in
those cases some people want to access
to the young random number generator I
mean secure on them number generators so
for those people entropy supply system
codes are often better than using devil
you random because they do not block
there enough files they do not block and
can directly access the entropy pools of
of the operating systems and only nukes
answer is they have get random and get
an anthro PC functions but on the other
hand freebsd implements this as a system
sysctl margin management information
base and can be called as an operating
system command shown in this slide of
course you can use this direct call and
see the CTL function but this is the
this is more easy way to show you so I
use the CTL command instead okay number
five use hardware random number
generator for security for maintaining a
high quality secure and enough heat from
the operating system you need to supply
enough around the bits or entropy to the
operating system recently a black hat in
a broadhead presentation in the USA on
2015 2015 there was a research about how
many entropy bits you can get an
operating system and the amount is
surprisingly small less than 100 feet
per second and this is very small
concerning the enormous use of
randomness in the recent TT pls or ssl
those secure particles so i should
conclude that obtaining out enough
entropy is not adequately done just
right just by running a computer
especially a server and even it is even
worse than the virtualization
environment because you
have to share the intro entropy of the
vert on the host host computer the host
operating system to the each of the
virtual operating systems so adding an
external random it non ambit generator
from physical sources will f ftv solve
the problem and this is a kind of
advertisement not i'm not selling this
but this is what i made let me introduce
this is called a via hardware random
number generator it's avi HW r ng and i
build it over as an arduino uno art
revision3 seal device for generating
physical damage and physical numbers
physical random numbers and i've been
testing this since 2008 and finally i
fixed the design on june and i actually
built on dice device and show it showed
it to at the maker faire tokyo 2016 on
august and i was surprised that quite a
lot of people were interested in you
know what the land of number is and this
was a very present surprise for me but
anyway connecting this i actually
connect connected this device to freebsd
servers for more than one month or more
or two months and consecutive
consecutively and it gives very good
results for weeks and it gives about 80
kbps and for the safety for every
physical random number generator you
have to use the hash function like
sha256 or 5 and 12 or char two or
shastri functions so that you can make
it more secure in the cryptographic
sense but even even doing that the the
result of the results speed will be
exceeding a 10 kilo BPS which is far
better than the that the entro feed
generative solely by the operating
system or host computer so um the source
code and schematics and all the
technical details of this device
are on get up and then if you if you are
interested you can ask me later after
this presentation so I'm going is a big
slide about this number six seating ran
mojo is different from seating random
mojo I was asked this on the Twitter and
one of the one of the twitter user asked
me that I couldn't see the brand most
you please help me so I realized that I
have to compile some information about
this because the semantics of seeding
between the brand module and random
module is a bit different sometimes the
difference is so subtle it's it's it's a
hard to understand so I will explain it
in details here ok six point though
sitting in / process and function IPS um
Duran and one of the modules have two
different sets of AP is the first one
uses / process seating which stores the
seed in the process dictionary the other
one is the functional API giving the
seed in the function argument and in
many use cases people just use the
process dictionary and that does not
affect the quality of randomness so long
as you are you are understanding that
you are depending on the process
dictionary ok 6.1 random mojo means
explicit and different seating for each
process random module seat / 0 function
has a flaw that it always returns the
same value and that is not good if you
are trying to sitting for many processes
at the same time so in random module you
have to do the express the seating for
each process this is required in which
time rated functions or even
cryptographic functions and in old days
you used ran Earl and now but the modern
after eight point oh you use these three
functions these are new functions
actually only available from eight point
eighty point oh but these new functions
are far better than are now so
if you are doing something like that you
should use them okay 6.1 continuing um /
process API functions in random module
is automatically receded on the first
call yes in ram module you do not need
to call the seeding function explicitly
if you use a plaster dictionary the
initial seeding will be done
automatically at the first goal with the
time related functions available since
OTP 18.0 you can read the souls and you
and it does the same thing like like in
this slide although the module name is
not random it's friend and so may in
many cases you can simply remove the
seeding function for the ram module you
don't have to write it explicitly if you
are if you decide to depend on the
process dictionary and 6.2 sitting in
random sees 3 / 3 no longer works in
rancid the function details are
different so you need to be aware of
this ceiling function argument
difference between random random and run
modules the seeds flash free function no
longer exists so when you use when you
try to use ran seed 100 200 300 with
three arguments three integer argument
this will fail and you be you be
surprised this we fail but the correct
way to see this is to use the rancid
with exs + exs + is the name of the
default algorithm and you have to
specify this for each ran seed function
and the next one 101 2300 is this
actually three-member topple this this
way you will be getting the the seeding
in proper way so if you if you have any
questions please refer to the OTP manual
for the details this is well described
in the manual section of the ran mojo
okay 6.3 dinala streams of CDs stored as
topples on ram modules on ran module 2
seed was a three-member tuple and the
lots of code assumes this using random
we're on the module and this is will
know with this will no longer work on
ran module the seas are dependent on the
algorithm and have two different formats
internal and external and the internal
format has actual algorithm handler and
seed value and the external one has the
algorithm name at name which is
represented by adam and seed so let me
show you them six point three point one
internal CD format when you execute
execute the function like this in the
slice you first get the two-member
topple and the first member is actually
a map map new structure from the
17-point oh i guess and the map contains
pointers pointers better say the handler
to the functions and there's a another
value of oh max which is which is I I I
think I believe that it's added by
Duncan Munson for calculating the normal
distribution function and on the type
means that the name of the algorithm and
this is a very important part of seed
because it without this you can't do
anything online module and the second
member with two member of incomplete
list this is at the actual seed are the
long integers so this is the how this is
the internal representation of the seed
of the ram module and for other types of
algorithms seed pot will be changed into
for example a exs thousand 24 it will be
a 16 a long integers so you cannot
assume no longer assumes three-member
couple for seed of a random random
or ran module anymore so six point three
point to use the external former to
transfer the state inside the process
dictionary the ran module have functions
to export and import seeds with the
external form at the ex fold underscore
seat on the score s flash one returns
the given seed in an external format and
which can be ported by the EDA sheet
underscore s / one or c1 and the seed in
the process dictionary can be obtained
with export underscore CH 0 function as
well so if you want want to transfer the
state or save the state into a file or
string or whatever using these functions
will ensure that boss the algorithm and
C are actually transferred so use these
functions and one thing you have to
remember that if the cds not initialize
these functions will return you
undefined and if that is undefined when
you transfer when you try to initializes
in your not initialize the seat by the
the value undefined the system will stop
with the eller so you have to be aware
of that okay so let's go to number seven
the default use the default algorithm
exs plus if you don't have other knees
if you have no specific reason to choose
their algorithm in the random module use
the default exs plus because it is
specifically designed for 64-bit beam
olin virtual machine I will explain it
later but on the designer of the Aurora
surfed algorithm of whose name is
Sebastian avenia Sebastian Sebastian oh
actually I'm accepted the challenge of
Dan Goodwin ssin requested him to build
a hundred sixteen bit random number
which is a kind of kind of a kind of a
extraordinary but Sebastiano Sebastiano
kindly calculated that and generated
that the optimized model for the request
of our own he he i think he was very
kind his route he's a true mathematician
on that sense and anyway this is
specifically designed for long and we
benchmarked it and the speed game of
moving moving from X roars ifft 128 to
116 is significant so and then if you
have no reasons to explicit reason to
use other algorithm use this algorithm
for speed and pure alumnus these two can
co-exist together okay let me explain
other algorithms there's another are
installed at exs thousand 24 which has
thousand 24 bits of internal state and
there's another algorithm called exx 64
okay so let's get to the next next topic
number eight try exs thousand 24-hour
rhythm around module for simulation if
you don't want to use any any kind of
external module but if you think exs
plus is not enough for your simulation
purpose exs thousand 24 will be there
for high-precision stimulation purpose
which requires a longer period exs
thousand 24 will give you a better
result the period is much much longer
than the excess the XS plus which is 2
to the power of a thousand 24 and the
execution time is only a bit more longer
than twice as a exs plus this is
benchmarked so if you if you are not so
so constrained about execution speed you
can use this algorithm for simulation
okay so the next one the next one number
nine use rand normal / 04 normal
distribution arm
we are talking about from the beginning
from on presentation to right now is not
about the normality of the presentation
but its actual that it's actually other
it is called uniform distribution
uniform means that every value from 0 to
the maximum the appearing probability is
equal it's called uniform distribution
but for the statistic it's not normal
normal is something like this and the
normal means that it represents more
more how should I say i'm not i'm not
good at statistics on two territories
but they say that it represents more
normally about the natural phenomena
ex-l phenomena such as them such as the
i should i say okay this distribution is
there is a theorem called central limit
sovereign that if you sum up a lots of
random numbers the result of some will
be converging into this bell curve
distribution this is i think this is the
most concise explanation of central
Central central image Solon please refer
to Wikipedia Wikipedia might be
experienced explaining much better than
I do around this topic but then the
reason why this function is added to run
module is that this which is very useful
for the third communication purpose on
determining errors and other specific
issues on the failures or maybe you can
use it on these weather on the binary
binomial distribution or something like
that so okay i'm not i'm going to the
details of this but the good thing is
that you don't have to calculate by
yourself about this distribution okay
right number 10 use SF mt for hardcore
long time simulation hardcore means if
you're running simulation for more than
one year or even or even though more
than one year's a massive number of
cores and if you are really into running
a simulation with a huge number of
samples for a long time the algorithm
called seemed oriented fast Mersenne
twister or SF mt is there and is will be
a good generator for you it is invented
by to jab to japanese professor makoto
matsumoto and professor with suicidal
and they built period of the sooner
random number generator which has a the
period of extremely long period 2 to the
power of 19,000 937 you won't be able to
count that on the issue is that this
means that the internal state of this
random number random number generated
very large and you can write it in the
pure actually i did it i submitted I i
submitted and accepted on the paper was
accepted on their HTM 2011 one alone
workshop but it's quite it's quite slow
so I also made a nice nice version of
this random number generator and it's um
I think it's already commonly used for
example by proper proper is costed
second all costs a second a stool and I
actually recently got the request from
the electric community people that they
want to use your SF empty for the random
number generators and they want one
inmates made make some changes of the
subtle details so I accepted the request
and it's very good that this stuff is
actually being used so if you are if you
really want something
various something with a very long
period which will never ever calculate
probably in the in there and probably
until the end of the world this will
this will be a good one and one thing
good is that this algorithm is also
available in hex already so if you're
using a lecturer you just get the SF
empty package okay so let me explain one
thing about the how to use the random
number generator in the concurrent or
power involvement you got to check so
number 11 check also guarantee of the
random number I forgot to work number
but random number generators for
concurrent or parallel operations if you
use concurrent regenerated random
numbers in the same tasks each process
might generate must generate orthogonal
sequences or independent sequences in
other words if the sequences may overlap
if the sequences may overlap if you just
randomly choose the seed may that did it
would not reject the possibility of the
overlapping and that might cause the
problem although the young in most cases
two periods very long so the possibility
is very low but it's not zero okay
before explaining this I should show you
this diagram um if you are if you're not
considering about overlapping on the gen
use the young randomly generated seed
for random number generator the
overlapping chickens which might be 0
right here we're here to process will
use the same partly same number of
sequence and this would be this will be
a disaster if you are trying to generate
a real random matrices so so when
the each member each each element of the
matrices must be independently generated
so okay and again I'm going to explain
it here first and the whole fortunately
there's an algorithm called jump
function jump function is an equivalent
function of calculator on the process of
jyj iterating the seed for very large
number um for example to the jump
function for exs plus is iterating to
250 2 to the power of 58 sequence at one
time and for exs thousand 24 2 to the
power of 412 oh and of course it doesn't
take that much time on the the
complexity is proportional to the length
of the lengths of the number of the 2 to
the power so the it's fun maybe it's a
little bit slower than 58 times of
execution or 512 x education but it's
much much faster and it's a absolutely
feasible and by using the jump functions
here there would be no overlapping
between processes and some in some use
cases this characteristic is a must this
is requirement so let me get back to the
station so when you use okay so let me
get back to number 11 okay I explained
know the importance of non overlapping
sequences and for the jump functions and
Sebastian avenia provided jump functions
and that is very good for exorcists
exhaustive stars and plus and jump
functions is also provided on the SF mt
and tiny mt but then i haven't
implemented them but there are verbal
and see cold already and
or tiny mt there's a dis variant of sfm
t equals tiny mt which has a much
shorter period of two to the 128 it's
still long but much older than SF mt and
it has the characteristic polynomial on
and you can choose as many as 2 to the 2
to the power of 58 polynomials but the
problem is that calculating each
polynomial takes one seventh of a second
on the modern computer I'm in a modern
gianna intel core computer so if you
want to you make use of this you have to
pre calculate so I pre-calculated this
while I was in the University Kyoto
University and I I was I was I had a
freedom above computing it using the
computing resources i calculated 200
million parameter sets of the tiny mt
and it's a relevant github and the
entire repository is a modern 82
gigabyte so you I suggest you not to
fork but but in but it's available it's
available that I I made it a level it's
your turn to use it so the tiresome it's
all the tiny MT is also on the air own
version also on hex package and it's the
good thing about it it it is it's in
pure almond okay alright so I explained
this so he says is i have only five
minutes left so i'm going to fat i'm
gonna make it fast number 12 use non
random external modules for OTP in 17 x
or before this means that even though
OTP 17 or before all these random
numbers are prisons explained in this
presentation are already available I've
already put them on the github so as an
external independent module without
depending on the maps it uses record is
redirected solely and so on you can you
can use them for the old programs and
the priests get rid of the random random
module as soon as possible
okay um there's 11 other things to
explain if you if you do have to make
your application compatible with false
random and run modules you can use a
rapper turns the ayahs he's very active
contributor of our own committee he has
built a rapper module called r on r and
compact which is used on trick a
property tester and and the old rebar
and his his mojo is very good i
recommend it but on on the river three
command you can you can still see a
better implementation so if you can if
you if you want to use it keeps a
compatibility with the many things refer
to a river three called or use the two
inserts module and there's another
interesting story on Robby hammock you
engineer the name is John Sebastian
patrol he made it he he had a lot of
time experimenting and to realize the
compatibility between random and one
module and he ended up to build their
own and I don't know whether this is the
right way but this is this is inevitable
regarding the wide use of RabbitMQ so I
supported and fortunately island and on
now and you can use the dynamic loading
auditor or the type of post or other
types of the techniques are the
supporting the many different
implementation on the same function but
um okay but one thing I have to tell you
that if you implement your own modules
for compatibility with Aldo TP versions
you have to do it very carefree alright
and if you do need to write your own
code an algorithm please do do check the
stochastic and statistics statistic
consistency and quality there are many
tools I'm not going the time is running
out so I'm not going to explain in a
details and but the onions on slides i
put a length and they are very good
algorithms and the day without passing
them you your result might be a big file
okay so i'm going to show you the
failure example as last one on on 2011
at the Olin SF bay I showed PHP 5 case
on Windows there was a big fella and I
this time I show you a v8 JavaScript
ends in fowler which was which has been
widely used in chrome or everything on
which was found and fixed on december
2015 what they were using was actually a
very short period of random number
generator which is insufficient for
their use and the day actually they
didn't pass the test user one you tested
01 means out on one of the test cases
and the plate is fried so this is the
quite visible extra and visible example
up failure you see lines horizonal lines
this is a big failure right that's all I
want to explain here and this is a new
one on the v8 out with v8 JavaScript
this is actually the result of XOR 628
plus yeah there they yes it's good for
them to use a new algorithm and that is
very of good news but even better news
is that urn people are chose the eggs or
sift algorithm seven months before the
behaved team did so I'm not saying we
want but we did a very good thing okay
so let me summarize this presentation
the time is selling out down I strongly
suggest you to use random module now
there are already many ways of migration
from random to run module and if you
security-conscious use crystal or w run
them with a preferably with a hardware
random number generator if you don't use
OTP 18 or later please stop using random
module anyway because there are lots of
all two other alternatives and for the
general warning please view test your
code before racing it especially if you
try to jail try to invent your own
random number generator that will that
might be that might cause a big failure
okay so last but not least i like to say
damn good moonstone for his contribution
to Ranma to overall development as a
rigorous island called optimizer he
proposed a lot lots of optimization
which I didn't come into my mind and
Sebastian vinya a very candid
mathematician for country testing and
providing gas or 616 algorithm for Alan
beam which actually was requested by dan
I think dan I think Don was very brave
person on this and all the solutions
were giving many chances of talking over
this topic without those people to
remedy would have never come into being
and I really thank OTP team to finally
accept this idea after the five years of
after five years of my first proposal in
2011 so thanks any questions hello thank
you for the presentation it's more
remark rly if you need access to secure
cryptographic random numbers and yes /
has made in akal which is also really
good it uses anapol sodium yeah it uses
lip sodium so it has access to both the
system call and as a fallback w random
okay day um it's not actually a question
it's a suggestion that there's a multi
culti napco and with sodium yeah they
are very good and they're very good
they're very good amp maybe it's a
rapper right okay it's a rapper okay
good thanks thanks for your information
any other questions thank you for a nice
talk um I was at last number seven I was
wondering you have 64 and then 1024 and
then there's 116 that that's a bit of a
funny number for me could you tell me a
bit more about that number um okay um
you can refer to the Sebastian Venus
site on the latest development hub X
received or he recently invented even
even faster our algorithm on the machine
language of x86 64 Arctic Circle XOXO
roc if i don't know how to read it but
it's a nice new algorithm and he chose
he tested a lot about live on 6420 8024
4096 and some of them have already been
deprecated from him his site although
the the algorithm was there and um but
when i try it when when i was thinking
about implementing a new arisen I was
looking for those stuff and
unfortunately I'm not a mathematician so
i had to i and all i could check is to
is to run the sea cold and build our own
cold and exactly check the air every
sequence is on the same side on the
different seas so the not the choice of
128 or thousand 24 it's not arbitrary
then it's done as i should say it's done
by Aceves jana be near himself is it do
i do I answer your question so why that
number is it why doesn't know why that
number because um um according to the
Sebastian on some solutions website he
wanted to implement those code as fast
as possible running as fast as possible
on the 64-bit computers so it's I it's a
multiple of 64 and and I have no idea
about the whole the the rigorous details
on why those numbers but 112 I think 128
or 160 or two to the power 116 is enough
for modern youth at wistful now maybe
not in 30 years later but at least for
now
an internal 64-bit machine doesn't
actually have 64 bits oh yeah I should
explain that I'm forbidden for the tug
oh yeah a few didn't the the participant
explain explain that the why why it's no
it was not 64 the olin 660 1464 being
the first pope it's on the top four bits
are actually used by users tags and the
rest only six TVs could be represented I
as a short integer and regarding the
algorithm you have to cut another tube
it so why it why it become 58 was the
reason or restriction on the iron beam
okay okay round of applause for 10g
catoctin think it will assume the
session two o'clock in the afternoon
