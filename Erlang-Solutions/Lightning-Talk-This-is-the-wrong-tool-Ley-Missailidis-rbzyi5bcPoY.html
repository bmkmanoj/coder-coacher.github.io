I've been in business for a while and my
accountant wanted to go over some
previous tax forms bla bla bla and he
basically said we have to refile some
things for optimization great but then
I'm sitting there and he says okay
here's a bunch of Excel spreadsheets and
I start groaning and there's some math
in there and it's just oh my god have to
do all this manually and he's like well
my bookkeeper can do it let's solve this
problem so obviously I don't want use
Excel I'm just going to be an elixir guy
and write it in Phoenix and ecto right
so I'm not showing you my books so I
start with Phoenix an ecto and now I
start looking over about five years
worth of returns and given the nature of
consultancy I have different projects at
different things sometimes I have
payroll sometimes I don't sometimes I'm
running a skort project so slowly as I
start trying to work with Fecteau I
start realizing there's no one table
that can well there's no obvious table
that could actually describe what the
hell's going on with my receipts or my
invoices each year is slightly different
and I start groaning again because I'm
back to the Excel spreadsheets and
trying to unify them somehow for sequel
so this kind of goes into and if you've
seen Babylon 5 this is funny to you if
you have it you should go watch it but
ecto is the wrong tool for this job or
at least sequel is so I sit there and
I've worked with other data stores
before and then I just started using
CouchDB now the reason this made the job
easier all of a sudden was because a I
have a normal accounting system where I
keep things in various parts like
there's digital references to everything
so I could just all import these and
just keep everything in its key values
as just JSON documents and receipts are
essentially just documents at the end of
the day you build up a couple views and
all of a sudden your tax years are done
like you can just query against the
textures and whatever peculiarities
happened you can see immediately and
then the business logic got way simpler
from what I was dealing with effect
all of a sudden I one phone call with my
accountant you just do the math very
quickly on a pattern match for
whatever's going on in that set of
documents for that time and it's done
and the side effect is you actually get
to attach the pictures of the receipts
or the PDFs which makes your accounting
really happy because now it's just like
audits are super simple now I've done a
couple things off-book here like for
instance because you know I decided that
there wasn't really a pattern to my
receipts I can't really use the struct
anymore so you rip some things out and
move them around but honestly my entire
counting app which replaces a bookmaker
is probably about 60 lines of mostly
Arkana of Canadian tax system and the
rest of the code is relatively just
gonna fetch me some JSON documents from
couch and that's it as opposed to what I
was dealing with before which again
trying to find patterns and tables and
all that I just didn't want to deal with
and this goes into a thing that's kind
of as I've been thinking about the
Erlang ecosystem which Lisp flavored
Erlang elixir or just a straight out
Erlang is think about what problem
you're solving each tool set comes with
a different set of experiences I do find
a lick sir has a lot of niceties with
maps and structs LFE I'm not as familiar
with so I'm not going to say when it's
very good at but Roberts around find him
and Erlang I have a much easier time in
Erlang with straight TCP connections and
stuff like that so just think about what
you're doing and then pick the right
tool for the job like we have this VM we
can use a lot of different tooling and
just don't try to shoehorn just because
some tool pre-exists or some library is
there just think about the problem and
you're probably your code will get
simpler with very little effort and as
for a company I work with right now is I
well my name it's domain registrar
largely we have Erlang in production we
have the elixir quasi in production
parts of the cider and elixir and we're
going for a full rewrite
so that's it for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
