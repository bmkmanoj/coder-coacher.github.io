about my journey to a flying quadcopter
built from scratch I tend to speak a bit
fast so please if it's the case just
stop me with a big move so I hope you
will enjoy first oh my I'm rich I'm 28
years old
I still need computer science at the
University of foreigners that's in
Belgium and since then I'm mainly active
in a software administration and a
software development it is follow me on
Twitter drop me an email or Facebook me
if you want
I'm a co-founder 15:42 we are three guys
that help teams to build more scalable
and better products using lean and agile
we work on all the aspects of an IT
project from system infrastructure to
the user experience well let's start
with my story so I think everybody has
been overrun by work at some point I
needed to relax and personally I like to
play sports and the north side of me
playing with new gadgets like so I
started to search on the web for the
latest trendy new gadget like SmartWatch
VR assets
IOT on everything else and then I saw
this everywhere on the web that's the
biggest runway took place in Dubai so
favorite things I've drawn my attention
so the first one is at the price for the
first place is $250,000 and then the
winner or what the boy a fifteen year
old so yeah that was enough to convince
me that that would be my game so I
started to check where I could buy this
kind of racing drones oh yes to choice
whether you can bid way to fly without
anything to do or you can buy each part
separately and maybe assembly by
yourself and that's what I did so I
spent some time to select which kind of
motor or frame all the pieces that I
wanted for my first row then I put in
together and configure it yeah that was
my first drone so I didn't know what to
expect and so marco supply was a big
fail and i bring this one after one week
and so after a build and wibbled I found
that very impressive the way they were
flying
super smooth stable and fast and so I'll
get to know more I wanted to know or
quote cooter works and for me the best
way to understand something is to try it
by myself so I started to read some
article about the operation of a
quadcopter and then the idea of creating
my own character from zero strategy to
obsess me yeah that's cool but I really
wanted to build something just for
myself so I saw that there are more and
more people involved in a makers and
do-it-yourself stuff and so I wanted to
build things that attract those group of
people because they do amazing stuff and
as a developer I know the contributing
to a project takes a lot of times and I
wanted to make the project as easy and
fun to contribute and finally I decided
to build my own quadcopter from scratch
and I identified through T values that
needed to be part of the project's
mindset first it should be
understandable so myself see that taking
leverage of new technology in software
development is very important so those
kind of projects are usually we circle
yong-taek so they are not the easiest to
understand and contribute and for me the
like a bit of structure and usually use
low living language like C that's
awesome but difficult to manage for
another effective for the newcomers so I
wanted to break those standards by
shipping a source code that not actually
work but also well organized and use eye
level languages that are more for me for
the most of us the next is that it
should be extendable so after seeing a
lot of amazing things on website like
ping givers I wanted to give people the
desire to contribute and unleash your
creativity so using tool like your 3d
printer is those kind of contribution
and gives the possibility of fast and
cheap protecting and provides a lot of
different materials additionally or we
are not trying to make stuff a smaller
and smaller and destructor impossible to
upgrade so my focus was to also to use
building blocks that are more easy to
connect together and it should be easy
to add or great and finally identity to
use our extensive dedicated cover like a
dedicated flight controller but instead
taking leverage of board like a
Raspberry Pi big
learn that our sheep and more powerful
every year well here is a big picture of
this presentation so I refers dig into
the design choice I made
next I will explain all the component of
the black observer by making analogy to
because when it's pertinent then we talk
about the first flight of the platter
and ofd bugdet and finally we spend some
time to talk about the future of the
project so let's start with the design
choices as compute units I choose a
raspberry pi 3 because they see to fine
is powerful and affordable platform and
there are constantly improving their
design and performances plus it has a
lot of connective logistical
input/output interface I have to see SPI
bus to communicate with immutable
sensors and actuators and finally it
comes with a built-in Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi well obviously I choose elixir but
nerves too so with this reagent like
basically an expose what verify you need
to configure the network then mr. SSH
then connect to your device then check
out your sources of the project and then
maybe Sony or run it if they are
noticing differences so that's a lot of
step that you always have to repeat and
so for me the full distributions are not
well sweetie to a meta system that need
to boot fast and without the boilerplate
so with nerve you can put your
application you're actually working on
from your computer to your record file
within 30 seconds you just need to
create a firmer which is actually an
image of your application and then using
a simple command then burn the firmware
on SD cards then you can search it into
your upper thigh then power up your PI
and we'll build up within 10 seconds
that's very fast to boot and easy to
update the code you just need to focus
on your code on the hood and nuts on the
boilerplate anymore well let's talk
about the building blocks of the
quadcopter so I will show you all the
application is organized along with
explanation of the main concepts that
allowed a quadrotor actually fly
so the idea behind this code is to give
you the ability to understand the basics
of the quarter and so that maybe you can
build your own after well basically as
what Couture is a big loop that repeat
indefinitely until Easter notice so
first it gets information from sensors
then you perform some computations with
sensor values and finally send a signal
based on the computation to actuator
which are the motors in this case so the
graph here is a review of the building
blocks and the order in which they are
actually dictating the code here just a
small subset to have another view of the
brain see private Super Mario 3 so the
brain is the name of the main
application under the umbrella directory
3 ups both of which we'll talk later or
so the brain at the drivers and the API
and basically every component is a
separate process on the Raspberry Pi I
use a gent server for each to a low
leverage of multiple CPU cores well
thanks to the elixir supervisors when a
process crashes it is automatically
restarted without crashing dual
application I also use multiple
supervisors to that group gen servers
into subsets like sensor or actuator
that connect different we start
strategies if there is a code sample so
the sensor that you want to use or
declare into the configuration as well
as the driver that the sensor need to
use on top you have the code snippet
that is used to declare this intro in
the configuration and that's a simple
array that tell which are the sensor and
then by sensor you have the driver
associated then on the bottom the code
snippets of the supervisor that fetches
all the sensor from the configuration
then spawn and supervise them
so now I will explain all the components
why buy one in more details so let's
start with the sensor so the main and
basic goal of this components are to get
the fields of the quadcopter
so by tilde means the angle on every
axis for this we use two sensor that are
the accelerometer and the gyroscope so
each one has advantage and disadvantage
and we'll see which they are so the
first answer is the drug of coke
it measures the angular speed of the
device on three axis so dengraf speed is
the speed in degrees per second at which
the device is moving around an axis for
example if the device is not moving it
without zero and ever axis if you keep
them in the device along an axis equal
output the current speed and out to zero
if you stop and to get the device tilt
from the angular speed we need to
compute some integral of the angular
speed over time on the graph you see
that the value are drifting with time I
don't move the device and all the
angular speed changing fast and that's
that's the main issue with this kind of
sensor next we have the accelerometer
which is a device that measures the
acceleration of the quadcopter and
through axis for example if you read a
device flat on a table it should show an
iteration of around 1g on a single axis
which corresponds to the gravity of the
earth roughly and to get the device tilt
from the acceleration when we use
something limitary with the portion of
acceleration apply to the axis on the
grass you see description of the
sensitivity to vibration so the device
was on a table and I was constantly
eating the table with my m and picks up
to 20 degrees where which even if the
device was laying flat well in practice
a sensor is composed of code from 2
application under the umbrella that
splits on top the business logic from
the bottom which is the interaction with
the hover
so on the brain side the top the code
defines how to interpret the data and
when
to data on the driver side for the
bottom the code defines Oh to get the
data from the hardware
what are the inscription that needs to
be sent to the device for the
initialization or to read the registry
that contain values in the driver we
also have the bus that is true which
medium the instruction are sensitive
devices like I could see your SPI
so I use elysée or early that there's a
very good job to unload those kind of
communications as I said we need to get
the precise tails of the quadcopter so
we have to use a simple formula to get
the best of the two sensor so this
formula is called the complementary
filter it takes a big ratio of the
gyroscope and a small one of the
accelerometers and this allows to
compensate the accelerometer noise and
it also scooped rest on the graph you
see that that our same setup done before
and no jungle are for effective more
stable
the next component is the receiver but
the receiver is the component that will
receive all the commands and by the user
and its transmitter so each button
switch or stick on this transmitter is
called a channel so the receiver
component I will handle all the design
by the hardware it sends immediately all
the same value as fast as you can to the
receiver in a package that we call the
frame the frame is a sequence of bytes
I start with a thing but it's a well
known value and then is followed by
additional value including two byte so
we need me to parse this frame to get
the numeric value of each channel in
practice that's basically the same logic
than the sensor for the speed of the
concern so the single difference here is
that the commit communicates to the
hardware device who you are so I use the
nerve you are slavery to until this kind
of communication the next component is
the interpreter the interpreter takes at
the receiver channel as inputs that are
value between 1,000 and 2,000 and from
the point of view of the quadcopter are
those that use doesn't mean anything so
we need to convert those value to
meaningful one R and that is the role of
the interpreter the products we need to
know a bit more about to flight mode so
the first one is the race mode so for
example we tell the quadcopter concern
at the specific speed the stage from C
degrees per second and then the
quadcopter will continue to turn up the
speed the second one is the angle mode
so we tell the class observer to tilt to
a specific angle let's say 40 degrees
and the quadcopter will turn and then
stick to 40 degrees so the goal of the
interpreter is to convert the channel
values to meaningful value for the
quadcopter for example if the tilt of
the quadcopter is maximum 45 degrees and
we push the transmitter stick to the
right let's say value of 2000 the
interpreter will convert this channel
value to an angle of 45 degrees and
recall the results of this this
conversion
setpoint that's the value that we want
to reach so set points are very
important for the next parts that are
key ID controllers while PID controller
that control the feedback mechanism the
basic idea behind the PID controller is
the following
it takes sensor value and set point of
input then it computes the best output
for the motors until disappointed switch
let's see a theory in action so that's
an example for the quadcopter refills so
a PID continuously compute the error
value as the difference between the
setpoint and the process variable which
is appears in this case then it applies
a correction based on the three
coefficient called proportional integral
and derivative sorry which are tuned to
get the optimal response referred to in
this case let's go with an example so
the flow is the following first you find
a set point to be reached then the PID
controller computes the response with
three coefficients the set points and
the process variable the responses apply
to the quadrotor and then the tilts
should be affected but there are other
external factors like the wind that can
also affect details and finally the
sensors measure the the actual scales
and send back to the PI controller and
start again until the setpoint is rich
then we have the mixer the missile
distributes the right amount of total to
derive motors so the plexidrone is to go
ahead of 10% of stability and left of
25% the mixer needs to figure out our
wish motor asked to change the speed so
the mixer has to deal with the three
main movement of our quad to sort out
the role at the pitch and a yo so the
role our is the move around the y axis
so to play with this kind of move you
have to increase or decrease at the
throttle on the motor on the left or the
right then we have the pitch the pitch
is the move around the x axis so same
idea but for this we have to change the
total of the front motor or the back
motor and the last is the move around
the z axis that's called the yo finally
to play with this kind of smooth you
have to increase/decrease the throttle
on the motor on the same general and
finally the the mixer takes our
the movements and combine them to output
the amount of throttle applied to ich
motor that's the basic idea for the
component of the quadrotor well I made
the software development at the same
time as the printing of the pieces so in
this part I will show you all are the
different steps of building the pieces
of the black observe and try to make it
slide so on the Left we have the
prototyping of the connections on the
right the same box where I stacked the
Raspberry Pi with a place to secure the
IMU which is the inertial movement units
which are the bird with all the sensor
and other sensor is needed and I put the
PDA and generator on the back to the
connection with the motors that's the
final box with all the third the
connection so I printing the boxes in
transparent eh-oh seeing the idiot was
right by I have some space for the HDMI
HDMI product in the power supply what I
was quite new to the 3d printing words
to learn a lot by making a lot of
mistakes on the left you have the main
place which takes around 20 hours of
printing and I still this one around 310
on the right you earlier somebody of the
baseplate to arms so print frequenting
is awesome but can still be very complex
when you to make make precise pieces I
will not going to free printing and
everything is told but if you want to we
can discuss about this later
well at the end the result is pretty
cool most everything fits perfectly
together at the receiver that have
advertising psoralen motors so the time
for the first slide wasallam
well if you wondering why there are some
books it's because I put the cord
between the books and a quadcopter to
avoid fighting my face but obviously
that's a face so at this point I knew
that the most of the work was to come so
I need to know what was going on on the
quadcopter to be able to debug properly
that's using some cereal or HDMI cable
on the same machine it's not the easiest
thing to do
so I need to find other way to get
feedback from the quadcopter and so I
developed the component called black box
and or the application called the ground
station so almost each component is used
as input of another so I thought it was
a good idea to track the final result of
each component separately so I created
this component called black box that
expose the summative and interface to
allow all the quadcopter components to
lock their outputs the communication
between the quadcopter and the ground
station is achieved by a phonics
circuits for a real-time for example
each sensor will send to the black box
the values that are read from the
hardware or the mixer and scales with an
the computed throttle or partition for
all the motors of the black box and all
those data allowed to make easily some
plotting and interpretation of the
ground station here are two simple of
code so one would present the code that
sends the data from a component in this
case a sensor on the other side we have
the black box that first answer the last
events so I made difference between
events and loops and events is like a
sensor we the ple result receiver
channel value and the loop groups all
the events at at our link each other
remember the graph the first graph about
the building blocks and to summarize at
the first point the complement calls the
trace function with this module process
name and data and at the second point
the black box processes even
synchronously before store Nick stirring
in its stirring it into the the loose
before
and then the black books are sends the
left loop to the ground station through
the socket periodically that's the
ground station it consumed the events
pushed by the quadcopter and put them on
multiple graphs so the plantation is an
angular 2 application sorry and on this
dashboard you can see multiple things so
first we have the graph for the rule
that you advocate by the accelerometer
and the gyroscope and on the bottom you
have the output of the controller a
future explained before there are other
graphs and that's shown on this picture
like the loops time which is the
duration of the main loop meaning the
time in milliseconds before to do a
complete loop and the repetition of the
photo on the format or observe I also
needed you to be able to adjust
parameters on the quadrant or based on
the black box feedbacks so to achieve
this expose an API to a phonics app
which is a 3d API app under the umbrella
that allows to change the configuration
for some component of the quadcopter so
it looks like this to re-implement EDP a
tuning for for the API from the API you
can choose all the coefficient for all
the PE controllers starting on the
quadcopter during the development I
frequently move the quadcopter between
my oh man world place and so the IP
address assigned to the quadrotor was
Chris changing frequently so I need to
find a way to avoid swapping the IP
address in the code each time a change
of location so I search on the web to
what can solve this issue and I found
the nerve that's a VP library so SSDP
stand for the simple service destroyed
protocol it does not use neither DHCP or
DNS basically the ask or grantstation
request on the wall network using
multicast or for all the available
services then all the available services
on the network with reply to this
request directly with the IP address the
name and some experimentation is if
needed then thanks to this library I
don't need anymore to bother about which
IP address is assigned to the quadcopter
to communicate with it at this request
when is needed and a thought for example
and the quadrotor side we start an SMTP
server that reason for all the requests
that's the first point and then the
seventh point on the off side we asked
on all the network for services select
those name le copter and MPEG struggie I
P address when I was praying that the
quadcopter I didn't put it in front of
me but as far as I can in the room to
avoid injury so that was a bit boring
because itching us on the bag I need to
bring it back to my desk swab the SD
card with a new firmware so it took me a
lot of time to make small changes during
my test
then I use a the nerve former HTTP
library to Adiemus firmware for the
network without sub in Jessica so
according the mix test that leverage SL
GP and HTTP former updates for its first
searches for the processor then build
the firmware and then push it through
HTTP to the processor and thanks to the
library is automatically updated and
restarted and assess me a lot of time as
you see that a few minutes code and we
are first step to discover a code for
them to build them up flow to the
processor well to see quadcopter can be
very dangerous from me and my teammate
so to avoid an accident about the
trampoline s that i sticked on the ruby
some magnets and thanks to this escapes
a lot of injuries we might this then
after some tuning and update of the code
is subsided
well Floyd flies and that was a kind of
a big victory for me so I still suggest
a bit but we've done before and it's a
good step forward so there is destroy I
only use the proportional gain and carry
controller because the other are more
suited to tune due to the soft we tang
of the along with one machine then
actually I lie a bit so the video that
we proven of the first version of the
quadcopter and since then I put a lot of
effort to improve the design for a
smaller and easier to carry and safer
version of the quadcopter so actually
this version is deprecated in profit of
this one so it's smaller so I can easily
question my bag there are some
prediction on the propellers that are
flexible to hit more crashes I put
sensor on some side and block to
minimize the vibration then if you're
more confident you can easily remove all
the propellers collection to gain some
weight so I'll bring it with me
yeah so I want to see you in the break
just come and see me discussion about
this so let's talk about the next steps
of a project so from is our two big
points firstly to improve what is
actually there so I started to mug
components like to our IPC to make some
tests but des correctly still very low
and I need today to to add some more
tests
then the PID controller used only
proportional gain coefficient so I need
to spend some time to tune the achieve
and integrative correctly but those are
difficult due to the short time of the
of the VM then make do two works on
Wi-Fi with nerve to have a remote shell
on the quad I see a guy that started
yesterday Linton on this and that super
cool
it has to continue that factory and
there are sensor original abroad but
after a news you can use the
magnetometer to all the orientation of
the drone you to Burma tour to all the
attitude then you can find by the way to
leverage some along diem tricks to
reduce the loop time then a driver or
sensor which is ranganatha the second
point is to innovate so that's that's a
good platform to play with so we can
imagine all the club entities of
expansion like the simple work could be
just adding a GPS to using a road map
then implement some video recognition to
follow people there are a lot of
libraries for that and I made some 3d
design to a low stacking multiple
Raspberry Pi and the quadcopter is
needed then you can add some sonar to
avoid obstacle implement Commerce
chairman Peter instead of complementary
filter there are a lot more
possibilities to play with then a
variety to open source this project so
all the part on Thingiverse and decoder
on github so we should reject nerves and
the rubbery around this because it's
going to be amazing and I don't think I
will want the Dubai drone waste yet but
at least understood autocopter work and
that's all for me it would be all wrong
if you want to see the drone and de
meditate to find me if you want more
precision thanks
ice we have a bit of time for questions
if anyone wants to ask one favor lap
step not too early I just worked my way
over as we go hello hi first of all
congratulations for the over for the
work is a pretty impressive if you think
it to explore ways of doing something
like real-time humor and upgrade not yet
not yet because I have to find a way to
continue some information to the motor
when the world verifies rebooting so we
need to add some more other that save
the last comments and and then maybe we
boot it that kind of tricky but the food
is I need you okay thank and I think
there's a couple over here so if you
raise your hand up I'll come find you
have you by any chance also heard about
the crazy fly and write about the crazy
fly it's a drone it's flying
autonomously I'm not sure I don't
understand I guess you there's a company
called bit Chris yeah they have an
autonomous flying drone
using like they put sensors in a room
and then the drone can fly automatically
so maybe it's interesting but you
haven't heard about it enough I know but
you're from France right yeah yeah these
guys as well so I thought maybe like a
few cool oh cool project by the way
Mariko let's talk after thanks as to who
else we had a question
did you have issues with the battery
with the Raspberry Pi doesn't it consume
too much battery for the battery doesn't
the Raspberry Pi averaged a PI consumed
too much battery no other doll actually
there with eyes like this less consumer
bugs we like to have an ID the four
motor can can can consume a I think 100
arms so what we advise like 500 mediums
so that's okay great I will set a
question you don't see how come back
over here next how much did you get on
the raspberry pi Rho is the longest
right what was the longest amount of
running time you got on the Raspberry Pi
in the battery I think they five minutes
I have two questions one for the
determination of orientation of the
quadcopter use the accelerometer
explanations and so how do you
compensate for the acceleration of the
quadcopter because when it's when it's
covering you have just the gravitation
and when you accelerate how do you know
which part of it is your acceleration
and which part is the gravity in fact um
it's always relative acceleration so and
as I said the formula with the component
or a filter is like taking 99% of the
gyroscope and only one of the extra
measure the extra meter is just there to
to avoid the gyroscope to drift so the
measure of the earth the accumulator I
are almost are not taken to account when
my question is the pretty pink pink
the dough is available there
aren't things there aren't killers so
people on the guitar people you would
see a link to the
Thingiverse design okay good
congratulations on the design Thanks
anyone else have our questions as well
hi um my question is so have you ever
tried to fly as far as possible and if
so what the maximum distance and
altitude
you have reached now now because I use
the regulation now in Belgium it's a bit
tricky to kind of stuff and I okay it's
kind of full torrent but if it's not
I've lost all my work so I'll wait a bit
to be sure that when the signal of the
transitory class they will just so I
think it's okay but as to try this kind
of stuff and the goal is not to fly a
far away but just to ever stuff kind of
some kind of a developer kit to build on
the quadcopter arena and to enjoy about
it yeah emails have to another question
hi how much with the hardware cost not
so much I think there are great buys
like 40 euros the pitbull VM is like 20
an essence or like 40 then you have the
motors but you can choose whatever you
want there are plenty err on website oh
that's our cost cost a lot but yeah I
think that's the motor the more
expensive that you have to to deal with
are there effective or not ask you to
choose but I think with 100 maximum 200
do yours you have a the wall okay thank
you super anyone else very a bit more
time so if if yeah as long as you're
willing to keep taking the question
so you talked about the discovery of the
drone over the SSDP oh yeah so that's
that HTTP or TCP connection of this
brand a SSEP is really low-level it's
likely to use UDP and multicast so that
that's being a that's not HTTP okay
that's before but it's pretty simple I
think so what your TV used to to
broadcast on there in the room so it's
used in smaller Network yeah did you
consider once they discovered actually
creating a single airline cluster with
the - yeah the controller is that what
happens - now or do you send commands
over some other mechanism now actually I
let some space for the code window
multiple work up sir but actually I just
take the list and take the first but
maybe you can just select the one you
want to each quadcopter can ever name
and so an IP address assigned and then
all which was fun with their IP address
and their name and that's up to you to
choose which one with the name you want
to select Tunis to Sunday the data okay
and then once you've selected that you
join them with an I just adored the IP
address of the one selected and then
communicate with this like this how do
you communicate with it that with a
twenty circuit for the locals or from
the ground station and then sooner or
west api screw from responding to from
the ground station to the quadcopter
I didn't
yeah thanks so just a good question
have you considered selling everything
as a kid I mean actually reefer
if some of you guys are interested you
could just sum me an email maybe I can
check with some 3d apps to make some
kids of 2d printing pieces and make some
kind of deal of materials with all that
stuff I can do this but if someone is
interested I'll make it okay thanks
thanks you should continue to develop
your Bluetooth steps to do but can you
elaborate a little bit about soft
real-time features as well as hard
wisdom what you usually use when you do
something in the traditional way
actually I'm not I'm not a big guy in a
VM or language I have some issue with
kind of garbage collection that happened
however and then because all the PID
computation are based on time except of
the proportional gain I need to find a
way to measure the time but in a really
regular by the way that some kind of
difficulty so I see that there are some
priority on the process I have to see
what what are the best alternates you to
avoid my process to be stopping off for
other useless process but that's some
way that I need to investigate a bit
more tricky so first on some 10s
how does anyone else have another
question if you have the stamina to take
another one I going once there we go
you use two umbrellas were they under
one big one or just separate them by
laps and then you build releases but in
the individual ones sorry the what you
have to Ambur labs we are in one quick
yeah
it's really we add the brain which is
plainly the older business logic like
the PID receiver and so on I have a the
API which is only funny up and correct
with the brain and then I strike the
drivers because there are a lot of
different hardware that you need to
implement some commands to initialize
them and I don't get to petitioner in my
business logic so it stores a number of
apps like not an app that is the drivers
that contain all the code for the
toddler okay so that as I've shown that
you can select for example which are the
sensor that are active like the Georgia
scope and then after you can say okay my
gyroscope used the driver l3 this driver
which is for this color yeah thanks
super what we should probably wrap there
just to make sure there's enough time
for people a transition but did anyone
else have another pressing question or
should we see you wrap it up time
testing after if you have more
questioning happy is that awesome or
thanks very this a good presentation
