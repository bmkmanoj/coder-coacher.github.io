startup called big live in Los Angeles
and Francesco had asked me to present
something here at Air lying factory
because we've done some work with with
our lying solutions that was very
successful and most of what we do there
or all what we do there is proprietary
so what I did in order to to make a
presentation was put together a quick
sample application that that people can
use as a means of introducing new
engineers to Erlang so the objectives
here are to provide a sample application
that works and is potentially
interesting and hopefully actually does
something useful and the object is the
application are leveraged and no SQL
backend show you how that's done in our
line it's very easy and everyone should
be doing it use natively implemented
functions those are actually also a
little bit more complex but relatively
easy and when we get into natively
implemented functions I'll explain some
of the pitfalls and why you want to be
careful with that make sure that people
are aware that they can use a dock and
rebar to sort of simplify and automate
their their build processes and provide
something that people can use so the
thing that we built and it took us a
couple of days to do it is actually
online at ER locator org and is on
github the source everything is licensed
and at worst with the MIT license there
a variety of components that are Apache
I think some are BSD but there's nothing
in here that is that is not free for you
to use in your own applications and of
course the entirety of the source code
is available all right so here's the
concept of our of our simple application
we decided that we wanted to be able to
quickly and efficiently locate users in
close proximity to one another and the
traditional solutions for this take
latitude and longitude and either
perform radius calculations on on every
entry or first take a ring
change of latitude longitude and then
apply radius calculations to that all of
which is fine and works but the problem
is if you have a hundred thousand users
and you try to do that with each data
point you end up with a hundred thousand
indexes and it very promptly becomes a
problem so we decided to solve this
problem using using greta sander line
and let's see I think you can actually
see that there so the way we did it is
we took the Geo hash algorithm and the
Geo hash algorithm is a pretty simple
algorithm that interleaves bits of
latitude and longitude and produces a
single a single value and then it
expresses that value in base32
alphanumeric characters so we did the
same thing but with a large number
instead and each each one of these
things can actually represent a range of
an arbitrary size and you can
continually add add precision by adding
more bits on the least significant end
of things so if you if you create
regions like this and you put users in
the region then what you'll have is all
the users within the same region which
is fine until your user is down in the
corner and then when you ask for
neighbors you get only the users you
know up on the other side and nobody on
on the the edges to which your user is
closest so we just went with a
three-by-three grid very very simple and
we exposed it you know with a Web API
but one last note this is just a sample
app there is no security on it at all
it's wide open if you deploy it deploy
it carefully behind firewalls and when i
get into the web api you'll see why that
is okay so take a look at the at the
front end to build the front end we
didn't want to spend any time on on
design or graphics so we just grabbed
twitter bootstrap which is free and easy
and it works it gives you something that
looks good is presentable as a
professional appearance cost you nothing
and is done in minutes we rolled into
that the google maps api because that's
how people don't like to see things
geographically again
this is all based on latitude and
longitude you could put it anywhere you
want and this is all just JavaScript in
the front end so I mean it doesn't it's
not necessarily tightly integrated and
then to provide some identity
information we use the Facebook
JavaScript API so that you can actually
be yourself and see who you are and who
your neighbors are on the map and I've
got the get the URL there I don't know
how well the Wi-Fi is working but if you
guys have laptops and want to log in you
can actually play with it it's a tiara
locator dorg and at the end of the
speech I'll try and actually demonstrate
it but my Wi-Fi hasn't been the best so
we'll see how that goes ok so I didn't
spend much time on the front end because
the audience isn't all that interested
in front end stuff so let's get to the
to the back end it's a very simple
Erlang application the core technology
is really the way that latitude and
longitude are are arranged it's very
similar to geo hash except we use
numeric numeric values to build the back
end we built and are giving away under
the MIT license the geo num in an if we
use Redis just a standard in this case
debian Redis no particular requirements
moshi web which is a tool for building
HTTP servers in Erlang quick and easy
gets the job done we used a doc to
generate some documentation for the code
and I'll talk a little bit more about
why a mundane detail like that is
important and rebar to to wrap it all up
and build it and down at the bottom
you've got the github identifiers for
both alright so some more detail on on
how the the data is actually stored if
you take a look at at that number I've
got latitude and longitude which are
somewhere in San Francisco
and when you when you make the request
it produces the Geo num of for 372 1694
and that is represented down below the
most significant bit is a flag it's a
placeholder so that if you have a lot of
zeros you don't end up with a problem
and then we just interleave longitude
and latitude bits back and forth until
you reach the desired precision and the
idea here is that you will use
relatively less precision in order to
have a region so that there's a number
there are a number of users stored
within that region the implementation of
geo gnome is a natively implemented
function for those of you who aren't
familiar with it natively implemented
functions are small routines and see
that you can actually pull into your
airline code to improve execution times
of computationally intensive tasks the
the risk with with an if currently and
there there there are improvements in
the language coming up that will
hopefully hopefully improve the
situation but the risk that you have
right now is that the C code is a black
box you don't get the pre-emptive
multitasking the the the Erlang virtual
machine doesn't have nearly as much
control over it so you want to make sure
that these things are short and that
they execute very quickly and you don't
build too much into the NIF because if
you do then you lose a lot of the value
that you have with the Erlang vm but to
use an if it's very simple in your on
the on the module load in the init you
just load up the load up the shared
object and then in the in the code you
wrap it and call it and the Erlang is
very simple you can see an example at
the bottom of the slide and just for fun
i put the documentation down in the in
the lower right in case you need any
reference the see also relatively easy
there's a header that you call and
wrappers that you use you can see
examples here and essentially what the
rapper's do is pass the arguments in
execute the sea and format the results
in such a fashion that Erlang can handle
them
very very easy all right so Redis I that
everyone here is reasonably familiar
with rhett asst but if not i'll give you
a quick introduction it's actually the
remote dictionary service stores and
serves foundational structures those are
lists ordered sets and key value very
very simple simple stuff but it's fast
it's all in memory you are limited to
the set of data that you can hold in RAM
if you go beyond that you'll find that
things don't work very well and i've
included a variety of urls here it's
licensed bsd no problem obviously the
optimal use case for something like this
is data that's tiny so that you can have
a lot of it so that you're scaling
doesn't become an issue you know in on a
machine that has enough physical RAM to
to make it workable frequent reads and
writes because it's all in memory it's
very efficient and transient there there
there are some persistence capabilities
in Redis but for my optimal use case I
avoid them let's see so the way we're
using rattus in this case we have three
specific keys and they're they're very
obviously named we've got geo Nam with a
colon and then the numeric hash number
that's actually a set of the user IDs
that are within that particular
geographic location you've got a Geo num
underscore user colon followed by the
Facebook ID and that's the data for any
user and we allow you to put you know
essentially arbitrary data in that you
pass and and parameters but that just
gets stored so that you can you can
include not just the user but also some
interesting information you can have
profile links and so on and so forth and
then you have an expires table which is
a sorted set ordered by when the thing
expires and we essentially just launched
a a background process that runs through
and deletes things that need to be
deleted for this implementation we use
redo redo is a very simple pipelines
Redis
client implementation for Erlang it has
one and one API functions only that's
ready to command and a redo command
Britannic depending and I want to
pronounce it and you just past the Redis
command into it very simple for the web
api we use motion web moshi web is an
extraordinarily simple set of tools for
building lightweight HTTP servers i'm
sure most of you guys are familiar with
it i would hope but you essentially run
through a loop there's there's a case
statement inside the loop that switches
based on the method that's being called
you've got we implemented post in our
head and get together and then post
separately and then inside each of that
you just call the code you're going to
call for the particular you ah URL in
question rebar rebar is really easy and
should always be used how to say it is
simply enough the only thing you really
have to do with rebar is is get it we
pull it directly off of github and put
it into the end of the end of the
project it's a it's an erlang script it
just execute it's very easy there's an
example of a make file there the only
thing this is this is a pretty standard
make file the only thing that's that's
at all different about it is that it
calls document as well as as the other
you know as well as compile and get
depths and then on the configuration at
the bottom you can see that we've
configured it to to go and get you know
a dependency very easy very
straightforward you know any experienced
software engineers shouldn't have any
trouble picking it up a doc doc is easy
and everyone should be using it and this
is this kind of gets into why why I'm
doing this if you take a doc and you put
headers on all your files and you
document every one of your functions and
you use and use rebar doc to generate
your documentation you can actually hand
the source code with the documentation
to any new engineer who's not familiar
with Erlang and they can kind of figure
out what's going on
in a lot of cases that doesn't get done
and it becomes really daunting and
difficult but I mean it and I've got an
example of you know just a header file
and a function description so the last
is a an explanation of the API that we
exposed we're getting geo neighbors you
pass in a geo num and it returns to all
the neighbors in a three-by-three grid
very simple there's a there's a bounding
box target that will show you what the
region is and then for the post there's
a set and a delete and then the last two
are sort of the reason that you would
never expose this publicly you've got to
generate which will create randomly
neighbor entries just you know for
testing purposes of course you'd never
want that in production and then there's
flush all which clears all the clears
all the keys and reddest you would also
never want that production so let's see
I'm going to see if I can actually wow
this is huge yikes I'm going to have to
make this much smaller let's see what we
can do here well it is actually working
so
green things a time
Green Barn XOX okay there we go oh yeah
full screen that'll work okay so this is
me this is this is what it is at the
default obviously I haven't told it Who
I am so let's see if that works there we
go so it got me yeah I can't even see
the rest of this thing that's annoying
so I
so a couple of people logged in and
these will actually I'll just disappear
within about a half an hour that log me
in several times kneels in I have two
entries that's a bug but anyway there
you have it if you if you if you can see
it on a larger screen and scroll down
further there's you know the ability to
create neighbors and do that sort of
thing but yeah you should be able to
yeah
so it is in effect the simplest thing on
the planet and I think everyone should
have done it years ago it's the default
or just reload the page yeah if it
doesn't if it doesn't initially report
the location that's a default yeah but
yeah I mean it's yeah generate a hundred
oh we actually threw ten thousand at it
when we were just getting started to see
how it worked and I worked fine the
client was a bottleneck at the data
actually came back in about two seconds
and then the client choked trying to put
all that on the map as one might expect
but does everyone see how
extraordinarily simple this is you think
you could hand it to someone who doesn't
know where lang and bring them up to
speed okay right well I mean the
objective here is to have a sort of
reference a reference application that
you know that people can look at and if
you guys want to take a look at it and
make contributions by all means that's
encouraged but it shouldn't be it
shouldn't be difficult it shouldn't be
scary it should be fun and easy now
there are any questions
generally an imperative background
probably object-oriented probably
JavaScript PHP HTML just just very
typical web stuff and what we want to do
is we want to bring those people kind of
into the fold so they can do more than
work as well well yeah so essentially
you've got you've got to number spaces
with latitude and longitude you've got
you know negative 180 to 180 and
negative ninety to ninety and what we do
is we just add it so that it begins at
zero and goes all the way up and then
divide it in half divided in half
divided in half divided in half so you
should have you know you should have any
of your neighbors we've we've
essentially eliminated the the negative
number problem or the one negative one
problem
I'd have to look at I'd have to look at
the edge cases but I'm not I'm not
immediately aware of areas where it
wouldn't work but yeah I mean if you if
you want to follow up let's let's do it
by all means all good no problem thank
you know we're getting those from the
from the browser and you can actually
drag and drop the icon if you want to
move it so if for some reason it thinks
that your IP is a million miles away you
can just you can just drag your pin on
on the Google Maps API and drop it it'll
reset you oh I don't know I mean well
it's going to be in this case it's by IP
so some might these are very accurate
others are poor and in it it's it's
controlled by your provider and the
providers do they exhibit varying levels
of effort in this area so I mean there
there are some cases where in parts of
the Midwest I'll show up in Chicago
right and you know that's just the way
it is but that's that's why we allowed
you to to drag it and put it somewhere
else I mean the system itself runs on
latitude and longitude if you have you
know if you have a better way of
specifying that that you're going to
you'll get better results right yeah
mobile is much better yeah well mobile
actually runs on GPS yes
well the geo hash is very similar geo
hash is very similar there's also
there's also a hammer sign that is
different but you know potentially
comparable I mean yeah this is I
wouldn't I wouldn't lay claim to the the
original algorithm that's I mean it's
more or less the same as geo hash the
that we just expressed it as an integer
simply because computers are better at
numbers I mean going this way you could
if you wanted to for example create a Z
set scored by scored by number and
actually have you know do bitwise
masking and in ranges of things like
that i mean it's it's a lot easier than
than working with the text any other
