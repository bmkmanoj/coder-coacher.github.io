I'm from the arcane project also
University of Kent so yeah we're
building a permanent decentralized
archive for the internet I've been
building systems with a line for about
eight or nine years now and my PhD work
was in building an operating system with
Erlang but we're not here to talk about
that today
so this talk first we'll be talking
about what block chains are and what
blocked weaves are how they differ how
they work at a pretty basic level and
then building up on top of that and then
we'll talk about what the are chain
project is so what its aims are or the
potential implications of it are and how
we're building it which I think should
be quite interesting as well as a new
model for a decentralized application
designer so first what is a block chain
well it's just a data structure really
but in most instances is deployed with a
peer-to-peer network so that's the first
component and the data structure itself
is simply a series of blocks containing
typically signed transactions that are
linked to every other block in the
system so you yeahyou cryptographically
link one block to the previous block and
so on back to the original block such
that you can verify at all times the
validity of all of the data that has
been entered into the system so it looks
a bit like this you have the blocks with
the transactions inside and then the
hash of the previous block added to the
next block such that they're all linked
essentially so in order to actually make
a system like this work you have to have
some way of limiting the speed at which
blocks are added to the system and most
blockchain based systems use a system
called proof-of-work
which is essentially taking the open
transactions in a block
and adding them to a randomly generated
number and then seeing if they hatch
typically using char two two five six
for Bitcoin at least to produce an
output that has a certain number of
preceding zeros and that number of
preceding zeros we call the difficulty
as more miners join the network and
attempted mined the chain which is just
adding new blocks to it the difficulty
increases such that hopefully you stay
at a roughly stable level of adding
blocks to the network so here the
difficulty is two we can see that we did
four hashes we generated four random
numbers hashed them with the
transactions and we got finally one at
the end here that had the right
properties to yes satisfy the difficulty
so then after you do this you just
package up the block and you send it
around the network to other people and
they verify sure enough all the
transactions inside a valid and the the
randomly generated value does indeed
lead to the correct difficulty
properties and then they accept it and
then they start mining the next block in
the system and once it's reached that
point then you have the all of the
transactions in that new block
cryptographically linked with all the
transactions in the previous block and
when new blocks are added they'll be a
link to that as well
so in a hardier system where there are
more miners the difficulty increases so
here the difficulties for lots more
hashes random guesses really so why are
block chains important well they allow
you to at a fundamental level they allow
you to negotiate some kind of
transaction doesn't have to be financial
between a large group of decentralized
peers that all have the same level of
authority in the system so in the case
of Bitcoin this allows you to do value
transfer without banks at all in any
sense but you can use it for other
things too like aetherium essentially
does negotiation of virtual machine
state through transactions it's really
just a way of coming to distributed
decent
wise consensus about something yeah and
it keeps the entire history of the
system cryptographic the verifiable from
start to finish at all times which is
really a neat feature for lots of
systems and currently obviously there's
been a big boom in this industry and
we're actually starting to see some
governments start to look at building
their own crypto currencies to issue as
national currencies so that would be a
game changer but we'll see how that goes
so what is a block we've essentially a
block we've is a sharding blockchain so
a blockchain that you can split across
many different computers and this is
interesting because it allows you to
expand the size of the data structure
many many fold it can get extremely
large internet scale we think where as
with the previous or with a blockchain
every single minor in the system would
have to download at least the headers of
all of the previous blocks here you just
need to store say two or three of the
blocks in order to start mining on the
system it also uses a new proof of work
system well a system built on top of
proof of work called proof of access
where essentially instead of just
linking to previous block one previous
block in the system another what's
called a recall block is randomly chosen
from the previous series and looped back
in to the next block and this means that
in order to mine the next block you have
to have the coffee of that recall block
as well as the last block in the system
and that incentivizes people to store
parts of the chain and this has some
really nice properties with wealth for a
start it means that you replace some of
the useless hashing that goes on in a
typical blockchain like system with
useful storage of data because they have
to you have to have that recalled block
in order to take part in a hashing of
the next block it also maintains the
proof of work security guarantees that
you have with typical chart two two five
six prw algorithms
and another nice thing about it is that
it incentivizes miners to evenly store
the blocks so you don't end up with a
situation where everyone has one block
and nobody has another because if very
few people have a block if you get a
copy of that for yourself it allows you
to take part in a hashing competition
with fewer other nodes meaning that
you're more likely to get the reward
so you're financially incentivized to
store blocks that nobody else has and
the network level this means that it's
self-organizes into a yeah a well a well
designed redundant distributed storage
system so this is what it looks like as
well as the previous system without the
merkel group you loop in one of the old
blocks the entire block not just the
header into the next one and if you
expand out over the whole thing sort of
has this funny confusing structure to it
so why are they better well they allow
you to shard the data structure across a
large number of different computers and
machines which means that you can come
to consensus about extremely large
pieces of data over long periods of time
it's convenient for miners because
instead of having to download the entire
chain to get started
they just download the last block and a
few of the other blocks that they've
decided might come up it essentially
randomly chosen and then they can get
going
Oh another thing is it's also much
greener because some of that proof of
work is is replaced with proof of access
to previous blocks and access to
previous blocks can be done with very
little amounts of electricity and in
comparison to Bitcoin we're essentially
just everybody is hashing for every
single block it's it's really quite a
difference and if the chain gets to
extremely large rather weave gets to
extremely large sizes then it's only
going to be feasible to store say 1% of
it yourself that means that 99% of the
time you are mining as efficient
years you can without doing anything at
all which uses zero electricity so
that's quite nice and it keeps the
difficulty of that hashing part of the
system low as well yeah
so recall blocks are included with the
previous blocks and this means that the
the network essentially refreshes itself
over time so in order to verify that a
new block has been added correctly the
miner has to distribute the recall block
as well because other people that are
trying to verify it won't necessarily
have a copy of that but they do have a
hat of what that block should be like so
they can verify that the book you sent
to them is a correct one but this means
over time if you just listen for all of
the blocks in the system eventually you
end up with the structure itself because
everyone has to send out those recall
blocks as well so you can't be selfish
and just hoard them like you have to
send it in order to use it yeah so in a
block chain everybody stores all of the
blocks in a block weave that hasn't yet
self organized and hasn't tried to make
itself or rather each individual player
in the system has not yet tried to make
most efficient use of their storage you
end up with this sort of random mess
which does cover the chain weave but
it's not it's not as organized as it
could be but over time it sort of self
organizes into this more reasonable
affair at the bottom so the arcane
project is the first implementation of a
block weave in the wild it's essentially
an open permanent archive that's
decentralized yet is able to scale to
huge sizes because it's based on a block
weave and it has a cryptocurrency
built-in which is used to pay for the
storage in the system yeah and it also
has nice features for cryptographic
verification at the point of entry into
the archive during these storage in the
archive and then on retrieval as well so
the first application we're looking at
for the our team project is to build an
Internet Archive
on top of it so what we're really
interested in doing here is putting
human history on a block weave such that
it can't be altered and can always be
accessed later it would protect the
information record against damage
alteration either maliciously or or
accidentally yeah on natural disasters
so the idea is you run a web extension
in your browser if there's a web page
that you like the look of and you want
to make sure that you can access it in
the future or you think that other
people in the future might want to see
this information later you press a
button it archives onto the chain you
pay very small amount for it and then
it's available in the long term and
critically the point of this is to
attempt to solve the problem of the
Orwellian memory hole so for those of
you that haven't read 1984 the idea is
that you should well the Winston the
main characters job is to alter records
of history and then throw the evidence
down the memory hole which really just
has a fire at the bottom of it and then
the idea is that if you do that it might
not be possible to ever verify what had
happened in the past and we're trying to
make it so that that's fundamentally
impossible right so - Erlang yeah how
are we building it well we're using a
Erlang as the as the basis of the system
with a block tree structure and
verification of content but the
interesting thing for us about Erlang is
how it distributes processes across
systems and really allows you to run
many processes without concern so the
fundamental thing that this has helped
us with as well as it's really just
being a nice language to write it in is
in testing which we've built to two
systems for so fundamentally at the core
of it we built a networking module that
allows you to send messages between
nodes in the system but it's agnostic as
to whether it uses Erlang message
passing or HTTP interface over an actual
oh yeah internet connection so we put
that on the base of it but with the
Erlang message-passing
we have a simulated network delay packet
loss and so on so that you can get a
real simulation of a good like the
peer-to-peer network inside one machine
and what we do with this is we run very
large network simulations thousands of
nodes all mining and working at the same
time just as they would in a real
network but obviously in one machine and
that allows you to pick up essentially
one in a million bugs it's the idea that
you would never really find unless you
put it out into production and then
someone send you some bug reports we can
find those bugs early by just running
tests simulated networks with simulated
clients that do they put stuff on the
chain they try and get it back later and
all sorts of things so then once we find
bugs in the never off very large network
simulator on no Vance we isolate the
conditions under which they happened and
then we write what we call a tiny
Network test which essentially has a
similar similar sort of thing but
instead of all of the miners running at
once
none of them auto mine so they all wait
to be told what to do
and you can then manipulate the network
into exactly the state you want to
trigger the bug so that you can then
find a solution to it test it and sure
it works over time and this is this is a
real step up from what we see other
cryptocurrency groups doing who
generally use three to five nodes on a
single machine to test their network and
hope that you know no other behavior
arises that the thousands of nodes scale
that doesn't arise at the three to five
note scale so so we think this is a
pretty good way of finding bugs early
and we really couldn't have done it
without early
so yeah we're also interested in a
different form of application in the
decentralized space so we note that
aetherium and other cryptocurrencies
that do computation on a blockchain have
really they've got a lot of hype and
buzz but none of them have actually that
no big applications have come out of
this that that people really want to use
and we've been wondering for a long time
why that is and we think the answer is
essentially the too many nodes in the
network have to execute all of the code
and it's very hard to get data into it
in the first place there isn't financial
so we've got a different model where
essentially we say okay well you write
your application in the normal way and
yeah you just use the are chain or a
similar block wave like system obviously
if we prefer you use the are chain to
store the data so you use it as the
application database back-end where you
would normally say put this record in
database you just send it to the are
chain instead and then you boot up a
series of nodes around the edge of this
system that essentially run in the usual
fashion but obviously because they're
sharing all the same data they'll return
the same results to the user so you can
get decentralization just by having
duplicated nodes and using a truly
decentralized storage mechanism so you
can you can build these applications in
any programming language if you want to
hit the HTTP API is really pretty simple
but you can also do it in Erlang so you
can do things like this like build
decentralized social media applications
so we have a decentralized Twitter
variant that runs on this system but as
well as that you can do other things
that we think are quite interesting so
this this our train system has or people
will put onto it large amounts of data
that they find interesting from the
internet
so news articles and so on that they
think are worthwhile to store for the
long term you can process that data you
can have that data just come to you and
passively listen to it just by adding a
node to the Archon network and you can
write an application in Erlang that just
listens to this data and processes it in
real time so you can do really
interesting stuff there like for example
check how many people are talking about
a stock ticker and then you could do
sentiment analysis on it say okay are
they talking about it in a positive or a
negative sense so now you've got
yourself as kind of stock tip generated
or at least an alert for what's
happening on the stock market but as
well as that you know if I want to know
what people are saying about the arching
project I can just set up a node that
listens to the data that's being sent
around the system and process it and see
you know what people are saying and this
is really so you can do this sort of
thing with the internet but the critical
difference is that you have to go out
and search for that information on the
internet here you just set up a monitor
that passively listens and the data
comes to you and it's really nice
because people have hand curated that
data so they someone out there thinks
it's worth storing which is a helpful
heuristic so we're running an app
development competition for applications
built on the R train
we're giving away a number of the the
tokens they're used in the system so
that people can fuel their applications
and also an investment pool that will
offer to people so that they can turn
their prototype systems into real
working companies so if you're
interested in that sort of thing and
online development so on come talk to me
afterwards or you can check out the r
chain medium blog for details so I've
run very short but that's it and one
last quote yeah so he who controls the
past controls the future he who controls
the present controls our past when we
were attempting to make it so that
everyone controls the past thank you
yeah yeah so certainly storage is easy
throughput is harder and the answer to
that is to keep the block time the yeah
the target block time long so that the
data has enough time to flow through the
network
yeah we're aiming for about seven to ten
minutes of block time and we've nice
thing about the simulation framework
we've used is that we can just run
simulations and see whether they work or
not so yeah we're pretty happy with that
yeah it's a good question and it comes
up in Bitcoin - so the answer is when
people want to access data they just ask
for transactions transactions are non
harmful for a selfish miner to give away
because they can't be made back into
blocks
but in Bitcoin if you want to join the
network someone has to give you all the
blocks right why should they because
it's just adding to the hashing power of
the network which is making things worse
for them and there's also yeah a few
other points we're going to earn our
white paper about that yeah what's a
I don't know the name I'm afraid is it
does it use a similar blockchain
structure or
right I see interesting so there are a
lot of other systems that use they store
hashes of data on a blockchain so hyper
ledger from IBM does a similar thing but
we see this as rather dangerous because
obviously you know a hash will only tell
you that when you have the data sure
enough that is the data that you're
talking about doesn't actually secure
your ability to access the data and we
kind of have a similar thing with file
coins say an IP FS where they have a
back-end for well they use ipfs for the
storage part but then they have a
settlement layer on a blockchain on top
but here the real difference is that the
block weave algorithm allows you to
actually store the data itself on the on
the chain
well we've in this case yeah
their reward so there's a static well
there's a block reward that you just get
from mining a block regardless of
whether there are any transactions in it
which slowly decreases over time where
there's also transaction mining rewards
so essentially what you're doing when
you decide that something should be
archived is you're just paying the miner
to do that work for you we actually pay
in the network but through the miner
II
yeah this is interesting yeah so you
could do it that way but it turns out
that the complexity is actually squared
so you yet you can control the recoil
block but there's absolutely no reason
you'd ever want to do it because doing
so would mean that you'd have to throw
away so many candidate blocks that you
have actual hashes for that is just not
profitable
well there's decentralized control so
it's up to the - what they agree to take
or not and that's rather interesting
because there's a system of blacklists
so each miner can specify what they
don't want to accept on the system and
this works a transaction level as well
as block acceptance level so say 51% of
people don't want content X on the
system then if a miner accepts a
transaction with content X in it then
when they miner block and they actually
get that block then they distributed to
everyone else everyone else will reject
it so they're actually very
disincentivized from accepting
transactions that contain content that
51% of the network over 50 percent
actually is going to reject
yes yeah precisely and critically the
arching project is not going to be
producing any black lists we're leaving
that up to the community to build for
themselves but we think that led
eventually lead to a system the sort of
analogous to political parties where
people essentially assign their
allegiance to one black list which leads
to sort of political influence on the
chain I suppose
is the same same situation yeah
it's so simply nobody would accept those
blocks the answer
well actually the FBI and so on
published hashes of all of their
database of this sort of content so it's
it's reasonably solved
that's interesting we actually don't
we'd rather that we stored it twice
because typically well frequently pages
change so one of the things that we like
about this system is it allows you to
look back through different versions
that have been stored over time on the
on the chain
we've okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
