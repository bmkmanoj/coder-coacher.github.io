implementation of the standard Lua 5 5 -
on top of the beam law it's a powerful
efficient lightweight embedded scripting
language coming in game machine learning
lot devices and scientific computing
research it's a birth procedural
programming object-oriented functional
data driven programming and data
description as well so how many of you
know about Lua okay that's right how
many of you have used it okay that's
quite a difference but it's great also
oh sorry
so let's talk a little bit about Laura
Laura was far enough out of necessary at
the in the nineties in in Brazil they
were they couldn't spend much money
buying technology so they had to make it
themselves
so Lua was created by and I might say
this kind of differently at their last
names but Roberta little szalinski Luis
Enrique figured you and Waldemar Salas
and the political cattle follicle
University of Rio de Janeiro Lua it's
explicitly design as in a scripting
language to be embedded into application
which means that aims to control control
some other applications instead of being
dynamic language is originally
influenced it by TCL Modula snobol AG as
a necessity rates lisp with their single
data
make it stricter making it and it scheme
with the first-class functions with
lexical scope which means closures yeah
I Lua
it's an embedded system meaning it's not
a standalone package right but it's a
library that links to other applications
to extend them the ability to use it as
a library it's what makes Lua and
extinction language Aloha can register
new functions in the environment such as
such functions implemented in c there's
to be is of Lua the extension language
and the extensive language the first one
sees the application language and
LeWitt's the library and the second kind
lourdes the application language and see
yeah and then C is the library I'm sorry
both of them is the same API which is
called the C API Lua programs are not
interpreted directly from the source
code they are compelled into bytecode
which runs into the Louisville tool
machine and this is done in preferred
during performance runtime some uses of
Lua
well it is quite famous in the game
industry also an embedded systems as
well like routers and Moyles it's also
in scripting applications like Wikipedia
or VLC it is popular in systems in
inference infrastructure like engine
or Asterix and web development as well
with up and rusty and lepas image
manipulation with the double lightroom
and tip learning would search her api
getaways with con
so moving on let's talk a little bit
about airline their language is a
concurrent function language which runs
on its own it scalable distributed fault
tolerant and sub real high availability
vm called the beam it's a multi lingual
from the start the Ilinca system with
the with its languages it's built around
in the beam and the eland
language OTP framework you can see it as
a layer a big layer of Ilyn and a really
a skin layer top of it with its going to
be the OTP framework and at the top you
can add certains languages and you can
talk and communicate with each others
and this other languages that you can
add in top of it are ear long as well
you can also add LFE elixir or lower and
which are the most common and there's
some others there as well the pin also
has internal properties that you don't
need to really get worried about it but
you do have them always it is
lightweight massive concurrency as in
cranium is communication process
isolation error handling hard code
replacement support and support for
introspect ation
and monitoring and there's also some
external properties that you can
actually see them and with those you
have immutable data better matching
functional language predefined set of
data types modules and no global data
some uses of Erlang well dealing is not
just for Telecom it's not just a telecom
language it's been using web
developments well with cowboy that's a
web server it's been using communication
systems like what's up or Mongoose am
operations and monitoring message
blockers and a very popular cluster
database like a react or amazon simpledb
so while we're right well real likes to
implement in the languages on top of the
beam so Bart lor really has a really
good features it allows you to switch
between Lua and lured introducing a new
way to use small bits of logic
programming luluwa instead of airline
which means that regrets programs can be
writing in the list at the list in two
languages which is Lua and airline and
you can also communicate with the others
that I just said like elixir or other
fine
elephant I'm sorry and the system
language implements of course the hard
parts of the application are green are
great limbs
data structures and there's a little
change of this level because Lua Lua has
a C API but we don't need this
and Lord we have Ilyn so we have an
eland API here and also we do use as the
feature of Lord above scripting to glue
the hard parts in a flexible level is it
to change and as as I was saying since
we do have ear along here we have a
million of processes that can represent
and and camera and millions of Lua
processes concurrently and part and in
parallel which it's that that's why it's
famous Ireland right right I know Dinka
routines since we do have ear line here
we don't need curtains because we did
need which we do have process here
okay so uses of Lourdes Lourdes it's
been used in a several of open-source
project around the world including
including games epic a API Gator woods
and which is our casing nonsense a
Starcraft I a boat but all good language
has his trailer and it depends of the
way do you see they might not be traded
at all you just need to use the right
tools for the right job so for example
although it's not good for concurrency
and multi-core parallel
the standard library is not very large
and you kind of need to do it yourself
because it only gives you a set of tools
it doesn't give you an a specific it's
not built for a specific tasks but it's
my point of view that that's not even a
bad thing that's that's really a great
thing
airline is not good for heavy number
crushing global share immutables mutable
state a scripting yeah but his script is
it's not quite good the goal look Lloyd
was to the it was to implement correctly
the Lua language on top of the beam
Rachel in initial look and behave the
same as Lua it shall include the
standards libraries and Ischl interface
with airline fluency completely
implementation of the Lua language on
top of the beam and it does unnecessary
for it does not has the C API and as a
result of this implementation we do have
a successful implementation here but
except of go to and encourage things and
because they do not match the features
of floor a patent sorry of airline and
it also has great integration between
Ireland and France as I said before you
can also talk with elixir
and an elephant if you want to there is
all the implementation we have functions
well as the result of the implementation
I'm sorry we have functions modules a
string manipulation table mechanisms
math functions bitwise operations and a
few input enough food in OS facilities
it is extendable if required to call lua
from england and a straightforward to
call ireland from lua and then again we
don't have the C API regarding the VM
and compiler we do have a relative
straightforward VM similar but not the
same as the standard Llewyn the compiler
optimizes the environment handling
separates peer local environment of
blocks and functions from the global M
lots of unnecessary information I mean
they we have a very basic error messages
but I believe that's in a pipeline for a
feature so regarding data types we do
have nil which is the item Neil we have
boolean which is which are the atom
boolean strings will become stream
binaries numbers are floats tables are
hash tables for kids we have 1 to N n
hash
Dex for the rest we do have functions
which are hash functions or funds the
main difficulty of lowered lamentation
was the need of the in was the need of
the of the to implement them sorry
mutable data with Ireland's immutable de
local data we keep all the low estate in
one data structure explicitly threaded
through everything
this threatening step is why you
typically do in era anyway rubble
implement alerts on garbage collection
on top of Airlines collector for low
estate we have a very small community
bad I believe is it keeps growing and
Laura embrace both of the languages Lua
and Ellen they do have they do are
simple diverse and common plan
complementary with each others and of
course they are languages big systems I
will encourage you to look up the the
github for this and also indicate hub
you will find a couple of demos there I
can show you let me say ok yeah I will
show you both of of the demos you can
find in indeed and the github so the
first one is really simple it is just
hello here and the first one the first
line it's it's a function call the
second one it's a file called remember
that I said that we do have some input
in our implementation and the third one
is a lower shank and also
I'm sorry I mean D yes
okay so in this wine which is which
which is the famous I'm sorry
chips from Robert each of one of this
dots it's a single law it's a single
Lewin note here so we do have I we do
have our millions of millions of
processes happening and this is about
they are killing himself and I encourage
you to look at this demos and also try
to make one yourselves and to I don't
know have fun with the Lord because this
is really fun and that's
and yep that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
