platforms service so what did what we've
got to see a few implementations we've
got the one probative presentation
earlier I was just involved in what we
did on a cloud foundry but both of these
are very early stage implementations so
we want to discuss the ideas of topics
about what changes you can make to these
platforms and service what features you
need to support what's not really
compatible in order to get to get the
idea so i guess you can kick off
right away the first questions with
walking part of the service do maybe
like one of operations thoughts
so I invested that foundry floretta
Burger has billed pets which is a way of
grabbing precompile coffee of fuels
language runtime and then installing
that using that Africa's quadruped
reinstalls times machines and they
actually end up singling to the
applications to introduce the lake
apartments while the key differences is
the cloud foundry gets all the bill to
be done locally on the development
machine as post comments okay so yeah I
guess who's on sir philip at the bit
that we don't have a great answer for is
how you compile
how do you keep up with changing OTP
votes like if you want to run various
like prostitutes ll be able things
I guess yeah like the arrow creek has a
compiled languages getting push in and
little file system container out with
the app in runtime necessary
so that's that automates some part of it
is still magnets has around as you
maintaining that the bill back to the
scripture plus frequent flyer miles so
like running multiple versions of the
language got a cat multiple freedom file
version though and sitting around
I think one thing that makes Java
popular in the space is the fact that
you get these a much more adult style
applications where everything that
basically defines your application is
bundled up and one little bundle and
then you just drop it in a directory
improvement slack and if you think about
it with with them with an early release
pretty close to having that right we've
got most of the pieces there we just
need the automation around actually
making it line in a real hands-off way
so do you guys think we should be
producing images that contain like an
entire OTP plus the application code
everything and the self-contained don't
need anything else this is the image
that you can execute problem what do you
think that we should share and reply no
reason those can be stuffed between
different applications on the side
window
so exciting the complication is the
trade-off between and actually having a
ball one easily keep your bubble
everything together is just going to
work but if if you actually include all
availing it I don't see exercise the
binary to go around like I notices slug
on or anything something sensitive i
make its way to pick which is not huge
but it's still a lot to be copying
around given level of us really started
45 made but so we've kind of this is
something that we've run into since we
added the bill packs are we running
ubuntu on the on the base machine and
we've got a bunch of languages that
can't pre-installed is like ubuntu dance
or whatever so if you will language pack
targets that environment then you are
cheated you are using my free of the
stove copies of stuff and it did it for
like actually i run into this because i
meant to write by our infrastructure
with you and compile is out of control
gonna take stimulus compile Ruby at but
the thing is like if you had to like a
build GCC
non trivial application plus its
compiler and its decay and all things
those are big jobs I don't know where it
really so you're asking that it's the
choices between limited like per
application for the better for us you
know i'm not going to encourage
something to have a general runnin
install the specific thing that I need w
deployed on it so I want to pass that
limits choices and so for an application
and that I something like you know I
want I want fewer choices I want control
you tell me mean want a more general
environment they can do multiple things
on when it comes to my pre-op lock it
down when the choices because otherwise
you're just pushing problems of the
stack to you know the application
provider or the application builder
simplicity is better for us
so because I guess the thing is that her
okies previously we had the positive
happens is pre-installed by the Ruby
rough diamonds are horrible painting so
the the problem that we came to with
that is that even within the Ruby
community and this happens this happens
in every language that we've looked at I
different customers want to be running
different versions of any given language
a job you don't know whether they want
job of 1.5 1.6 1.7 one point you don't
know which contain a step and want to be
running it so on and so forth in some
communities some of these issues are
kind of settled and that there's like
one popular staff that can basically
Peck but if you want to if you want
broad support that you've got to have
some mechanism for somebody to be able
to do that to be able to get around the
leading thanks pre-installed problem and
so yeah like we currently have that and
it's a results in that you know
compilation slopes athletes which ever
make it look like a
if the premise how we can make
operations easier has made easier does
that make it easier that makes it easier
that it gives you choice but it still
exited the way we've done it it makes
life difficult for the build a plant and
some but once you've picked a build path
for an application you generally need
don't change it and you do have the
option of like making the build packs of
it as using some precompiler resources
that it just adds into your cell so then
you can like if you use that build pack
you can say well your your compiler
version and your OTP version won't
change if you can do it
visually risky also run that way those
don't even just build pack approach
they're going to there is if you're
assuming you might run that also more
private cloud we've actually one of the
operations teams usually usually used to
be able to very much control what it is
it's running on the infrastructure
you've got to this point that you can be
running version where like that they
don't see as being appropriate today
infrastructure posters it may not be
optimized for the right ways they have
some kind of custom modification quite
different things like that I guess kind
of you and so the assumption is making
it easier for the consumer overlying not
the operator of the system with a
operator like another layer apps are
frosted yeah there's something here is
is what makes it easier simply just
adding bill pex does not make it easier
for people developing apps unless you
have added unless somebody has written a
bill pack for the thing that they
actually want to do so if that's the
case then yeah no pets are when
otherwise no because now I want to go my
application on Heroku great back to go
freak out when I quite a bill panic and
then rock man so tell people doing that
as these statements
most people use existing ones that it's
it's the kind of leading edge people
within different language communities
the ones who intend to run the morgue
optional they didn't more like the Java
and so the bill Peck support is actually
being essential for java for the
different IDK versions but there was no
obvious way for us to support like
multiple debian installs of job i could
be wrong i don't really look at the
stuff so i guess when we kind of covered
this one a little bit but so too the
idea of the preparation of cards offices
indo-pak approach they had buses tapping
builded go before you uploaded anyone
else having folks another kind of scoot
over so how do you take an account major
providers I mean how many major Erlang
sort of services or a place to provide a
mountain pass today rather than two or
something but you take into account the
requirements of the various systems are
going to be built on top of like react
and monitor yeah obviously I react
continues to be like the gold standard
for
if they can get that running on top on
top of it early past need folio support
them to actually do anything how easy it
ain't even quite reach that yeah how
many people can put their hands up right
now I think the complication often ends
up being because I like quite frequently
mixes in C code so it's at that point
you stop crying their platform specific
if you built that code since I guess
what Bill pack works there but has the
thing if there's a lot more work to do
at the point of time yeah and it works
because we have like one flavor of
runtime contentment which it's the same
flavor that we're building
yeah I don't even know what I would do
if it was some kind of what cross
compilation reason yeah so far founders
approach to that is that we see link out
the libraries to try to get around it if
you play in the sea inside it's going to
go up ok ok so the next one is what I
like modern features don't fit it has I
think the obvious one that we talked
about at the Heroku is upgrading code
because nothing else that we can see has
a really a concept of doing that like it
if you deploy a new Ruby thing like I
mean even if it even if you were running
maybe you could do this if you were a
running like a PHP in a container and
you could drop new files into the
container somehow they're happy that's
what most exports do anyway yes so we
want to enable exploit as a service in
the cloud so how do we go about this
yeah i'm not sure like in the legs case
i think that path to this is kind of
sideways and that once you can get an
airline distribution into your running
cluster or at least you can get some ssh
session to a shell if you're running
cluster then you have a way of loading
code into the cluster and you can do it
sort of sideways because nothing i can't
think of any other language where this
is a feature that they're even thinking
about and our like platform has no
concept of that as a you know first
class action to take we have an idea of
building things we have an idea of like
a release where we replace containers of
one version with containers of another
version but we have no concept of like a
container with this version that we then
multiply yeah we are biggest in our
biggest production environment whether
its customers at jo-ann or it's like a
TNT themselves you talk about this and
it's like it's like you think you have
the coolest thing in the world and there
is actually there's no operational
awareness there's nobody there's no they
don't register way to offer in them and
we think it's cool and we can
demonstrate that it's cool if we can
control the entire environment but
minute they want to take control of this
just it doesn't fit into the sort of the
paradigm that they're used to operate
moms don't care about it that's
something how big a cluster you talking
about there when you we talked about
postures being run that's the one of the
size of the clusters so we have at today
like at perot group we have one coherent
melon cluster which is a log flex
application and that thing generally
runs at about 12 notes okay and we do
live version version upgrades on where
and yet again it doesn't really fit into
the same release strategy that we use
for Sadie HTTP right except it doesn't
operate as an early imply step because
that thing we upgrade and replace nodes
note by note the local folks cluster we
can write some shellcode up
just run that on our PC multi-ball
upgrade so so to prevent using a part
fires to kind of deploy the second
version of the code that's that's what
I'm a can have the Hatton's up and who
in the audience has successfully used in
that button just got thing anybody ever
has I mean it's kind of a little bit
trolling but kind of also they're super
complicated like one of the things that
I've liked in recent years about
actually developing our own systems is
is reborn and how it's taken a lot of
manual editing files for things and
figuring out how to do stuff and like
it's taken a lot of the pain away and I
feel like our pups and relatives they
work for the use case that Ericsson has
and I haven't encountered them as
something that solves a problem that
I've had without just introducing way
too much complexity okay i can write
building shell scripts to upgrade nodes
far easier than i can write a pups and
relatives so i guess even even if my
karoku tomorrow offered a way for me to
like inject a nap up or Arella some kind
of bundle like that into the system and
have an upgrade my notes I still
probably just really want shell bracha
blogging what seems like a fox and
relics are really kind of targeted at
big systems of really complex of
requirements and you know foremost
reason well
those applications the size of which I
normally interact with it's not that
complicated right it's like oh hey we're
going to you know we just need to inject
this new code and if you're going to do
something like I introduce a gen server
with different state you just you just
restart yep yeah you because because of
the way you architect your systems for
availability and reliability of like
some kind of input load-balanced e thing
in front of it up in front of the thing
that needs to be upgraded you generally
have the option of punting and rebooting
nodes anyway if you're talking about
infrastructure run pass you know you're
a mistress remote past and services that
are based on on Erlang I'm surprising
this is the biggest you seen is 12 well
so I should probably point out that you
can't run they're like clusters as I
Thorogood customer right well okay so i
think one thing that we're seeing in a
twitch fritchy was very wise to avoid
when i talk about like when we with with
some of our biggest clusters now
it met rainy probably are great for
eloquently about the OTP isms that are
becoming really costly on the bigger
clusters we're talking to hundreds and
knows so you get the cost of
communications hold the degradation of
someone or it just becomes its
predictable at least what you're seeing
what you know that you're reaching that
bound of scale and some people made
other choices for you the bigger
clusters we're talking to and chest
about this week about other choices you
can make alternative airline
distributions or alternatives to like
distribution yeah so that's to derail
the conversation too much but how
compatible is the idea of an erlang
cluster with a pass I mean I think it's
it should be doable by the the main
feature I think we're missing is
contained it to contain your networking
if we added that that would pretty much
solve most of the problems because give
me nothing can stop what it is managing
and clustering is essentially
introducing each node feature each other
asked to pull it up
yeah yeah we just haven't properly
virtualized them that's the problem
where we're running on top of and
network that we don't do anything
complicated with the network does not
know about the networks that we would
logically introduce like one per hour or
as a resource that you can attach to
multiple apps or deserve it kinds of
containers inside an apple timing but
but yeah we don't we don't have that and
that's why we can't do it right now but
you know there's nothing stopping
anybody from going out and building it
then some of the other types of the
conference look like that would help out
with that a lot Hogan's OpenFlow stuff
looks really promising to me and never
gone so you think so in that respect
right so you get these containers I'm
talking to each other do you think it it
makes more sense to just kind of assume
the Erlang OTP distribution or do you
think maybe it's just like ok these
notes can talk to each other you figure
out how you want to pass those messages
across um I think as a as a first pass
we want to let people do distribution
the way they've always been doing it so
that you can run existing applications
that know how to cluster like
in our each ever d and react and so on
and so forth the performance is probably
not going to be anything like what you
would get out of a Decatur hardware and
software stack but you know that's not
what you're going forward the power to
make further sort of management and
deployment that's good love it usually
the complication is telling people they
can do it their own way is how you
discover what the other nodes are like
if you've assumed that you're going to
use a heli distribution and in
connection to do the nav in command
social connect to those together as
heroes get booted up whereas without
that yeah it's the end of the path
specific video if it was your
environment of hazzard engine starts to
40 how to introduce know it across all
these near you my name of some kind of
specific discovery service you need to
talk to ya I mean I think people are
running run into this on a situ exactly
and somebody wrote load finder I forget
how that is I guess Erlang distribution
aside from dns and world files or
something that has no multi we shave
discovery right now
and the multi machine discovered it has
is really weird like not careful so I
mean I would not use a world phone if I
was going to introduce a lot of machines
which I mean people build their own
mechanisms whether it's like config
files list of nodes or you know they
have some shared resource that they will
connect to any way like you're right
keys and read us with host names or
there's some predictable host naming
scheme I've seen all kinds of terrible
horrible solutions if you probably
improve on me so in confidence anyway
that's one obviously we talked about the
first two already but what about amnesia
in terms of supporting it that's
obviously built a little bit on top of
the distribution but then it's also a
whole concept of disciplines and they're
all possible I love thanks i love when
amis is out there because they're
eventually gonna find a bunch of
problems that we come in you know
actually it's hard to get amnesia out of
a dedicated or like programme's hands
when they live europe i think you know
we sold their problems you guys gotta
stop doing this we've got a perfectly
good persistent ignis so i mean if you
want to I me so kind of part of the
question this is I mean are we trying to
shoehorn her lying-in because we all I
curling in past and it has a couple of
things that can do but if they're sort
of like they're sort of not narrowing
you can make it do a lot of things but
you know how code upgrades people don't
really people don't have a people don't
even start with a operations paradigm
that allows that to be how to think
about unless you've got a full Erlang
application we can do that for somebody
it's like somebody's running a system
and they say hey we want to do a upgrade
because we
we patched something and we'll say okay
we'll help you do it like you know
grants here he's done it a couple times
you know and that's useful but people
don't embrace that if they're not
already sort of aware what are like a so
how do we take more advantage of it and
we really just become more more like
awareness of the language and people
have an operational parent on that
actually brings that in now if we're
talking about people using a pass that's
more difficult to get people because
they can get a generic audience of Ruby
developers or they want all this stuff
transparent but people operating the
past it depends on how critical the
system isn't how many things we have on
our line i like it i think it's if
uptime and quality of service are
important you have the X you're the sort
of underlying resources to ensure you
know sort of a stable quality services
you go through different sort of step
function advanced upgrades or you know
code changes whatever that's a great
thing to happen so it looks it looks
pretty smooth and at akamai if we had
and that was a cool things we had our
line if we built it that that would be a
great thing when you have you know big
clusters or big meeting
pretty kinky a pretty cool thing to do
is that are bouncing a whole region but
uh and you know it just it doesn't it
doesn't I mean it's are we trying to
make it fit when it's such a such a
outside than normal I don't we contrary
I think it's cool but we use it to do
advantage it's probably just knowledge
well in an almost that's a very good
question right and I think we're all
kind of a little bit biased but there
are a lot but I you know I almost feel
like it's not quite mature enough yet
we're still kind of finding our way
through a lot of these issues erling has
a little bit of a little bit of a bent
towards doing things a certain way
because where it came from tools and
ways that use and you know almost feel
like to kind of have to maybe in true
three more years this conversation turns
out quite a bit differently
distribute processes and communication
that's kind of capitalism so in any
event meet up there yeah you want to
cover that Francesca well you know i'll
talk about amnesia i have very strong
opinions about two answers one is that
if you had the container to container
networking that would let you establish
your own distribution and you cannot
imagine problems the second answer i
would have is god no don't ok and the
thing is i'm nita relies pretty heavily
on node identity and if don't identity
changes what a like frequently your
containers don't have persistent disk so
you don't have any disk or disk 0 2
copies country gather any controls and
says disk I mean I things you can
generalize to you're not usually its
pages don't you take exit villa has its
own that plane you will get which is the
biggest issue the rent here and then
yeah like there are a lot of upper
operational issues to running amnesia on
a non reliable frequently changing
network with different note identities
that make it a real giant hassle and
frankly you know we are trying to take
folk for the operational castle alone
we're tryna
so I guess approach is more generally
two applications as well known I didn't
do something you kind of let go will be
a lot more flexible one because they
were come and go all the time but I
don't think it's at all unreasonable to
say that in the space of applications
that you want to run on as if you're
going to do this with Erlang there are
certain things that that you can do that
we're just not going to support people
in these just probably one of those
things like I guess I guess the overall
question is like obviously the pass for
a lot about the languages like Ruby
being the cable on people have seen
massive benefits i feel like people
considering the clarification is going
to be away so the idea here is can you
get a link to that how many features do
reason anyway it sounds like the answer
is probably quite accurate well and you
have to do things you have to do things
differently when when you talk to people
about for example for roku saying why is
Roca great like dude five minutes it's
off you know it's like takes me longer
to name the git repository that doesn't
bring the application up right and
that's the kind of in its its it's easy
as simple it's one step popping but
we've done right and we're not there yet
but their life right even just bringing
an application up on your local box
takes a little bit more than that I
think rebar has helped in this area a
lot because it's it's less than wild
wild west now you know rebar says hey if
you follow these rules I'll make things
a lot simpler and that's helped but
we've still got a ways to go yeah i mean
if there was lots o rebuy establishes
some good
inventions that I personally can look
with which is why I'm using it because
I've seen alternative built systems that
sort of encompass the same functionality
as rebar but they make choices that I
haven't been able to live with so rebar
has done that for the build process but
some of the things I Bri by generating
real tool just so not ready for prime
time that it's it's painful like I
really wanted to use the the rebar a
little thing because it generates
allegedly relocatable you know releases
containing your app code plus 0 T V Plus
u dependencies fantastic that's exactly
what I want to be there to put to
prepare a runtime images for deploying
airline systems except that there are so
many constraints on the precise
environment in which you run that
command a new project structure has to
be different to the default thing that
people do when they set up their project
structure that just like I can't use it
yet well you know I think the rebar team
is done a pretty good job of automation
is kind of an ugly process but it's
still in the process for us it's a you
know within a suit at a small enough
size if you willing to make some
compromises a distributed database on a
pass as a compromise is commbuys that
has costs that are higher than the
pro-life
but then as you get bigger even if you
go down to bare metal or zone just like
that you know we sort of get out of the
real idea of what pop has is furling
becomes the ship we rolling but the
current major distribution fighting
against some of the things so it's like
the set 12 packaging a villain
really high apparently it's really high
concurrency high right load you're
paying a price for that for that
distribution so so it's so for us maybe
if we had a different model because
we're doing distribution we're using
some of the things that really gives you
but we're also taxing
as much behaviors of the day the show I
mean we just how do we take full
advantage of her leg and we just had
another conversation about how it
doesn't do the pheasant I put obviously
the whole code loading on the side it's
really cool we got that the hot code
loading is a big selling point right I
mean you know when when I'm talking to
people about our use of Erlang and
they're not familiar with it right maybe
they've seen an articles blog post more
something right and you're like oh
that's that concurrent language you can
you know you can do hot coal loading in
99 s right you know and to come back and
say well no and no right that kind of is
a damper brings downer I don't I don't
think things was as grim is all bad but
I would say that the managing hot
upgrades on any kind of reasonable
complexity of billing system is still at
the you know Spears with stone tips kind
of mimic the stage well I as you point
out it's a very manual process you do
with the shells have you
the structure antalya that doesn't mean
just have a shower of course every
single boat but but but that's the thing
like there's already some tooling around
it but the tooling doesn't seem to work
for for the kinds of apps that we want
to run has environments so like if you
if you're building like software that
comes in a box that is a computer again
telephone switch chasity's or whatever
then this stuff seems to work sensibly
because you do like one hop great every
unit and you prepare it new tested in
advance and it's worth the hassle but if
you want to deploy every time you get
push you can try Trella every time you
get push so we need we need something
else and like we need reabon upgrades so
it's the idea of hot upgrades basis is
great it's really executioner's
absolutely well I can end this whole
stay out demo for it yeah well it feels
like the the tools the underlying tools
just aren't start quite there yet right
you could you could take and building
you know another layer on top like Mike
rebar tries to do that kind of
orchestrates all of this stuff and get
some moving in the same direction but it
still feels kind of kind of clunky I
think maybe it's the underlying tools
mature a bit and then it comes from
people people using it people doing this
and coming back and saying wow this is
really a pain point we have to smooth
that smooth that out
I think that's allowed us to be wanna
anyone for any questions comment they'll
more than a question and we're we're
basically talking about you completely
different things here there's i'll call
it smaller languages I've got a server
and writing a client that it's a server
and we're doing whatever and that's your
classic platform service kind of
scenario and then there's all the stuff
that we we talked about the last two
days we just hey we scale we scale like
mad oh my god check it out on a million
scale thingy whatever which is that work
distributed etc etc and that's a
different type of platform as a service
which I don't you know that we're in
position to know what that means um I
think there are aspects of the o-line
distribution that don't work great in
the cloud right now and some of those
things are things like the way Erlang
distribution protocol works it makes all
kinds of assumptions which on true or
true overly ninety-nine point nine
percent of the time in the cloud and
that's actually one thing where I would
like they're like runtime like Earth's
to be modified so that we can write
Erlang distribution in olin and I don't
think that there are a huge number of
things like Nick V and modifications I
don't think there are a large number of
those necessarily might get possible and
once people can experiment and try
writing their own distribution carriers
actually in billing instead of having to
write at sea driver kidding me my see
cochin FB
to an early memory space just do it once
we can experiment with some of those
kinds of things we can actually like
shave all of these rough edges off to
the point that you do come up with a set
of tools and distribution and the other
things that will let you run more advice
a bit more easily on something like it
has so yeah like I think if you had like
if has is improved to the point you
could run my only distribution right now
you could get to a certain cluster size
with it and it would be mostly reliable
it would be annoying in some cases where
there's like transient network problems
which occur on easy to and pass
providers happens kinda saw really are
the issue with this is and I'm just
thinking of a couple talks that we went
through today now there's the morning
and work you needed a plan anyhow the
point being that the things that you
need to scale and the way to architect
separate scale and the way you set up
your system for the scale is quite
drastically different in any one what
you mean by scale yeah 3 zeros and all
of a sudden architecture goes from this
to that but I guess I mean as it as a
pass vendor if I climb at it through
zeros we would not have a large amount
of money to work on it with right so a
lot of our customers are running apps
that are decently lunch that get
reasonable volumes of traffic but
they're tractable volumes of traffic and
scheduling stuff at this point
I think I mean there really is to kind
of issues here and the first issue isn't
necessarily a past specific issue it's
almost like an IT management issues I
how do we deploy these things easily how
do we manage you know running
applications easily you solve that
problem right then early in a pass
becomes a much more doable thing and
then you start to talk about how can we
take advantage of this real specific
strengths of early in a path setting
this is there any is there any legs or
any framework doesn't when it goes into
a past environment need to make
compromises I don't think so right i
mean yeah some of these some of these
there's some compromises i'm going to
think about stuff that has developed
recently sentences i'm obviously being
think about no two minutes come out
after past I mean there are compromises
that our assumptions there so you don't
have some of the compromises they've
been made some of the things that just
having that accomplish that no because
they're at the priorities are things
that we look at knowing this is crazy I
mean but it's being very that's very
effective and it's being adopted lots of
reasons you know we were benchmarking
positive back pressure so it seems to
been fully adapted to an environment
like this and makes very simple
assumptions about disposal II it's
simpler I mean yeah that there are some
at some actors and some optimizations
that give up when you move to a pass
because in the in the process of making
your life easier we make some choices so
that's why and you talk about a little
bit of rebar we're learning because we
have to go across lots of different
environments we don't we we have to make
risk that we started serve
idealistically with the notion that you
could that the environmental variables X
divided environmental variables that we
face every day are changing faster than
they and they're just continue to
multiply unified openstack we've got all
these different ways to manage not just
deploy the system you know the pass is
almost awesome also often very deploy
centric in the way it frames the
problems but is the operates the
operating environment is the operating
environment also has a series of
important understand compromises they're
not wrong they're just compromise have
created you know persistence to disk for
another thing and it's much easier to
meet order
or a contained in order for to have lots
of different tenants you know you've
made some of these compromises but
simplifying you know the distribution of
erling that works for a five note
cluster on metal might just have to be
different and simple and the choice is
limited and then they and the
distributions of Erlang that work on a
certain class of hasn't sort of sorts of
behaviors might just have to be
different and simple it's like rebar
simplifies and takes away some choices
its opinionated it's not like take away
choices it's like be opinionated in the
way that a really good hardware vendors
is opinionated you don't have 19
different toys you have three choices
and they're the right choices we buy me
a lot of it constraints are liberating
yeah yeah yeah so you know the problem
of that is a paz manner also has to
offer enough options to pull everybody
in the flavors so it's a constant you
know but if the user experience and we
sort of a move between talking about
paths they early in the past and we're
laying on the paths and there's two
different ways to look at it so an
operator who has gets to can be believed
communities there's just you're not
having problem early for the things
you're using the clockwise clusters
right here like Valley for logging stop
you as such a straight for something
right yeah I mean so we we would like to
be able to run it on our own paths do
the networking
the time so we like we're running Erlang
on ec2 which is like somewhere in the
middle of the problems that yep yep and
we've traded things like stable node
identity and custom a vision for the
ability to get machines to come and go
rapidly that's kind of the whole idea of
the right is that any instance is not
guaranteed to be there where every
instance is guaranteed to not be there
sometime when you presented it to ya
know Jackson should actually be a really
good thing for but isn't that go back to
what we thought when we started off when
you talk about back home as a service
potentially there is somebody at some
point at some point down the road
there's a situation where we're not
talking about instances advantage we're
talking about this or lying
infrastructure this relying environment
that's available where you have see
below that entity we have the ability to
use amnesia he's almost like it but
where it works where you can do things
where you get skin benefits that you
take a step back in that one a bunch of
the advantages stuff Erlang for people
in the tasks as Linda scales but what
I've noticed with last couple years it's
getting a lot more people who are using
our language specifically asked single
server and
and that's it they make multiple
instances of single servers of the using
but it's really a single server solution
that's a different solution and yep and
I ok we should move this to the bar but
we should have started this in the bar
don't what this wasn't exactly the betas
are beaten up our life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
