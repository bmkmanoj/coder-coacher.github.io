about my toy project me to the meetup
I'm diwali developing this application
why i am reading program in phoenix so
thanks the outers for the book so what's
this application but i want to collect
some information from the meetup.com api
and why do I want to do that first is
because i really like the the tech
meetups and i often go to the rib meet
up in budapest and second is that i am
the co-founder of the headaches field
meet up in Budapest so I was curious to
know about the people and this is the
mill occasional you can go there and log
in straight away you don't have any
registration right now because I don't
say anything I don't even have a
database you can go there login with
your meetup account and then you will
see Oh your meetup groups and what
information you can get from that right
now I have organizers you can see how
many members of your meetup also
organize another meetup so for my meet
up there elixir in Budapest and 17 oh
and you can also see the other groups
that people are remember so right now
budapest are be the root meetup is the
second place in our knee top and you can
see the topics that people like you can
visit it's wholesaling in rock right now
and so what's next for this application
during my learning I want to use
channels and OTP I didn't arrive there
yet so i'm not using all the cool stuff
if you have like a comet up that's
really big you will probably get a
timeout from my application and
fortunately but i can work on it as soon
as I can
and the other stuff I want to separate
the application and the API client
because maybe you also want to use this
for some other reason and that's it's
all feedbacks are welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
