leaves ah yes yes I'm not quite that
aggressive and what is that I want
that's about learning languages to
expand the way that you think rather
than learning language there's something
that needs work what kind of language is
still in language well we did Ruby io
prologue Scala Haskell closure and early
wow what different time good is actually
in the mindset I think and you had a
talk here what was it about tom was
called snake pit and the idea is that
the industry is at a bad place because
we are based on mutable state right now
and the industry is making a transition
multicore which means all beautiful
states down it's going to break so
everyone knows we need to be on
something else and I talked about how
the languages evolved to the point that
but why should you do is doing like
actors functional programming
one of these one of those right here
well thank you very much for him well
then thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
