to be here it's really so far as being
great so I really hope I can continue
the streak of good talks so I'm for
London well I me tell him but I I work
in a company I web console to see in
London now we mostly build Ruby and
JavaScript publication or at least
that's ninety percent of what we've been
doing so far what I want to talk about
is basically the first Alexa project
that we built internally it's a client
applications and it's running in
production so there are a few lessons
that we learned while doing this and
hopefully I can share some ideas that
may be useful for you if you try to do
the same thing now all introduced to you
is the main problem we had so this
handsome fella here like like the man
not the dog is mark mark is one of my
colleagues he writes this ruby gem
called dragon flight is be maintaining
for a few years a lot of you have Ruby
experience so you may have come across
it or used it iz iraq engine that allows
you to do asset and upload management so
what you do is you plug it in in your
rack application or race application and
it gives you the ability to upload files
and serve them back what makes it
different from other solutions is that
II what you define with those apples so
for example image transformations so you
say you upload a big image and you want
to serve a small thumbnail and it gives
you back a URL that has all the
instructions to do that on the fly so a
request time so the first time you
request an image with a different size
it will be resized and then it's up to
you to catch it and do what you want
with it but essentially what it does is
remove the pre computation of the image
the classical problem is you build a
website two years later
new design comes in or like a new
viewport whatever you want a new device
and then you have to spend like a couple
of days going back and recompute all
possible sizes of uploads that are like
two years old so you saw that problem
just by doing that at last possible
moment now how does it do that so this
is the end part of a URL so we have a
base64 encoded payload in the middle
when you decode this it comes back as a
JSON data structure so essentially an
array of arrays where each operation if
executed like in order creates the image
you need this one for example is fetch
this file from a known data store could
be an s3 bucket could be a point in the
file system whatever you want processes
that make a thumb with this dimensions
and then encode the final result in jpg
now what this means is that to generate
that specific image at that size with
those with that format the only thing
you need is this URL and some minimal
configuration which makes the phone are
pretty portable and a good candidate to
be for example moved out of an existing
trunk common application you can just
have a separate service that does this
now how do we use this and this we get
to the problem where the actual problem
is we had a client call contagious
communications what they do is they sell
the subscription service where you
access marketing content like
essentially marketing insight and
analysis it's a it's essentially a beefy
CMS now we'll be talking about real time
stuff and everything this use case is
far more traditional in the web sense we
are talking about a fairly structured
CMS that has at least a dozen different
image formats and all of them are
executed by dragonfly erequest time all
of their
require some form of interaction with a
imagemagick to create them so things
like this you start with a conversion to
the thumbnail then for example you you
cut out a triangular transparent
triangle or for example you just resize
it to a different one it's nothing
particularly complicated conceptually
but it comes with a price in the sense
that you at least in this implementation
you shell out perform a transformation
if it's a complicated one or if it's a
chain of transformations you end up
writing to disk and then you get back
the result so what does this mean it
means that you have this is just like an
hour of activity on the version we had a
reversion we had oh you have like spikes
depending of different factors like
latency you fetch a big image from s3 it
just takes a while you perform a
complicated transformation if you run as
we we do on roku diners are not
particularly fast at performance so if
you write to disk that may take some
time so if you look at the left hand
side we are talking about like huge
spikes and news differences at least in
percentage terms between fast responses
and very slow ones and also we had a
problem of not having that many
concurrent requests at a time now the
load for this application is not huge we
usually handle like at peak times 150
160 requests per minute so in terms of
alessia ellen world this is basically
nothing but in terms of Ruby world it
becomes a significant number to the
point that we were running an
application on three diners which is
like trees more servers for anyone who
is not familiar with Roku in itself all
of that with some time our scenarios
because we are very much net will depend
honest three and four sometimes
transformations don't work properly if
the image is corrupt or many other
reasons lastly because we are right in
the disk and this is where we spend like
a couple of days trying to figure it out
that we just didn't figure out why we
were linked in memory and temporary
files just everywhere so in terms of
usage memory usage would just like
constantly grow until a rocker decides
to reboot the Dino which it does like
pretty much once a day and then user
you're safe again so thanks to actually
crashing the diner we could survive not
an ideal scenario so provide extra bit
of money inside you just that the
latency so how could we improve this the
biggest point is that we thought about
rewriting and streamlining the whole
thing now we are still not talking about
a specific technology to do this and I
think like I feel like I need to make
this point because we are very much
focused here to talking about Alesia
airline and coming from like aerobic
company it's it's very easy to like get
Ruby and basically butcher it in terms
of performance however most of the
slowness of this application came from
the design of its component so we
decided what if we had an ad hoc
implementation just for this use case
and like let's try to remove the
bottlenecks first one is instead of
fetching from history and doing the
whole end shake every time we because
images were public let's fetch from to
http from cloud front in front of a
bucket much faster anyway because the
caching layer provided by called for and
just makes fetching faster so we remove
that at least some of the latency and
what if we could get the data stream it
transform it get it back and serve it to
the client without ever write in the
disk we just keep it in memory and that
way we ideally remove two problems one
is the slowness of
disk and the second is we don't create
temp file basically so we just we may
accidentally remove the problem of those
memory leaks in addition if we write in
from scratch we can decide to cash a
different layers like if you have 12
images generated by the single source
image you just fetch it once and then
compute all the other ones based on a
local cache or maybe a separate cache
server like that depends on the
infrastructure so we definitely had some
other options but we also had like very
strong constraints now first one is it
has to run on a Roku for those who are
not familiar with a Roku as an
infrastructure you have basically
workers where you deploy your
application too but that's the end early
you are not real service for you you
have no way to target them directly to
ssh you don't control the machines and
the file system is basically a female
you can go away there in time so you
cannot use them to store data in
addition your work is a completely
independent so they don't share memory
so you don't you cannot store things in
memory so essentially we have we had
like infrastructure and this is because
just for a very simple reason we are an
agency we don't do twenty four seven
support for example and our client is
perfectly happy with running on Heroku
for so many reasons including the fact
that they don't have a sysadmin so this
is fairly peculiar I think unusual
unusual if we talk about along at elixir
because all of these shines a lot if you
have dedicated hardware or at least
basically either blessed or any way any
kind of server that you can access to
pretty we also wanted to try to keep
compatibility with existing tools that
we use simple because it's part of it is
convenience part of it is a sort of an
experiment to see how far we can get to
without changing too much and finally
probably the most important one I
probably should put the top we didn't
want to change any of the existing URLs
this has this has to be a drop-in
replacement that works better but as
supports exact
same thing now Alexa fits this design
like the most important point is that
this hasn't happened the other way
around like we didn't try to find a way
to design the software that would fit
elixir as a platform rather we started
from a specific need and then decided
out of a small investigation and a bit
of a leap of faith that Alexei would be
a good fit so we could have written the
same thing where Ruby and we haven't
done that so I'd like to be able to but
I can't really prove that this is
inherently faster in terms of a domain
like domain problems or transforming
image then a ruby implementation so this
is important because and despite the
basic point out if you have to like
think about one thing after leaving this
talk performance especially when you
start from a platform like Ruby can be
very easy to just like we just miss it
completely like measuring things is a
bit more complicated so you have to
think about what would be the trade-off
and if you make sense to switch language
or together or if you make sense to stay
we're looking at least for a bit longer
so you fast-forward six months so six
months means we spend like a wig like
three weeks on the first part of writing
this project then a few half days and
days over the course of six months to
get it to production and now it's
abduction and it's working so that's I
think a good result I would say like
there was no guarantee for that it's
working really good and what I like to
go a bit more into detail now is what
are the things about elixir about it
along the end that made it a good fit
for this now it's really good that I'm
talking this afternoon because some of
the people before me have already
highlighted some of the features of the
nvm so I won't repeat what they say but
a as a general rule if you keep in mind
especially what has been said by Sasha
this morning about basically the runtime
and supervisors and things like that
this should be helpful to follow along
now let's stop by one specific part
which is how do I get that data
structure and execute essentially and
transform whatever in a way that it
makes sense it generates the result now
if you think about like how many people
actually wrote elixir code like and got
the idea of pattern matching a recursion
or do we need to like go into more
detail to that is that fine okay so this
is a list of lists basically so once you
generate once you think once you start
analyzing it you can just like basically
process it one by one and recurse and
get to the get to the end of it and the
good thing is that we pattern matching
expressing this becomes very easy so if
we find enough you just fetch if you
find a p you know it's a processing
operation and the second argument thumb
it's just a bit more sugar around the
convert operation which is a low-level
instruction basically a command-line
instruction do you give to imagemagick
so all of this can be configured
original dragonfly so this adapter needs
to support them now what you can do and
this is just one of the possible ways to
solve this is you match on the thumb and
then decide what do I do with this this
is just a convert in these guys so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to make it
a convert I'm going to change those
dimensions into a format is compatible
for imagemagick and just pass it with a
default image format and put it back
where I found it so in the same list
that I still have to process so at a top
of the tail so that way this sum will be
processed as a normal
convert operation now it's you could
have done it differently we could have
implemented thumb as a form of this so
decide to feel the destruct with all the
steps of the transformation straight
away from this but a nice way at least
the way I see it about this solution is
that you don't have ambiguity like a
conversion is always a single entry
point yours steps struct always gets
filled from a single point in your code
everything else if it's if at thumb is a
formal conversion you can express that
clearly in the method the intent I think
it's pretty clear you you pass from a
thumb to a convert so your code is
instantly clear if you read it and it
shows you exactly what you the actual
thing is which is also a good thing when
you get to the final result of this now
this is more generic thing about
functional programming itself but the
way the logic ends up being model is
that there's a clear separation between
the data and the structs you carry a
cross between the different stages of
your program and the logic that executes
them because this is what you what in
terms of application this application
that's what it needs to know about a job
to execute it there's no behavior
attached to this data structure there
are clear keys that indicate what this
job is you as a human can inspected and
understand exactly what it does if you
want to have a debug endpoint to see
this information you can mount it pretty
easily but essentially in even in terms
of testing and doing like proper
integration testing of this application
you can just say given this data
structure to represent the job do I get
the right image back and this is
incredibly useful when you want to unit
test that everything is wired up
correctly because it just makes it easy
to reason about it compared to the Ruby
code this
much less ceremony in the execution is
just data that flows to a function and
gives you back an image and because
that's simple enough then you can think
about your pipeline of work and isolate
it and put it into a process into a
worker like every transformation is
taken care of by a separate work there's
complete separation between the
application in terms of web stack that
gets the request endpoint that as soon
as you get the base 64 payload you pass
it to a worker and at that point the
worker is going to take care of it
completely in parallel and inside the
worker the worker will dispatch
different well some different messages
to different processes to compose this
data so it will talk to a HTTP fetcher
process that gets the data then it will
talk to another process that passes is
to imagemagick and gets the data back
and then all of this will be sent back
to the client and back to the actual web
layer and soccer so instead of having
top-down logic which it was the ruby
implementation you have separate
discrete processes separate entities in
your actors in your application that all
run at the same time and what you can do
you can reason about them in a simpler
way because when you talk about a
transformation a transformation is just
an isolated workers so you can handle it
separately you can treat it as a single
thing you can test it independently your
web layer doesn't need to be concerned
about that it's not just a matter of
separation or concern but even in terms
of resources you're a sleepy layer that
is waiting for requests to come in
doesn't have it's never going to be
blocked by what happens at a
transformational level because they're
running completely separate pipelines
and how does this work or other this
look from the point of view so this is
just a screenshot which I'm
I hope it's barely readable at least
from the bottom I but it's I can show it
to you later on like live in a machine
if you're interested about this morning
like sorry I talked about supervisors
and that ideas come up in a few
different talks today now if you haven't
tried before along vm and leased a ship
with a graphical environment which is
the observer the observer allows you to
run and target in your machine or like
another node and see your application as
you runs which means that all of those
processes can be represented into a tree
and this tree is in spectable at runtime
so you run your application you let it
run and see what happens which also
means that if you want a reason about
code you can actually look at it and see
that things are running the way you
expect them now this list on the left
each line is one of the discrete
components that runs inside the
application basically all of the
applications that compose yours most of
them are dependencies like they should
be layer like the process that manages
the connection with imagemagick like all
of this then does your domain lodges so
this application and the way you can
implement this is one possible ways that
you have different supervisors for each
part of your application and each one of
them for example the bottom one is the
one that supervises the jobs as they are
executed and it supervises a pool and
this is a pool with ten workers each one
of them is ready to be checked out
execute a transformation and put back in
the pool what does this mean what this
means is that anything that happens
during transformation if it happens to
fail or break it will go as far as the
supervisor and the supervisor will block
the failure there and we'll catch the
failure and decide what to do next
what could go wrong and this is where
there was a again it was mentioned this
morning about what does it mean like
failing fast or letting in crash in my
specific case he meant that if you have
an archive with like 20 thousand images
and five or ten of them happen to be
corrupted because maybe they've uploaded
brown ones maybe they upload if you
upload a 5-megawatt image every once in
a while it just goes wrong so how what
do you do at that point you fetch the
image you try to transform it
imagemagick fails now from up in our
case like it didn't make sense or in
general like to predict that is
basically unpredictable we didn't know
up front what were the images that could
cause their failure because some of them
date back to an archive that was being
that had been imported ages ago so when
a transformation fails because of that
we clearly have no code at the worker
level that cares about that the worker
just crashes the crash get caught by the
supervisor we get a stack trace about
that in the logs and then we're going to
see what image costs that and basically
tell the people who manage content like
swap that image for something that works
but a good thing about it is that the
logic in the application doesn't have
any mention of that problem that's a
problem that it's just very difficult to
predict because of its nature and we
just have like the Golden Path
implemented so it works nice ninety-nine
point whatever percent of the times and
we just write code for that which means
that we can get to a good representation
of how the domain should work without
being too defensive about what could go
wrong and this is good because it makes
it easy to reason about it and same
thing goes for all the other parts of
the infrastructure it's like that for
the caching layer for example but it can
be the same for the HTTP fashion layer
because
htp like yeah we are fetching from cloud
front so technically should always be up
but how do you know that that's going to
happen we do it just a bit of a rambling
but barely enough so that we get good
error report when things go wrong and
the result of this is that we have a
much better performance graph now we are
not biking at least not not often to
more than a minute at least for the
average the total size of the
application is a thousand lines of code
including tests which is very manageable
for something that has been written from
scratch and then solves this problem and
this is where we get real benefits from
the as well from the llvm on a single
Dino we get twice as much capacity as
three diners before in the Robo
implementation and this is because we
just set it up to handle a hundred
concurrent connections that most which
we haven't even reached yet so right now
we are running the application with a
configuration is far lower than what it
could handle on very cheap hardware
simple because we don't need to push it
more than that the moma uses your stable
it's basically starts pretty slow 30
megabytes then it gets to 160 a full
capacity but it stays there rock solid
so it's very good because it makes it
easy to predict how much you need to add
if you want to scare more one of the
reasons why we're using workers for
example is that we kind of have an idea
of how many processes and how much we
can add if we need to add more capacity
so it's just a better design and that's
enabled by the fact that the platform
allows you to think about things in
way but obviously you get to pain points
because it's very difficult for a
project s to be completely painless part
of these pain points are related to
ourselves as a company the experience
the fact that is the first airline /
elixir project part of it is the nature
of the problem and the domain and the
constraints so as anyone from a Roku at
this conference okay no I was at I just
I asked because I I'm actually wondering
if there's a way to improve this
situation like I don't I don't wanna say
anything so that's so personally I don't
have a problem with Eric on itself
because it solves a lot of my problems
which is I really like my weekends to be
just weakens and sleep at night so
that's a good thing so to do that
someone else has to manage the
infrastructure so we just work with us
that but it comes with a price we say
before they you don't have ssh access by
extension you cannot use any of the
existing as far as I could figure out
and please prove me wrong if you know
anything different but you can use any
of the existing tools provided by dl on
vm to profile a running application you
cannot attach a concert to it for
example and you cannot run remote code
to it so for example i cannot run an
observer on a different machine to see
what's happening on my writing cluster
because i can simply cannot target them
target them by IP address or anything
like that they are behind the proxy they
don't even expose a tcp connection of
any sort unless you ask it so it's very
difficult for that too to do and
resources are constrained we are
processing images with imagemagick so we
could just like you can't get out the
cpu and they proceeded at least the
search for Misha layer could be faster
and if we could have a dedicated
infrastructure you wouldn't even cash on
me
external you just keep it in memory on
the machine and finally we have a custom
wheel pack which is a way for to deploy
on on Heroku there's no Stan Earl and
release effectively some of the
toolchain had to be a big custom and
like someone else before me did most of
the job I just had to make a few changes
to existing bill packs but that means
that you lose the ability to tap into
certain cases to tap into existing
airline knowledge which is a bit of a
shame because some of the problems have
been sorted out for years at the same
time the libraries and develop a tool
chain in this specific case it would
sometimes it was a bit of a nightmare in
the sense that when it comes to
especially like what Francesca was
talking about before like profiling your
application and evelyn's all of that
kind of nice things that you really want
to have on a running application that
was a bit frustrating because if you run
Ruby usually use something like New
Relic to profile it but the early client
that you can use with our long is a
reverse engineer of a Python version
that has to be plugged in manually like
it's it's a bit of a it's a bit of a
hack so we try to use it but it's a mean
it kind of works but not that much so
there's a bit of a problem and this goes
into the familiarity of the tools that
if you have other 15 developers you you
want to try to keep it a bit familiar at
least for them because otherwise the
transition becomes too painful and when
you're using logs to catch exceptions
like send me an email if you see this in
the logs which is not ideal it's ok but
sometimes if it's an unpredictable error
if you haven't known if you haven't seen
it before you may forgot you may forget
to add and clothes for that finally and
this is more about the elixir consistent
some of the like for example like
memcache
there's one library there's also another
lung library to use it but none of the
existing libraries support for example
memcache authentication so we had to add
that on top of it and some of them are
not particularly robust if memcache goes
down you kind of have to end all of that
on your own which means that we wrote it
like code to handle these problems which
could be baked in into existing
libraries so there's a there's a lot of
opportunities in this like I think like
that's the thing that I I'd like to take
away from this light is that there's
opportunity to improve all of this
whether it's using like or training
about different tools and they're like
the solutions that Francesca mentioned
are a good like definitely a good way to
go but also something that could be more
specific to smaller use cases or
integrating with different platforms
like Erica so there's definitely a lot
of opportunity from that point of view
the learning curve for working with and
when I started this project I had like a
good ear of free time development with
licks a pet projects whatever you wanna
you want to call them basically no
production code which means that I
thought I knew what I was doing but
that's not always true the problem is if
you have a company that basically it's a
company that leaves without the Oriental
languages the transition to a language
that is functional even if not
completely it's difficult because the
ideas are slow to sink in it may be just
peculiar from what I work but I think
it's a general thing about especially if
you come from the Ruby community which
tends to be opinionated and in some
extent
stand really like their object with
different flavor than Java but they
really like their objects it's difficult
to make the transition had a match is an
incredibly powerful tool but if you mix
you a recursion it's difficult for
people to embrace able quickly and use
it to do control flow because and this
is also because energy provided other
ways to do that kind of thing why would
you use recursion if you can map over a
collection for example like it's
difficult to decide when one is a good
pattern 01 isn't that it's very easy to
write code in a lick see that
deceptively looks like Ruby despite the
fact the semantics are completely
different so sometimes there have been
moments where I you just have to go
through things step by step and progress
may be a reason really slow and finally
you get to OTP which is powerful but
again difficult to grasp as an idea if
you come from Ruby in JavaScript you
have no idea what basically truly
concurrent actors are maybe you try to
use different Ruby libraries to have
that kind of feel but the reality is
it's a completely different way to think
about it and ODP and Jen servers are you
just have to build that knowledge and
there's a surprising different between
is more OTP engine server example that
you write and you think you got it and
running the whole thing into production
things like how do i track a memory leak
for example like this application had to
deal with binaries big banners which if
you usual and you may end up seeing how
they are the end or why are the staining
memory how come they they are not
garbage collected why is my memory usage
spiking so much luckily there's
literature about that buddy
it just opens a whole set of problems
that you haven't seen before so and it
will be obvious and apply to any other
language but the point is it does come
with a with a price but it's a good
price I think to pay and I think ideally
what you want to do is isolate a good
use case if you are thinking about and
if you had the same problem that I did
which is like how do I make this happen
how do I build the first thing in the in
the company that is not written me in
Ruby finding a good use case is not the
difficult but the important thing is
that I think you start from requirements
more than the tool I would have wanted
to do this like ages before on so many
other projects but I never found a good
cook a really really good fit and
finally this chance happens so the main
problem is the most important thing and
then if it's a good fit for a lick ship
like go for it even if it looks risky
hopefully you will be able to convince
your boss or client or decision maker
anyone you need to but I think and we
have an opportunity with a with the tool
chain to make it more approachable for
beginners things like a quick check that
was a really good example before it just
makes it very approachable and then
property based testing is it's a fairly
new idea that you don't at least 40 be
program and things like that lowering
the barrier of entry is useful because
that way you can get more people on
board when it makes sense so it's a quiz
about the code and I really encourage
you to opening then I don't know open
issues comment on the code being like
being the first project you will find
especially if you know what you're doing
you will find things to tell me about
hopefully positive criticism
do because it's important that at least
for me to have a better understanding of
how things can be improved but yeah so
that's it that thank you for listening
if you have any questions be happy to
as one
yeah I think so like there's a even just
being able to run the observer against
your running instance for example it
would have been it would have been a
maid for example tracking down that
binary memory leak much easier there are
good tools there's a good book by I
forgot his name basically the one of the
local developers ironically that runs
erlangen production is called buco
erlangen anger it's got very good like
basically techniques that you can use to
the back production and all these types
of problems and hold them assume that at
least you can open a new line console to
your running costs just doing that would
have been great you could have seen like
oh this is the process that is holding a
reference to that memory so that would
have been I would say the biggest
difference in terms of monitoring
general usage and think so that you can
end up like using the brat on top and
then your log files at least I the
general profiling of the dyno as a
machine gives you enough information to
have a roughly good idea but it's when
things get like the nitty gritty details
of why for example you have a bottleneck
that's at least for me that was very
difficult to the back so i would say
that dedicating force action would have
probably made it isn't the respect with
the price that you have to manage on
your own
yeah yeah that's but basically you need
to decorate your function to tell them
like oh this is the things that I want
to measure and it becomes it's good
because you're having like good my final
level detail but it's it's also like
more work compared to when you have to
explain that to for example like my crew
developer who sometimes used to like
drop in a jam and then boom profiling
just works you don't have to worry about
anything else so that becomes just a
matter of understanding and this work to
do and there's a cost associated to it
but it's it's a good thing to do when
it's definitely needed oh sorry J my
appointed to this gentleman
well theoretically yes you could do that
like you can you can basically like run
out of memory if you perform like
particularly complicated transformation
in practice he has happened in the sense
that transformations are known up front
there's a limit on the size of the files
now that can be uploaded and II the line
runs on 512 megabytes which means that
it can spike to like to 300 for the
summation but I haven't seen anything
bigger than that you would definitely
have to do like a better job around
there like in an ideal world I'd like
not to shell out and do that there are
other approaches that you could think
about like but far most of them are much
more complicated than this like you
could use like lib imagemagick and like
embedded into your night we go into a
territory where basically you would
embed like sickle in your right hand
which is comes with a whole set of other
problems and risks that at the time they
seemed far greater than a sporadic
possible memory spike that we didn't
know anything about
people are interested when they sit
beside you the tricky thing is always
get them to sit beside you because
everyone is on a project like there's so
many like it's difficult to get to get
traction internally I think that's a
general problem when you're a highly
specialized company because the comfort
of what you know is a very powerful
force even when people are extremely
curious about the technology they asked
all of them they asked a lot of
questions they were interested the way
like there was a lot of interest but
there's a always a gap when it comes to
actually writing production code symbol
because it's it's risky and like people
sometimes have also different priorities
like they show up at work and they do
the job and they they go back to the
family they are happy about it like that
it's just like it really it really
becomes a people problem more than
anything else like the college is
basically irrelevant at that point you
could have done this in Ingo for example
and it would have read like the exactly
the same problem from that point of view
