day in 30 second car workshop first
speaker this morning is talkin Hoffman
out solutions to this step thank you so
I fallen in the percent of a lot of
functional programmers I would explain
how I got into a line first first touch
government was back in the late 90s I
was still in academia at that point I
had a look at a girl and I said this
will never work it's got no typing
system because I came out of the ML
school so no types cannot work and then
I was using concurrently know some of my
research at that point and then this
linear line thing came along and it did
asynchronous message passing that can
possibly not work and you can really
work that in one of my both blog post
how I was utterly wrong and people that
jump in to earn these days will some of
them take the same wrong decisions
hopefully they're more informed than I
was at that point to take those wrong
decisions but you never know anyway so
after a few years I was sitting in a
middle management position in motorola
and there was a list of long list of
proposals to do some research together
with universities back in the time when
motorola had money so there are some hot
laps and there was a weird guy doing
something with her life and I just said
my big fat thing on that one
then four years later the results came
back and that point I've been doing
people management I can process
improvement technology stopping all the
kind of things that makes a good healthy
upward trajectory career and i'll just
have to do something else so I jumped on
the Erlend bandwagon and said airline it
has some potential to solve one of our
big business problems at that point so i
circumvented which is career advice
don't serve meant all the middle
managers and go straight to the vice
president in contact so on too many
years there / went straight to the vice
president that we are going to do this
we're going to use the order to solve
your big business problem we've talked
about and you said farewell we had some
debates back and forth and after body
said no no somebody else is doing this
but you guys you go up and talk to the
beat senior system architects and you
find something to do we went down then
we did something with Arlen we created a
product from scratch I gave up all many
rural roads and had the most fun and the
most learning experience in my life also
the most
work ever we created a product based on
learning from this match and actually
shipped it to customers at the end and
then baba rest is history I'm CJ own
solutions we're here and I'm here to
talk to you about the golden trinity of
airline pitting on the other priests to
speak about this and while I'm doing
this talk this of course are going to
introduce you to the golden trinity of
our because this is the important thing
to understand about early so I'm
condensing everything that Simon and
Francesca is combined effect books about
and turning it into a 20-minute rent
yeah and then I want to show the
business value of these simple things
and how that accident makes you money
and then of course being a nun and
priest I need to spread the ER involved
in any occasion so be aware there will
be a lot of protein bar that is talking
so just to say a little bit of our own
City solutions we have a lot of
customers normally the number of reason
forever in fact there are 19 billion on
this American and million millions
millions of reasons to use early that's
what's up that's early combined with
good engineers and some other cook
technology choices that makes you a lot
of money so that these days that ends or
discussion and why you select until you
start talking to me the managers will
defend that java java armies to death
and we also have a lot of University
Relations where we actively involved in
a lot of research and we continue to do
that so then in order to understand the
golden springs are goin i'm going to
take you through a little bit of running
history because early is different from
all most other languages because ehrin
originated in a company trying to make
money and not aricent that's a wonderful
we Erickson of them what they wanted
once they want a short time to market at
the time the division to doing these pre
studies that turned into our length they
had turnaround times of like three years
from when somebody got an idea or cost
of my boys something to do that
something in the field even longer
sometimes they also wounded on the fly
operates because they had some very
nasty customers who had that idea that
when I mean if if the telecom system you
deliver to me if it's not running i'm
not going to pay you anything that
business model also see that today when
the people companies like browser eyes
they're giving out they're not giving
out there selling the Indians to
airplanes if that engine is not running
waters rise is not getting paid it sort
of makes people slightly committed to
what they deliver the Erickson has the
same issue with the telecom stuff and
then they wanted quality and reliability
because after all this is this is this
is Terrell is communication this is
somebody's little mobile phone that
needs to be able to call this
presentation today something like that
very very and then some other stuff and
but in fact what they wanted was
productivity and you can also translate
on the fireplace too no downtime that's
what say yeah and then they wanted
something that always works these just
translating slides from the more
technical things into more businesslike
things then I don't know what it was but
all the managers and Eric's and they've
been gone in the seventies and then
probably isn't a little bit too much to
other but but they really really want it
was money money money it's a rich man's
wealth and well then I'll make sure that
it comes in all of these things and that
the history behind this is described in
polytech as decent eight pieces and if
you go and read that that's a marble
piece about technology management it's
very well read or listen to
now I mean this I have a thing about
simplicity so I have this from whore
that the minute the tool you're using
becomes part of the problem something is
wrong the basic tool you're using to
create what you're doing should be
simple this is an insider revealed in 81
yes the chewing award never let things
like C++ and other hitter swings they
are not of the problem they should not
be that so that'll things yet another
line actually I saw the note that I come
in sure why that is there then learning
is good for more than silicon because
otherwise we wouldn't be having store
too so if you have something we have
local agency of approval then learning
is your friend also if you have
something that's stapled so you have
things like session when you keep data
around like when you have a phone call
as a telephone central or you have an
exchange of messages in
system then if you don't have stayed you
might consider doing other things that
other see I'm not over religious about
things despite being running priest you
have to know when to pick the right
tools if you have something that's
massively concurrently talk what sir
they have so many things going on at the
same time you need something that's
dedicated not necessary because early as
distribution in so you can buy off
different things but because it's very
good for doing protocols coming up with
the telecom today then if you need
something that's fault tolerant most
people wanted these days these days they
want to because we're compliant and
something where it's complicated enough
for you to use your OTP library inside
learning and if you need non-stop
operation then run like us also your
friend and then one of the things here
because you see a lot of benchmarks out
there and this is one of our consultants
who's working in danish company of my
baby it's montagnes company is
discovering after a while is that when
you put things on the load earning
performs as well as all the other
languages normal need better because it
deals with being pushed a lot better
than other languages good then the court
entreated your own now if you have
iphone to think you should be taking
pictures read it and everything urn has
three pillars that put together is the
Marvel of the engineering that goes into
running this is the important point you
have share nothing which a lot of people
these days i've come to realize share
nothing is good they have failed fast
something that hardware people have
known for years and then they've added
failure handling these three things when
you leave them in together the way it's
done interact it's beautiful it works
I'll take you through each of them just
to share not to share so doing the
regular stuff in NH c c++ whatever
setting you share some memory when one
process dies well the memory is
corrupted the only same thing to do is
to kill the other process this is how
much related their mission-critical
systems that meant when somebody was
goofing off and making something go down
the entire Sun Control is a telephone
switch ed system had to be taken down
that races announced because you had
standby things so it takes a while to
get that up but it raises an arm and
that means that goes through a chain of
events and after a few things somebody
in the States will be calling the
management denmark in the middle of the
night screaming that he needs to have
somebody on site immediately which is
not what you want to do other companies
would have similar stories about these
things so what are you doing our line is
you don't share any memory so when p1
here dies that memory is corrupt and
then you just wait for the garbage
collectors come around and reclaim that
memory p 2 is unaffected by it this is
the benefit of share nothing lots of
other people are realizing this these
days and trying to get
this week that was absolutely but then
you share the same my address space I
mean that in the same process same yoke
process this in the same units from
cirrhosis but in such that they are all
separate but you see you're assuming
that certain corruptions don't happen
like ever the entire line process
doesn't override something yeah yeah
well that's where the last 20 years of
development of the runtime system goes
to prove that that just doesn't happen
yeah you're right it's in the same
unique space but none of this is yet
none of the processes which the building
blocks of our church share things so
what your true so in very grave events
you can add things taking things all the
way down for that is rare you're sending
a very reliable memory management yes a
garbage man 3
let's get some come their language
memory cites the individual program the
individual programs everything was Jack
yes you come the wild right you can't go
on faithful with somebody else's memory
even I'd say yes so that's that's a good
thing a very good thing it helps you
avoid about a problem then again then
failures and this is where again
learning is different from other
languages is that all the films that can
go wrong will go wrong we all know that
if you more than 27 you know that
everything will go wrong then you have
programming errors that you realize
after your 30 that you can actually make
arrows yourself by your programming then
you kept this affair this will happen
this will kill you and network failures
even more so those things are just
unreliable so no other languages they're
full intolerant they don't really cope
with force that means that you must deal
with all the arrows or die it's a very
match your world either you deal with it
all or you die running on the other hand
is folks are owned by the side that
means that you'll embrace errors and you
manage them meaning and you can continue
to them now showing piece of code here
of that run so this is the naive and not
that it's a way of doing is is here we
have a converter between weekdays and
the number of the day in that we and
here you have a catch all that the end
and say error unknown day somebody gave
me something wrong this is not the one
way of doing it you're just propagating
that error outside if somebody is stupid
enough to call this function with
something that's not something he should
be penalized and licked immediately so
what are you doing airline is you earn
that code and then you get this fail
fast function and that has the benefit
when you do
assistant Lee throughout your code base
when you have something that fails the
stack trace leads you to the in no
time static target fire department
sometimes satori true too then again
this is a simple one way of course a
static type system would have helped me
quite a lot it works with more involved
stuff when you do something with
protocols and have interactions and then
you and for some reason in open at the
start state you didn't a division then
this one is what station are but then
you need to Pendle tights yes but but
you see I still have my hair reason for
them I don't know I don't do dependent
sighs and I don't do see program those
are the two things that keeps my hair in
my head but the I have a trick
and I have an Edwin so anyway and one of
the things is we have the system we did
this and what we want to do these iop
test with our competitors and we are two
guys sitting there doing everything
coding system testing everything and
this they had an army of people that to
system test us that's seven engineers
and Senate architects on this thing all
sitting outside the room waiting for
things to happen then our system goes
down we have a look at our run and
competitive excuse so you just okay wait
a minute ok coo coo 20 minutes late
let's see new version works then the
funny part is five minutes later their
system precious i could see that in my
system and they were just is not working
yeah then i just ran over i had my stack
trace what went wrong we know to that
screen on that d parking system that
I've never seen before and then write
down the picture that's a copy there
like
that's about they had to call the
engineers in okay he had that minute
gaps that's the bucket and then they had
to go and fix it and took to 24 hours
there you go let it fail and again that
means the rowing actually crunches I
don't know what the right word for it is
I like offensive programming as opposed
to being defensive about things we're
being offensive you go for lid for the
the golden days in area all the time and
you worry about the aerosol motherly
offensive the best form of Boston yeah
so anyway so what would this be without
having some numbers try to show that's
money in it so this study that was done
with motorola there you have he an
existing component called date ability
that has been rewritten in your way so
here you see code that solves the
problem this is the app code in this
graph that's what solves the problem of
the custom this is what you're making
ammonium so antsy you have a staggering
eighteen eighteen percent of your
co-pays is devoted to solving the
problem and the needs of the customer
and when you look at the library's it
goes even more berserk then the other
line depending on what version you look
at it i end up with over sixty percent
of the code they're bolted to solving
the needs of the customer this is money
in the bank this is fewer lines of code
you need fewer developers which comes
back to the saying of the other
community
don't tell the manager of 10 that
airline is 10 times it effective don't
tell them anything that interferes girl
but here we have only been three times
more effective more more bang for the
buck then that's all now we allow
yourself to let it fail very fast so how
did it do that so that's failure hanting
and this is why you the supervision
hierarchy you knowing kicks in so here
you have a number of supervisors those
are the ones with two double circles and
they're monitoring either supervisors or
workers with our single circles here
that means that if this poor guy down
here dies it's the supervisor here it
deals with that Aaron takes appropriate
decisions about what to do this guy over
here it's not affected whatsoever by
this and this is how you feel reliable
system so knowing you embrace the
failures you deal with them and if you
can't deal with it be propagated up and
then you can make more elaborate
supervision and monitoring schemes
depending on the knees or your
particular problem now this this is
where some of the business benefits
comes from this wheeling in of having
failed fast with supervision so the
business benefits here are you only have
one processor thighs when something goes
wrong this is really important and that
means that this isolation gives you
continued service all the other guys is
still running which depending on your
business could be very important then
everything is a lot in a sensible way
and that means whenever something goes
wrong you know exactly what it is you
have all the information in it's not
like you need to do a CSI Miami and you
need to hire expensive policemen of
access to come in
investigation system don't you know
what's wrong and that means in business
terms the colon cases can be fixed at
leisure you the product owner stays in
charge because you decide when to fix
those things failing in the leaves of
your supervision tree and I'll speed it
up now is good and that means that we
exit here have software architecture the
supports intuitive development and they
take you to the right risk management or
winter fitting thing so if you want to
cruise with Erlang you understand the
failure model golden Trinity you're
rolling be spreaded yeah you embrace
failure which is something that a lot of
people have a very long time doing but
that's what you need to do and then you
use the different patterns with
supervision to use to deliver business
value and make sure you're not chasing
every little part because we take down
your system and that means you stay in
charge and you continue to make money
