in development early that's miniclip
basically I lead a team of engineers
that developed a nice game server site
and I'm gonna I'm gonna game developer
for five years I've worked on a bit of
everything when I'm working with Erlang
and go and you guys just gave a great
presentation on the game server platform
you've been working on if you want to
talk to you about that platform and
about what you covered in this education
okay actually
president Erickson can dig into
Michelle's if needed
basically we presented to the mayor so
platform that is the game is perfect -
for internal use that's allowed to
develop games just focus on the on the
specific of each game so it will it
provides a set of features that enable
to to deliver quickly a new game yeah we
both managed to be extensible so that we
can quickly start develop deploy and
monitor any game that we need to launch
only focusing on the domain logic of the
game in particular and not having to
deal with almost the boilerplate tunic
we generally need to do for each game of
your lunch it sounds like I mean that's
pretty interesting work that seems to be
an emerging area in
now where you're laying has been used to
do some of that southern path but it
simply happening much more frequent yeah
we from the from the beginning of the
mobile of mobile studio at Lisbon we the
decision was was to use a link just
because the scalability and
fault-tolerance these are instinctive
airline provides and yeah we keep
believing in handling as a programming
language in modern desert in an
environment to run our our the big
clusters so yeah basically we believe
that we are in the right and as the the
game industry itself is pretty young
industry also is considered somewhere as
it's maturing companies are gravitating
to to matter solution - through that
filter game developers so as they're
starting to figure it out and they look
at Erlang and it's already proven to be
a great platform for distributing system
they can start to use it but they what
they need from that and the rest of the
technology to make better service okay
yeah I think I think some of the you
know the power and the concurrency and
the speed you get through language we
evolved period to that industry I
wouldn't say that the BBS is the speed
of development yet for sure thing the
the performance that's why we built also
a massive because we can integrate the
parts that are not n like like C++
engine and then we use l enfant what's
the most useful that's killing us
scaling down allowed to have concurrent
and use massive course so that that's
what we gain from there so basically
that's why we built the mayor's platform
we began the advantage of the best of
both long were you guys into that
process rate sounds like the air they're
getting pretty material USP about
pedaling or about the platform are you
asking about the platform and we need
you like the grape is given to the
miraculous
yeah we already have it in intersection
but we have we are doing like one year
of development of my answer that it's
not yet deployed in the big title that
we have five titles that are not so big
that as others that we have but yeah it
is production ready for short because we
had it in production
what are your plans for what you've done
in terms of high you thinking you needed
enter me like a disinhibitor
superior why are there any aspect of it
to be open sourced rasoolullah
for now we are not considering to to
open source or routing at external to
the available other game developers at
least use it freely really not in the
sense of money that use it by itself
but I don't know what is what will be
from now on the business models but for
now we need first to prove in general in
our games that is the right path for all
types of games that we develop and then
we don't know we don't know what will be
the business model in the future yeah I
mean it's an interesting certainly just
a lesson to learn in the course we're
rolling out this platform to watch the
game isn't mature now it's great
ok well is there anything else that you
would want to share with folks just
making the experience of a dream I would
like to get back to the complimentary a
couple - yes I think if you watch our
our our presentations or you'll see that
what we are dealing with if you're
interested in Erlang and what you aim
for hiring overcome and how's their
competency so far
really cool interesting thought and now
we don't have the pressure where to
present so we will be more alike at
Eppley I myself I will be more electable
I will enjoy for shorter because they
were thank you take the time to demand
action man again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
